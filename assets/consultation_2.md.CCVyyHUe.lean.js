However, the restricted maneuverability and severe blurring of these staplers along with their limited hemostability induced strain. In this study, we determined the feasibility and safety of performing delta-shaped anastomosis using the Endo GIA? Reloads with Tri-Staple? Technology combined with Endo GIA? Ultra Universal stapler (Tri-Staple) with a particular focus on short-term surgical outcomes. METHODS We performed a single-institutional prospective interventional study (UMIN 000008014). The Tri-Staple was prospectively used on 23 consecutive patients who underwent a curative totally laparoscopic Billroth I gastrectomy with delta-shaped anastomosis. These patients were matched with the 19 patients previously treated using the ENDOPATH(?) ETS Articulating Linear Cutters (ETS) on clinical and demographic characteristics. RESULTS There were no differences between the groups in anastomosis-related local complications, morbidity, non-anastomosis-related local complications, total systemic complications, and short-term outcomes with the exception of significantly reduced blood loss in the Tri-Staple group (ETS vs. Tri-Staple: 37 [10-306] vs. 15 [5-210] mL, p = 0.02). Intraoperative bleeding from the staple line was significantly reduced in the Tri-Staple group. The postoperative drain indwelling period (ETS vs. Tri-Staple, 6 [4-10] vs. 4 [2-43] days, p = 0.032), fasting period (5 [3-7] vs. 3 [3-24] days, p = 0.022), and hospital stay (14 [10-47] vs. 11 [6-58] days, p = 0.025) were significantly shorter in the Tri-Staple group. There was no mortality in this series. Acceleration assessed as indices of blurring of stapler tip might have a significant adverse influence on staple-line bleeding at stapling sites. CONCLUSION Totally laparoscopic Billroth I distal gastrectomy using Tri-Staple was feasible and safe with favorable short-term surgical outcomes. Reduced blurring while stapling may be a novel endpoint which newly developed stapling devices should target.","output":"Totally intracorporeal delta-shaped B-I anastomosis following laparoscopic distal gastrectomy using the Tri-Staple? reloads on the manual Ultra handle: a prospective cohort study with historical controls."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ ]more than ever, it is important to pay attention to the kind of futures that are being prefigured throughout the dispersed set of emerging practices within and around organizations [ ]alternative practices and entrepreneurial actions can have intended and unintended effects on the sociopolitical landscape in which they are emerging [ ]they show that the moral underpinnings of alternative organizing are elusive and in constant construction [ ]this special issue reassesses the importance of the researchers reflexivity and ethical engagement in studying topics related to entrepreneurship, alternative practices and social change","output":"Guest editorial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 has shocked the entire world with its fairly rapid spread and has challenged different sectors.

Although the use of cell culture systems and small animal models have enhanced our understanding of astrovirus infection and pathogenesis, little is known about the immune response to astrovirus infection. Studies from humans and animals suggest that adaptive immunity is important in restricting classic and novel astrovirus infections, while studies from animal models and cell culture systems suggest that an innate immune system plays a role in limiting astrovirus replication. The relative contribution of each arm of the immune system in restricting astrovirus infection remains unknown.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a regional network for management of ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI). Methods: We report a single centers experience of patients hospitalized for ACS in a high-volume hub of a STEMI network during the lockdown (in the first pandemic trimester), compared with the same time interval of the previous year and including all consecutive patients referred for an AMI during the second trimester of 2020 (from April to June) or during the same time interval of the previous year, 2019. Results: The absolute number of hospital admissions for AMI decreased by 22.3%, while the non-AMI hospitalizations decreased by 77.14% in Q2-2020 compared to Q2-2019 (210 vs. 48, p < 0.0001). As a consequence, the percentage of AMI cases from the total number of hospital admission increased from 38% to 68% (p < 0.0001), AMI becoming the dominant pathology. In the STEMI group there was a significant reduction of 55% in the absolute number of late STEMI presentations. Functionality of the STEMI network at the hub level did not present a significant alteration with only a minor increase in the door-to-balloon time, from 34 min to 41 min. However, at the level of the network we recorded a lower number of critical cases transferred to the interventional center, with a dramatic reduction of 56.1% in the number of critical STEMI cases arriving in the acute cardiac care unit (17.0% vs. 7.3%, p-0.04 for KILLIP class III, and 21.17% vs. 11.11%, p = 0.08 for resuscitated out of hospital cardiac arrest). Conclusions: The COVID-19 outbreak did not have a major impact on the interventional centers functionality, but it limited the capacity of the regional STEMI network to bring the critical patient with complicated STEMI to the cathlab in time during the first months of the lockdown. Even a very well-functioning STEMI network like the one in Central Romania had difficulties bringing the most critical STEMI cases to the cathlab in time.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on STEMI Networks in Central Romania"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chapter 5 discusses several selected sciences and technologies to provide a deeper look at some of the transformative influences of our environment.

The objective of this project is to validate the Death and Dying Distress Scale in Spanish (DADDS-Sp) for screening anxiety about death and evaluating psychometric properties for people with advanced cancer. METHODS: DADDS is a 15-item self-administered questionnaire that assesses thoughts and feelings related to death and the process of dying. A cross-sectional, descriptive, psychometric validation study was conducted in two cancer centres in Santiago de Chile. Included were patients over 18 years of age with incurable and/or metastatic cancer, fluent in Spanish, and a life expectancy of more than 3 months. Reliability was analysed using Cronbachs alpha, and confirmatory factor analysis was performed following the model of the original scale. RESULTS: Seventy four patients participated in the study. The median age was 63 years. Of the sample, 59% identified themselves as women. On average, participants reported low anxiety about death (mean = 21, SD = 18). Women have more death anxiety. The reliability analysis yielded a value of  = 0.93 (IC = 0.91C0.95). Factor analysis with a one-factor structure yielded Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0. 0.972, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.092, Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) = 0.085 and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.968. The model with a two-factor structure yielded CFI = 0.989, RMSEA = 0.059, SRMR = 0.075 and TLI = 0.987, suggesting that the two-factor model has a better fit for the data studied. CONCLUSIONS: DADDS-Sp is psychometrically valid for use in a Spanish-speaking population, yielding high reliability and internal consistency. A majority of the Chilean patients reported a low level of anxiety about death although about 10% presented with severe anxiety, so their identification for adequate clinical management is fundamental.","output":"Validation of the Death and Dying Distress Scale (DADDS-Sp) in a population with advanced cancer in Chile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The estimate of people with clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment provides an understanding of the disease burden.

In the clinical setting with limited resources, high degree of suspicion is needed to diagnose cardiac involvement including myocarditis. Although myocarditis is not reported as a common complication due to lack of diagnostic facilities, there are evidence to support myocarditis is more prevalent in post mortem studies of patients died due to leptospirosis. We present a case series of severe leptospirosis with cardiac involvement observed during a period of one month at Colombo-North Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here five patients with severe leptospirosis complicated with cardiac involvement, admitted to a single medical ward, Colombo-North Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka during a one-month period. Out of six suspected leptospirosis patients admitted during that period, five in a raw developed severe leptospirosis with cardiac involvement. In this case series, four patients were confirmed serologically or quantitative PCR and one patient had possible leptospirosis. All patients developed shock during their course of illness. Two patients developed rapid atrial fibrillation. One patient had dynamic T wave changes in ECG and the other two had sinus tachycardia. Two patients had evidence of myocarditis in 2D echocardiogram, whereas other two patients had nonspecific findings and one patient had normal 2D echocardiogram. All five patients had elevated cardiac troponin I titre and it was normalized with the recovery. All five patients developed acute kidney injury. Four patients needed inotropic/vasopressor support to maintain mean arterial pressure and one patient recovered from shock with fluid resuscitation. All patients were recovered from their illness and repeat 2D echocardiograms after recovery did not show residual complications. One patient had serologically proven dengue co-infection with leptospirosis. CONCLUSIONS: Myocarditis and cardiac involvement in leptospirosis may be overlooked due to non-specific clinical findings and co-existing multi-organ dysfunction. Atypical presentation of this case series may be due to micro-geographic variation and unusual outbreak of leptospirosis.

This scoping review aims to integrate the relevant literature on current reintegration procedures as well as assess stakeholders' perceived challenges related to children with CMC and CDD's return to school following hospitalisation. Finally, information will be synthesised regarding parental and child involvement in reintegration strategies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The current scoping review follows the five-stage framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley (2005).

The critique is based on the assumption that Markovian models are scientific models, and while we may defend ontological theories about the nature of scientific models, we could not read off metaphysical theses about the nature of target systems (self-organising conscious systems, in the present context) from our theories of nature of scientific models (Markov blankets). The paper draws attention to different ways of understanding Markovian models, as material entities, fictional entities, and mathematical structures. I argue that none of these interpretations contributes to the defence of a metaphysical stance (either in terms of neutral monism or reductive physicalism).

The timely and standardized information published by authorities as a response to the crisis can better inform the public and enable better preparations for the pandemic during the low transmission period of COVID-19; however, there is limited evidence of whether people consent that information is disclosed timely and influencing factors. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in China from 4 to 26 February 2021. Convenient sampling strategy was adopted to recruit participators. Participants were asked to filled out the questions that assessed questionnaire on the residents attitudes to information disclosure timely. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors affecting the residents attitudes. RESULTS: A total of 2361 residents filled out the questionnaire. 1704 (72.17%) consented COVID-19 information has been disclosed timely. Furthermore, age (OR = 0.093, 95%CI = 0.043 ~ 0.201), gender (OR = 1.396, 95%CI = 1.085 ~ 1.797), place of residence (OR = 0.650, 95%CI = 0.525 ~ 0.804), employed status (OR = 2.757, 95%CI = 1.598 ~ 4.756), highest educational level (OR = 0.394, 95%CI = 0.176 ~ 0.880), region (OR = 0.561, 95%CI = 0.437 ~ 0.720) and impact on life by the COVID-19 (OR = 0.482, 95%CI = 0.270 ~ 0.861) were mainly factors associated with residents attitudes.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the ongoing pandemic has changed people's habits related to skincare products and cosmetic procedures. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter survey study covering both private and public hospitals. Sociodemographic characteristics and clinical diagnoses of the patients were noted by dermatologists. A survey was used to determine the type and application areas of skincare products and cosmetic procedures before and during the pandemic, whether the patients were concerned about being infected, and any change in the make\\\\up habits of female patients. RESULTS: Of the 1437 patients, 86.7% presented to the hospital due to dermatological complaints and 13.3% for cosmetic procedures. The rate of those that did not use skincare products was 0.05% before and 0.06% during the pandemic. Of the participants, 43.2% had undergone cosmetic procedures before and 38.1% during the pandemic. For both periods, the most frequent cosmetic procedure applied was laser epilation, followed by skincare treatment and chemical peeling. While undergoing these procedures, 34.9% of the patients were concerned about contracting coronavirus. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in the use of skincare products and cosmetic procedures before and during the pandemic. The majority of the patients continued to undergo these procedures despite their fear of being infected. This shows that during the pandemic period, patients are concerned with their appearance and continue to undergo cosmetic procedures and pay attention to their skincare.","output":"Has the COVID\\\\19 pandemic changed attitudes and behaviors concerning cosmetic care and procedures among patients presenting to the dermatology outpatient clinic?

There is no data documenting the effect of metformin taken as an outpatient on COVID-19 related hospitalizations. Our aim was to evaluate if metformin decreases hospitalization and severe COVID-19 among minority Medicare patients who acquired the SARS-CoV2 virus. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including elderly minority Medicare COVID-19 patients across eight states. We collected data from the inpatient and outpatient electronic health records, demographic data, as well as clinical and echocardiographic data. We classified those using metformin as those patients who had a pharmacy claim for metformin and non-metformin users as those who were diabetics and did not use metformin as well as non-diabetic patients. Our primary outcome was hospitalization. Our secondary outcomes were mortality and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). RESULTS: We identified 1,139 COVID-19 positive patients of whom 392 were metformin users. Metformin users had a higher comorbidity score than non-metformin users (p < 0.01). The adjusted relative hazard (RH) of those hospitalized for metformin users was 0.71; 95% CI 0.52C0.86. The RH of death for metformin users was 0.34; 95% CI 0.19C0.59. The RH of ARDS for metformin users was 0.32; 95% CI 0.22C0.45. Metformin users on 1000 mg daily had lower mortality, but similar hospitalization and ARDS rates when compared to those on 500C850 mg of metformin daily.

Bovine-milk extracellular vesicles (EVs) confer protection to dietary miRNAs, although it remains unclear whether this importantly improves their chances of reaching host target cells to exert biological effects. METHODS: Caco-2, HT-29, Hep-G2 and FHs-74 cell lines were exposed to natural/labelled milk EVs to evaluate cellular uptake. Five frequently reported human milk miRNAs (miR-146b-5p, miR-148a-3p, miR-30a-5p, miR-26a-5p, and miR-22-3p) were loaded into EVs. The intracellular concentration of each miRNA in cells was determined. In addition, an animal study giving an oral dose of loaded EVs in C57BL6/ mice were performed. Gene expression regulation was assessed by microarray analysis. RESULTS: Digestive stability analysis showed high overall degradation of exogenous miRNAs, although EV-protected miRNAs better resisted gastrointestinal digestion compared to free miRNAs (tenfold higher levels). Importantly, orally delivered EV-loaded miRNAs reached host organs, including brain, in mice. However, no biological effect has been identified. CONCLUSION: Milk EVs protect miRNAs from degradation and facilitate cellular uptake. miRNA concentration in EVs from bovine milk might be insufficient to produce gene modulation. Nevertheless, sizable amounts of exogenous miRNAs may be loaded into EVs, and orally delivered EV-loaded miRNAs can reach tissues in vivo, increasing the possibility of exerting biological effects. Further investigation is justified as this could have an impact in the field of nutrition and health (i.e., infant formulas elaboration).","output":"Dietary bovine milk miRNAs transported in extracellular vesicles are partially stable during GI digestion, are bioavailable and reach target tissues but need a minimum dose to impact on gene expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The actual prevalence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and the individual assessment of being or having been infected may differ Facing the great uncertainty - especially at the beginning of the pandemic - and the possibility of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, subclinical infections, we evaluate the experience of SARS-CoV-2 antibody screening at a tertiary clinical setting Methods and analysis All employees of a tertiary eye centre and a research institute of ophthalmology were offered antibody testing in May 2020, using a sequential combination of different validated assays/antigens and point-of-care (POC) testing for a subset (NCT04446338) Before taking blood, a systematic inquiry into past symptoms, known contacts and a subjective self-assessment was documented The correlations between serostatus, patient contacts and demographic characteristics were analysed Different tests were compared by Kappa statistics Results Among 318 participants, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 9 employees Chemiluminescence assays (chemiluminescence immunoassay and electrochemiluminescence) showed superior specificity and high reproducibility, compared with ELISA and POC results In contrast to the low seropositivity (2 8%) of healthcare workers, higher than that of the other departments of the hospital, a large proportion mistakenly assumed that they might have already been infected Antiviral antibody titres increased and remained on a plateau for at least 3 months Conclusions The great demand and acceptance confirmed the benefit of highly sensitive testing methods in the early phase of the pandemic The coincidence of low seroprevalence and anxious employees may have contributed to internalising the need of hygiene measures ? 2021 Author(s)","output":"Testing for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence: Experiences of a tertiary eye centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on reports of parasite resistance and on World Health Organization recommendation, chloroquine was replaced with the artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) as the first choice of drugs for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Disuse of chloroquine led to restoration of drug-sensitive parasite to some extent in certain countries. Ever since chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were touted as potential treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there has been a dramatic surge in demand for the drugs. Even in areas where chloroquine is proscribed, there has been an unexpected increase in demand and supply of the drug. This situation is quite worrying as the indiscriminate use of chloroquine may produce drug-resistant parasites which may impact negatively on the efficacy of amodiaquine due to cross-resistance. Amodiaquine is a partner drug in one of the ACTs and in some of the drugs used for intermittent preventive treatment. We herein discuss the consequences of the escalated use of chloroquine in the management of COVID-19 on chemotherapy or chemoprevention of malaria and offer an advice. We speculate that parasite strains resistant to chloroquine will escalate due to the increased and indiscriminate use of the drug and consequently lead to cross-resistance with amodiaquine which is present in some drug schemes aforementioned. Under the circumstance, the anticipated hope of reverting to the use of the 'resurrected chloroquine' to manage malaria in future is likely to diminish.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study on 61 COVID-19 patients (severe and non-severe; 33 men, age 63+/-15 years) who underwent a CT scan due to tachypnea, dyspnoea or desaturation. QCT was performed using VCAR software. Patients' clinical data was collected, including laboratory results and oxygenation support. The optimal cut-off point for CT parameters for predicting death and respiratory support was performed by maximizing the Youden Index in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: The analysis revealed significantly greater progression of changes: ground-glass opacities (GGO) (31,42% v 13,89%, p<0.001), consolidation (11,85% v 3,32%, p<0.001) in patients with severe disease compared to non-severe disease. Five lobes were involved in all patients with severe disease. In non-severe patients, a positive correlation was found between severity of GGO, consolidation and emphysema and sex, tachypnea, chest x-ray (CXR) score on admission and laboratory parameters: CRP, D-dimer, ALT, lymphocyte count and lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio. In the group of severe patients, a correlation was found between sex, creatinine level and death. ROC analysis on death prediction was used to establish the cut-off point for GGO at 24.3% (AUC 0.8878, 95% CI 0.7889-0.9866; sensitivity 91.7%, specificity 75.5%), 5.6% for consolidation (AUC 0.7466, 95% CI 0.6009-0.8923; sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 59.2%), and 37.8% for total (GGO+consolidation) (AUC 0.8622, 95% CI 0.7525-0.972; sensitivity 75%, specificity 83.7%). The cut-off point for predicting respiratory support was established for GGO at 18.7% (AUC 0.7611, 95% CI 0.6268-0.8954; sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 64.4%), consolidation at 3.88% (AUC 0.7438, 95% CI 0.6146-0.8729; sensitivity 100%, specificity 46.7%), and total at 23.5% (AUC 0.7931, 95% CI 0.673-0.9131; sensitivity 93.8%, specificity 57.8%). CONCLUSION: QCT is a good diagnostic tool which facilitates decision-making regarding intensification of oxygen support and transfer to an intensive care unit in patients severely ill with COVID-19 pneumonia. QCT can make an independent and simple screening tool to assess the risk of death, regardless of clinical symptoms. Usefulness of QCT to predict the risk of death is higher than to assess the indications for respiratory support.","output":"Value of quantitative analysis in lung computed tomography in patients severely ill with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation has been associated with poor patient prognosis. In this study, we assessed the effects of different drugs and cardiac injury on QTc interval prolongation in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The study cohort consisted of 395 confirmed COVID-19 cases from the Wuhan Union Hospital West Campus. All hospitalized patients were treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (CQ/HCQ), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), quinolones, interferon, Arbidol, or Qingfei Paidu decoction (QPD) and received at least 1 electrocardiogram after drug administration. Fifty one (12.9%) patients exhibited QTc prolongation (QTc  470 ms). QTc interval prolongation was associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality (both P < .001). Administration of CQ/HCQ (odds ratio [OR], 2.759; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.318C5.775; P = .007), LPV/r (OR, 2.342; 95% CI, 1.152C4.760; P = .019), and quinolones (OR, 2.268; 95% CI, 1.171C4.392; P = .015) increased the risk of QTc prolongation. In contrast, the administration of Arbidol, interferon, or QPD did not increase the risk of QTc prolongation. Notably, patients treated with QPD had a shorter QTc duration than those without QPD treatment (412.10 [384.39C433.77] vs 420.86 [388.19C459.58]; P = .042). The QTc interval was positively correlated with the levels of cardiac biomarkers (creatine kinase-MB fraction [rho = 0.14, P = .016], high-sensitivity troponin I [rho = .22, P < .001], and B-type natriuretic peptide [rho = 0.27, P < .001]). In conclusion, QTc prolongation was associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality. The risk of QTc prolongation was higher in patients receiving CQ/HCQ, LPV/r, and quinolones.

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that Twitter discourse on two epidemics (firearm injury and COVID-19) would differ between tweets with health careCinitiated hashtags (#ThisIsOurLane and #GetUsPPE) versus those with nonChealth careCinitiated hashtags (#GunViolence and #COVID19). METHODS: Using natural language processing, we compared content, affect, and authorship of a random 1% of tweets using #ThisIsOurLane (Nov 2018-Oct 2019) and #GetUsPPE (March-May 2020), compared to #GunViolence and #COVID19 tweets, respectively. We extracted the relative frequency of single words and phrases and created two sets of features: (1) an open-vocabulary feature set to create 50 data-drivenCdetermined word clusters to evaluate the content of tweets; and (2) a closed-vocabulary feature for psycholinguistic categorization among case and comparator tweets. In accordance with conventional linguistic analysis, we used a P<.001, after adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, to identify potentially meaningful correlations between language features and outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 67% (n=4828) of #ThisIsOurLane tweets and 36.6% (n=7907) of #GetUsPPE tweets were authored by health care professionals, compared to 16% (n=1152) of #GunViolence and 9.8% (n=2117) of #COVID19 tweets. Tweets using #ThisIsOurLane and #GetUsPPE were more likely to contain health careCspecific language; more language denoting positive emotions, affiliation, and group identity; and more action-oriented content compared to tweets with #GunViolence or #COVID19, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Tweets with health careCled hashtags expressed more positivity and more action-oriented language than the comparison hashtags.

Although many models have been developed all around the world, transparent models that allow interacting with the assumptions will become more important as we test various strategies for lockdown, testing and social interventions and enable effective policy decisions. In this paper we developed a suite of models to guide development of policies under different scenarios when the lockdown opens. These had been deployed to create an interactive dashboard called COVision which includes the Agent based Models (ABM) and classical compartmental models i.e Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) approaches. Our tool allows simulation of scenarios by changing strength of lockdown, basic reproduction number(R0), asymptomatic spread, testing rate, contact rate (Beta), recovery rate (Gamma), incubation period and starting number of cases. We optimized ABMs and classical compartmental models to fit the actual data, both of which performed well in terms of R-squared, root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Out of the three models in our suite, ABM was able to capture the data better than SIR and SEIR and achieved an RSQ of 92.3% for India and 89% for Maharashtra for the next 30 days. We also computed R0 using SIR and SEIR models which were found to be decreasing over the different periods of lockdown indicating the effectiveness of policies and interventions. Finally, we formulated ICU bed requirements using our best models. Our evaluation suggests that ABM models were able to capture the dynamic nature of the epidemic for a longer duration of time while classical SIR and SEIR models performed inefficiently for longer terms. The visual interactivity and ability to simulate outcomes under different parameters will allow the policymakers to make informed decisions for estimating the strength of lockdown to be implemented and testing rates. Further, our models were able to highlight the differences at state level for the parameters such as R0 and contact rates and hence can be applied for state specific decision making.

The usual lopinavir trough plasma concentrations are 3000-8000a? ng/mL. A trend towards a 28a? day mortality reduction was observed in COVID-19-infected patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. OBJECTIVES: To assess the plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients with severe COVID-19 infection and receiving lopinavir/ritonavir. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 infection included in the French COVID-19 cohort and treated with lopinavir/ritonavir were included. Lopinavir/ritonavir combination was administered using the usual adult HIV dose regimen (400/100a? mg q12h, oral solution through a nasogastric tube). A half-dose reduction to 400/100a? mg q24h was proposed if lopinavir Ctrough was >8000a? ng/mL, the upper limit considered as toxic and reported in HIV-infected patients. Lopinavir and ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters were determined after an intensive pharmacokinetic analysis. Biological markers of inflammation and liver/kidney function were monitored. RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir were first assessed in eight patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. Median (IQR) lopinavir Ctrough reached 27a?908a? ng/mL (15a?928-32a?627). After the dose reduction to 400/100a? mg q24h, lopinavir/ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed in nine patients. Lopinavir Ctrough decreased to 22a?974a? ng/mL (21a?394-32a?735). CONCLUSIONS: In mechanically ventilated patients with severe COVID-19 infections, the oral administration of lopinavir/ritonavir elicited plasma exposure of lopinavir more than 6-fold the upper usual expected range.

In this article, an international panel of oncology experts discusses the lasting impacts of the pandemic on oncology clinical trials and proposes solutions for clinical trial stakeholders, with the support of recent data on worldwide clinical trials collected by IQVIA. These lasting impacts and proposed solutions encompass three topic areas. First, acceleration and implementation of new operational approaches to oncology trials with patient-centric, fully decentralized virtual approaches, that include remote assessments via telemedicine and remote devices. Geographical differences in the uptake of remote technology, including telemedicine, are discussed in the article, focusing on the impact of the local adoption of new operational approaches. Second, innovative clinical trials. The pandemic has highlighted the need for new trial designs that accelerate research and limit risks and burden for patients while driving optimization of clinical trial objectives and endpoints, while testing is being minimized. Areas of considerations for clinical trial stakeholders are discussed in detail. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the underrepresentation of minority groups in clinical trials; the approach for oncology clinical trials to improve generalizability of efficacy and outcomes data is discussed. Third, a new problem-focused collaborative framework between oncology trial stakeholders, including decision makers, to leverage and further accelerate the innovative approaches in clinical research developed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Many countries aimed at supporting their contact tracers with the use of digital contact tracing apps in order to manage and control the spread of the virus. Their idea is the automatic registration of meetings between smartphone owners for the quicker processing of infection chains. To date, there are many contact tracing apps that have already been launched and used in 2020. There has been a lot of speculations about the privacy and security aspects of these apps and their potential violation of data protection principles. Therefore, the developers of these apps are constantly criticized because of undermining users privacy, neglecting essential privacy and security requirements, and developing apps under time pressure without considering privacy- and security-by-design. In this study, we analyze the privacy and security performance of 28 contact tracing apps available on Android platform from various perspectives, including their codes privileges, promises made in their privacy policies, and static and dynamic performances. Our methodology is based on the collection of various types of data concerning these 28 apps, namely permission requests, privacy policy texts, run-time resource accesses, and existing security vulnerabilities. Based on the analysis of these data, we quantify and assess the impact of these apps on users privacy. We aimed at providing a quick and systematic inspection of the earliest contact tracing apps that have been deployed on multiple continents. Our findings have revealed that the developers of these apps need to take more cautionary steps to ensure code quality and to address security and privacy vulnerabilities. They should more consciously follow legal requirements with respect to apps permission declarations, privacy principles, and privacy policy contents.","output":"A privacy and security analysis of early-deployed COVID-19 contact tracing Android apps"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores university discourse as a conceptual-communicative macrostructure that verbally represents international organizations' and universities' policies and activities to support youth's sustainable development to support youth's sustainable development amidst COVID19.

The textual corpus from 172 universities from Africa, Asia, Europe, North and Latin America, Oceania, as well as 164 documents with essential international institutional affiliations, were explored. The methodology combined qualitative and quantitative tools, theoretical, and empirical analysis. Data processing rested on thematic content analysis. Manual and computer-based coding techniques were applied. The analysis made it possible to identify major concepts and their constituents which form a verbally expressed conceptual macrostructure of university knowledge and action in fostering youth's sustainability during pandemics. The findings revealed some standard features within universities communication dimensions, on the one hand, and some specific to Russian universities on the other. Differences between universities and international organizations concerning communication focus were also identified.

In this study, we assessed the association between COVID-related relationship conflict and changes in intimate and sexual behaviors and experiences. Using data from an online nationally representative probability survey of 1,010 American adults in April 2020, we estimated the impact of coronavirus-related relationship conflict on changes in intimate and sexual behaviors among those in any type of romantic or sexual relationship (Nweighted=742). Further, we assessed the association between conflict and experience of orgasm and feeling emotionally close to partner. Among individuals in relationships, 34% reported some degree of conflict with their romantic partners due to the spread of COVID-19 and its related restrictions. Those experiencing frequent coronavirus-related conflict with their partner were significantly more likely to report decreased frequency of several solo and partnered intimate and sexual behaviors compared to those not experiencing any such conflict, exhibiting a dose-response trend among partnered sexual behaviors. Since the spread of coronavirus and associated social distancing measures in the United States, Americans have experienced escalations in conflict in their romantic partnerships, which was associated with changes to their intimate and sexual lives.","output":"Romantic Relationship Conflict Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Changes in Intimate and Sexual Behaviors in a Nationally Representative Sample of American Adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly across the world.

We show that a unique feature of the Covid recession is that the peak-to-trough decline is roughly the same for consumption, investment, and output. In contrast to the 2008 recession, there was only a short-lived rise in financial stress that quickly subsided. Finally, there was mild deflation between the peak and the trough of the Covid recession. We argue that a New Keynesian model that explicitly incorporates epidemic dynamics captures these qualitative features of the Covid recession.

In this paper, we sought to test our view: that damaged or absent trust, relating to the technology or its sponsors (particularly governments), was key in understanding the way community disquiet constrained efficacy of the control policy. However, initial findings have demonstrated instances where trust relationships were damaged this did not always or consistently appear to deter significant rates of downloads. Conversely, initial public engagement and approval of the technology likewise did not always or consistently result in requisite uptake rates being met, for the technology to work as planned. Through our survey of the UK and German app, how trust is created and maintained is neither simple not inevitable. Externalities beyond community engagement effected trust in various ways depending on the wider socio-political control environment prevailing. What can be said of trust and engagement is that their absence, along with other influences of public permission and approval, can have an impact on how control initiatives are received by data subjects. Therefore if trust and engagement are not magic bullets for efficacy, their absence will produce disquiet and this can impact on the sustainability of pandemic control policy.","output":"Digital Contact Tracing C An Examination of Uptake in UK and Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oxygen regulates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factors to control cell metabolism, erythrogenesis, and angiogenesis. Whereas much has been elucidated about how oxygen regulates HIF, whether lipids affect HIF activity is un-known. Here, using cultured cells and two animal models, we demonstrate that lipoprotein-derived fatty acids are an independent regulator of HIF. Decreasing extracellular lipid supply inhibited HIF prolyl hydroxylation, leading to accumulation of the HIF subunit of these heterodimeric transcription factors comparable with hypoxia with activation of downstream target genes. The addition of fatty acids to culture medium suppressed this signal, which required an intact mitochondrial respiratory chain. Mechanistically, fatty acids and oxygen are distinct signals integrated to control HIF activity. Finally, we observed lipid signaling to HIF and changes in target gene expression in developing zebrafish and adult mice, and this pathway operates in cancer cells from a range of tissues. This study identifies fatty acids as a physiological modulator of HIF, defining a mechanism for lipoprotein regulation that functions in parallel to oxygen.","output":"Serum lipoproteinCderived fatty acids regulate hypoxia-inducible factor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionWhen New York City became an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers from an array of specialties were deployed to work on general medicine units with limited time for clinical retraining.ObjectivesThis study assesses the subjective experience and perceived preparedness of a cohort of non-internal medicine clinicians who were deployed to assist with inpatient management of patients with COVID-19 in the Spring of 2020.MethodsAn online survey was distributed to clinicians (residents, fellows, attendings, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) who cared for patients in roles outside their usual specialties during the pandemic at the Montefiore Health System in the Bronx, NY.Results85/169 (50.3%) clinicians responded. 16.5% reported strong feelings of preparedness prior to deployment (7/10 Likert scale).

Existing video-based coaching systems often present feedback on the correctness of poses by augmenting videos with visual markers either manually by a coach or automatically by computing key parameters from poses. However, previewing and augmenting videos limit the analysis and visualization of human poses due to the fixed viewpoints, which confine the observation of captured human movements and cause ambiguity in the augmented feedback. Besides, existing sport-specific systems with embedded bespoke pose attributes can hardly generalize to new attributes; directly overlaying two poses might not clearly visualize the key differences that viewers would like to pursue. To address these issues, we analyze and visualize human pose data with customizable viewpoints and attributes in the context of common biomechanics of running poses, such as joint angles and step distances. Based on existing literature and a formative study, we have designed and implemented a system, VCoach, to provide feedback on running poses for amateurs. VCoach provides automatic low-level comparisons of the running poses between a novice and an expert, and visualizes the pose differences as part-based 3D animations on a human model. Meanwhile, it retains the users' controllability and customizability in high-level functionalities, such as navigating the viewpoint for previewing feedback and defining their own pose attributes through our interface.

STUDY DESIGN: An observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Nuclear Medicine, Meram Faculty of Medicine, Necmettin Erbakan University, Konya, Turkey, from August 2010 to April 2021. METHODOLOGY: In this study, 60 cases were subclassified in three age-matched groups; 15 patients diagnosed with ISBH in Group Ia, 15 cases with inguinoscrotal herniation (ISH) of bowel in Group Ib, and 30 patients without ISH in Group II. In the reconstructed PET/CT images, the prostate volume (PV), abdominal subcutaneous fat (SFV), and visceral fat (VFV) volumes were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant relationship between subgroups of Group I in the measurements of BMI, PV, SFV, and VFV, which were higher in Group Ia than Group Ib. The lower SFV/VFV value in Group Ib was considered as the most important risk factor in developing ISH of the bowel. A significant statistical difference was found between Group I and II in terms of PV, VFV, and SFV/VFV parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This study reiterated the impact of PV and the parameters representing abdominal fat distribution on ISBH development.

Despite the traumatic nature of witnessing gun violence, we have little knowledge of whether exposure to local gun violence is associated with higher risks of depression among mothers, whose symptoms of depression are likely to have spillover effects for kin. We examined the association between exposure to gun violence in mothers neighborhoods and their experiences of depression using longitudinal Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study data (n = 4587) in tandem with lagged outcome and fixed effect models. We find that mothers who witness at least one shooting in their neighborhoods or local communities exhibit more symptoms of depression and are 32C60% more likely to meet criteria for depression than mothers who do not witness a shooting. We also find that witnessing a shooting is associated with increases in parental aggravation, which is partially mediated by maternal depression. Given this and other previously documented spillover effects of mothers mental health on children and family members, these findings have important implications for mothers wellbeing and their kin. Further, we observe substantial racial and socioeconomic disparities in exposure to gun violence, suggesting that gun violence may heighten health disparities and drawing attention to the importance of providing mental health resources in communities that are most affected by gun violence.","output":"Gun Violence Exposure and Experiences of Depression Among Mothers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: Studies have demonstrated racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, with black Americans having higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and death. Similarly, CDC data has shown higher Influenza-related mortality in the black American population. While COVID-19 is a deadlier viral respiratory illness, a comparison between influenza and COVID-19 can provide insight into racial disparities and clarify if there is excess disease burden of COVID-19 on black American communities compared with another viral pneumonia. METHODS: We performed a four-year retrospective cohort study (2016-2020) of adult inpatients tested with SARS-CoV-2 or Influenza (A or B) infection in a tertiary, academic referral center in Richmond, Virginia. We compared the unadjusted and adjusted positivity rate, and mortality between black and non-black patients. We performed multiple logistic regression to adjust for age and gender and applied the models to estimate and compare the predicted adjusted mortality. RESULTS: The proportion of black patients admitted for Influenza from 2016-2020 was significantly greater than the proportion of black patients admitted with COVID-19, 66.6% vs. 57.5% (p &lt;0.01). The unadjusted mortality for Influenza + patients was 1.6% (31). The unadjusted mortality for SARSCoV- 2 + patients were 5.6% (125). Black patients had lower unadjusted OR for death for influenza (0.6 95% CI 0.6-0.64, p&lt;0.001) and OR of death for SARS-CoV-2 (0.84, 95% 0.73-0.96, p=0.01). The findings persisted after adjusting for age and gender in influenza patients (OR 0.68 95% CI 0.64-0.74, p&lt;0.001) but not in SARSCoV- 2 patients (OR 0.91 95% CI 0.8-1.05, p=0.2). CONCLUSION: In our predominantly black American cohort, we found no significant association between race and in-hospital adjusted mortality related to COVID-19. Our findings are contrary to larger cohorts and CDC data which shows increased mortality in the black American population. The higher proportion of black patients with Influenza than COVID-19 also indicates that in our population there is not an excess burden from COVID-19 compared to previous Influenza data, although for both COVID-19 and Influenza black patients are overrepresented compared to demographics of VCU's catchment area. The reason for these findings is not clear. Our cohort was composed predominantly of black Americans as is Richmond, VA. It is possible that in this setting the provision of community health or outreach regarding COVID-19 disease prevention to black communities was more effective, reducing excess COVID-19 disease burden.

To accomplish this goal, we adapted a clustering approach to reveal residential water consumption patterns within metered data. In the experiment, we used two data sets (engineered features data set as well as the times of use and weighted probabilities of use data set) based on the data collected over 10 months from 306 households in Melbourne, Australia. For the engineered features data set, first, we identified the number of optimal clusters. We then performed extensive experiments to find the best clustering approach in terms of performance evaluation and clustering quality. We chose the hierarchical agglomerative clustering technique based on the nature of the data and the objective of the study. We observed that for the engineered features data set, k-means is the best performing clustering technique after considering performance metrics. For the other data set, we found that the number of clusters varies based on the type of water-consumption event, type of day (i.e., weekday or weekend), profiling interval and probability of use. In addition, we observed that insight into tap-water usage could be used to determine the populations adaptation of hygiene practices in an unprecedented time, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. Demographics, comorbidities, and daily clinical physiologic and laboratory data were collected. Plasma levels of neurofilament-light chain, total tau, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, and glial fibrillary acidic protein were measured. The primary neurologic outcome was delirium defined by the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (scale 1C8). Associations among plasma biomarkers, respiratory failure, and inflammation were analyzed. SETTING: Multicenter study in ICUs. PATIENTS: Critically ill patients with respiratory failure, with coronavirus disease 2019, or without (ICU control). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 27 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and 19 ICU controls were enrolled. Compared with ICU controls with pneumonia of other etiology, patients with coronavirus disease 2019 had significantly higher glial fibrillary acidic protein (272 pg/mL [150C555 pg/mL] vs 118 pg/mL [78.5C168 pg/mL]; p = 0.0009). In coronavirus disease 2019 patients, glial fibrillary acidic protein (rho = 0.5115, p = 0.0064), ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (rho = 0.4056, p = 0.0358), and neurofilament-light chain (rho = 0.6223, p = 0.0005) positively correlated with Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist score and were increased in patients with delirium (Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist  4) in the coronavirus disease 2019 group but not in ICU controls.

However, a lack of immune cells in hLOs limits the recapitulation of in vivo cellular physiology. Here, we generated hLOs containing alveolar macrophage (AM)Clike cells derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSC). To bridge hLOs with advanced human lung high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT), we acquired quantitative micro-CT images. Three hLO types were observed during differentiation. Among them, alveolar hLOs highly expressed not only lung epithelial cell markers but also AM-specific markers. Furthermore, CD68(+) AM-like cells were spatially organized on the luminal epithelial surface of alveolar hLOs. Bleomycin-treated alveolar hLOs showed upregulated expression of fibrosis-related markers and extracellular matrix deposits in the alveolar sacs. Alveolar hLOs also showed structural alterations such as excessive tissue fraction under bleomycin treatment. Therefore, we suggest that micro-CT analyzable PSC-derived alveolar hLOs are a promising in vitro model to predict lung toxicity manifestations, including fibrosis.

The electrochemical parameter of microbial fuel cells and biofilm changes on the anode were observed. The results showed that the addition of phenanthrene reduced the power output of the microbial fuel cell which affected the process of microbial electricity generation. Meanwhile, microorganisms destroyed the original structure of phenanthrene through anaerobic metabolism, and achieved good average degradation of 94.9-98.4%. Observation of the anodic biofilm found that the microbes had tolerance to phenanthrene and the biofilm exhibited to be well-constructed. Bacterial community distribution showed a decrease in the relative abundance of Acidovorax and Aquamicrobium, whereas the relative content of the main electroactive organism, Geobacter, increased by a factor of three.

However, the mechanisms responsible for infection and molecular evolution of this virus remained unclear. Methods We collected and analyzed 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV including 11 novel genomes from patients in China. Through comprehensive analysis of the available genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains, we have tracked multiple inheritable SNPs and determined the evolution of 2019-nCoV relative to other coronaviruses. Results Systematic analysis of 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV revealed co-circulation of two genetic subgroups with distinct SNPs markers, which can be used to trace the 2019-nCoV spreading pathways to different regions and countries. Although 2019-nCoV, human and bat SARS-CoV share high homologous in overall genome structures, they evolved into two distinct groups with different receptor entry specificities through potential recombination in the receptor binding regions. In addition, 2019-nCoV has a unique four amino acid insertion between S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, which created a potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site. Conclusions Our studies provided comprehensive insights into the evolution and spread of the 2019-nCoV.

As with other coronaviruses, a preponderance of evidence suggests the virus originated in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) and may have infected an intermediate host prior to spillover into humans. A significant concern is that SARS-CoV-2 could become established in secondary reservoir hosts outside of Asia. To assess this potential, we challenged deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) with SARS-CoV-2 and found robust virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, lungs and intestines, with detectable viral RNA for up to 21 days in oral swabs and 6 days in lungs. Virus entry into the brain also occurred, likely via gustatory-olfactory-trigeminal pathway with eventual compromise to the blood-brain barrier. Despite this, no conspicuous signs of disease were observed, and no deer mice succumbed to infection. Expression of several innate immune response genes were elevated in the lungs, including IFN&#945;, IFN?, Cxcl10, Oas2, Tbk1 and Pycard. Elevated CD4 and CD8? expression in the lungs was concomitant with Tbx21, IFN?3 and IL-21 expression, suggesting a type I inflammatory immune response. Contact transmission occurred from infected to naive deer mice through two passages, showing sustained natural transmission and localization into the olfactory bulb, recapitulating human neuropathology. In the second deer mouse passage, an insertion of 4 amino acids occurred to fixation in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein that is predicted to form a solvent-accessible loop. Subsequent examination of the source virus from BEI Resources determined the mutation was present at very low levels, demonstrating potent purifying selection for the insert during in vivo passage. Collectively, this work has determined that deer mice are a suitable animal model for the study of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory disease and neuropathogenesis, and that they have the potential to serve as secondary reservoir hosts in North America.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection, neuropathogenesis and transmission among deer mice: Implications for spillback to New World rodents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To assess the relevance of systematic SARS-CoV-2 screening of all children admitted to hospital, we conducted a prospective multicenter study including 438 consecutive hospitalized children.

In human studies, CT prevented colds in healthy subjects and enhanced antibody production after influenza vaccination in elderly individuals with a poor nutritional status. The mechanism of action of CT is thought to be glutathione (GSH)-mediated regulation of intracellular redox, which might affect innate immune systems such as macrophages to exert physiological effects. The effect of CT on influenza is independent of viral type, and this treatment has a broad range of antiviral activities. To explore the mechanisms of CT in viral infection, we performed transcriptome profiling of spleen tissues isolated from influenza A virus (IAV)-infected mice. We identified unique gene signatures in response to CT in the IAV-infected mice. Genes upregulated by CT included redox-regulated genes such as GCLC/GCLM (subunits of glutamate cysteine ligase, a rate-limiting enzyme of GSH biosynthesis), TXN1, TXN2, TXNRD2, and SOD1, suggesting that the intracellular redox environment is substantially altered by CT. However, genes downregulated in response to CT included chemokine/chemokine receptor genes (CCL5, CCL19, CXCL9, CXCL12, CXCR3, CXCR4, and ACKR3), some of which are related to cytokine storm. A comparison with public COVID-19-related gene set data showed that the upregulated gene signature was highly similar to the downregulated gene sets of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and the upregulated gene set of attenuated SARS-CoV-infected cells. In conclusion, the unique gene signatures observed in response to orally administered CT in IAV-infected mouse spleen tissues suggested that CT may attenuate viral infection, replication and associated symptoms such as cytokine storm.","output":"Elucidation of the antiviral mechanism of cystine and theanine through transcriptome analysis of mice and comparison with COVID-19 gene set data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leishmaniose canina, causada por Leishmania infantum  uma doen?a parasitria de grande importancia veterinria.

PARTICIPANTS: 659 adults (aged 18 years) with advanced or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma who had not received systemic treatment. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive sintilimab or placebo (3 mg/kg in patients weighing <60 kg or 200 mg in patients weighing 60 kg) in combination with cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) every three weeks. The trial was amended to allow investigators to choose the chemotherapy regimen: cisplatin plus paclitaxel or cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (800 mg/m(2) continuous infusion on days 1-5). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall survival in all patients and in patients with combined positive scores of 10 for expression of programmed cell death ligand 1. RESULTS: 659 patients were randomly assigned to sintilimab (n=327) or placebo (n=332) with chemotherapy. 616 of 659 patients (93%) received sintilimab or placebo in combination with cisplatin plus paclitaxel and 43 of 659 patients (7%) received sintilimab or placebo in combination with cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil. At the interim analysis, sintilimab with chemotherapy showed better overall survival compared with placebo and chemotherapy in all patients (median 16.7 v 12.5 months, hazard ratio 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.51 to 0.78, P<0.001) and in patients with combined positive scores of 10 (17.2 v 13.6 months, 0.64, 0.48 to 0.85, P=0.002). Sintilimab and chemotherapy significantly improved progression free survival compared with placebo and chemotherapy in all patients (7.2 v 5.7 months, 0.56, 0.46 to 0.68, P<0.001) and in patients with combined positive scores of 10 (8.3 v 6.4 months, 0.58, 0.45 to 0.75, P<0.001).

Methods: In this multicenter cross-sectional study, the quality of sexual life in Italian infertile couples was assessed and their well-being was evaluated before the pandemic and during the quarantine. All couples were asked to fill out a questionnaire, in which their desire for parenthood, sexual life, and well-being were investigated. Results: Out of 1650 cases, 300 patients were finally enrolled. COVID-19 negatively impacted the well-being of individuals, leading to significantly reduced scores of happiness, feeling energetic, and interest in life (p<0.05). Although most couples had prolonged infertility, a small number of cases (4.0%) achieved a spontaneous natural pregnancy during the lockdown, probably due to more intimacy and longer time spent together. However, major concerns about the consequential effects of the virus on pregnancy and the risk of contagion in the hospital led a small number of infertile couples (5.0%) to decide to postpone their parenting project.

PPIases catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides and accelerate the folding of proteins. The CyP40 protein has been shown to possess PPIase activity and, similar to other family members, can bind to the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A (CsA). In this study, we created keratinocyte cell lines with CyP40 being stably knocked down using viral particles containing shRNA for CyP40 which knocked down the expression level of CyP40 transcripts by 90 to 99%. The proliferation rates of the cell lines with silenced CyP40 were decreased compared to the control cells. After UVA irradiation, the rate of apoptosis was found to be significantly lower in CyP40 silenced cell lines than it was in control cells. Moreover, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was found to be less dissipated and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) less active in cells with knocked down CyP40 than in control cells after UVA irradiation. Also, less mitochondrial superoxide was detected in the cells with silenced CyP40 compared to control cells after UVA exposure. Moreover, silencing of CyP40 partially modulates expression of key genes involved in mitochondrial pore formation including CyPD, ANTs and VDAC family members. The ability of CyP40 to regulate UV induced apoptosis implicates this protein as a potential target for therapy in cancer cells.","output":"Cyclophilin 40 alters UVA-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial ROS generation in keratinocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Histone modification and nucleosome assembly are mainly regulated by various histone-modifying enzymes and chaperones. The roles of histone-modification enzymes have been well analyzed, but the molecular mechanism of histone chaperones in histone modification and nucleosome assembly is incompletely understood. We previously found that the histone chaperone Nrp1 is localized in the micronucleus (MIC) and the macronucleus (MAC) and involved in the chromatin stability and nuclear division of Tetrahymena thermophila. In the present work, we found that truncated C-terminal mutant HA-Nrp1TrC abnormally localizes in the cytoplasm. The truncated-signal-peptide mutants HA-Nrp1TrNLS1 and HA-Nrp1TrNLS2 are localized in the MIC and MAC. Overexpression of Nrp1TrNLS1 inhibited cellular proliferation and disrupted micronuclear mitosis during the vegetative growth stage. During sexual development, Nrp1TrNLS1 overexpression led to abnormal bouquet structures and meiosis arrest. Furthermore, Histone H3 was not transported into the nucleus; instead, it formed an abnormal speckled cytoplastic distribution in the Nrp1TrNLS1 mutants. The acetylation level of H3K56 in the mutants also decreased, leading to significant changes in the transcription of the genome of the Nrp1TrNLS1 mutants. The histone chaperone Nrp1 regulates the H3 nuclear import and acetylation modification of H3K56 and affects chromatin stability and genome transcription in Tetrahymena.","output":"Histone Chaperone Nrp1 Mutation Affects the Acetylation of H3K56 in Tetrahymena thermophila"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Meeting the United Nations (UNs) 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has become a worldwide mission.

The purpose was to investigate the incidence of lung involvement and analyzed factors related to lung involvement on CT images for establishment of the indication for CT scans in the triaging of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Included were 192 COVID-19 patients who had undergone CT scans and blood tests for triaging. Two radiologists reviewed the CT images and recorded the incidence of lung involvement. The prediction model for lung involvement on CT images using clinico-laboratory variables [age, gender, body mass index, oxygen saturation of the peripheral artery (SpO(2)), comorbidities, symptoms, and blood data] were developed by multivariate logistic regression with cross-validation. RESULTS: In 120 of the 192 patients (62.5%), CT revealed lung involvement. The patient age (odds ratio [OR]; 4.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.93C26.49), albumin (OR; 4.66, 95%CI; 1.37C15.84), lactate dehydrogenase (OR; 5.79, 95%CI; 1.43C23.38) and C-reactive protein (OR; 8.93, 95%CI; 4.13C19.29) were selected for the final prediction model for lung involvement on CT images. The cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was 0.83. CONCLUSIONS: The high incidence of lung involvement (62.5%) was confirmed on CT images. The proposed prediction model that includes the patient age, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein may be useful for predicting lung involvement on CT images and may assist in deciding whether triaged COVID-19 patients should undergo CT.","output":"Triaging of COVID-19 patients using low dose chest CT: Incidence and factor analysis of lung involvement on CT images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The disease caused by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is currently a global public health issue Advanced age, male gender, history of tobacco addiction and presence of comorbidities, among them cancer, were reported in the literature as factors associated to the worse prognosis of the disease Objectives: To review the literature about the new coronavirus infection in individuals with malignant neoplasms and to update the epidemiological aspects of the disease in oncologic patients Method: Literature review on articles published in scientific journals that addressed the epidemiologic aspects of the infection by coronavirus in oncologic patients using the terms of the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and of the Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCs) in the MEDLINE/PubMed database Results: Patients with cancer have worse clinical results when compared to the general population Conclusion: Elderly oncologic patients with lung cancer or patients who have submitted to recent cancer surgery or chemotherapy when diagnosed with COVID-19 were more susceptible to the development of severe infection Introdu??o: A doen?a causada pelo novo coronavrus (Covid-19)  atualmente um problema mundial de sade pblica A idade avan?ada, sexo masculino, histrico de tabagismo e presen?a de comorbidades, entre as quais, o cancer, foram relatados na literatura como fatores associados ao pior prognstico da doen?a Objetivos: Revisar a literatura acerca da infec??o pelo novo coronavrus em indivduos portadores de neoplasias malignas e atualizar os aspectos epidemiolgicos da doen?a em pacientes oncolgicos Mtodo: Revis?o de trabalhos publicados em peridicos cientficos que abordavam os aspectos epidemiolgicos da infec??o por coronavrus em pacientes oncolgicos por meio de termos do Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) e dos Descritores em Cincias da Sade (DeCs) na base de dados MEDLINE/PubMed Resultados: Pacientes com cancer apresentam piores resultados clnicos quando comparados  popula??o geral Conclus?o: Pacientes oncolgicos idosos, portadores de cancer de pulm?o, ou que se submeteram  cirurgia oncolgica ou  quimioterapia recentes ao diagnstico de Covid-19 apresentaram maior suscetibilidade ao desenvolvimento da infec??o grave Introduccin: La enfermedad causada por coronavirus (Covid-19) es actualmente un problema de salud pblica Las personas con enfermedades crnicas como el cncer, el sexo masculino, los pacientes con antecedentes de tabaquismo y los ancianos tienen un mayor riesgo de adquirir formas graves, desarrollar complicaciones y morir por la enfermedad Objetivos: Revisar la literatura sobre la infeccin con el nuevo coronavirus en individuos con neoplasias malignas y sintetizar los aspectos epidemiolgicos de la enfermedad en pacientes con cncer Mtodo: Revisin de la literatura como artculos publicados en revistas cientficas utilizando los trminos mdicos (MeSH) y Descriptores en Ciencia de la Salud (DeCs) en la base de datos MEDLINE/PubMed Resultados: Los pacientes con cncer tienen peores resultados clnicos en comparacin con la poblacin general Conclusiones: Pacientes oncolgicos ancianos, portadores de cncer de pulmn, o que se sometieron a ciruga de cncer o a quimioterapia reciente al diagnstico de Covid-19 fueron ms susceptibles al desarrollo de infeccin severa","output":"COVID-19 and Cancer: Updating Epidemiological Issues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chronic diarrhea is a common disease causing morbidity and mortality of captive rhesus macaques (RMs, Macaca mulatta). Chronic diarrhea in RMs is typically characterized by long-term diarrhea and a weak response to antibiotic treatment. Diarrhea is also a common disease in humans and can cause death. However, the etiology of about half of diarrheal cases of humans is still unclear. Therefore, we performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing to characterize the differences in the gut microbiome and resistome of chronic diarrhea RMs and asymptomatic individuals. RESULTS: Our results showed Lactobacillus spp. (mainly L. johnsonii, L. reuteri and L. amylovorus) were significantly depleted in chronic diarrhea RM guts compared to asymptomatic individuals (5.2 vs 42.4%). Functional annotation of genes suggested these Lactobacillus spp. carried genes involved in the adhesion of intestinal epithelial cells and production of bacteriocin. Chronic diarrhea RM guts also had a significantly greater abundance of many other gut bacteria, including mucin-degrading bacteria and opportunistic pathogens. The metabolic pathways of chronic diarrhea RM gut microbiome were enriched in aerobactin biosynthesis, while the metabolic pathways of asymptomatic RM gut microbiome were enriched in the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Chronic diarrhea RM guts had a significantly greater abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), such as ermF, aph(3)-IIIa, ermB, and floR. The strains isolated from feces and tissue fluid of chronic diarrhea RMs had higher resistance rates to the majority of tested antibiotics, but not cephamycin and carbapenem antibiotics. Gut microbial composition comparisons showed that several captive nonhuman primate (NHP) guts were more similar to the guts of humans with a non-westernized diet than humans with a westernized diet. Chronic diarrhea RM gut microbiome was strikingly similar to rural-living humans with diarrhea and humans with a non-westernized diet than asymptomatic RMs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested chronic diarrhea significantly altered the composition and metabolic pathways of the RM gut microbiome. The frequent use of antibiotics caused antibiotic resistance in chronic diarrhea RM gut microbiome with serious consequences for individual treatment and survival. The findings of this study will help us to improve the effective prevention and treatment of diarrhea in RMs. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40168-021-01218-3.","output":"The gut microbiome and antibiotic resistome of chronic diarrhea rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and its similarity to the human gut microbiome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nursing leaders have a responsibility to promote and facilitate social engagement and connectedness to mitigate social isolation in long term care (LTC).

METHODS Forty-three HIV-infected patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head and a comparison group of 50 HIV-infected patients with negative MRI of the hips and for whom serial plasma samples were available were included. D-dimer and CRP levels were measured prior to and at the time of diagnosis for osteonecrosis patients, at the time of negative MRI of the hips for controls, and at least 6 months later for both groups. RESULTS Biomarker levels were elevated at the time of diagnosis in the osteonecrosis cohort compared with controls. Median D-dimer value was 0.32 g/ml in the osteonecrosis group compared with less than 0.22 g/ml in the control group (P = 0.016). For CRP, the corresponding values were 2.52 mg/l and 1.23 mg/l (P = 0.003). Postdiagnosis, D-dimer and CRP levels were also elevated in the osteonecrosis patients compared with controls. Linear regression demonstrated a rise in D-dimer levels from prediagnosis to diagnosis in the osteonecrosis patients whereas CRP levels did not change significantly over time. CONCLUSION Compared to controls, patients who developed osteonecrosis had elevated levels of D-dimer and CRP at diagnosis. D-dimer levels increased whereas CRP levels did not change significantly from prediagnosis to diagnosis.

We present a case of ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm in conjunction with bilateral superficial femoral occlusion, as incidental findings in Covid-19 positive patient. The patient, a 62-years-old female, presented with cough, shortness of breath, fever and leg claudication. Doppler ultrasonography of the lower limbs was conducted to rule out thromboembolism, revealing bilateral superficial femoral arteries occlusion. The patient was administered high doses of parenteral anticoagulants. Hemoptysis ensued, prompting an MSCT scan, that showed right pleural effusion, atelectasis, and right active perihilar infiltrates with inter-lobar pleurisy.

This review aimed to explore the clinical evidences of using IL-6 antagonists in COVID-19 infection based on most recent available data. Relevant studies were searched through PubMed, scopus, and ISI databases focusing on interleukin-6 antagonists in cytokine release syndrome and prospective data on COVID-19 infection. Only papers in English were included in the search. There were several studies conducted to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of IL-6 antagonists and mostly with tocilizumab. After the search, we found that studies recruited patients with severe COVID-19 and elevated inflammatory mediators such as C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, or ferritin to receive tocilizumab, situximab or sarilumab in combination with other medications. Result showed that these agents may provide a clinical advantage as patients were able to refrain from invasive ventilation support after initiating IL-6 antagonists. In summary, IL-6 pathway inhibition in severe COVID-19 may be an emerging candidate to subside pulmonary complication. These agents may carry benefits in COVID-19 infection as well as safety risks such as bone marrow suppression.

Methods & Materials: Faecal samples were collected from Lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros) in the UK during annual population monitoring surveys, stored in RNAlater and frozen prior to genomic analysis. For metagenomic analysis, the Sequence-independent Single-Primer Amplification (SISPA) method was employed and sequencing completed using Illumina Nextera and the Oxford Nanopore GridION platforms. Results: A De novo hybrid assembly utilising shorter Illumina reads with longer Nanopore reads acting as a scaffold, generated a 29kb contig named RhGB01. Mapping raw reads against RhGB01 demonstrated a combined depth of 50x across the genome. Sequence alignment exhibits genomic organisation comparable to other sarbecoviruses isolated from animal and human hosts. Within the receptor binding domain, but excluding the receptor binding motif, RhGB01 has 77% and 81% amino acid homology compared to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS respectively. Maximum likelihood phylogenies inferred from the nucleotide sequence of RNA dependent RNA polymerase, spike glycoprotein and entire coding sequence exhibit clustering with the only other fully sequenced zoonotic Sarbecovirus from Europe which was isolated from Rhinolophus blasii. The structure of the receptor binding domain of RhGB01 was predicted by homology modelling using a crystal structure of the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV as a template. This model was selected with a Global Model Quality Estimate (GMQE) > 0.7 and Quaternary Structure Quality Estimate (QMEAN) of -2.18. Structural comparisons between the predicted receptor binding domain of RhGB01 and SARS-CoV-2 highlight structurally different regions which house hACE2 contact residues. Conclusion: Phylogenetic inference and structural modelling suggest an absence of pathogenic potential for RhGB01. However, the discovery of a novel Sarbecovirus at the western limit of Lesser horseshoe bats demonstrates their presence throughout the entire horseshoe bat distribution and indicates the need for viral surveillance systems in Western Europe.","output":"Metagenomic Discovery of a Novel Sarbecovirus in the United Kingdom at the Western Extreme of the Range of Rhinolophidae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Health systems are complex organizations.

The rapid development of promising therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 is keenly anticipated. Family Coronaviridae comprises positive, single-stranded RNA viruses that use RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) for viral replication and transcription. As the RdRP of viruses in this family and others plays a pivotal role in infection, it is a promising therapeutic target for developing antiviral agents against them. A critical genetic driver for many cancers is the catalytic subunit of telomerase: human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), identified initially as an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. However, even though hTERT is a DNA polymerase, it has phylogenetic and structural similarities to viral RdRPs. Researchers worldwide, including the authors of this review, are engaged in developing therapeutic strategies targeting hTERT. We have published a series of papers reporting that hTERT has RdRP activity and that this RdRP activity in hTERT is essential for tumor formation. Here, we review the enzymatic function of RdRP in virus proliferation and tumor development, reminding us of how the study of the novel coronavirus has brought us to the unexpected intersection of cancer research and RNA virus research.","output":"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRP, a promising therapeutic target for cancer and potentially COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, the WHO declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a global pandemic. Obesity was soon identified as a risk factor for poor prognosis, with an increased risk of intensive care admissions and mechanical ventilation, but also of adverse cardiovascular events. Obesity is associated with adipose tissue, chronic low-grade inflammation, and immune dysregulation with hypertrophy and hyperplasia of adipocytes and overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, to implement appropriate therapeutic strategies, exact mechanisms must be clarified. The role of white visceral adipose tissue, increased in individuals with obesity, seems important, as a viral reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. After infection of host cells, the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines creates a setting conducive to the cytokine storm and macrophage activation syndrome associated with progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome. In obesity, systemic viral spread, entry, and prolonged viral shedding in already inflamed adipose tissue may spur immune responses and subsequent amplification of a cytokine cascade, causing worse outcomes. More precisely, visceral adipose tissue, more than subcutaneous fat, could predict intensive care admission; and lower density of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) could be associated with worse outcome. EAT, an ectopic adipose tissue that surrounds the myocardium, could fuel COVID-19-induced cardiac injury and myocarditis, and extensive pneumopathy, by strong expression of inflammatory mediators that could diffuse paracrinally through the vascular wall. The purpose of this review is to ascertain what mechanisms may be involved in unfavorable prognosis among COVID-19 patients with obesity, especially cardiovascular events, emphasizing the harmful role of excess ectopic adipose tissue, particularly EAT.","output":"COVID-19 and Obesity: Role of Ectopic Visceral and Epicardial Adipose Tissues in Myocardial Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic has led to a global public health emergency with the need to identify vulnerable populations who may benefit from increased screening and healthcare resources.

METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study involving a case series of loxoscelism. Only cases of dermonecrosis with photodocumentation of lesion evolution (from admission until complete or almost complete healing) were included. RESULTS Eight patients (six men, two women; median age, 38 years) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The bite sites included the thigh (n = 4), forearm (n = 2), abdomen (n = 1), and trunk (n = 1). Time interval between the bite and first contact with our service ranged from 15 to 216 h (median = 29 h). The main clinical manifestations included local erythematous and ischemic violaceous lesions overlying a base of indurated edema (livedoid plaque, 8), local pain (8), exanthema (6), serohemorrhagic vesicles/blisters (5), fever (5), and jaundice (1). Based on a previously established classification, the cases were classified as probable cutaneous-necrotic loxoscelism (CNL, n = 4), presumptive CNL (n = 3), and presumptive cutaneous-hemolytic loxoscelism (n = 1). Seven patients were treated with anti-arachnidic antivenom (AV; median time post-bite = 46 h). Complete lesion healing ranged from 34 to 98 days post-bite (median, 68 days; six patients).

The city imposed different levels of social distancing including, the closure of sports venues and restrictions on eateries. This inevitably affects the eating behaviour and physical activities of the population. We examined the changes in eating behavior and physical activities before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and identified sociodemographic factors associated with the behavioral changes. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study via a random telephone survey of Chinese adults conducted in Hong Kong from May to June, 2020 - a period in which social distancing measures were being imposed. We measured the physical activity habits from four aspects and dietary consumption patterns from seven aspects before and during the pandemic based on the World Health Organization's guidelines and previous publications. RESULTS: In total, 724 participants were recruited. Individuals were found to cook more frequently at home (p < 0.001) and order take-out (p < 0.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. While no significant change in the frequency of fast food consumption was observed, we found significant increases in the frequency of eating fruits (p < 0.001) and vegetables (p = 0.004). The frequencies of walking, moderate-intensive sports, and high-intensity sports were significantly reduced (p < 0.001). We found that healthy lifestyle behaviors during the pandemic were negatively associated with participants' economic status. CONCLUSIONS: Social distancing measures likely provided an opportunity for individuals to stay home and thus eat healthier. However, in a prolonged period of social restrictions, a lower physical activity level poses a risk to public health. Public health officials are thus advised to monitor physical health on a population-wide basis.

Generally, Asians are more inclined to wear face masks during disease outbreaks. Hong Kong has emerged relatively unscathed during the initial outbreak of COVID-19, despite its dense population. Previous infectious disease outbreaks influenced the local masking behaviour and response to public health measures. Thus, local behavioural insights are important for the successful implementation of infection control measures. This study explored the behaviour and attitudes of wearing face masks in the community during the initial spread of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. METHODS: We observed the masking behaviour of 10 211 pedestrians in several regions across Hong Kong from 1 to 29 February 2020. We supplemented the data with an online survey of 3199 respondents' views on face mask use. RESULTS: Among pedestrians, the masking rate was 94.8%; 83.7% wore disposable surgical masks. However, 13.0% wore surgical masks incorrectly with 42.5% worn too low, exposing the nostrils or mouth; 35.5% worn 'inside-out' or 'upside-down'. Most online respondents believed in the efficacy of wearing face mask for protection (94.6%) and prevention of community spread (96.6%). Surprisingly, 78.9% reused their mask; more respondents obtained information from social media (65.9%) than from government websites (23.2%). CONCLUSIONS: In Hong Kong, members of the population are motivated to wear masks and believe in the effectiveness of face masks against disease spread. However, a high mask reuse rate and errors in masking techniques were observed.

When COVID-19 closed schools and businesses and restricted social gatherings, parks became one of the few places that urban residents were permitted to visit outside their homes. With a focus on Philadelphia, PA and New York City, NY, this paper presents a snapshot of the park usage during the early phases of the pandemic. Forty-three Civic Scientists were employed by the research team to observe usage in 22 different parks selected to represent low and high social vulnerability, and low, medium, and high population density. Despite speculation that parks could contribute to the spread of COVID-19, no strong correlation was found between the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in adjacent zip codes and the number of park users. High social vulnerability neighborhoods were associated with a significantly higher number of COVID-19 cases (p&lt;0.01). In addition, no significant difference in the number of park users was detected between parks in high and low vulnerability neighborhoods. The number of park users did significantly increase with population density in both cities (p&lt;0.01), though usage varied greatly by park. Males were more frequently observed than females in parks in both high vulnerability and high-density neighborhoods. Although high vulnerability neighborhoods reported higher COVID-19 cases, residents of Philadelphia and New York City appear to have been undeterred from visiting parks during this phase of the pandemic.

Nineteen of the mutants were soluble and were analyzed for enzymatic activity. Six mutants, including four at the putative active site, were significantly reduced in endoribonuclease activity. Two of the inactive mutants had unusual secondary structures compared to the wild-type protein, as measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Gel-filtration analysis, velocity sedimentation ultracentrifugation, and native gradient pore electrophoresis all showed that the wild-type protein exists in an equilibrium between hexamers and monomers in solution, with hexamers dominating at micromolar protein concentration, while native gradient pore electrophoresis also revealed the presence of trimers. A mutant in the N terminus of Nsp15 was impaired in hexamer formation and had low endoribonuclease activity, suggesting that oligomerization is required for endoribonuclease activity. This idea was supported by titration experiments showing that enzyme activity was strongly concentration-dependent, indicating that oligomeric Nsp15 is the active form.

The European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis (EPOS) provides widely accepted diagnostic criteria, which include sinonasal symptoms, their duration, and imaging results. Our objective was to compare these approaches to assessing symptoms to determine if either was more indicative of radiologic findings, to support decisions in telehealth. STUDY DESIGN: Observational outcomes study. SETTING: Tertiary care center. METHODS: In total, 162 consecutive patients provided a structured sinonasal history, completed the SNOT-22, and underwent sinus computed tomography (CT) within 1 month. SNOT-22 scores, EPOS-defined symptom sets, and Lund-Mackay results were assessed. To facilitate direct comparisons, we performed stepwise evaluations of sinonasal symptoms alone and combined with duration. The discriminatory capacity for imaging results was determined through areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC-AUC) for dichotomous outcomes and ordinal regression for multilevel outcomes. RESULTS: In ROC-AUC analyses, SNOT-22 and EPOS-defined symptoms had similar discriminatory capacity for Lund-Mackay scores, regardless of duration. Within ordinal regression analyses, SNOT-22 nasal scores were significantly associated with Lund-Mackay scores, while EPOS-defined nasal symptoms were not statistically significantly related. CONCLUSIONS: SNOT-22 nasal scores and EPOS-defined nasal symptoms may have similar associations with imaging results when assessed via ROC-AUC, while SNOT-22 may have more association within ordinal data.

This process is crucial for sperm transport, as demonstrated in knockout mouse studies where simultaneous genetic deletion of P2X1-purinoceptors and &#945;1A-adrenoceptors resulted in male infertility. We hypothesize that dual pharmacological antagonism of these two receptors could inhibit sperm transport sufficiently to provide a novel nonhormonal method of male contraception. To generate a suitable P2X1-purinoceptor antagonist, substituents were introduced on the phenyl moiety of 2-phenyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoxaline to create a series of analogues that were tested for P2X1-purinoceptor antagonism in isolated preparations of rat vas deferens. Novel compounds were initially screened for their ability to attenuate contractile responses to electrical field stimulation (EFS: 60 V, 0.5 ms, 0.2 Hz). The addition of polar substituents to the meta, but not ortho, position markedly increased the inhibition of contractions, as did the addition of both polar and aliphatic substituents to the para position. Di-substituted compounds were also synthesized and tested, resulting in a compound 31 (2-hydroxy, 4-fluoro), which exhibited the greatest potency, with an IC50 of 14 M (95% confidence limits: 12-16 M).

This is particularly true for an intensive care unit (ICU), where highly specialized staff cannot be readily replaced. In the light of lacking evidence for optimal staffing models in a pandemic, we hypothesized that staff shortage can be reduced when staff scheduling takes the epidemiology of a disease into account. METHODS: Various staffing models were constructed, and comprehensive statistical modeling was performed. A typical routine staffing model was defined that assumed full-time employment (40 h/wk) in a 40-bed ICU with a 2:1 patient-to-staff ratio. A pandemic model assumed that staff worked 12-hour shifts for 7 days every other week. Potential in-hospital staff infections were simulated for a total period of 120 days, with a probability of 10%, 25%, and 40% being infected per week when at work. Simulations included the probability of infection at work for a given week, of fatality after infection, and the quarantine time, if infected. RESULTS: Pandemic-adjusted staffing significantly reduced workforce shortage, and the effect progressively increased as the probability of infection increased. Maximum effects were observed at week 4 for each infection probability with a 17%, 32%, and 38% staffing reduction for an infection probability of 0.10, 0.25, and 0.40, respectively.

The aim of this study was to explore the lived experiences of allied health professionals working in hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the ethical issues and moral distress these professionals might have encountered. Methods and findingsLived experiences were collected in semi-structured interviews with 39 allied health professionals including dieticians, occupational therapists, physical therapists, and speech-language therapists, working in four different hospitals in the Netherlands. Interviews were held in June and July 2020, after waning of the first wave of COVID-19 spreading. Interpretative phenomenological analysis revealed four themes: a disease with great impact, personal health and safety, staying human in chaotic times and solidarity and changing roles. Participant experiences show that the virus and COVID-19 measures had a significant impact on the in-hospital working environment due to the massive downscaling of regular care, infection prevention measures and unknown risks to allied health professionals personal health. At the same time, participants experienced a certain freedom, which made room for authentic motives, connection and solidarity.

Eligible patients were recruited from July 24, 2018, to February 5, 2020. Participants were adult men who were diagnosed with localized very low risk to favorable intermediate risk prostate cancer and undergoing active surveillance. They were randomized to either the high-intensity interval training (HIIT) group or usual care group. All statistical analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. Interventions The HIIT group was asked to complete 12 weeks of thrice-weekly, supervised aerobic sessions on a treadmill at 85% to 95% of peak oxygen consumption (V?o2). The usual care group maintained their normal exercise levels. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was peak V?o2, which was assessed as the highest value of oxygen uptake during a graded exercise test using a modified Bruce protocol. Secondary and exploratory outcomes were indicators of biochemical progression of prostate cancer, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and PSA kinetics, and growth of prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Results A total of 52 male patients, with a mean (SD) age of 63.4 (7.1) years, were randomized to either the HIIT (n = 26) or usual care (n = 26) groups. Overall, 46 of 52 participants (88%) completed the postintervention peak V?o2 assessment, and 49 of 52 participants (94%) provided blood samples. Adherence to HIIT was 96%. The primary outcome of peak V?o2 increased by 0.9 mL/kg/min in the HIIT group and decreased by 0.5 mL/kg/min in the usual care group (adjusted between-group mean difference (1.6 mL/kg/min; 95% CI, 0.3-2.9; P = .01). Compared with the usual care group, the HIIT group experienced decreased PSA level (-1.1 g/L; 95% CI, -2.1 to 0.0; P = .04), PSA velocity (-1.3 g /L/y; 95% CI, -2.5 to -0.1; P = .04), and LNCaP cell growth (-0.13 optical density unit; 95% CI, -0.25 to -0.02; P = .02). No statistically significant differences were found in PSA doubling time or testosterone. Conclusions and Relevance The ERASE trial demonstrated that HIIT increased cardiorespiratory fitness levels and decreased PSA levels, PSA velocity, and prostate cancer cell growth in men with localized prostate cancer who were under active surveillance. Larger trials are warranted to determine whether such improvement translates to better longer-term clinical outcomes in this setting.

However, viruses have also been associated with petechial rash. Nonetheless, a systematic analysis of viral infections with modern available techniques as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in the context of petechial rash is lacking. The purpose of this pediatric study was to prospectively uncover viral pathogens that may promote the emergence of petechiae and to analyze the correlation with the clinical characteristics and course. METHODS We conducted a prospective study in children (0 to 18 years) presenting with petechiae and signs or symptoms of infection at the emergency department between November 2009 and March 2012. In nasopharyngeal aspirates the following viruses were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction: cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19, influenza A and B, parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus A and B, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, human coronavirus OC43, 229E, NL63 and human bocavirus. RESULTS A viral pathogen was identified in 67% of the analyzed 58 cases with petechial rash. Virus positive patients showed a significantly higher incidence of lower respiratory tract infections. Forty-one percent were viral coinfections, which were significantly younger than virus negative patients, had a higher leukocyte count and were hospitalized for a longer time.

In this review, the authors discuss the results in subgroups of patients with prior transient ischemic attacks or ischemic stroke. In aggregate, the NOACs are superior to warfarin for secondary prevention and result in a 50% reduction in intracerebral hemorrhage. Apixaban was superior to aspirin in the AVERROES trial and had a similar rate of major bleeding complications. Expert opinion: NOACs add to the therapeutic options for secondary stroke prevention in patients with AF and offer advantages over warfarin including a favorable bleeding profile and convenience of use.

With only low quality medical evidence, but massive media support and a very significant public demand for the use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19, we are now faced with an ethical dilemma. Therefore, this paper uses a structured analysis that focuses on the preferred reporting items for a systematic review of ethical issues regarding the use of Convalescent Plasma Therapy for COVID-19. The use of convalescent plasma must meet the ethical principles of autonomy; such as voluntary, informed consent, and confidentiality. Consideration of the risk-benefit ratio for potential donor recipients also needs to be considered in order to meet the beneficence and non-maleficence principles.

OBJECTIVE To compare the long-term outcomes of conservative management vs intervention for unruptured bAVM. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION Population-based inception cohort study of 204 residents of Scotland aged 16 years or older who were first diagnosed as having an unruptured bAVM during 1999-2003 or 2006-2010 and followed up prospectively for 12 years. EXPOSURES Conservative management (no intervention) vs intervention (any endovascular embolization, neurosurgical excision, or stereotactic radiosurgery alone or in combination). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cox regression analyses, with multivariable adjustment for prognostic factors and baseline imbalances if hazards were proportional, to compare rates of the primary outcome (death or sustained morbidity of any cause by Oxford Handicap Scale [OHS] score 2 for 2 successive years [0 = no symptoms and 6 = death]) and the secondary outcome (nonfatal symptomatic stroke or death due to bAVM, associated arterial aneurysm, or intervention). RESULTS Of 204 patients, 103 underwent intervention. Those who underwent intervention were younger, more likely to have presented with seizure, and less likely to have large bAVMs than patients managed conservatively. During a median follow-up of 6.9 years (94% completeness), the rate of progression to the primary outcome was lower with conservative management during the first 4 years of follow-up (36 vs 39 events; 9.5 vs 9.8 per 100 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35-0.99), but rates were similar thereafter. The rate of the secondary outcome was lower with conservative management during 12 years of follow-up (14 vs 38 events; 1.6 vs 3.3 per 100 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19-0.72).

Here, we explore the dynamics of liquid plug transport using an anatomically-relevant, true-scale in vitro 3D model of the upper airways of a premature infant. We quantify the initial plug's distribution as a function of two underlying parameters that can be clinically controlled; namely, the injection flow rate and the viscosity of the administered fluid. By extracting a homogeneity index (HI), our in vitro results underline how the combination of both high fluid viscosity and injection flow rates may be advantageous in improving homogeneous dispersion. Such outcomes are anticipated to help refine future SRT administration guidelines towards more uniform distribution using more anatomically-realistic 3D in vitro models at true scale of the preterm neonate.","output":"Towards homogenization of liquid plug distribution in reconstructed 3D upper airways of the preterm infant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo O artigo tem por objetivo analisar as condutas alimentares de professores segundo os vnculos de trabalho.

Design: Prospective nationwide cohort study of characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2-positive children. Data collection utilized routine Pediatric Intensive Care Audit Network and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2-specific data. Setting: All U.K. PICUs. Patients: Children less than 18 years old, admitted to U.K. PICUs between March 14, 2020, and June 13, 2020, and a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction. Children admitted to U.K. PICUs in 2019 with influenza provided comparison. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: We identified 76 PICU admissions among 73 children with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction test. Prevalence of PICU admissions per million was 5.2 for children versus 260 for adults. Ten children (14%) were identified on routine screening. Seventeen children (23%) had pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. Seventeen (23%) had coinfections. Invasive ventilation was required in seven of 17 children (41%) with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 versus 38 of 56 other severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 positive children (68%), with 77% requiring vasoactive support versus 43%, respectively. Seven children (10%) died. In comparison with influenza children, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 children were older (median [interquartile range]: 10 [1-13] vs 3 yr [1-8 yr]), more often Black or Asian (52% v 18%), higher weight z score (0.29 [-0.80 to 1.62] vs -0.41 [-1.37 to 0.63]), and higher deprivation index (3.3 [-1 to 6.3] vs 1.2 [-1.8 to 4.4]).

METHODS: PubMed and Scopus were systematically searched, while references and preprint servers were explored, for relevant articles up to December 26, 2020, to identify studies which reported on mortality and/or morbidity of patients with COVID-19 undergoing early versus late intubation. \\"Early\\" was defined as intubation within 24 h from intensive care unit (ICU) admission, while \\"late\\" as intubation at any time after 24 h of ICU admission. All-cause mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) were the primary outcomes of the meta-analysis. Pooled risk ratio (RR), pooled mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effects model. The meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020222147). RESULTS: A total of 12 studies, involving 8944 critically ill patients with COVID-19, were included. There was no statistically detectable difference on all-cause mortality between patients undergoing early versus late intubation (3981 deaths; 45.4% versus 39.1%; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99-1.15, p = 0.08). This was also the case for duration of MV (1892 patients; MD - 0.58 days, 95% CI - 3.06 to 1.89 days, p = 0.65).

However, the reproducibility of measurements has not been compared with conventional cart-based ultrasound machines. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the intra- and inter-operator reproducibility of a HUD compared with a conventional ultrasound machine for aortic screening. DESIGN: Analytical, cross-sectional. SETTING: Ultrasound department at a large tertiary care hospital in Riyadh. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible male participants aged 60 years were invited to participate upon arriving for a non-vascular ultrasound appointment. Three repeated anteroposterior measurements of the transverse aorta were made at the proximal and distal locations for each machine before repeating the measurements on a subset of participants by a second blinded operator. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and the Bland-Altman method were used to analyze reproducibility. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Inter-system and intra- and inter-operator ICCs. SAMPLE SIZE: 114 males with repeated measurements by second operator on a subset of 35 participants. RESULTS: The median age (interquartile range) of participants was 68 years (62C74 years).

Of 619 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia or primary progressive aphasia, we included 70 subjects with a negative amyloid status in whom predominant right temporal lobar atrophy was identified based on blinded visual assessment of their initial brain MRI scans. Clinical symptoms were assessed retrospectively and compared with age- and sex-matched patients with svPPA (n = 70), bvFTD (n = 70) and Alzheimer's disease (n = 70). Prosopagnosia, episodic memory impairment and behavioural changes such as disinhibition, apathy, compulsiveness and loss of empathy were the most common initial symptoms, whereas during the disease course, patients developed language problems such as word-finding difficulties and anomia. Distinctive symptoms of rtvFTD compared to the other groups included depression, somatic complaints, and motor/mental slowness. Aside from right temporal atrophy, the imaging pattern showed volume loss of the right ventral frontal area and the left temporal lobe, which represented a close mirror image of svPPA. Atrophy of the bilateral temporal poles and the fusiform gyrus were associated with prosopagnosia in rtvFTD. Our results highlight that rtvFTD has a unique clinical presentation. Since current diagnostic criteria do not cover specific symptoms of the rtvFTD, we propose a diagnostic tree to be used to define diagnostic criteria and call for an international validation.","output":"A clinical-radiological framework of the right temporal variant of frontotemporal dementia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ribavirin is a guanosine analog with broad-spectrum antiviral activity against RNA viruses. Based on this, we aimed to show the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of this drug molecule via in vitro, in silico, and molecular techniques. Ribavirin showed antiviral activity in Vero E6 cells following SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas the drug itself did not show any toxic effect over the concentration range tested. In silico analysis suggested that ribavirin has a broad-spectrum impact on SARS-CoV-2, acting at different viral proteins. According to the detailed molecular techniques, ribavirin was shown to decrease the expression of TMPRSS2 at both mRNA and protein levels 48 h after treatment. The suppressive effect of ribavirin in ACE2 protein expression was shown to be dependent on cell types. Finally, proteolytic activity assays showed that ribavirin also showed an inhibitory effect on the TMPRSS2 enzyme. Based on these results, we hypothesized that ribavirin may inhibit the expression of TMPRSS2 by modulating the formation of inhibitory G-quadruplex structures at the TMPRSS2 promoter. As a conclusion, ribavirin is a potential antiviral drug for the treatment against SARS-CoV-2, and it interferes with the effects of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression.","output":"Ribavirin shows antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and downregulates the activity of TMPRSS2 and the expression of ACE2 in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fathers significantly influence family functioning, as coparents and partners, and must be part of family-based approaches to behavioral health interventions or programs.

In recent times a huge percentage of COVID-19 infected patients suffered from respiratory system failure. In order to ensure the abundant availability of mechanical ventilators during COVID-19 pandemic, most of the manufacturers around the globe utilized open source designs. Patients safety is of utmost importance while using mechanical ventilators for assisting them in breathing. Closed loop feedback control system plays vital role in ensuring the stability and reliability of dynamical systems such as mechanical ventilators. Ideal characteristics of mechanical ventilators include safety of patients, reliability, quick and smooth air pressure buildup and release.Unfortunately most of the open source designs and mechanical ventilator units with classical control loops cannot achieve the above mentioned ideal characteristics under system uncertainties. This article proposes a cascaded approach to formulate robust control system for regulating the states of ventilator unit using blower model reduction techniques. Model reduction allows to cascade the blower dynamics in the main controller design for airway pressure. The proposed controller is derived based on both integer and non integer calculus and the stability of the closed loop is ensured using Lyapunov theorems. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is demonstrated using extensive numerical simulations.","output":"Cascaded robust control of mechanical ventilator using fractional order sliding mode control."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"HIV and tuberculosis are among the global deadliest diseases.

The main source for vitamin D is the bodys skin which absorbs the suns ultraviolet rays and convert them into vitamin D; at the same time, deficiency can occur or people may not get enough supplementation; this occurs mainly in old age, not taking healthy food, or have darker skin, and this deficient cases can raise the risk of severe COVID-19 if infected. Vitamin D boosts immunity and decreases inflammation. Poorer outcome of corona virusdisease (COVID-19) has been suggested to be due to vitamin D deficiency. We suggested to find the effect of cholecalciferol levels 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25 OHD) on the severity and mortality in patients suffering from COVID-19.

Medical services can be apportioned as procedural care (eg, surgery, radiology, or laboratory testing and others) or cognitive care, also known as Evaluation and Management (E/M) services, in which the provider formulates an assessment and plan after obtaining information from the patient's history, examination, and diagnostic tests.Providing a medical opinion and plan using the telephone as the technology that links the provider and the patient is an example of a non-face-to-face E/M service. Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and the details for how to provide telephone services have been available for decades but have not been reimbursed and therefore were rarely used. In recent years, as new technologies have evolved, there has been slow and steady acceptance that non-face-to-face E/M care can be an adjunct to or replacement for some face-to-face E/M services. These technologies and the descriptors for associated CPT and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes were introduced over the past few years and have become known by the generic term telehealth. They have been slowly incorporated into medical practice. Most of these services were introduced in the consumer retail market, in which the cost was borne directly by the patient, or as private contract services, in which the cost was borne by the consulting hospital, such as with telestroke services. In both the consumer retail model and private contract model, the care delivered usually did not involve CPT or HCPCS coding. The adoption of telehealth has been slow, in part because of the initial costs and several regulatory constraints, as well as the reluctance of patients, providers, and the insurance industry to change the concept that medical care could only be delivered when the patient and their provider were in physical proximity.After the COVID-19 pandemic reached the United States, the US Department of Health & Human Services issued a public health emergency and declared a Section 1135 Waiver that lifted many of the administrative constraints. With the need for near-absolute social distancing, this perfect storm has resulted in the immediate adoption of telemedicine, at least for the duration of the pandemic, for cognitive care to be delivered using communication technologies that are already in place.

Innovative manufacturing industries and technology-oriented services experienced an increase in the numbers of start-ups. High subsidies and a temporary suspension of important criteria obliging firms to declare insolvency weakened market selection resulting in fewer exits in 2020.

DATA SOURCES A MEDLINE search was performed using the following terms: severe acute respiratory syndrome and SARS virus. Additional information and references were obtained from the Web sites for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, and Health Canada. STUDY SELECTION Recent case series were used to develop a review of the epidemiology, clinical features, outcomes, and management of patients with SARS from an intensive care unit (ICU) perspective. This was supplemented by epidemiology information obtained from other Web-based sources. Recent published studies describing the etiology of SARS were also included. DATA SYNTHESIS SARS has rapidly spread from Southeast Asia to numerous countries, including Canada and the United States. A new coronavirus has been isolated and detected from many affected patients. The mortality rate worldwide is approximately 10.5%. From five cohorts, the ICU admission rate ranged from 20% to 38%. Fifty-nine percent to 100% of the ICU patients required mechanical ventilatory support. The mortality rate of SARS patients admitted to the ICU ranged from 5% to 67%. The most common clinical symptoms and signs are fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgias, malaise, and inspiratory crackles. Common laboratory abnormalities included mild leukopenia, lymphopenia, and increased aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, lactic dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. The chest radiograph pattern ranged from focal infiltrates to diffuse airspace disease. Management consisted of isolation, strict respiratory and contact precautions, ventilatory support as needed, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, ribavirin, and corticosteroids. Predictors of mortality included advanced age, the presence of comorbidities, and a high lactic dehydrogenase or high neutrophil count at admission. CONCLUSIONS SARS is a highly contagious, infectious process that can advance to significant hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring ICU monitoring and support. Early recognition is critical for effective management and containment of this disease.","output":"Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS): a critical care perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Molecular diagnosis and surveillance of pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 depend on nucleic acid isolation. Pandemics at the scale of COVID-19 can cause a global shortage of proprietary commercial reagents and BSL-2 laboratories to safely perform testing. Therefore, alternative solutions are urgently needed to address these challenges. An open-source method, magnetic-nanoparticle-aided viral RNA isolation from contagious samples (MAVRICS), built upon readily available reagents, and easily assembled in any basically equipped laboratory, is thus developed. The performance of MAVRICS is evaluated using validated pathogen detection assays and real-world and contrived samples. Unlike conventional methods, MAVRICS works directly in samples inactivated in phenol-chloroform (e.g., TRIzol), thus allowing infectious samples to be handled safely without biocontainment facilities. MAVRICS allows wastewater biomass immobilized on membranes to be directly inactivated and lysed in TRIzol followed by RNA extraction by magnetic nanoparticles, thereby greatly reducing biohazard risk and simplifying processing procedures. Using 39 COVID-19 patient samples and two wastewater samples, it is shown that MAVRICS rivals commercial kits in detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus. Therefore, MAVRICS is safe, fast, and scalable. It is field-deployable with minimal equipment requirements and could become an enabling technology for widespread testing and wastewater monitoring of diverse pathogens.","output":"A Robust, Safe, and Scalable Magnetic Nanoparticle Workflow for RNA Extraction of Pathogens from Clinical and Wastewater Samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Patients with 2019-nCoV infection have a high risk to develop venous thrombotic events. Several guidelines recommend the use of either unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparins in preventing thrombotic events in these patients. However, results from clinical studies, so far published, reached controversial conclusions on heparin efficacy in this kind of patients since the incidence of venous thromboembolism remains high despite prophylaxis. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of heparins and their efficacy and safety in SARS-CoV-2 medical ward-patients. Moreover, anatomical findings and ongoing trials are also reported. Finally, this narrative review tries to explain why heparins fail to prevent venous thrombosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched for the most relevant published studies on heparins and 2019-nCoV infected patients using the MEDLINE electronic database in the period between January and December 2020. Articles were preliminarily defined as eligible if they: a) were in English language, b) enrolled 250 or more medical ward-patients and 100 or more ICU-patients, c) reported results on patients treated with heparins in a percentage of at least 70% and d) performed an objectively confirmed diagnosis of VTE. RESULTS: Data from medium to large scientific studies show that the incidence of venous thrombotic events in medical ward-patients with SARS-CoV-2 vary between 0% and 8.3%, while this rate is higher, from 6.2% to 49%, in Intensive Care Unit-patients. However, heparins reduce the mortality rate in these patients of about 50%. Histological findings show that thrombosis could affect capillaries, main and small-mid-sized vessels, and it is associated with diffuse alveolar damage. CONCLUSIONS: Heparins have anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties, which may be of help in reducing mortality in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Failure of heparins at prophylactic dosages in preventing VTE, especially in ICU-patients, could be due to the severity of the disease.

The 205 images were randomly partitioned into training, validation and test datasets containing 143, 32, and 30 images, respectively, using a 70%/15%/15% split. The performance of several deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architectures, including VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet121, and InceptionV3, were evaluated on the disease detection task. These networks were first pretrained on the ImageNet dataset consisting of natural images and then further fine-tuned on the task of detecting COVID-19 in chest X-ray images. The networks were then evaluated on the test set by assessing overall accuracy, area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity and specificity. The performance of the networks trained from scratch without pretraining on ImageNet was also compared to the performance of the networks that were first pretrained on ImageNet and then fine-tuned on the detection task.

Hence, identification of SES zones in thirty-eight sub-basins (SB) for basin prioritization is necessary. The present research addressed the issue by using four multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) models: VlseKriterijumska optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), simple additive weighing (SAW), compound factor (CF). To determine the best fitted method from MCDM for erosion susceptibility (ES), a comparison has been made with Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), where fifteen morphometric parameters were considered for MCDM, and meteorological data, soil, slope and land use land cover (LULC) were considered for SWAT model. Two validation indices of percentage change and intensity change were used for evaluation and comparison of MCDM results. With SWAT model performance, SWAT calibration and uncertainty analysis programs (CUP) was used for sensitive analysis of SWAT parameters on flow discharge and sediment load simulation. The results showed that 23, 16, 18 SB have high ES; therefore they were given 1 to 3 ranks, whereas 31, 37, 21SB have low ES, hence given 38 to 36 rank as predicted by MCDM methods and SWAT. MCDM validation results depict that VIKOR and CF methods are more acceptable than TOPSIS and SAW. Calibration (flow discharge R2 0.86, NSE 0.75; sediment load R2 0.87, NSE 0.69) and validation (flow discharge R2 0.79, NSE 0.55; sediment load R2 0.79, NSE 0.76) of SWAT model indicated that simulated results are well fitted with observed data.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of new patients with eating disorders who visited an outpatient eating disorders clinic of a single university hospital in Tokyo, Japan, from April 2020 to March 2021 (FY2020) and April 2019 to March 2020 (FY2019). We determined whether the onset or course in each patient in FY2020 was associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and classified COVID-19-associated medical histories into the following categories: (1) fatness phobia, (2) acceleration of dieting, (3) family relationships, (4) social factors, and (5) mood change. We performed the KolmogorovCSmirnov test to compare the cumulative distribution of disease onset by month in FY2020 and FY2019. RESULTS: We reviewed the records of 112 and 77 patients with eating disorders in FY2020 and FY2019, respectively. The onset or course of 35 patients (31.3%) in FY2020 was associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study investigated parental preferences for a mandatory vaccination scheme. Methods Discrete choice experiment. Six attributes were investigated: vaccine, child age group, incentive, penalty, ability to opt out, and compensation scheme. Mixed effects conditional logit regression models were used to investigate parental preferences and relative importance of attributes. Findings Participants were 1,001 parents of children aged 5 years and under in England (53% female;mean age=336 years, SD=71;84% white). Parental preferences were mostly based on incentives (307% relative importance;809% [95% confidence interval 763C850%] preference for parent and 748% [710C783%] for child incentive;reference: no incentive) and penalties (254% relative importance;695% [657C731%] preference for schemes where unvaccinated children cannot attend school or day care and 676% [636C714%] for those withholding financial benefits for parents of unvaccinated children;reference: 450 fine). Parents also preferred schemes that: offered a compensation scheme (181% relative importance;664% [627C698%] preference;reference: not offered), mandated vaccination in children aged 2 years (versus 5 years;114% relative importance;426% [394C459%] preference;reference: 2 years), mandated the 6-in-1 vaccine (105% relative importance;582% [546C617%] preference;reference: MMR), and that offered only medical exemptions (versus medical and religious belief exemptions;40% relative importance;455% [411C500%] preference;reference: medical exemptions).

Design: A secondary analysis derived from multicenter, observational study Setting: Critical Care Units Patients: Adult critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease admitted to 63 ICUs in Spain. Interventions: corticosteroids vs no corticosteroids Main variables of interest: Three phenotypes were derived by non-supervised clustering analysis from whole population and classified as (A: severe, B: critical and C: life-threatening). We performed a Multivariate analysis after propensity optimal full matching (PS) for whole population and weighted Cox regression (HR) and Fine-Gray analysis(sHR) to assess the impact of corticosteroids on ICU mortality according to the whole population and distinctive patient clinical phenotypes. Results: A total of 2,017 patients were analyzed, 1171(58%) with corticosteroids. After PS, corticosteroids were shown not to be associated with ICU mortality (OR:1.0,95%CI:0.98-1.15). Corticosteroids were administered in 298/537(55.5%) patients of A phenotype and their use was not associated with ICU mortality (HR=0.85[0.55-1.33]). A total of 338/623(54.2%) patients in B phenotype received corticosteroids. No effect of corticosteroids on ICU mortality was observed when HR was performed (0.72[0.49-1.05]).

Our analysis showed a steeper teen childbirth reduction in persistent poverty counties compared to their non-persistent poverty counterparts. After we published our results, the coronavirus pandemic hit U.S. and the rest of the world, causing a massive recession. In the U.S., after an initial dose of fiscal stimulus, no further stimulus has been forthcoming, primarily because of disagreement as to focusing the stimulus to the most needy. Based on our observations vis--vis the effect of the stimulus that the 10-20-30 provision provided, we recommend that any further Covid-related stimulus can be directed at least to persistently poor counties. The 10-20-30 provision allocated at least 10% of Federal funds provided in three rural development program accounts to persistent poverty counties (i.e. counties that had poverty rates of 20% or more for the past 30 years) as measured by the 1980, 1990, and 2000 censuses. We used Difference-in-Difference () of teen childbirth rates of the treatment and the control groups to mitigate non-treatment effects on teen childbirth. Our analysis showed a steeper teen childbirth reduction in persistent poverty counties compared to their non-persistent poverty counterparts. Therefore, antipoverty measures such as 10-20-30 provision, which intended to reduce poverty in persistent poverty counties, also helped in reducing teen childbirth rates. This suggests that directing funding to these areas can have a strong positive impact on the economy. Finally, we hypothesize that an antipoverty measure like 10-20-30 provision may not only benefit the community in general but may correlate to a reduced culture of despair in persistent poverty counties. As mentioned above, our conclusion recommends targeting coronavirus fiscal stimulus to persistently poor counties in order to obtain best economic outcome.","output":"Does Targeting Persistent Poverty Counties with Fiscal Stimulus Provide Efficient Economic Recovery: Effect of the 10-20-30 Provision of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in Reducing Teen Child Birth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A single-component droplet placed on a completely wetting substrate shows a pseudostable apparent contact angle (??app) during evaporation.

Severe COVID-19 is characterized by pro-inflammatory cytokine release syndrome (cytokine storm) which causes high morbidity and mortality. Recent observational and clinical studies suggest famotidine, a histamine 2 receptor (H2R) antagonist widely used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease , attenuates the clinical course of COVID-19. Because evidence is lacking for a direct antiviral activity of famotidine, a proposed mechanism of action is blocking the effects of histamine released by mast cells. Here we hypothesized that famotidine activates the inflammatory reflex, a brain-integrated vagus nerve mechanism which inhibits inflammation via alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( 7nAChR ) signal transduction, to prevent cytokine storm. Methods. The potential anti-inflammatory effects of famotidine and other H2R antagonists was assessed in mice exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine storm. As the inflammatory reflex is integrated and can be stimulated in the brain, and H2R antagonists penetrate the blood brain barrier poorly, famotidine was administered by intracerebroventricular (ICV) or intraperitoneal (IP) routes. Results. Famotidine administered IP significantly reduced serum and splenic LPS-stimulated tumor necrosis factor  and interleukin-6 concentrations, significantly improving survival. The effects of ICV famotidine were significantly more potent as compared to the peripheral route. Mice lacking mast cells by genetic deletion also responded to famotidine, indicating the anti-inflammatory effects are not mast cell dependent. Either bilateral sub-diaphragmatic vagotomy or genetic knock-out of 7nAChR abolished the anti-inflammatory effects of famotidine, indicating the inflammatory reflex as famotidines mechanism of action. While the structurally similar H2R antagonist tiotidine displayed equivalent anti-inflammatory activity, the H2R antagonists cimetidine or ranitidine were ineffective even at very high dosages. Conclusions. These observations reveal a previously unidentified vagus nerve-dependent anti-inflammatory effect of famotidine in the setting of cytokine storm which is not replicated by high dosages of other H2R antagonists in clinical use. Because famotidine is more potent when administered intrathecally, these findings are also consistent with a primarily central nervous system mechanism of action.","output":"Famotidine activates the vagus nerve inflammatory reflex to attenuate cytokine storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To evaluate major bleeding in cirrhosis with use of traditional anticoagulation or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), using a standardized definition. Anticoagulation in patients with cirrhosis is often a clinical conundrum for providers as the necessary balance between thrombotic and bleeding risk is complicated by end organ damage. Recent meta-analyses have sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with liver disease. These recent analyses are limited by various bleeding definitions, broad inclusion criteria, and few indications for anticoagulation. We sought to conduct a meta-analysis using a validated definition for major bleeding and compare rates between traditional anticoagulation and DOACs in patients with cirrhosis.

Additionally, only articles including patients with cirrhosis and receiving treatment with anticoagulation for an indication for stroke prevention or venous thromboembolism were eligible. Eligible articles needed a DOAC comparator group against traditional anticoagulant medication. Seven studies met inclusion criteria and compiled data for 683 patients in the meta-analysis. Pooled trial analysis demonstrated no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome of ISTH major bleeding (OR 0.55, 95%CI 0.28-1.07, I2 0%).

In addition, we confirmed increased Th2-biased adaptive immune responses, accompanying overt complement activation, in the severe group. Moreover, enhanced antibody responses and complement activation was associated with disease pathogenesis as evidenced by formation of immune complexes and membrane attack complexes in airways and vasculature of lung biopsies from a fatal case, as well as by enhanced hallmark gene set signatures of FcgR signaling and complement activation in myeloid cells of respiratory specimens from severe COVID-19 patients.

The goal of the HCS is to produce generalizable information for policy makers and community stakeholders seeking to implement CTH or a similar community intervention. To support this objective, one aim of the HCS is a health economics study (HES), the results of which will inform decisions around fiscal feasibility and sustainability relevant to other community settings. METHODS: The HES is integrated into the HCS design: an unblinded, multisite, parallel arm, cluster randomized, wait listCcontrolled trial of the CTH intervention implemented in 67 communities in four U.S. states: Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio. The objectives of the HES are to estimate the economic costs to communities of implementing and sustaining CTH; estimate broader societal costs associated with CTH; estimate the cost-effectiveness of CTH for overdose deaths avoided; and use simulation modeling to evaluate the short- and long-term health and economic impact of CTH, including future overdose deaths avoided and quality-adjusted life years saved, and to develop a simulation policy tool for communities that seek to implement CTH or a similar community intervention.

Atezolizumab monotherapy is an established treatment for recurrent NSCLC, and were reported to have a lower risk of pneumonitis than PD-1 inhibitors. This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab monotherapy for pretreated advanced or recurrent NSCLC patients with idiopathic IP. Methods Advanced/recurrent NSCLC patients with comorbid idiopathic, chronic fibrotic IP with %forced vital capacity (FVC) of > 70% and no history of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were enrolled. The patients received atezolizumab (1200 mg) every three weeks until the discontinuation criteria are met. The primary end point of this study is the one-year survival rate. A sample size of 38 patients was set. Results This study was terminated early due to high incidence of pneumonitis. Seventeen patients were enrolled, with a median age of 70 years. The median %FVC and %diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide at baseline were 85.4% and 54.4%, respectively. The incidence of pneumonitis was 29.4% (5/17) for all grade, 23.5% (4/17) for grade  3, and 5.9% (1/17) for grade 5. 57.1% (4/7) of patients with honeycomb lung developed grade 3 pneumonitis, whereas only one patient (10%) of grade 1 pneumonitis was found in patients without honeycomb lung (n=10).

Studies in solid tumors show high rates of patient satisfaction with virtual care as well as cost-savings. However, little is known about the application of virtual care in malignant hematology, which includes a heterogenous population of patients often at increased risk of infection. Understanding when virtual care or a hybrid model can be used is crucial for comprehensive patient care. Methods: A retrospective review of patients with hematologic malignancies receiving care at Princess Margaret (PM) Cancer Centre in Toronto, Canada from October 2019 to March 2021 was performed. The primary objective was to describe the use of virtual care at three time points: prior to the pandemic, during the initial months of the pandemic, and beyond the initial months. Patients were included in the analysis if they had a clinical visit for their hematologic malignancy. Patients were excluded if they were presenting for treatment-related visits or blood count checks. All methods of virtual care, including phone visits and teleconferencing, were included in the analysis. Patient satisfaction with virtual care was assessed using responses to the Your Voice Matters survey administered from September 2020 to April 2021, a provincial survey of patient-reported experience. Results: A total of 93472 visits for 23162 patients were identified at PM from October 2019 to March 2021 (55% of visits for ambulatory clinic appointments). Mean age was 60 years (range 18-103 years) and 45% of patients were female (N = 23162). Ambulatory clinic appointments for new consultation or follow-up care were done in the following clinics: autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplant (21%, N = 10 747), cellular therapy (0.2%, N = 82), leukemia (26%, N = 13419), lymphoma (32%, N = 16427) and myeloma (21%, N = 10711). From October 2019 to March 2020, there were 14512 visits, of which nearly 100% were in-person (N = 14511). From March 1 2020 to September 1 2020, there were 19179 total visits, of which 36% were virtual, with the majority of visits by phone (6325 phone visits and 567 video visits). From September 1 2020 to March 1 2021, there was a small decrease in the use of virtual care (p<0.01), but utilization of phone and video visits continued to be used for 30% of patients (N=17695 total visits; 4964 phone visits and 327 video visits). Virtual care was most often used for patients with myeloma (46%) or lymphoma (36%), as shown in Figure 1. A total of 75 survey responses for patients with hematologic malignancies followed at PM were available. 67 responses (89.3%) were from patients, with the remaining from caregivers. 47 visits (62.7%) were in-person, 26 visits (34.7%) were virtual, and 2 visits (2.7%) did not have the visit type available. Survey results are shown in Table 1. Results for in-person and virtual visits were very similar, with both groups reporting that their provider listened to their concerns and involved them in making treatment decisions. There was a trend toward providers discussing physical symptoms more for patients who had virtual visits (mean score of 4.73/5 for virtual visit compared to a mean score of 4.36/5, p=0.10). Data on next visit type preference was available for 25 patients who had a virtual visit and 46 patients who had an in-person visit. For patients who had a virtual visit, 36% preferred a repeat virtual visit with 56% having no preference and only 7.7% preferring an in-person visit. For patients who had an in-person visit, 33% preferred their next visit to be virtual, with only 24% preferring their next visit to be in-person and the remaining 43% having no preference. Conclusion: The use of virtual care increased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic and persisted into 2021 with high rates of patient and provider satisfaction. The highest uptake of virtual care was for patients with myeloma or lymphoma. There were no significant differences in patient satisfaction scores for virtual visits compared to in-person visits, and one third of patients preferred a virtual visit after an in-person visit. These findings suggest that virtual care is a feasible and preferred tool for delivering care to a substantial proportion of patients with hematologic malignancies. Further work is needed to determine how to optimally integrate virtual care for specific patient populations.

Most viruses have yet to be isolated and cultured [11-13], and surprisingly few efforts have explored what analysis of available data might reveal about their nature. Here, we compiled and analyzed seven decades of one-step growth and other data for viruses from six major families, including their infections of archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic hosts [14-191]. We found that the use of host cell biomass for virus production was highest for archaea at 10%, followed by bacteria at 1% and eukarya at 0.01%, highlighting the degree to which viruses of archaea and bacteria exploit their host cells. For individual host cells, the yield of virus progeny spanned a relatively narrow range (10-1000 infectious particles per cell) compared with the million-fold difference in size between the smallest and largest cells. Furthermore, healthy and infected host cells were remarkably similar in the time they needed to multiply themselves or their virus progeny. Specifically, the doubling time of healthy cells and the delay time for virus release from infected cells were not only correlated (r = 0.71, p < 10-10, n = 101); they also spanned the same range from tens of minutes to about a week.

Recent key barriers include social distancing and government-imposed social restrictions due to the additional health risks to vulnerable children and their families.

This trial was designed to study the effects of this treatment on pharyngeal stability evaluated by critical closing pressure in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. METHODS This single-centre, randomized, crossover, double-blind study compared active manipulation and sham manipulation of the SPG. Randomization was computer-generated. Patients each received one active manipulation and one sham manipulation at an interval of 21 days and were evaluated 30 min and 48 h after each session administered by a qualified osteopath. Neither the patients, nor the investigator performing the evaluations were informed about the order of the two techniques (double-blind). The primary endpoint was the percentage of responding patients presenting increased pharyngeal stability defined by a variation of critical closing pressure (Pcrit) of at least -4 cmH2O at 30 min. Secondary endpoints were the variation of Pcrit in absolute values, sleepiness and snoring. Others endpoints were lacrimation (Schirmer's test), induced pain, sensations experienced during OMT. RESULTS Ten patients were included and nine (57 [50; 58] years, comprising 7 men, with an apnoea-hypopnoea index of 31.0 [25.5; 33.2]/h; (values are median [quartiles])) were analysed. Seven patients were analysed for the primary endpoint and nine patients were analysed for secondary endpoints. Five patients responded after active manipulation versus no patients after sham manipulation (p = 0.0209). Active manipulation induced more intense pain (p = 0.0089), increased lacrimation (ns) and more tactile, nociceptive and gustatory sensations (13 versus 1) compared to sham manipulation. No significant difference was observed for the other endpoints. CONCLUSIONS Osteopathic manipulative treatment of the SPG may improve pharyngeal stability in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.

Diversion of infection prevention resources toward COVID-19 mitigation limited routine infection prevention activities such as rounding, observations, and education in all areas, including the peri-operative space. There were also changes in surgical care delivery. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SSI rates has not been well described, especially in community hospitals. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study analyzing prospectively collected data on SSIs from 45 community hospitals in the southeastern United States from 1/2018 to 12/2020. We included the 14 most commonly performed operative procedure categories, as defined by the National Healthcare Safety Network. Coronary bypass grafting was included a priori due to its clinical significance. Only facilities enrolled in the network for the full three-year period were included. We defined the pre-pandemic time period from 1/1/18 to 2/29/20 and the pandemic period from 3/1/20 to 12/31/20. We compared monthly and quarterly median procedure totals and SSI prevalence rates (PR) between the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Pre-pandemic median monthly procedure volume was 384 (IQR 192-999) and the pre-pandemic SSI PR per 100 cases was 0.98 (IQR 0.90-1.04). There was a transient decline in surgical cases beginning in March 2020, reaching a nadir of 185 cases in April, followed by a return to pre-pandemic volume by June (figure 1). Overall and procedure-specific SSI PRs were not significantly different in the COVID-19 period relative to the pre-pandemic period (total PR per 100 cases 0.96 and 0.97, respectively, figure 2). However, when stratified by quarter and year, there was a trend toward increased SSI PR in the second quarter of 2020 with a PRR of 1.15 (95% CI 0.96-1.39, table 1).

Although there was no overall change in the SSI PR during the study period, there was a trend toward increased SSIs in the early phase of the pandemic (figure 3). This trend could be related to deferred elective cases or to a shift in infection prevention efforts to outbreak management.

The present work highlights the need to estimate the individual patient risk of infection, which depends on both epidemiological considerations and individual clinical characteristics. The management of patients with breast cancer should be adapted and personalized according to the balance between COVID-19-related risk and the expected benefit of treatments. This work also provides useful suggestions on the modality of patient triage, the conduct of clinical trials, the management of an oncologic team, and the approach to patients' and health workers' psychological distress.","output":"Personalized Risk-Benefit Ratio Adaptation of Breast Cancer Care at the Epicenter of COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: As the Novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) was declared by the world health organization a pandemic in March 2020, thousands of healthcare workers (HCWs) worldwide were on the frontlines fighting against the pandemic. Herein, we selected two Middle East countries; Egypt and Saudi Arabia to investigate the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on their HCWs. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a Google survey was used to access HCWs in many hospitals in Egypt and Saudi Arabia between the 14th and 24th of April 2020. The survey assessed HCWs regarding their sociodemographic and occupational features, sleeping hours, and psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). RESULTS: This study included 426 HCWs (48.4% physicians, 24.2% nurses, and 27.4% other HCWs). Of them, 69% had depression, 58.9% had anxiety, 55.9% had stress, and 37.3% had inadequate sleeping (<6 h/day). Female sex, age 30 years, working in Egypt, attending emergency and night shifts, watching/reading COVID-19 news 2 h/day, and not getting emotional support from family, society, and hospital were associated with a high likelihood of depression, anxiety, stress, and inadequate sleeping. LIMITATIONS: the cross-sectional design restricted our ability to distinguish between preexisting and emerging psychological symptoms. CONCLUSION: HCWs on the frontlines in Egypt and Saudi Arabia experienced depression, anxiety, stress, and inadequate sleeping during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Depressed, anxious, and stressed: What have healthcare workers on the frontlines in Egypt and Saudi Arabia experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 16, 2020, the US Government introduced strict social distancing protocols for the United States in an effort to stem the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. This had an immediate major effect on the job market, with millions of Americans forced to find alternative ways to make a living from home. As online labor markets like Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) play a major role in social science research, concerns have been raised that the pandemic may be reducing the diversity of subjects participating in experiments. Here, we investigate this possibility empirically. Specifically, we look at 15,539 responses gathered in 23 studies run on MTurk between February and July 2020, examining the distribution of gender, age, ethnicity, political preference, and analytic cognitive style. We find notable changes on some of the measures following the imposition of nationwide social distancing: participants are more likely to be less reflective (as measured by the Cognitive Reflection Test), and somewhat less likely to be white, Democrats (traditionally over-represented on MTurk), and experienced with MTurk. Most of these differences are explained by an influx of new participants into the MTurk subject pool who are more diverse and representative - but also less attentive - than previous MTurkers.","output":"Turking in the time of COVID"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The roots and rhizomes of Glycyrrhiza species (licorice) have been widely used as natural sweeteners and herbal medicines. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of glycyrrhizic acid (GA) from licorice on macrophage polarization. Both phenotypic and functional activities of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated by GA were assessed. Our results showed that GA obviously increased the cell surface expression of CD80, CD86, and MHCII molecules. Meanwhile, GA upregulated the expression of CCR7 and the production of TNF-, IL-12, IL-6, and NO (the markers of classically activated (M1) macrophages), whereas it downregulated the expression of MR, Ym1, and Arg1 (the markers of alternatively activated (M2) macrophage). The functional tests showed that GA dramatically enhanced the uptake of FITC-dextran and E. coli K88 by BMDMs and decreased the intracellular survival of E. coli K88 and S. typhimurium. Moreover, we demonstrated that JNK and NF-B activation are required for GA-induced NO and M1-related cytokines production, while ERK1/2 pathway exhibits a regulatory effect via induction of IL-10. Together, these findings indicated that GA promoted polarization of M1 macrophages and enhanced its phagocytosis and bactericidal capacity. The results expanded our knowledge about the role of GA in macrophage polarization.","output":"Glycyrrhizic Acid Promotes M1 Macrophage Polarization in Murine Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages Associated with the Activation of JNK and NF-B"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine acceptance is influenced by the trusted recommenders. This survey examined the public references, concerns, and trust in seven groups of recommenders regarding COVID-19 vaccine in Vietnam. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 1,579 participants between April 16 and July 16, 2021. Participants references, concerns, and responses to vaccination recommendations made by government officials, employers, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, senior family members, and religious leaders were captured using a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Rates of trust ranged from 18.5% to 89.1%. The highest rates were attributable to government (89.1%) and physicians (85.9%). Less than half of participants would accept the vaccines if pharmacists (45.5%), nurses (44.7%), employers (42.4%), senior family members (28.1%), and religious leaders (18.4%) recommended it. Only 37.6% of participants thought that vaccines were safe for them, while 57% were unsure. Most participants would wait and see how people respond to the vaccines before getting vaccinated (91.5%), preferred to receive the vaccines at public hospitals (88.6%), and were concerned about vaccine effectiveness (86.9%) and side effects (76.4%), while 61.8% were concerned about vaccine cost. CONCLUSION: Focusing on the personal benefit and relying on the government, physicians, and social role models would make the vaccine advertising campaigns more effective. If annual vaccinations were needed, providing the community with affordable vaccines would be an appropriate, long-term solution to ensure vaccination coverage in low-resource countries like Vietnam. Further studies are needed to examine reasons for the public reference of vaccination centers which may help in improving their confidence in getting the vaccine, regardless of the settings.","output":"Who Influences the Public Intention to Get a COVID-19 Vaccine and What are the Public References and Concerns?

Less than one year after the discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral sequence, these vaccines were approved for use in the European Union (EU) as well as in numerous other countries and mass vaccination efforts began. The so far in the EU approved mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 are based on similar lipid-based nanoparticle carrier technologies; however, the lipid components differ. Severe allergic reactions and anaphylaxis after COVID-19 vaccination are very rare adverse events but have drawn attention due to potentially lethal outcomes and have triggered a high degree of uncertainty. Methods: Current knowledge on anaphylactic reactions to vaccines and specifically the new mRNA COVID-19 vaccines was compiled using a literature search in Medline, PubMed, as well as the national and international study and guideline registries, the Cochrane Library, and the Internet, with special reference to official websites of the World Health Organization (WHO), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert Koch Institute (RKI), and Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI). Results: Based on the international literature and previous experience, recommendations for prophylaxis, diagnosis and therapy of these allergic reactions are given by a panel of experts. Conclusion: Allergy testing is not necessary for the vast majority of allergic patients prior to COVID-19 vaccination with currently licensed vaccines. In case of allergic/anaphylactic reactions after vaccination, allergy workup is recommended, as it is for a small potential risk population prior to the first vaccination. Evaluation and approval of diagnostic tests should be done for this purpose.","output":"Practical handling of allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines: A position paper from German and Austrian Allergy Societies AeDA, DGAKI, GPA and ?GAI"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of April 26, 2020, more than 2,994,958 cases of COVID-19 infection have been confirmed globally, raising a challenging public health issue.

In this paper, we gathered case data from Jan 22, 2020 to April 14 for 6 countries to compare different models' proficiency in COVID-19 cases prediction. We assessed the performance of 3 machine learning models including hidden Markov chain model (HMM), hierarchical Bayes model, and long-short-term-memory model (LSTM) using the root-mean-square error (RMSE). The LSTM model had the consistently smallest prediction error rates for tracking the dynamics of incidents cases in 4 countries.

COVID19 was first reported in December, 2019 and after several observations of cutaneous involvement in patients with the disease there was need to document such in literature. The details of the clinical presentation and the pathophysiological mechanisms of these cutaneous lesions are, however, still poorly understood. This is a review of twenty-four published scientific articles summarizing the various cutaneous features observed by the frontline health care givers involved in the management of patients with Covid-19. Maculopapular exanthem was the most common pattern reported, accounting for 44.4% of skin manifestations. The pseudo-chilblain, urticarial, vesicular, livedoid and Kawasaki-like disease patterns accounted for 18.1%, 17.6%, 12.9%, 5.1% and 1.9% respectively. Anumber of the patients (9.5%) developed skin lesions at the time of diagnosis of Covid-19 or at the onset of Covid-19 respiratory symptoms while 75.1% developed the lesions after the onset of Covid-19 respiratory symptoms or after laboratory diagnosis of the disease had been made. There is no gainsaying that apart from the respiratory and other reported systems, Covid-19 also affects the skin. Clinicians, especially dermatologists, should therefore watch out for the already reported skin lesions and for possible yet to be discovered or reported skin lesions in patients with Covid-19.

Emergency releases have been shown to be feasible in terms of public safety but lack sustainability in reducing the number of people living in detention, and, globally, only a small proportion of them have been released. Without controlling the infection inside prisons, global efforts to tackle the spread of the disease may fail. People living in detention are not only more vulnerable to infection with COVID-19 but they are also especially vulnerable to human rights violations induced by inappropriate restrictions under the pretext of infection control. Therefore, alternatives for detention should be promoted and the number of incarcerated people radically decreased.This article calls on policymakers and all professionals involved in public health and criminal justice not to waste the opportunities provided by the crisis but to act now.","output":"COVID-19-The Case for Rethinking Health and Human Rights in Prisons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A review Comparison of domestic and foreign standards for medical personal protective equipment for the prevention and control of new coronavirus pneumonia","output":"Comparison of domestic and foreign standards for medical personal protective equipment for the prevention and control of new coronavirus pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research paper examines how engineering instructors initially experienced a forced change from in-person teaching to emergency remote teaching by collecting instructors' self-reported successes and challenges.

However, although vaccinations provide good protection, they do not offer full immunity and while they likely reduce transmission of the virus to others, the extent of this remains uncertain. This produces a dilemma for communicators who wish to be transparent about benefits and harms and encourage continued caution in vaccinated individuals but not undermine confidence in an important public health measure. In two large pre-registered experimental studies on quota-sampled UK public participants we investigate the effects of providing transparent communication-including uncertainty-about vaccination effectiveness on decision-making. In Study 1 (n = 2097) we report that detailed information about COVID-19 vaccines, including results of clinical trials, does not have a significant impact on beliefs about the efficacy of such vaccines, concerns over side effects, or intentions to receive a vaccine. Study 2 (n = 2217) addressed concerns that highlighting the need to maintain protective behaviours (e.g., social distancing) post-vaccination may lower perceptions of vaccine efficacy and willingness to receive a vaccine. We do not find evidence of this: transparent messages did not significantly reduce perceptions of vaccine efficacy, and in some cases increased perceptions of efficacy. We again report no main effect of messages on intentions to receive a vaccine. The results of both studies suggest that transparently informing people of the limitations of vaccinations does not reduce intentions to be vaccinated but neither does it increase intentions to engage in protective behaviours post-vaccination.","output":"Effect of Information about COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness and Side Effects on Behavioural Intentions: Two Online Experiments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aimed to estimate the high suicide risk during the COVID-19 lockdown in the Colombian population.

DESIGN: We compared the characteristics of the children who died in 2020, split by SARS-CoV-2 status. A negative binomial regression model was used to compare mortality rates in lockdown (23 MarchC28 June), with those children who died in the preceding period (6 JanuaryC22 March), as well as a comparable period in 2019. SETTING: England. PARTICIPANTS: Children (0C17 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Characteristics and number of the children who died in 2020, split by SARS-CoV-2 status. RESULTS: 1550 deaths of children between 6th of January and 28 June 2020 were notified to the NCMD; 437 of the deaths were linked to SARS-CoV-2 virology records, 25 (5.7%) had a positive PCR result. PCR-positive children were less likely to be white (37.5% vs 69.4%, p=0.003) and were older (12.2 vs 0.7 years, p<0.0006) compared with child deaths without evidence of the virus.

AIM: The aim of this study was to assess pregnant women's satisfaction with antenatal care and social support and to examine stress-reduction strategies women used during the pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was conducted between June and July 2020. Pregnant women, aged over 18 years were recruited. The survey included closed and open-ended questions to assess women's perceptions and satisfaction with their antenatal care, social support, and stress-reduction strategies. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis were used for quantitative analyses; qualitative content analysis was used for open-ended questions. FINDINGS: 573 pregnant women completed the survey. Women reported low levels of social support which was predicted by women's mental health and demographic factors and was related to public health and maternity service restrictions. Women reported that restrictions implemented in the maternity services limited their face-to face interactions with healthcare professionals and meant their partners could not attend antenatal appointments or support them in the postpartum period in the maternity setting. The lack of information on COVID-19 and pregnancy meant women had greater uncertainty about pregnancy and birth. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate how the lack of access to antenatal care and reduced perceived social support as a result of the restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially intensifies pregnancy specific stress.

METHODS: We retrospectively assessed for persistent viral shedding across Northwestern Medicine Healthcare (NMHC) patients between March and August 2020. We assessed for predictors of persistent viral shedding, in-hospital delirium, and six-month mortality using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 2,518 hospitalized patients with an RT-PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, 959 underwent repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR at least fourteen days from initial positive testing. Of those, 405 (42.2%) patients were found to have persistent viral shedding. Persistent viral shedding was associated with male sex, increased BMI, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and exposure to corticosteroids during initial COVID-19 hospitalization. Persistent viral shedding was independently associated with incidence of in-hospital delirium after adjusting for factors including severity of respiratory dysfunction (OR 2.45; 95% CI 1.75, 3.45).

Data acquired from 28 long-term air quality stations across the U.S. revealed widespread but nonuniform reductions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) during the first phase of lockdown (March 15-April 25, 2020) relative to a pre-lockdown reference period and historical baselines established in 2017-2019. The reductions, up to 49% for NO2 and 37% for CO, are statistically significant at two thirds of the sites and tend to increase with local population density.

An online survey was carried out to assess sociodemographic, psychosocial (previous mental health conditions, sexual orientation, intimate partner violence and perceived social support) and COVID-19-related variables. Hierarchical linear regression was carried out with anxiety and depressive symptoms as separate outcomes. Of the COVID-19-related factors, testing positive for COVID-19 infection, having COVID-19 symptoms, having other medical conditions, self-isolating due to COVID-19 symptoms, worry about infection, perception of the pandemic as a threat to income and isolation during the lockdown were significantly associated with higher anxiety and depressive symptoms. Of these, worry about infection, isolation during lockdown and disruption due to the pandemic retained independent associations with both outcomes. The variance in anxiety and depressive symptoms explained by COVID-19-related factors was larger in women (11.8%) compared to men (6.1% and 0.8% respectively). COVID-19-related stressors are associated with higher anxiety and depressive symptoms, with these effects being larger in men compared to women.

PFS is an extended version of the intuitionistic fuzzy set, where in addition to membership and non-membership grade, neutral and refusal membership grades are used to solve uncertain real-life problems more efficiently. Hence, we attempt to use it in this article to solve the mentioned problem. Previously, researchers considered the neutral membership grade of the PFS similar to the other two membership values (positive and negative) as applied to the decision-making method. In this study, we explore that neutral membership grade can be associated with probabilistic uncertainty which is measured using D-S theory of evidence and FUSH operation is applied for the aggregation purpose. Then GRA is used to measure the performance among the set of parameters which are in conflict and contradiction with each other. In this process, we propose an alternative group decision-making approach by the evidence of the neutral membership grade which is measured by the D-S theory and the conflict and contradiction among the criteria are managed by GRA.

The genetic architecture is complex with multiple loci involved, variable expressivity, and incomplete penetrance. The majority of cases are sporadic, consistent with a disease affecting fertility. The current study aims to investigate mosaicism as a genetic mechanism for CHH, focusing on de novo rare variants in CHH genes. METHODS: We evaluated 60 trios for de novo rare sequencing variants (RSV) in known CHH genes using exome sequencing. Potential mosaicism was suspected among RSVs with altered allelic ratios and confirmed using customized ultradeep sequencing (UDS) in multiple tissues. RESULTS: Among the 60 trios, 10 probands harbored de novo pathogenic variants in CHH genes. Custom UDS demonstrated that three of these de novo variants were in fact postzygotic mosaicism-two in FGFR1 (p.Leu630Pro and p.Gly348Arg), and one in CHD7 (p.Arg2428*). Statistically significant variation across multiple tissues (DNA from blood, buccal, hair follicle, urine) confirmed their mosaic nature.

The COVID-19 pandemic sped up this process. The rapid uptake of virtual care at the start of the pandemic prevented educators from taking deliberate steps to design the foundational elements of the related learning environment, including workflow, competencies, and assessment methods. Educators must now pursue an informed and purposeful approach to design a curriculum and implement virtual care in the learning environment. Engaging learners in virtual care offers opportunities for novel ways to teach and assess their performance and to effectively integrate technology such that it is accessible and equitable. It also offers opportunities for learners to demonstrate professionalism in a virtual environment, to obtain a patient's history incorporating interpersonal and communication skills, to interact with multiple parties during a patient encounter (patient, caregiver, translator, telepresenter, faculty member), to enhance physical examination techniques via videoconferencing, and ideally to optimize demonstrations of empathy through \\"webside manner.\\" Feedback and assessment, important features of training in any setting, must be timely, specific, and actionable in the new virtual care environment.

METHODS: Using a prospective non-randomised comparative study design, we enrolled a cohort of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients undergoing MFR. The predictor variables were osteofixation system (conventional titanium plates [CTiP] vs. ultrasound-assisted resorbable plates [USaRP]). The main outcomes were the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on four different surfaces. Other study variables were categorised into demographic, anatomical, and operative. Descriptive, bi- and multivariate statistics were computed. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 11 patients (27.3% females, 63.6% right side, 72.7% displaced fractures) with a mean age of 52.7  20.1 years (range, 19C85). Viral spread was, on average, 1.9  0.4 m. from the operative field, including most oral and orbital retractors tips (81.8% and 72.7%) and no virus was found at 3 m from the operative field, but no significant difference was found between 2 osteofixation types. On binary adjustments, significantly broader contamination was linked to centrolateral MFR (P = 0.034; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05 to 1.02), and displaced MFR > 45 min (P = 0.022; 95% CI, 0.1 to 1.03). CONCLUSIONS: USaRP, albeit presumably heavily aerosol-producing, cause similar SARS-CoV-2 distribution to CTiP. Non-surgical operating room (OR) staff should stay  3 m from the operative field, if the patient is SARS-CoV-2-positive.

Analyzing the effect of COVID-19 is an important issue in agricultural sectors. However, such analysis requires a complex hierarchical statistical model. Rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the world's production and productivity in many sectors. Among those sectors, the agricultural sector is highly affected. The Bale zone in the larger extent and Sinana district, in particular, is one of the potential agricultural areas in the Oromia regional state, Ethiopia where agriculture is the major sector in supporting the livelihood of thousands of subsistence farmers in the area as well as the country at large. Research Methodology. This study involved primary data collected from the farmers in the Sinana district during the period 2020-2021. A total of 991 farmers were selected from the entire 22 kebeles in the district. The data were analyzed using multilevel binary logistic random intercept regression models with maximum-likelihood parameter estimation. Results. Of the 991 farmers, 549 (55.4%) responded that COVID-19 has brought only challenges in their agricultural production and 311 (31.4%) responded both challenges and opportunities. About 632 (63.8%) of the farmers said that there was wastage of products such as milk, dairy, fruits, and vegetables. Three hundred twenty-eight (33.1%) of the participants obtained modernization in their agricultural production system like use of tractors and irrigation systems. According to the model results, farmer's sex, age, educational level, family size, farmland size, types of effect, aggravation in food insecurity, input delay, lack of workers, slowdown of service, falling in income, modernization in the system of production, wastage of product, and types of wasted products were identified as significant factors. About 8% of the total variability in the effect of COVID-19 is due to differences across kebeles (ICC = 0.08, P value 0.05), and the remaining is due to individual differences. Conclusion. This study further demonstrated the potential of a hierarchical model for the study of COVID-19 effect variation within and between the kebeles. The majority, about 92% variation in the effect, is due to the disparity of individuals (farmers). The farmers with large family sizes and high capacity to produce and who were females were negatively related to the effect of COVID-19 in agricultural production. ? 2022 Meskerem Abebe et al.","output":"Challenges and Opportunities for the Agricultural Producers in Sinana District in Reflection of COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Memory CD8(+) T cells accumulate with aging, while the na?ve T cell compartment decreases, leading to an increased susceptibility to infections and a decreased vaccine efficiency. To get deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms, this study aims to determine the age-dependent expression profile of total versus memory CD8(+) T cells from young and old donors. Total CD8(+) and CD8(+)CD45RA(-) memory T cells isolated from young (<30 years) and old (>60 years) donors were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies for 48h before analyzing the cytokine secretion and activation markers by flow cytometry and changes in the expression profiles using RNA sequencing. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analyses were performed for up-regulated and uniquely expressed transcripts identified in the T cell populations of both age groups. Total and memory CD8(+) T cells from old donors expressed significantly higher CD25 levels and have an increased cytokine secretion. While approximately 1,500 up-regulated transcripts were identified in all groups, CD8(+)CD45RA(-) memory T cells of old donors had approximately 500 more uniquely expressed transcripts. Four GO terms related to the JAK-STAT pathway were identified for up-regulated transcripts in the total CD8(+) T cells of old donors, whereas CD8(+)CD45RA(-) memory T cells GO terms related to adjacent pathways, like JNK and MAPK/ERK, were found. Additionally, the unique transcripts of CD8(+)CD45RA(-) memory T cells of old donors were related to the JNK, MAPK and IL-12 pathways. For both T cell populations of the old donors, cytokine and JAK-STAT pathway transcripts were up-regulated. Thus, an age-dependent effect was observed on the transcriptomes of total and memory CD8(+) T cells. The CD8(+) CD45RA(-) memory T cells from old donors maintained the increased cytokine secretion of the total CD8(+) T cell population and the increased JAK-STAT pathway transcripts, which have an impact on inflammation and senescence.","output":"Transcriptional Analysis of Total CD8(+) T Cells and CD8(+)CD45RA(-) Memory T Cells From Young and Old Healthy Blood Donors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Lung transplant (LTx) recipients may be at increased risk for fulminant novel SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 infection due to their immunosuppressed state Additional risk factors, outcomes, and optimal management of COVID-19 in LTx recipients is unknown Methods We identified LTx recipients infected with COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab in our institution Baseline demographics and clinical data were obtained through review of the electronic medical record (EMR) from 3/20/2020 to 10/25/2020 Results Ten LTx recipients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection Disease course and management details are described in Table 1 Mean age was 57 5  8 years, 50% were women (n = 5), and 70% self-identified as Latinx, 66% had a high school diploma or lower education Medicare or Medicaid was the primary insurance in 60% (n = 6) Mean household size was 3 2  1 5 persons Forty percent (n = 4) had mild symptoms that progressed to fulminant hypoxemic respiratory failure at 9-10 days from symptom onset Ninety percent (n = 9) required hospitalization with an average length of stay 14 8  12 Sixty percent (n = 6) were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU), 40% (n = 4) requiring mechanical ventilation COVID-19 specific therapies included remdesivir (80%, n = 8), dexamethasone (60%, n = 6), and convalescent plasma (50%, n = 5) Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was reduced or held in 60% (n = 6) of recipients One recipient who recovered later died in hospice care from other comorbidities Conclusion Most LTx recipients infected with COVID-19 had severe complications, with a high proportion requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation Though, mortality was relatively low Adjustments to immunosuppression included reduction in MMF and steroid augmentation Similar to the general US population, there is a disproportionate impact of COVID-19 infection in Latinx LTx recipients that may be related to social factors such as residing in multi-generational households","output":"COVID-19 Disease in Lung Transplant Recipients: A Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Although numerous patient specific co-factors have been shown to be associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19, the prognostic value of thalasemic syndromes in COVID-19 patients remains poorly understood.Aims: We studied the outcomes of 137 COVID-19 patients with a history of Transfusion Dependent Thalassemia (TDT) and non-Transfusion Dependent Thalassemia (NTDT) extracted from a large international cohort and compared them with the outcomes from a matched cohort of COVID-19 patients with no history of thalasemia.Results: The mean age of thalassemia patients included in our study was 4116 years (48.9% male). Almost 81% of these patients suffered from TDT requiring blood transfusions on a regular basis. 38.7% of patients were blood group O. Cardiac iron overload was documented in 6.8% of study patients, whereas liver iron overload was documented in 35% of study patients. 25% of thalassemia patients had a history of splenectomy. 27.7% of study patients required hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection. Amongst the hospitalized patients, one patient died (0.7%) and one patient required intubation. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was required in almost 5% of study patients. After adjustment for age-, sex- and other known risk factors (cardiac disease, kidney disease and pulmonary disease), the rate of in-hospital complications (supplemental oxygen use, admission to the an intensive care unit for CPAP therapy or intubation) and all-cause mortality was significantly lower in the thalassemia group compared to the matched cohort with no history of thalassemia. Amongst thalassemia patients in general, the NTDT group exhibited a higher rate of hospitalization compared to the TDT group (p=0.001). In addition, the rate of complications such as acute kidney injury and need for supplemental oxygen was significantly higher in the NTDT group compared to the TDT group. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, age and history of heart or kidney disease were all found to be independent risk factors for increased in-hospital, all-cause mortality, whereas the presence of thalassemia (either TDT or NTDT) was found to be independently associated with reduced all-cause mortality.Conclusions: The presence of thalassemia in COVID-19 patients was independently associated with lower in-hospital, all-cause mortality and few in-hospital complications in in our study.

Currently, there are insufficient data on what drives antibiotic prescribing practices throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE This study sought to determine antibiotic use rates and identify risk factors for antibiotic prescribing in hospitalized patients. It was the first study to assess risk factors for receiving more than 1 course of antibiotics. METHODS This was a retrospective, multi-center, observational study. Patients admitted from March 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020, and treated for COVID-19 were included. The primary endpoint was the rate of antibiotic use during hospitalization. Secondary endpoints included risk factors associated with antibiotic use, risk factors associated with receiving more than 1 antibiotic course, and rate of microbiologically confirmed infections. RESULTS A total of 208 encounters (198 patients) were included in the final analysis. Eighty-three percent of patients received at least 1 course of antibiotics, despite low rates of microbiologically confirmed infection (12%). Almost one-third of patients (30%) received more than 1 course of antibiotics. Risk factors identified for both antibiotic prescribing and receiving more than 1 course of antibiotics included increased hospital length of stay (median 12 days), intensive care unit admission, and the necessity for mechanical ventilation.

Stan is an expressive probabilistic programming language that abstracts the inference and allows users to focus on the modeling. As a result, Stan code is readable and easily extensible, which makes the modeler's work more transparent. Furthermore, Stan's main inference engine, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, is amiable to diagnostics, which means the user can verify whether the obtained inference is reliable. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to formulate, fit, and diagnose a compartmental transmission model in Stan, first with a simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, then with a more elaborate transmission model used during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Market creation is a complex activity that affects a large number of disciplines and synergistically creates satisfaction with the product and / or service, which, in a pandemic, is a special challenge for the creators of the product portfolio, especially for distribution channels. Distribution of products and / or services is a key factor of business success in the conditions of social distance and insufficiently developed technical - technological support for the transition to the virtual sphere of business and communication. A useful base of business activity includes adequate modeling of consumer profiles in order to adapt the marketing strategy to them, which ultimately provides guidelines for market positioning as a precondition for business efficiency. Creating consumer profiles requires a model analysis of habits, preferences, talents, personal and socio - psychological characteristics that allow the creation of similar groups, and thus the adaptation of marketing strategies in line with the created consumer profiles. The empirical basis of the proposed solutions enables a confidence in the modeled information, and thus reliability in their objectivness, which enables business flexibility conditioned by external stimuli, such as the COVID - 19, but it can also be used in other business conditions. The aim of the research is to establish a correlation and find answers on how to fit consumer profiles and their purchase under pandemic conditions. Consumer purchase depends on numerous factors, both internal and external, which are valid in regular conditions as well. Considering the current conditions, it is necessary to evaluate consumers' behaviour during the purchase. Consumer profiling is not universal and cannot be generalized for the global market, especially if it is programmed for providers within a selected geographic unit. The research assumption is that different results would be obtained in another territorial unit and a different consumer typology would be profiled, but this assumption needs to be checked, which opens up the possibilities of new research projects. The research marked off another group of factors, known as factor II, which includes: marital status, number of children, respondent's age, children's age, ownership of a residential building and employment status. Consumers' reaction to consumption is mostly within these factors. Data analysis and generation of management information that profiles consumers can be performed in other territorial units and in other time frames, and they are based on the knowledge of tools for data collection and processing, and then consulting service management - marketing adjustment of strategic commitments and business policy in accordance with the generated results.","output":"Statistical Modeling of Consumer Profiles in Adaptation of Marketing Strategy in Conditions of Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical guidelines are \\"statements that include recommendations, intended to optimize patient care, that are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options\\".1 Clinical guidelines are increasingly becoming a part of neurology clinical practice, most probably because they may improve patient clinical outcomes.2,3.","output":"Guidelines should be guidelines: Time to leave the terms \\"consensus\\" and \\"position\\" for other purposes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To determine the well-being of urologists worldwide during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and whether they have adequate personal protective equipment knowledge and supplies appropriate to their clinical setting.

Currently, atrial endocardial catheter ablation, mainly targeting focal discharges in the pulmonary veins, is the most widely used interventional treatment of drug-refractory AF. Despite technical improvements, results are not yet optimal. There is ongoing search for alternative and/or complementary interventional targets. Conditions associated with increased sympathetic activation such as hypertension, heart failure and sleep apnea lead to structural, neural and electrophysiological changes in the atrium thereby contributing to the progression from paroxysmal to persistent AF and increasing recurrence rate of AF after PVI. Until now, interventional modulation of autonomic nervous system was limited by highly invasive techniques. Catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) was introduced as a minimally invasive approach to reduce renal and whole body sympathetic activation with accompanying blood pressure control and left-ventricular morphological and functional changes in resistant hypertension. This review focuses on the potential atrial antiarrhythmic and antiremodeling effects of RDN in AF patients with hypertension, heart failure, and sleep apnea and discusses the possible role of RDN in the treatment of AF.","output":"Renal denervation: effects on atrial electrophysiology and arrhythmias."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the clinical training of dental programmes worldwide. This study aimed to assess the self-reported competencies of dental graduates directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as compared to the cohort before the year 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS A questionnaire consisting of eight domains with 43 questions was sent to all the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia's (UKM) dental graduates of 2019 and 2020 cohorts. The domains were: A) gathering information at chair-side, B) diagnosis, C) treatment planning, D) treatment and prevention, E) community-based, F) management and administrative, G) communication and H) personal management and professional development. Three additional questions were included to assess satisfaction on clinical teaching and supervision, requirements and assessment and cross infection control. RESULTS A total of 54 (91.5%) and 45 (100%) questionnaires were returned by the 2019 and 2020 cohorts, respectively. The 2019 cohort consistently perceived their competencies to be high across all the eight domains, and these responses were significantly higher than the 2020 cohort for seven out of the eight domains (p<0.005). The 2019 cohort also consistently perceived their competencies higher compared to the 2020 cohort for 40 out of 43 skills. Eleven skills were deemed to have 'poor ratings', and seven of these skills were rated significantly lower by the 2020 cohort than the other cohort (p<0.005). CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study highlight the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the self-perceived competencies of dental graduates. The 2020 graduates reported lower percentages of competent responses, mainly for community-based skills and management and administrative skills, even though they were deemed competent and graduated.

Plasma donation, in contrast, despite being a similar process, is mostly a paid activity in which donors are compensated for their contribution to the production of therapeutic preparations. This creates a so-called plasma paradox: If remuneration is promised for a socially useful effort, volunteers with altruistic motives might be deterred. At the same time, regular plasma donors who pursue the monetary benefits of donation might drop out if remuneration stops. The same controversy can be caught in the messages of most plasma donation companies as well: They promise a monetary reward (MR), and at the same time, highlight the altruistic component of donation. In this study, we tested the assumption that emphasizing the social significance enhances the willingness to donate blood plasma more effectively than either MR or the combination of these two incentives. This had to be rejected since there was no significant difference between the three scenarios. Furthermore, we also hypothesized that individuals might be more motivated to donate plasma if there is a possibility of offering an MR toward other socially beneficial aims. We found an increased willingness to donate in scenarios enabling double altruism, that is, when donating plasma for therapeutic use and transferring their remuneration to nongovernmental organizations, is an option. We propose relying on double altruism to resolve the plasma paradox, and suggest that it could serve as a starting point for the development of more optimized means for donor recruitment.","output":"Help Is in Your BloodIncentive to Double Altruism Resolves the Plasma Donation Paradox"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to reflect upon the challenges posed for the ongoing implementation of multi-agency risk assessment conferences (MARACs) for police forces in England and Wales during the 2020 pandemic.

The aim of this study was to screen severity-associated markers and construct an assessment model for predicting the severity of COVID-19. Methods: : 172 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled from two designated hospitals in Hangzhou, China. Ordinal logistic regression was used to screen severity-associated markers. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression was performed for further feature selection. Assessment models were constructed using logistic regression, ridge regression, support vector machine and random forest. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to evaluate the performance of different models. Internal validation was performed by using bootstrap with 500 re-sampling in the training set, and external validation was performed in the validation set for the four models, respectively. Results: : Age, comorbidity, fever, and 18 laboratory markers were associated with the severity of COVID-19 (all P values <0.05). By LASSO regression, eight markers were included for the assessment model construction. The ridge regression model had the best performance with AUROCs of 0.930 (95% CI, 0.914-0.943) and 0.827 (95% CI, 0.716-0.921) in the internal and external validations, respectively. A risk score, established based on the ridge regression model, had good discrimination in all patients with an AUROC of 0.897 (95% CI 0.845-0.940), and a well-fitted calibration curve. Using the optimal cutoff value of 71, the sensitivity and specificity were 87.1% and 78.1%, respectively. A web-based assessment system was developed based on the risk score. Conclusions: : Eight clinical markers of lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, albumin, comorbidity, electrolyte disturbance, coagulation function, eosinophil and lymphocyte counts were associated with the severity of COVID-19. An assessment model constructed with these eight markers would help the clinician to evaluate the likelihood of developing severity of COVID-19 at admission and early take measures on clinical treatment.","output":"Severity-associated markers and assessment model for predicting the severity of COVID-19: a retrospective study in Hangzhou, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although amoxicillinCclavulanate is the recommended first-line empirical oral antibiotic treatment for non-severe exacerbations in children with bronchiectasis, azithromycin is also often prescribed for its convenient once-daily dosing. No randomised controlled trials involving acute exacerbations in children with bronchiectasis have been published to our knowledge. We hypothesised that azithromycin is non-inferior to amoxicillin-clavulanate for resolving exacerbations in children with bronchiectasis. METHODS: We did this parallel-group, double-dummy, double-blind, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial in three Australian and one New Zealand hospital between April, 2012, and August, 2016. We enrolled children aged 1C19 years with radiographically proven bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis. At the start of an exacerbation, children were randomly assigned to oral suspensions of either amoxicillinCclavulanate (225 mg/kg, twice daily) and placebo or azithromycin (5 mg/kg per day) and placebo for 21 days. We used permuted block randomisation (stratified by age, site, and cause) with concealed allocation. The primary outcome was resolution of exacerbation (defined as a return to baseline) by 21 days in the per-protocol population, with a non-inferiority margin of ?20%. We assessed several secondary outcomes including duration of exacerbation, time to next exacerbation, laboratory, respiratory, and quality-of-life measurements, and microbiology. This trial was registered with the Australian/New Zealand Registry (ACTRN12612000010897). FINDINGS: We screened 604 children and enrolled 236. 179 children had an exacerbation and were assigned to treatment: 97 to amoxicillinCclavulanate, 82 to azithromycin). By day 21, 61 (84%) of 73 exacerbations had resolved in the azithromycin group versus 73 (84%) of 87 in the amoxicillinCclavulanate group. The risk difference showed non-inferiority (?03%, 95% CI ?118 to 111). Exacerbations were significantly shorter in the amoxicillinCclavulanate group than in the azithromycin group (median 10 days [IQR 6C15] vs 14 days [8C16]; p=0014). Adverse events were attributed to the trial medication in 17 (21%) of 82 children in the azithromycin group versus 23 (24%) of 97 in the amoxicillinCclavulanate group (relative risk 09, 95% CI 05 to 15). INTERPRETATION: By 21 days of treatment, azithromycin is non-inferior to amoxicillinCclavulanate for resolving exacerbations in children with non-severe bronchiectasis. In some patients, such as those with penicillin hypersensitivity or those likely to have poor adherence, azithromycin provides another option for treating exacerbations, but must be balanced with risk of treatment failure (within a 20% margin), longer exacerbation duration, and the risk of inducing macrolide resistance.

Combining LAGB with gastric plication (LAGB-P) may increase weight loss compared to LAGB alone. METHODS In this study, we report our short-term experience with this novel technique and compare the data for the first 42 consecutive patients with the data for LAGB alone and LSG. Forty-two morbidly obese patients underwent LAGB-P and were followed for 12 months. Operative complications, weight loss, and late complications were followed and compared with matched groups of LAGB alone and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). The setting was a university hospital in Taiwan. RESULTS The study consisted of 42 patients, specifically 21 males and 21 females with an average age of 32.69.7 years (range 18 to 58) and a mean body mass index of 40.76.1 kg/m2 (range 31.5 to 56.4). The mean operation time was 141.924.8 minutes (range 105 to 190), and the mean hospital stay was 2.31.9 days. Two (4.8%) major complications were encountered and resolved by laparoscopic revision surgery. There was 1 (2.4%) major complication in the LSG group and none in the LAGB group. The operation time for LAGB-P was longer than for LAGB and LSG (75.617.9 and 110.522.3 minutes; P<.001). The mean body mass index of the LAGB-P group decreased from 40.7 to 29.4 kg/m2 at 1 year after surgery, with an excess weight loss of 62.6%. This result is similar to the 67.2% excess weight loss in the LSG group, but is higher than the 31.7% excess weight loss of the LAGB group. At follow-up, revision surgery was required in 2 (4.8%) patients in the LAGBP group, none (0%) in the LAGB group, and 1 (2.4%) in the LSG group. More patients in the LSG group still required proton pump inhibitor treatment at 1 year after surgery than the other 2 groups CONCLUSION By combining LAGB with gastric plication, LAGB-P can augment the weight loss of LAGB and is similar to LSG but may increase risk.","output":"Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) with gastric plication: short-term results and comparison with LAGB alone and sleeve gastrectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to its ability to reflect the capacity to engage in context-appropriate responses, tonic heart rate variability (HRV) is considered a putative biomarker of stress resilience. However, most studies are cross-sectional, precluding causal inferences. The high levels of uncertainty and fear at a global level that characterize the COVID-19 pandemic offer a unique opportunity to investigate the longitudinal role of HRV in stress resilience. The present study examined whether HRV, measured about 2 years earlier (Time 0), could predict emotion regulation strategies and daily affect in healthy adults during the May 2020 lockdown (Time 1). Moreover, we evaluated the association between HRV measures, emotion regulation strategies, subjective perception of COVID-19 risk, and self-reported depressive symptoms at Time 1. Higher tonic HRV at Time 0 resulted a significant predictor of a stronger engagement in more functional emotion regulation strategies, as well as of higher daily feelings of safeness and reduced daily worry at Time 1.

The aim of this study was to investigate endothelial-dependent and endothelial-independent skin microvascular reactivity in patients with critical COVID-19. METHODS: Twelve patients with COVID-19 treated with non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation were included in the study. We investigated skin microvascular reactivity on two separate days during hospitalization (study day 1 and 2) and at least three months after disease onset (study day 3). Twelve controls with no confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection during 2020 were also examined. Skin perfusion was investigated through Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) before and after iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to determine the endothelial-dependent and the endothelial-independent vasodilation, respectively. RESULTS: Compared to controls, patients with critical COVID-19 had higher basal skin perfusion and reduced responses to endothelial-dependent (ACh, pa??=a??0.002) and endothelial-independent (SNP, pa??=a??0.01) vasodilator drugs on study day 1. In addition, the ACh/SNP ratio was significantly reduced in patients (0.50a??a??0.36 versus 0.91a??a??0.49 in controls, pa??=a??0.02). Three months after disease onset, surviving patients tended to have reduced ACh-mediated vasodilation compared to controls (pa??=a??0.08).

Results: One important theme among migrants was their eagerness to return to their native homes. Participants were also concerned about pending agriculture-related work, their families back home, and job insecurity. Most of the migrants supported the government-mandated lockdown and agreed that they would follow all instructions. Conclusions: Physiologic requirements, safety, and security were the predominant needs of the migrant workers while staying in the shelter home during lockdown. The participants feared contracting COVID-19 and were uncertain about when and how they would return to their native homes.","output":"Migrant Workers' Needs and Perceptions While Lodged in a Shelter Home in India During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: High-dose ( 80 ppm) inhaled nitric oxide (INO) has antimicrobial effects. We designed a trial to test the preventive effects of high-dose NO on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in health care providers working with patients with COVID-19. The study was interrupted prematurely due to the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines for health care professionals. We thereby present data on safety and feasibility of breathing 160 ppm NO using 2 different NO sources, namely pressurized nitrogen/NO cylinders (INO) and electric NO (eNO) generators. METHODS: NO gas was inhaled at 160 ppm in air for 15 min twice daily, before and after each work shift, over 14 d by health care providers (NCT04312243). During NO administration, vital signs were continuously monitored. Safety was assessed by measuring transcutaneous methemoglobinemia (SpMet) and the inhaled nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration. RESULTS: Twelve healthy health care professionals received a collective total of 185 administrations of high-dose NO (160 ppm) for 15 min twice daily. One-hundred and seventy-one doses were delivered by INO and 14 doses by eNO. During NO administration, SpMet increased similarly in both groups (P = .82). Methemoglobin decreased in all subjects at 5 min after discontinuing NO administration. Inhaled NO2 concentrations remained between 0.70 ppm (0.63-0.79) and 0.75 ppm (0.67-0.83) in the INO group and between 0.74 ppm (0.68-0.78) and 0.88 ppm (0.70-0.93) in the eNO group. During NO administration, peripheral oxygen saturation and heart rate did not change. No adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study testing high-dose INO (160 ppm) for 15 min twice daily using eNO seems feasible and similarly safe when compared with INO.","output":"High-Dose Nitric Oxide From Pressurized Cylinders and Nitric Oxide Produced by an Electric Generator From Air"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to myocardial injury and shock in children, likely the result of a severe inflammatory state, and can mimic Kawasaki disease. OBJECTIVE To describe the characteristics of shock and myocardial injury in children with confirmed or suspeted COVID-19 during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Spain, including clinical presentation, laboratory and imaging findings, treatment, disease course, and outcome. An extensive literature review is provided. METHODS Retrospective case series including all children (age 1 month-18 years) admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit in Madrid, Spain, between March 15 and April 30, 2020 with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and shock. RESULTS Twelve previously healthy patients with shock, age 5 to 14 years, were included. All required volume resuscitation and 75% required vasoactive/inotropic support. Distributive shock was present on admission in 67% (n = 8), and 4 patients (33%) showed features of cardiogenic shock. Myocardial injury was diagnosed in 67% (n = 8) and ventricular dysfunction in 33% (n = 4). The most common symptoms on presentation were fever (100%), anorexia (100%), diarrhea (75%), and vomiting (75%). Five patients showed signs of Kawasaki disease but none met the criteria for the classic form. Laboratory findings revealed lymphopenia (83%), thrombocytopenia (83%), and increased inflammatory markers (100%). Respiratory status was not significantly impacted. Chest X-ray showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates in 7 (58%) and bilateral pneumonia in 3 (25%). COVID-19 was confirmed in 11 cases (92%). All received empirical therapy against COVID-19, thromboprophylaxis and immunomodulation. Median stay in the PICU and inpatient ward was 4.5 and 10 days, respectively. No patients died. CONCLUSION Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children with COVID-19 can mimic Kawasaki disease and lead to a combination of distributive and cardiogenic shock, probably secondary to a hyperinflammatory state that remains to be precisely defined. Treatment strategies include hemodynamic support, empirical therapies against COVID-19, thromboprophylaxis, and immunomodulation.","output":"Shock and Myocardial Injury in Children With Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Associated With SARS-CoV-2 Infection: What We Know.

Methods: Prospective cohort study of previously healthy term infants enrolled during hospitalization or acute care outpatient visits (emergency and clinic visits) for ARI from 2004-2008. ARI severity was determined using a 12-point respiratory severity score (RSS), and dichotomous LRTI or URI. ARI viral etiology was determined using real-time PCR for a panel of common respiratory viruses including seasonal CoV NL63, 229E, and OC43. In an exploratory analysis, proportions who subsequently developed childhood asthma were estimated by infection status in infancy. Clinical presentation of infant seasonal CoV infections was compared with published data on SARS-CoV-2 clinical characteristics in infants. Results: Among 665 infants, 28 (4%) had CoV detected. NL63, 229E, and OC43 comprised 25%, 25%, and 61% of detections, respectively, which included mixed-CoV infections. CoV exhibited winter seasonality. Among 28 CoV infections, 19 (68%) infants had co-infection with other viruses (RSV, HRV, influenza). Of 9 CoV-only detections, 2 (22%) were hospitalizations, 7 (78%) were outpatient, 8 (89%) were URI, 0 were bronchiolitis, and 1 (11%) was other diagnosis. Among CoV co-infections, 9 (47%) were hospitalizations, 10 (53%) were outpatient, 6 (32%) were URI, 11 (58%) were bronchiolitis, and 2 (11%) were other diagnoses. Average RSS was higher in infants with CoV co-infection than CoV-only infection (figure). Most common seasonal CoV symptoms were fever, cough, and rhinorrhea. Among those with long-term follow-up, childhood asthma (4-6 years) appeared more prevalent in RSV-only (62/152, 41%) and HRV-only infection groups (33/61, 54%) versus CoV-only (2/6, 33%);however, infants with CoV infection comprised a small proportion. Conclusions: Seasonal CoV represented the fourth most common viral etiology of ARI among infants seeking unscheduled medical care. CoV infection was less severe compared to RSV or HRV. This mild disease presentation is similar to current published reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants. Greater illness severity was associated with CoV coinfection compared to CoV alone;however, CoV-only detection were few. Infants with seasonal CoV were less likely than infants with RSV or HRV to have later childhood long-term respiratory morbidity. These findings highlight the potential influence that respiratory co-pathogens may have in infant SARS-CoV-2 infection severity, and underscore the importance of identifying co-infecting pathogens.","output":"Severity of seasonal coronavirus acute respiratory illness during infancy associated with respiratory viral co-infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Sharing of fake news on social media platforms is a global concern, with research offering little insight into the motives behind such sharing. This study adopts a mixed-method approach to explore fake-news sharing behaviour. To begin with, qualitative data from 58 open-ended essays was analysed to identify six behavioural manifestations associated with sharing fake news. Thereafter, research model hypothesizing the association between these behaviours was proposed using the honeycomb framework and the third-person effect hypothesis. Age and gender were the control variables. Two data sets obtained from cross-sectional surveys with 471 and 374 social media users were utilized to test the proposed model. The study results suggest that instantaneous sharing of news for creating awareness had positive effect on sharing fake news due to lack of time and religiosity. However, authenticating news before sharing had no effect on sharing fake news due to lack of time and religiosity. The study results also suggest that social media users who engage in active corrective action are unlikely to share fake news due to lack of time. These results have significant theoretical and practical implications.","output":"Sharing of fake news on social media: Application of the honeycomb framework and the third-person effect hypothesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the first observations of patients with COVID-19, significant hypoalbuminaemia was detected. Its causes have not been investigated yet. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that pulmonary capillary leakage affects the severity of respiratory failure, causing a shift of fluids and proteins through the epithelial-endothelial barrier. METHODS: One hundred seventy-four COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms, 92 admitted to the intermediate medicine ward (IMW) and 82 to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan, were studied. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics at admission were considered. Proteins, interleukin 8 (IL-8) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analysed in 26 ICU patients. In addition, ten autopsy ultrastructural lung studies were performed in patients with COVID-19 and compared with postmortem findings in a control group (bacterial pneumonia-ARDS and H1N1-ARDS). ICU patients had lower serum albumin than IMW patients [20 (18-23) vs 28 (24-33) g L-1 , P < 0.001]. Serum albumin was lower in more compromised groups (lower PaO2 -to-FiO2 ratio and worst chest X-ray findings) and was associated with 30 days of probability of survival. Protein concentration was correlated with IL-8 and IL-10 levels in BALF. Electron microscopy examinations of eight out of ten COVID-19 lung tissues showed loosening of junctional complexes, quantitatively more pronounced than in controls, and direct viral infection of type 2 pneumocytes and endothelial cells. CONCLUSION: Hypoalbuminaemia may serve as severity marker of epithelial-endothelial damage in patients with COVID-19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A monocentric, retrospective study was conducted, using the data of 70 female patients, who visited the endocrinology department of the \\"Dr. Shterev\\" Hospital, Sofia, Bulgaria between May 2020 and September 2020. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of vitamin D3 supplementation: either a microencapsulated liposomal form (n=35), or a conventional oil-based form (n=35). The following clinical measures were analysed and compared: BMI, serum levels of 25(OH)D, fasting plasma glucose levels, fasting immunoreactive insulin (IRI), homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index, levels of antimullerian hormone (AMH) II generation, and testosterone. In all selected patients, these measurements were performed at baseline and 3 months after initiation of vitamin D supplementation. RESULTS: Significantly increased serum levels of 25(OH)D were observed in patients supplemented with the microencapsulated form of vitamin D3 in the third month from the beginning of therapy, compared with the control group (p=0.003). In the microencapsulated vitamin D group, there was a decrease in IRI serum levels (p=0.023), HOMA-IR (p=0.021), serum AMH (p=0.010) and testosterone levels (p=0.006).

However, little is known about the status of vascular dynamics in obese and morbidly obese adults. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this present quasi-experimental longitudinal study, changes in beat-to-beat BPV, using continuous, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, in obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery are characterised. The capacity of linear and non-linear measures of BPV to detect differences between hypertensive, prehypertensive and normotensive obese subjects prebariatric and postbariatric surgery are tested. Additionally, potential correlations between beat-to-beat BPV and age, body mass index, gender and comorbidities will be investigated. In parallel, the impact of the unsteady fluctuations of beat-to-beat blood pressure on the dynamic stresses imparted by blood flow on blood vessel walls will be explored. We expect to find altered BPV profiles in hypertensive and prehypertensive subjects as compared with normotensive subjects.

Our goal is to provide a prediction model to help policy makers in different countries address the epidemic outbreak and adjust the control policies to contain the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) more effectively. MethodsUnlike the classic public health and virus propagation models, this new projection model takes both government intervention and public response into account to generate reliable projections of the outbreak 10 days to 2 weeks in advance. This method is an observation based projection similar than the classic Moores Law in miroelectronics. The Moores law is not based on any physics law and yet has anticipated the development of microelectronics for decades. This work is an empirical relation to decribe the evolution of epidemic to pandemic situations in different countries. The country was selected as an observation unit because the regulation and political decision is an national decision for numerous measures such as the implementation of social distancing, the quarantine of suspected cases, and the closing of borders to achieve territorial containment. FindingsThis model has been successfully applied to predict the evolution of pendemic situation in China. Then the model was also validated by the South Korean data. With a reduction of cases calculated as reduction coefficient of the increase rate of daily cases Rc = 2% per day, we observed a very efficient policy with a strict systematic control in both China and South Korea. For the moment, the Canada, USA, Australia may have difficulties to limit the fast evolution of the epidemic. With a Rc<0.5%, its particularly important for the USA to consider escalating the control measures because the affected cases can reach more than one million very soon. InterpertationDue to the difference of national disciplines and historical culture, the national policy may be implemented and observed with different efficiency. The starting point where the government decided to apply total containment can also play a key role for the evolution of the pendemic situation. The model will allow each national government of the nations still affected by the pandemic to project the situation for the coming 10 to 14 days. Its very important for the deployment of national and international efforts to stop the pandemic situation.

This study aims to ascertain the antibody response to each dose with respect to age, previous infection status etc. METHODS: Baseline total COVID-19 antibody level was ascertained using Siemens SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody assay in consenting health care workers before the first dose of vaccination. Adverse effects were noted in each individual and were monitored weekly for the total antibody titre following both doses. Descriptive statistical tests were used to analyse the changes in antibodies levels weekly after both doses. Association of previous COVID infection and age with antibody levels was assessed. RESULTS: Median (range) of age of the 30 study participants was 31.5 years.23% of the participants had a history of previous COVID-19 infection. Mild adverse events following immunisation were reported by 87% participants after first dose whereas only in 7% after second dose. Median baseline antibody titres were significantly higher among those with previous COVID infection as compared to previously uninfected individuals. Antibody titres increased consistently after first dose and showed a declining trend following the second dose in all participants and showed no significant association with previous COVID-19 infection or age. CONCLUSIONS: Antibody titre response was similar amongst the various age groups. Higher response in the previously infected individuals following first dose may make them ideal candidates for a single dose vaccine regimen. Individuals showing lower levels of neutralising antibodies can be ideal candidates for a booster dose. ?

However, both ordinary users and malicious actors may spread misinformation, which can misguide not only the end-users but also the threat intelligence tools. In this work, for the first time, we study the prevalence of cybersecurity and privacy misinformation on social media, focusing on two different topics: phishing websites and Zoom's security&privacy. We collected Twitter posts that were warning users about phishing websites and tried to verify these claims. We found about 22% of these tweets to be not valid claims. We then investigated posts about Zoom's security and privacy on multiple platforms, including Instagram, Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook. To detect misinformation related to Zoom, we first created a groundtruth dataset and a taxonomy of misinformation and identified the textual and contextual features to be used for training classifiers to detect posts that discuss the security and privacy of Zoom and detect misinformation. Our classifiers showed great performance, e.g., Reddit and Facebook misinformation classifier reached an accuracy of 99% while Twitter and Instagram reached an accuracy of 98%. Employing these classifiers on the posts from Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter, we found that respectively about 3%, 10%, 4%, and 0.4% of Zoom's security and privacy posts as misinformation.

The assay utilized primers targeting ISAV RNA segment 8, with ISAV isolate U5575-1 as template. The entire optimized assay, including one cycle of reverse transcription, 50 cycles of complementary DNA amplification, and data acquisition and analysis took only 80min. The melting curve and gel electrophoresis analyses of real-time RTCPCR showed harmony with each other as a virus-specific single melting peak and a product of the expected size of 211bp were obtained. A regression line between the mean threshold cycle (Ct) values and viral template concentrations over a 1:105 dilution range with an r 2 value of 0.962 and a slope of ?3.771 indicated that the assay was highly reproducible. This assay was 100 times more sensitive than the conventional one-tube RTCPCR assay when compared on the same sample. Analysis of different tissues from fish that survived an ISAV experimental infection further confirmed that real-time RTCPCR was more sensitive than regular RTCPCR for detection of ISAV nucleic acids. Temporal analysis of ISAV-infected TO cell cultures showed that the amount of the specific viral RNA increased more than 100-fold within 32h post-inoculation (p.i.) and over 1200-fold by 144h p.i. The melting curve analysis throughout the duration of the infection sampled had a single melting peak suggesting that the virus population was uniform in the targeted region. Quantitative analysis of CHSE-214 cell cultures infected with different ISAV isolates indicated that ISAV isolates, based on their ability to replicate and cause cytopathic effects in CHSE-214 cells, may be differentiated into three CHSE phenotypes: replicating cytopathic, replicating non-cytopathic, and non-replicating. Thus, the SYBR Green real-time RTCPCR is a sensitive, rapid, and highly reproducible assay that can be used to quantitate ISAV in biological samples.","output":"Detection of infectious salmon anaemia virus by real-time RTCPCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"World health care systems are affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and its associated disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

BACKGROUND: Following the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, a drop in blood donation has been observed. It is crucial to determine the actual number of potential SARS-CoV-2-positive donors to define the measures and ensure adequate blood supply. METHODS: The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, calculated on the general population, was applied to the donor population by estimating the number of positive subjects. The calculation model was validated by the linear interpolation method. The number of blood units actually discarded based on post-donation information was also taken into account. RESULTS: Three months after the outbreak, 5322 donors were estimated to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were therefore potentially excluded from donation. A total of units of blood components were discarded following post donation information. The estimated number of donors deceased (180) and the number of clinically recovered individuals in the same period was also considered.

BACKGROUND Angioplasty and stenting are options for revascularization of symptomatic peripheral artery disease. While angioplasty alone is effective in short lesions, outcomes in longer lesions (i.e., mean 8.7 cm) show suboptimal patency rates of 33% at one year. METHODS Two hundred eighty-seven patients (mean age 68 years, 66% male) were treated with the EverFlex? Self-Expanding Peripheral Stent System. Patients were followed through 3 years with yearly core lab adjudicated duplex ultrasonography for patency, radiographic assessment of stent fractures, and resting ankle brachial indices. RESULTS Overall freedom from loss of primary patency at 3 years was 60.0%. Patency was significantly higher for lesions 8 cm compared with lesions >8 cm (71.0 vs. 50.5%, P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in patency between single-stent and multistent recipients (60.4 vs. 52.4%, P = 0.343). The three-year freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 70.0%. At 3 years, the overall stent fracture rate was 0.9%. CONCLUSIONS DURABILITY II is the first investigational device exemption trial to report 3-year duplex Doppler defined stent patency and CD-TLR outcomes in long SFA and proximal popliteal lesions and demonstrated acceptable stent patency and freedom from CD-TLR with a low fracture rate. These data suggest that use of a single long stent provides reasonable long-term outcomes when intervention is required for symptomatic SFA and proximal popliteal arterial disease.","output":"A single stent strategy in patients with lifestyle limiting claudication: 3-year results from the Durability II trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has already taken many lives but is still continuing its spread and exerting jeopardizing effects.

RdRp is a major part of a multi-subunit transcription complex of the virus, which is essential for viral replication.

This study was conducted to reveal the differences in Aspergillus carbonarius tannase enzymatic characterization, secondary structures, and molecular mechanisms after treatment of the strain with atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP). RESULTS: The results showed that the specific activity of tannase was improved by ARTP treatment, and it showed higher thermostability and tolerance to metal ions and additives. The enzymatic characterization and molecular docking results indicated that tannase had a higher affinity and catalytic rate with tannic acid as a substrate after ARTP treatment. In addition, the docking results indicated that Aspergillus tannases may catalyze tannic acid by forming two hydrogen-bonding networks with neighboring residues. RNA-seq analysis indicated that changes in steroid biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation pathway, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways might be crucial reasons for the high production of tannase.

The downward slopes vary by about a factor of three with time constants (1/slope) of between 1 and 3 weeks; this suggests it may be possible to predict when an outbreak will end. Is it possible to go beyond this and perform early prediction of the outcome in terms of the eventual plateau number of total confirmed cases or deaths? We test this hypothesis by showing that the trajectory of cases or deaths in any outbreak can be converted into a straight line. Specifically , is a straight line for the correct plateau value N, which is determined by a new method, Best-Line Fitting (BLF). BLF involves a straight-line facilitation extrapolation needed for prediction; it is blindingly fast and amenable to optimization. We find that in some locations that entire trajectory can be predicted early, whereas others take longer to follow this simple functional form. Fortunately, BLF distinguishes predictions that are likely to be correct in that they show a stable plateau of total cases or death (N value). We apply BLF to locations that seem close to a stable predicted N value and then forecast the outcome at some locations that are still growing wildly.

We hypothesized that coronaviruses could affect pulmonary tissues via integration with the critical immune genes after their interaction with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) elements. The aim of the present bioinformatics study was to assess expression changes of the RAS and non-RAS genes, particularly immune response genes, in the lung epithelial cells after infection with SARS-CoV. METHODS: Linear regression, hierarchical clustering, pathway analysis, and network analysis were performed using the E-GEOD-17400 data set. RESULTS: The whole-genome expression data of the lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV for 12, 24, and 48 hours were analyzed, and a total of 15 RAS family and 29 immune genes were found to be highly correlated with the exposure time to the virus in the studied groups.

Postponing elective surgery in order to provide capacity for emergency operations is inevitable at times. Elderly patients, residents of nursing homes, women, patients with low socioeconomic status and ethnic minorities are at risk for undertreatment in other contexts, as suggested by reports in the medical literature. We hypothesized that specific patient groups could be at higher risk for having their elective surgery rescheduled for non-medical reasons. METHODS: In this single center, prospective observational trial, we analysed 2519 patients undergoing elective surgery from October 2018 to May 2019. A 14-item questionnaire was handed out to illicit patient details. Additional characteristics were collected using electronic patient records. Information on the timely performance of the scheduled surgery was obtained using the ORs patient data management system. 6.45% of all planned procedures analysed were postponed. Association of specific variables with postponement rates were analysed using the MannCWhitney U test and Fisher's exact test/(2)-test. RESULTS: Significantly higher rates of postponing elective surgery were found in elderly patients. No significant differences in postponing rates were found for the variables gender, nationality (Germany, EU, non-EU), native language, professional medical background and level of education. Significantly lower rescheduling rates were found in patients with ties to hospital staff and in patients with a private health insurer. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients, retirees and nursing home residents seem to be at higher risk for having their elective surgery rescheduled. However, owing to the study design, causality could not be proven. Our findings raise concern about possible undertreatment of these patient groups and provide data on short-term postponement of elective surgery. Trial registration DRKS00015836.

We use the time-varying parameter vector autoregressions framework combined with the connectedness approach based on the generalized forecast error variance decomposition. Our static connectedness analysis evidences a low connection of the DeFi markets with the conventional currency markets. The results of our dynamic analysis reveal that the return spillovers are time-varying, with an abrupt increase in connectedness between the DeFi and currency markets in early 2020, during the initial escalation of the pandemic. However, the spillover from the Chinese Yuan to the system does not exhibit any hike due to the COVID-19-triggered meltdown, highlighting a pandemic-caused decoupling of the Chinese financial system from the other centralized and decentralized markets. We observe unprecedentedly high spillovers from the system to the DeFi markets at the beginning of the pandemic. However, we still find that the DeFi markets act predominantly as net innovation transmitters during the first COVID-19 year. Moreover, we detect the existence of a pairwise-like relationship between the net return spillover profiles and report on inversely symmetric profiles for the Maker - Euro, Basic Attention Token - Japanese Yen, and the Chainlink - Pound Sterling pairs.

We propose a piecewise stationary time series model that accounts for pervasive serial and cross-sectional correlations through a factor structure, and only assumes that any remaining idiosyncratic dependence between variables can be modelled by a sparse VAR model. We propose an accompanying two-stage change point detection methodology which fully addresses the challenges arising from not observing either the factors or the idiosyncratic VAR process directly. Its consistency in estimating both the total number and the locations of the change points in the latent components, is established under conditions considerably more general than those in the existing literature.

Methods: : In this descriptive study, all confirmed cases of COVID-19 admitted to Guder Hospital from May 16 to December 31, 2020, were included. Cases were confirmed by real-time PCR and analyzed using SPSS version 22. The data were collected from January 15-20, 2021. Results: : A total of 260 confirmed patients were admitted, including 180 men and 80 women. Of these cases, 184 (70.8%) were asymptomatic at admission. The mean age of the patients was 35.5 [SD 15] years. Adults aged 15 and above years accounted for 254 (97.7%). Meantime in the hospital was 14.3 [SD 3] days.

Methods We performed an ecological study using data at the municipality level. We used COVID-19 data obtained from government public reports up to and including July 17th, 2020. We defined PM2.5 long-term exposure as the 2014-2018 average of the estimated concentrations at municipalities obtained from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service Reanalysis (CAMSRA) model. We fitted a logit-negative binomial hurdle model for the mortality rate adjusting for sociodemographic and health conditions. Results Estimated mortality rate ratios (MRR) for long-term average PM2.5 were not statistically significant in either of the two components of the hurdle model (i.e., the likelihood of reporting at least one death or the count of fatal cases). We found that having 10% or more of the population over 65 years of age (MRR=3.91 95%CI 2.24-6.81), the poverty index (MRR=1.03 95%CI 1.01-1.05), and the prevalence of hypertension over 6% (MRR=1.32 95%CI1.03-1.68) are the main factors associated with death rate at the municipality level.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a survey with IM attendings and trainees at a large academic medical center in Western Pennsylvania. We used descriptive statistics to characterize attitudes towards medication abortion provision, including the belief that it is within their scope of practice and interest in future provision, and to explore perceived barriers to provision. We used logistic regression models to assess factors associated with each of these attitudes. RESULTS: Of 397 eligible attendings and trainees, 121 (30%) completed the survey. Among those surveyed, 44% believed medication abortion is within the scope of practice of IM PCPs with trainees and female-identifying providers being significantly more likely to believe medication abortion is within their scope of practice compared to attending physicians and male physicians (60% vs 30%, p < 0.01 and 53% vs 31%, p = 0.01, respectively).

Beta-islet cells in the pancreas have been shown to be affected by COVID-19 via ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors. Accordingly, diabetes mellitus (DM) has not only been described as an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19, but there is also an association between new-onset DM (NODM) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with COVID-19. This case report discusses a patient with NODM presenting with DKA precipitated by COVID-19. Case Summary: A 45-year-old male with no past medical history who emigrated from India in March 2020 presented to the emergency department with five days of dyspnea, chills, fatigue, polyuria, and polydipsia. He was COVID-19 PCR-positive while his labs were remarkable for WBC 14, sodium 126, bicarbonate 2, glucose 350, anion gap 33, pH 6.95, pCO2 26, lactate 4.4, D-dimer 479, LDH 350, Ferritin 2381, Procalcitonin 1.13, HIV negative, and significant ketonuria. Chest x-ray revealed bilateral lower lobe patchy infiltrates consistent with COVID-19. He was started on an insulin drip, therapeutic Enoxaparin, and fluid resuscitation. He did not require supplemental oxygen and was not treated with steroids or antivirals. He was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin after one day. He was discharged after an uncomplicated five-day hospital stay. Discussion: There has been an increasing number of reports describing DKA precipitated by COVID-19 in patients with NODM, though our patient presentation is unique because he had a mild COVID-19 course that precipitated severe DKA. This case indicates a more direct role of COVID-19 damaging beta-cells in the pancreas as our patient remained on insulin and no other diabetic medications at discharge and after follow-up, indicating a complete reliance on exogenous insulin and failure of the pancreas to produce insulin seen with type-1 DM. The patient's HbA1c of 13.3 indicates a chronic state of DM, though COVID-19 certainly contributed to establishing NODM and DKA likely by wiping the remaining function of the Beta-cells in the pancreas. This uncommon case presentation demonstrates that even mild COVID-19 can induce DKA, so it is imperative that further research be conducted on its mechanism and prevention in the future.","output":"COVID-19: Too Sweet to Handle?

Methods The patients using telemedicine services were enrolled during the period of pilot run from February 10th to April 15th, 2020. The study was done from the social perspective. A decision-tree model was constructed to compare the costs between telemedicine services and conventional clinical services for outpatients. The main outcome was measured as incre- mental cost-effective ness ratios (ICER). Sensitivity analysis was conducted by using one-way sensitivity analysis. Results During a period of forty-seven days, the online fever clinic was applied 3055 person-times(2070 patients) and the online outpatient clinic were applied 36 549 person-times(20 467 patients). On average, 44 febrile cases/d and 435 nonfebrile cases/d were reduced in the outpatient clinic. It helped to reduce roughly 1/4 (febrile) and 1/5(nonfebrile) of total numbers of the patients in the outpatient clinic during the peak period of the epidemic. If calculated according to the actual free-of-charge condition, the ICER was -64.7 yuans/person-time. If the actual cost of each consultant of telemedicine service was estimated according to the level of outpatient-service fee, the ICER was -5.5 yuans/person-time. The results of sensitivity analysis showed that the main factors affecting the ICERs were transportation cost, lost wages, and the efficiency of telemedicine services. Conclusions Launching telemedicine services helped to relieve the pressure at the outpatient clinics, and has the potential to provide significant cost saving compared to conventional clinic services for outpatients.

RNA-seq analysis revealed that ZIKV infection alters several and diverse biological processes, including stress, locomotion, lipid metabolism, imaginal disc morphogenesis and regulation of JAK/STAT signaling. To explore the interaction between ZIKV infection and JAK/STAT signaling regulation, we generated genetic constructs overexpressing ZIKV-specific non-structural proteins NS2A, NS2B, NS4A and NS4B. We found that ectopic expression of non-structural proteins in the developing Drosophila eye significantly restricts growth of the larval and adult eye and correlates with considerable repression of the in vivo JAK/STAT reporter, 10XStat92E-GFP. At the cellular level, eye growth defects are associated with reduced rate of proliferation without affecting the overall rate of apoptosis. In addition, ZIKV NS4A genetically interacts with the JAK/STAT signaling components; co-expression of NS4A along with the dominant-negative form of domeless or StatRNAi results in aggravated reduction in eye size, while co-expression of NS4A in HopTuml (also known as hop(Tum)) mutant background partially rescues the hop-induced eye overgrowth phenotype. The function of ZIKV NS4A in regulating growth is maintained in the wing, where ZIKV NS4A overexpression in the pouch domain results in reduced growth linked with diminished expression of Notch targets, Wingless (Wg) and Cut, and the Notch reporter, NRE-GFP. Thus, our study provides evidence that ZIKV infection in Drosophila results in restricted growth of the developing eye and wing, wherein eye phenotype is induced through regulation of JAK/STAT signaling, whereas restricted wing growth is induced through regulation of Notch signaling. The interaction of ZIKV non-structural proteins with the conserved host signaling pathways further advance our understanding of ZIKV-induced pathogenesis.

Pharmacological inhibition of the 3C-like3 protease has revealed remarkable reduction in hospitalization and death in phase 2/3 clinical studies.

We capture targets of the 3CL protease described previously for SARS-CoV, and we identify hundreds of new putative targets. We experimentally validate a number of these predicted targets, including the giant sarcomeric protein Obscurin, and show that expression of 3CL protease alone recapitulates the sarcomeric disorganization seen by SARS-CoV-2 infection of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.

Multiplication of HRVs occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell. To produce infection, HRVs must first attach to specific cellular receptors embedded in the plasma membrane. Ninety percent of HRVs immunogenic variants use as receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a cell surface glycoprotein that promotes intercellular signaling in processes derived from inflammation response. As HRV receptor, ICAM-1 positions the virus to within striking distance of the membrane, and then triggers a conformational change in the virus that ultimately results in delivery of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm, across a lipid bilayer. The interaction between ICAM-1 and HRVs has been analyzed by the combination of crystal structures of HRVs and ICAM-1 fragments with electron microscopy reconstructions of the complexes. The resulting molecular models are useful to address questions about receptor recognition, binding specificity, and mechanisms by which ICAM-1 induces virus uncoating.","output":"ICAM-1 receptors and cold viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Opioid-related overdose deaths have increased almost 30% in the US since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

Yet implementation considerations have not been adequately addressed when developing interventions for this context. The aim of this paper is to present a protocol for a scoping review of existing implementation frameworks that might guide SLCN intervention research in schools. Methods: In accordance with scoping review guidelines, the proposed study will be conducted in phases: (1) identifying potentially relevant studies, (2) screening and selection of studies, (3) charting and extracting data from identified frameworks, (4) collating, summarising and reporting the results and (5) consulting with stakeholders. Two reviewers will conduct the screening and the data extraction phases independently. Identified frameworks will be collated, and described, and constructs from the frameworks will be categorised using domains from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. A draft implementation science model will be proposed based on the findings of the scoping review. Conclusions: The findings of this review will provide guidance for researchers to begin to address implementation considerations when developing and facilitating the uptake of universal interventions for SLCN in the ordinary classroom, and ultimately can contribute towards improving outcomes for this vulnerable childhood population.","output":"Addressing implementation considerations when developing universal interventions for speech, language and communication needs in the ordinary classroom: a protocol for a scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has infected more than 79 million individuals, with 1.7 million deaths worldwide. Several countries have implemented social distancing and testing policies with contact tracing as a measure to flatten the curve of the ongoing pandemic. Optimizing these control measures is urgent given the substantial societal and economic impacts associated with infection and interventions. To determine the optimal social distancing and testing strategies, we developed a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission and applied optimal control theory, identifying the best approach to reduce the epidemiological burden of COVID-19 at a minimal cost. The results demonstrate that testing as a standalone optimal strategy does not have a significant effect on the final size of an epidemic, but it would delay the peak of the pandemic. If social distancing is the sole control strategy, it would be optimal to gradually increase the level of social distancing as the incidence curve of COVID-19 grows, and relax the measures after the curve has reached its peak. Compared with a single strategy, combined social distancing and testing strategies are demonstrated to be more efficient at reducing the disease burden, and they can delay the peak of the disease. To optimize these strategies, testing should be maintained at a maximum level in the early phases and after the peak of the epidemic, whereas social distancing should be intensified when the prevalence of the disease is greater than 15%. Accordingly, public health agencies should implement early testing and switch to social distancing when the incidence level begins to increase. After the peak of the pandemic, it would be optimal to gradually relax social distancing and switch back to testing.","output":"Optimal strategies for social distancing and testing to control COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kv7 channels (Kv7.1-7.5) are voltage-gated K+ channels that can be modulated by five ?-subunits (KCNE1-5). Kv7.1-KCNE1 channels produce the slow-delayed rectifying K+ current, IKs, which is important during the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. Kv7.2-7.5 are predominantly neuronally expressed and constitute the muscarinic M-current and control the resting membrane potential in neurons. Kv7.1 produces drastically different currents as a result of modulation by KCNE subunits. This flexibility allows the Kv7.1 channel to have many roles depending on location and assembly partners. The pharmacological sensitivity of Kv7.1 channels differs from that of Kv7.2-7.5 and is largely dependent upon the number of ?-subunits present in the channel complex. As a result, the development of pharmaceuticals targeting Kv7.1 is problematic. This review discusses the roles and the mechanisms by which different signaling pathways affect Kv7.1 and KCNE channels and could potentially provide different ways of targeting the channel.

This pathogenic virus has been identified in swabs performed on the throat and nose of patients who suffer from or are suspected of the disease. When COVID-19 infect the upper and lower respiratory tract it can cause mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-6. The binding of COVID-19 to the Toll Like Receptor (TLR) causes the release of pro-IL-1b which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature IL-1b which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis. Suppression of pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members and IL-6 have been shown to have a therapeutic effect in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections. Cytokine IL-37 has the ability to suppress innate and acquired immune response and also has the capacity to inhibit inflammation by acting on IL-18Ra receptor. IL-37 performs its immunosuppressive activity by acting on mTOR and increasing the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) kinase. This cytokine inhibits class II histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and inflammation in inflammatory diseases by suppressing MyD88 and subsequently IL-1, IL-6, TNF and CCL2. The suppression of IL-1b by IL-37 in inflammatory state induced by COVID-19 can have a new therapeutic effect previously unknown. Another inhibitory cytokine is IL-38, the newest cytokine of the IL-1 family members, produced by several immune cells including B cells and macrophages. IL-38 is also a suppressor cytokine which inhibits IL-1b and other pro-inflammatory IL-family members. IL-38 is a potential therapeutic cytokine which inhibits inflammation in viral infections including that caused by COVID-19, providing a new relevant strategy.","output":"Induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and IL-6) and lung inflammation by COVID-19: anti-inflammatory strategies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has affected the functioning and capacity of healthcare systems worldwide.

On a subset of the subjects that underwent bronchoscopy, we also quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral load, analyzed the microbiome of the lower airways by metagenome and metatranscriptome analyses and profiled the host immune response. We found that isolation of a hospital-acquired respiratory pathogen was not associated with fatal outcome. However, poor clinical outcome was associated with enrichment of the lower airway microbiota with an oral commensal (Mycoplasma salivarium), while high SARS-CoV-2 viral burden, poor anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response, together with a unique host transcriptome profile of the lower airways were most predictive of mortality.

New York City (NYC) represents a unique opportunity to examine the epidemiologic association between the two given the variable regional distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in its highly diverse neighborhoods. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between OHSD and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic burden during the first COVID-19 pandemic across the highly diverse neighborhoods of NYC. METHODS: The incidences of OHSD between March 20 and April 22, 2019, and between March 20 and April 22, 2020, as reported by the Fire Department of New York were obtained. As a surrogate for viral epidemiologic burden, we used percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests performed between March 3 and August 20, 2020. Data were reported separately for the 176 zip codes of NYC. Correlation analysis and regression analysis were performed between the 2 measures to examine association. RESULTS: Incidence of OHSD per 10,000 inhabitants and percentage of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion were highly variable across NYC neighborhoods, varying from 0.0 to 22.9 and 12.4% to 50.9%, respectively. Correlation analysis showed a moderate positive correlation between neighborhood data on OHSD and percentage of positive antibody tests to SARS-CoV-2 (Spearman  0.506; P <.001). Regression analysis showed that seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 and OHSD in 2019 were independent predictors for OHSD during the first epidemic surge in NYC (R(2) = 0.645). CONCLUSION: The association in geographic distribution between OHSD and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic burden suggests either a causality between the 2 syndromes or the presence of local determinants affecting both measures in a similar fashion.","output":"Association between regional distributions of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and out-of-hospital sudden death during the first epidemic outbreak in New York"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal complications of COVID\\\\19 have been reported over the last year.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety, efficacy and effect of the intramuscular administration of polymerized type I collagen (PTIC) on hyperinflammation, oxygen saturation and symptom improvement in adult outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19. DESIGN Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial of PTIC vs placebo. SETTING Single Third-level hospital in Mexico City (Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran) PARTICIPANTS Eighty-nine adult participants with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and symptom onset within the 7 days preceding recruitment were included from August 31, 2020 to November 7, 2020 and followed for 12 weeks. Final date of follow-up was February 4, 2021. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1.5 ml of PTIC intramuscularly every 12 h for 3 days and then every 24 h for 4 days (n=45), or matching placebo (n=44). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a mean reduction of at least 50% in the level of IP-10 compared to baseline. The secondary outcomes were mean oxygen saturation >92% while breathing ambient air and duration of symptoms. RESULTS Of 89 patients who were randomised, 87 (97.8%) were included in an intention-to-treat analysis; 37 (41.6%) were male and mean age was 48.5+/-14.0 years. The IP-10 levels decreased 75% in the PTIC group and 40% in the placebo group vs baseline. The comparison between treatment vs placebo was also statistically significant (P=0.0047). The IL-8 (44%, P=0.045), M-CSF (25%, P=0.041) and IL-1Ra (36%, P=0.05) levels were also decreased in the PTIC group vs baseline. Mean oxygen saturation >92% was achieved by 40/44 (90%), 41/42 (98%) and 40/40 (100%) of participants that received PTIC at 8, 15 and 97 days of follow-up vs 29/43 (67%), 31/39 (80%) and 33/37 (89%) of patients treated with placebo (P=0.001). The unadjusted accelerated failure time model showed that patients treated with PTIC achieved the primary outcome 2.70-fold faster (P<0.0001) than placebo. In terms of risk, the group of patients treated with PTIC had a 63% lower risk of having a mean oxygen saturation <92% vs placebo (P<0.0001). Symptom duration in patients treated with PTIC was reduced by 6.1+/-3.2 days vs placebo. No differences in adverse effects were observed between the groups at 8, 15 and 97 days of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In this study, treatment with PTIC down-regulated IP-10, IL-8, M-CSF and IL-Ra levels, which could explain the PTIC effect on the higher proportion of patients with mean oxygen saturation readings > 92% and a shorter duration of symptoms as compared to patients treated with placebo.

The current study aims to identify potential small molecule inhibitors against the main protease protein of SARS-CoV-2 by the computational approach. MAIN METHODS: In this study, a virtual screening procedure employing docking of the two different datasets from the ZINC database, including 1615 FDA approved drugs and 4266 world approved drugs were used to identify new potential small molecule inhibitors for the newly released crystal structure of main protease protein of SARS-CoV-2. In the following to validate the docking result, molecular dynamics simulations were applied on selected ligands to identify the behavior and stability of them in the binding pocket of the main protease in 150 nanoseconds (ns). Furthermore, binding energy using the MMPBSA approach was also calculated. KEY FINDINGS: The result indicates that simeprevir (Hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and pyronaridine (antimalarial agent) could fit well to the binding pocket of the main protease and because of some other beneficial features including broad-spectrum antiviral properties and ADME profile, they might be a promising drug candidate for repurposing to the treatment of COVID-19.

While some HCWs and paramedics may reflect these characteristics, many may not. Such heroic narratives can be damaging, stifling meaningful discussion around limits to duties, failing to acknowledge the importance of reciprocity and potentially imposing demands on paramedics and HCWs to be heroic.

We have previously shown that vaccines made of a polymeric glyco-adjuvant conjugated to an antigen were effective in triggering such a response in other disease models and hypothesized that the technology could be adapted to create an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The core of the vaccine platform is the copolymer p(Man-TLR7), composed of monomers with pendant mannose or a toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist. Thus, p(Man-TLR7) is designed to target relevant antigen-presenting cells (APCs) via mannose-binding receptors and then activate TLR7 upon endocytosis. The p(Man-TLR7) construct is amenable to conjugation to protein antigens such as the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, yielding Spike-p(Man-TLR7). Here, we demonstrate Spike-p(Man-TLR7) vaccination elicits robust antigen-specific cellular and humoral responses in mice. In adult and elderly wild-type mice, vaccination with Spike-p(Man-TLR7) generates high and long-lasting titers of anti-Spike IgGs, with neutralizing titers exceeding levels in convalescent human serum. Interestingly, adsorbing Spike-p(Man-TLR7) to the depot-forming adjuvant alum amplified the broadly neutralizing humoral responses to levels matching those in mice vaccinated with formulations based off of clinically-approved adjuvants. Additionally, we observed an increase in germinal center B cells, antigen-specific antibody secreting cells, activated T follicular helper cells, and polyfunctional Th1-cytokine producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells.

The outbreak was traced to a seafood wholesale market and human to human transmission was confirmed. The rapid spread and the death toll of the new epidemic warrants immediate intervention. The intra-host genomic variability of SARS-CoV-2 plays a pivotal role in the development of effective antiviral agents and vaccines, as well as in the design of accurate diagnostics. We analyzed NGS data derived from clinical samples of three Chinese patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, in order to identify small- and large-scale intra-host variations in the viral genome. We identified tens of low- or higher- frequency single nucleotide variations (SNVs) with variable density across the viral genome, affecting 7 out of 10 protein-coding viral genes. The majority of these SNVs (72/104) corresponded to missense changes. The annotation of the identified SNVs but also of all currently circulating strain variations revealed colocalization of intra-host as well as strain specific SNVs with primers and probes currently used in molecular diagnostics assays. Moreover, we de-novo assembled the viral genome, in order to isolate and validate intra-host structural variations and recombination breakpoints. The bioinformatics analysis disclosed genomic rearrangements over poly-A / poly-U regions located in ORF1ab and spike (S) gene, including a potential recombination hot-spot within S gene. Our results highlight the intra-host genomic diversity and plasticity of SARS-CoV-2, pointing out genomic regions that are prone to alterations. The isolated SNVs and genomic rearrangements reflect the intra-patient capacity of the polymorphic quasispecies, which may arise rapidly during the outbreak, allowing immunological escape of the virus, offering resistance to anti-viral drugs and affecting the sensitivity of the molecular diagnostics assays.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 exhibits intra-host genomic plasticity and low-frequency polymorphic quasispecies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The surging COVID19 pandemic has underlined the need for quick, sensitive, and high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 detection assays.

Feasibility of the assay and analytical sensitivity was first determined by testing a dilution series of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA in two different solvents (water and AMIES VTM), revealing a high degree of linearity and robustness in fluorescence readouts. Following analytical performance using synthetic RNA, the limit of detection was determined at equal to or less than 1 SARS-CoV-2 copy/ul of sample in a commercially available sample panel that contains surrogate clinical samples with varying SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Lastly, we benchmarked our method against a reference qPCR method by testing 87 nasopharyngeal swab samples. The direct endpoint ultra-fast RT-PCR method exhibited a positive percent agreement score of 98.5% and a negative percent agreement score of 100% as compared to the reference method, while RT-PCR cycling was completed in 27 minutes/sample as opposed to 60 minutes/sample in the reference qPCR method. In summary, we describe a rapid direct RT-PCR method to detect SARS-CoV-2 material in clinical specimens which can be completed in significantly less time as compared to conventional RT-PCR methods, making it an attractive option for large-scale SARS-CoV-2 screening applications.","output":"Ultrafast RNA extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 detection by direct RT-PCR using a rapid thermal cycling approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/Aims In 2017 an audit and survey of giant-cell arteritis (GCA) services were conducted across northwest England (reported previously). This re-survey in 2020, following publication of revised BSR guidance, sought to identify what changes were made in the intervening period, and provided the opportunity to assess the impact of COVID-19. Methods Rheumatologists from 16 hospitals in northwest England were invited to complete a survey in July 2020. Questions focused on service provision for GCA, including pathways, diagnostics and steroid prescription. Results Responses were received from 14/16 sites in 2017, and 15/16 in 2020. 9/15 (60%) sites reported that the 2017 audit and survey prompted changes to GCA services, with two (13%) stating that it clarified the need for implementation of existing plans. Two sites had a GCA pathway in 2017. Four of the seven sites who committed to introducing one have now done so, bringing the total in 2020 to six. Eight of the nine remaining sites plan to implement one, six with a specific date within six months. Six (40%) have completed additional local audit/QI since 2017. Temporal artery (TA) ultrasound (US) is now available in an additional four sites, bringing the total to 6/15 (40%) in 2020. Two sites reported improvement in both time between first rheumatology consultation and TA biopsy, and time to receive results (now <7 days for each task in 6/15 (40%)). Six additional sites reported providing leaflets on steroids routinely, bringing the total in 2020 to 12/15 (80%), versus 6/14 (43%) previously. Four sites (27%) now have a database of GCA patients (one in 2017). There was no major change in sites having a standard protocol for steroid taper (n = 8 2017; n = 7 2020, 89% and 100% of whom respectively use BSR guidance), nor in the number of patients routinely provided steroid cards (six in 2017; five in 2020). The three sites who do not report giving leaflets on steroids routinely, all had a pathway. 8/15 (53%) reported COVID-19 having an adverse effect upon services, including: reduced access to diagnostics (n = 7: TA US, biopsy, and PET-CT); delayed appointments (n = 4); delayed referrals (n = 3). The tertiary referral centre reported an improvement because access to tocilizumab was facilitated by a relaxation of rules by NHS England. Conclusion The original audit and survey of current GCA practice in 2017 highlighted areas for improvement for each site, and regionally. Sites contributing to this re-survey report that the exercise stimulated them to improve their current care. The 2017 exercise showed a strong correlation between reported practice (survey) and actual practice (audit), leading us to have confidence that responses provided a true picture of care.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the radiographic and clinical outcomes of patients undergoing TLIF using PEEK-Ti-HA cages with a particular focus on fusion rate. METHODS: A prospective and nonrandomized study was conducted to compare the outcomes of PEEK-Ti-HA cages (group A, n = 32) and uncoated PEEK cages (group B, n = 32). The follow up time was at least 2 years. The radiographic assessments included the regional lordosis (RL), disc height (DH), and fusion rate. The clinical indexes included the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scores and visual analog scale (VAS) scores (back and leg). RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the pre- and postoperative RL and DH between Group A and Group B. And RL and DH, even if there were any variance initially, were restored not long after surgery in both groups. Though Group A had a significantly higher fusion rate than group B at 3 months post-surgery (93.7% vs. 75.0%), the fusion rates for the two groups reached the same level (100%) when it comes to the final follow-up. Additionally, differences of VAS and JOA scores for the two groups in general approximate. CONCLUSIONS: PEEK-Ti-HA cages, in contrast with uncoated PEEK cages, produced a better fusion rate at 3 months after single-level TLIF. The fusion rates of both groups could get 100% at the final follow-up.

Many institutions were in a weak financial position before the pandemic and are now facing a massive cash-flow crisis. These difficulties could permanently decrease the demand for higher education places. The pandemic has crystallised pre-existing concerns that there is something awry with the product and services universities offer, and how the system is run and financed. The UK higher education policy has been heading in the wrong direction since the mid-1980s, and there is no evidence that the UKs economic performance has been elevated by the expansion in the number of graduates. On the contrary, it has led to overextension, increased financial fragility, and a system that fails to meet labour market needs. These problems cannot be resolved by a continuation or expansion of previous policies;instead, wholesale reform may be required. Different kinds of institutions could be recognised and encouraged, and they could be organised in different ways, with different kinds of funding and missions. If calls for a bailout are resisted, universities will not be able to continue as before. Moving their funding out of current government spending could give them greater independence and responsibility. Ultimately, there is a case for stopping the use of higher education as a validation device for employers.

One year after it became a pandemic, the current COVID-19 situation in Brazil is an example of how the impacts of a pandemic are beyond health outcomes and how health, social, and political actions are intertwined. Objectives: We aimed to provide an overview of the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, from a social and political point of view, and to discuss the perspectives from now on. Methods: This is a narrative review using official, scientific (PubMed, Medline, and SciELO databases) and publicly available data. Press articles were also used that contain important information not found in these databases. Findings: We address the impacts of COVID-19 in different regions of Brazil, on indigenous populations, health care workers, and how internal social contrasts impacted the pandemics advance across the country. We also discuss key points that culminated in the countrys failed management of the COVID-19 spread, such as poor management of the public health care system, disparities between public and private health care infrastructure, lack of mass testing and viral spread tracking, lack of preparedness and planning to implement strict isolation and social distancing measures, and, most importantly, political instability, a deteriorating Health Ministry and sabotaging attitudes of the countrys president, including anti-scientific actions, underplaying COVID-19 severity, spreading and powering fake news about the pandemic, promoting knowingly inefficient medications for COVID-19 treatment, and interference in collective health policies, including the countrys vaccination plan. Conclusions: After one year of COVID-19 and a disastrous management of the disease, Brazil has more than 11 million cases, 270,000 deaths, and the highest number of daily deaths due to COVID-19 in the world, most of which could have been avoided and can be credited to negligence of municipal, state, and federal authorities, especially President Jair Messias Bolsonaro. Unfortunately, the country is an example of what not to do in a pandemic setting. Key Points: One year after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, Brazil had the second higher number of cases and deaths, and the highest number of daily deaths due to the disease. Lack of massive testing, non-stringent and ineffective collective health policies, poor management of the public health care system, and political instability were the main drivers of the countrys flawed management of the COVID-19 advancement. Anti-science and sabotaging actions by government had a pivotal role in the countrys current situation. Brazil has a large territory and is marked by social contrasts among different regions and states, which showed contrasting data regarding the impact caused by COVID-19.

The model includes national-level climate damages from rising temperatures and sea levels for 180 countries, calibrated on detailed econometric evidence and simulation modeling. Collectively, climate tipping points increase the social cost of carbon (SCC) by a??25% in our main specification. The distribution is positively skewed, however. We estimate an a??10% chance of climate tipping points more than doubling the SCC. Accordingly, climate tipping points increase global economic risk. A spatial analysis shows that they increase economic losses almost everywhere. The tipping points with the largest effects are dissociation of ocean methane hydrates and thawing permafrost. Most of our numbers are probable underestimates, given that some tipping points, tipping point interactions, and impact channels have not been covered in the literature so far; however, our method of structural meta-analysis means that future modeling of climate tipping points can be integrated with relative ease, and we present a reduced-form tipping points damage function that could be incorporated in other IAMs.","output":"Economic impacts of tipping points in the climate system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nursing homes (NHs) are an important site of death for residents with advanced dementia.

The intent recognizer can be used first to classify the users utterance into one of several predefined classes (intents) that help to understand the users current goal. Then, the most adequate response can be provided accordingly. Intent recognizers also often appear as a form of joint models for performing the natural language understanding and dialog management tasks together as a single process, thus simplifying the set of problems that a conversational system must solve. This happens to be especially true for frequently asked question (FAQ) conversational systems. In this work, we first present an exploratory analysis in which different deep learning (DL) models for intent detection and classification were evaluated. In particular, we experimentally compare and analyze conventional recurrent neural networks (RNN) and state-of-the-art transformer models. Our experiments confirmed that best performance is achieved by using transformers. Specifically, best performance was achieved by fine-tuning the so-called BETO model (a Spanish pretrained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model from the Universidad de Chile) in our intent detection task. Then, as the main contribution of the paper, we analyze the effect of inserting unseen domain words to extend the vocabulary of the model as part of the fine-tuning or domain-adaptation process. Particularly, a very simple word frequency cut-off strategy is experimentally shown to be a suitable method for driving the vocabulary learning decisions over unseen words. The results of our analysis show that the proposed method helps to effectively extend the original vocabulary of the pretrained models.

The paper begins by contrasting measures of the scale of job loss during the crisis.

Focusing only on a subset of vulnerable job losers, the potential lifetime earnings losses from job loss related to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic are predicted to be up to $2 trillion. Related losses in employment could imply a lasting reduction in the overall employmentCpopulation ratio. For these workers, losses in potential life years could be up to 24 million. Even at the low range, the resulting estimates are substantially larger than losses in potential life years from deaths directly due to COVID\\\\19.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a self\\\\efficacy theoryCbased health information technology intervention implemented through blood control and patient self\\\\management. DESIGN: A clinical randomized waitlist\\\\controlled trial. METHODS: The study was conducted at a medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. A total of 60 subjects were randomly assigned to either the immediate intervention (experimental) group or the waitlist control group. The primary endpoint was systolic blood pressure at 3 months; secondary end points included self\\\\management behavior and QOL. Treatment for the immediate intervention group lasted 3 months, while the waitlist control group received routine care for the first 3 months, at which point they crossed over to the intervention arm and received the same intervention as the experimental group for another 3 months. Both groups were evaluated by questionnaires and physiological measurements at both 3 and 6 months postadmission. The results were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure significantly improved for the intervention group participants at 3 months, when there was also significant improvement in self\\\\management behavior and QOL. There was no significant or appreciable effect of time spent in the waitlist condition, with treatments in the two conditions being similarly effective. CONCLUSION: The use of a theory\\\\based health information technology treatment compared with usual care resulted in a significant improvement in systolic blood pressure, self\\\\management behavior, and QOL in patients with coronary artery disease.

To help identify innovative solutions needed to resolve bottlenecks hampering the culture of this species, it is important to generate genetic and genomic resources. Towards this aim, we have produced the most complete publicly available P. monodon transcriptome database to date based on nine adult tissues and eight early life-history stages (BUSCO - Complete: 98.2% [Duplicated: 51.3%], Fragmented: 0.8%, Missing: 1.0%).

While annotation rates were low (approximately 30%), as is typical for a non-model organisms, annotated transcript clusters were successfully mapped to several hundred functional KEGG pathways. Transcripts were clustered into groups within tissues and early life-history stages, providing initial evidence for their roles in specific tissue functions, or developmental transitions.

METHODS: Characteristics of consultations, patients, and drug prescriptions were analysed. Joinpoint models were used to identify changes in the weekly trend of consultations. RESULTS: During the 2020 lockdown the overall number of HED consultations for schizophrenia decreased by 40.7% and after the lockdown by 12.2% compared with 2019. No difference was found in the proportion of consultations that led to GHPU admissions or compulsory admissions. Suicidality rates did not differ across the two years, with the exception of ideations and plans (+5.9%) during the post-lockdown period. We found an increase in benzodiazepine prescriptions in 2020 during the lockdown and post-lockdown periods (+10.6% and +20.8%, respectively), and a decrease of prescriptions for short-acting sedative agents in the post-lockdown period (-7.9%). An increase in the weekly trend of consultations occurred from March 11-17 (week 11) to June 26-June 30 (week 26). As a result, the initial gap in the number of consultations between the two years cancelled out at the end of June. CONCLUSIONS: HED consultation rate for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders declined consistent with that of other psychiatric disorders.

CC commonly observed include myocarditis/myocardial injury, arrhythmias and heart failure, with an incidence reaching about a quarter of hospitalized patients in some reports. The increased incidence of CC raise questions about the possible heightened susceptibility of patients with cardiac disease to develop severe COVID-19, and whether the virus itself is involved in the pathogenesis of CC. The wide array of CC seems to stem from multiple mechanisms, including the ability of the virus to directly enter cardiomyocytes, and to indirectly damage the heart through systemic hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states, endothelial injury of the coronary arteries and hypoxemia. The induced CC seem to dramatically impact the prognosis of COVID-19, with some studies suggesting over 50% mortality rates with myocardial damage, up from ~ 5% overall mortality of COVID-19 alone. Thus, it is particularly important to investigate the relation between COVID-19 and heart disease, given the major effect on morbidity and mortality, aiming at early detection and improving patient care and outcomes.

In this process, young people began to experience some mental problems due to the fear of contagion, as well as some changes in their lifestyles. AIMS In this study it is aimed to investigate anxiety and depression levels of medical school students and the factors associated with these mental problems. METHOD The forms were sent over the internet to the officials responsible for medical education at universities in various regions of Turkey. A total of 2,778 medical faculty students were included in the study. Students were asked to fill out the sociodemographic data form, the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) Test. RESULTS Students' 67.3% were female and 31.7% were male. About 90.2% of the students in the PHQ-9 scale had depressive symptoms in the major depressive disorder (MDD) dimension, and 44.5% in the GAD-7 scale had moderate/severe anxiety symptoms. Gender, being a preclinical student, history of psychiatric treatment in the past, currently receiving psychiatric treatment, death of someone due to pandemic, economic and health situation, perception of mental health were found associated with MDD and Moderate/Severe Anxiety symptoms. Students with Anxiety and MDD reported significantly more anxiety about contamination and negative beliefs about precautions' sufficiency. CONCLUSIONS It was determined that medical school students in our country showed anxiety and depression at a remarkable level during the pandemic. Examining the underlying causes of these high rates will be beneficial in terms of taking precautions during the long-term pandemic.

Based on fortifying self-determination theory, this research answered the question to what extent proactive personality moderates the relationship between work uncertainty and PWB and strengthens the relationship between entrepreneurial leadership and PWB. To empirically examine the studys underlying theoretical framework, respondents were selected from SMEs working in Pakistan from the high-tech industry. Multisource data were accumulated from 420 workers and their leaders utilizing a two-wave, time-lagged research design. Conclusions revealed that entrepreneurial leadership first reduced individuals work uncertainty, which in turn, led to enhanced proactive work behaviour of employees. Furthermore, the results revealed that work uncertainty mediates the relationship between entrepreneurial leadership and proactive work behaviour. Moreover, proactive personality moderates the link concerning work uncertainty and proactive work behaviour, such that this association is significant only when proactive personality is low.

There is also production of hypersaline waters from oil-polluted ecosystems which contain toxic hydrophobic pollutants that are threat to public health, environmental protection, and sustainability. Currently, innovative advances are being proposed for the remediation of oil-contaminated hypersaline regions. Such advancements include the exploration and stimulation of native microbial communities capable of utilizing and degrading petroleum hydrocarbons. However, prevailing salinity in these environments is unfavourable for the growth of non-halophylic microorganisms, thus limiting effective bioremediation options. An in-depth understanding of the potentials of various remediation technologies of hydrocarbon-polluted hypersaline environments is lacking. Thus, we present an overview of petroleum hydrocarbon pollution in hypersaline ecosystems and discuss the challenges and prospects associated with several technologies that may be employed in remediation of hydrocarbon pollution in the presence of delimiting high salinities. The application of biological remediation technologies including the utilization of halophilic and halotolerant microorganisms is also discussed.","output":"Prospects in the bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbon contaminants from hypersaline environments: A review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: On May 11, the Dutch Government allowed 26 nursing homes to welcome 1 visitor per resident, after 2 months of lockdown. The study aimed to monitor in-depth the feasibility of the regulations and their impact on the well-being of residents, their visitors, and healthcare staff. DESIGN: Mixed-methods study in 5 of the 26 facilities; the facilities were affiliated to an academic network of nursing homes. PARTICIPANTS: Visitors and healthcare professionals. INTERVENTION: Allowing visitors using local regulations based on national guidelines. MEASUREMENTS: Digital questionnaire, analyzing documentation such as infection prevention control protocols, attending meetings of COVID-19 crisis teams, in-depth telephone or in-person interviews with visitors and healthcare professionals, and on-site observations. RESULTS: National guidelines were translated with great variety into local care practice. Healthcare professionals agreed that reopening would increase the well-being of the residents and their loved ones. However, there were also great worries for increasing workload, increasing the risk of emotional exhaustion, and the risk of COVID-19 infections. Compliance with local regulations was generally satisfactory, but maintaining social distance and correctly wearing face masks appeared to be difficult. Care staff remained ambivalent for fear of infections. In general, allowing visitors was experienced as having a positive impact on the well-being of all stakeholders. Nevertheless, some residents with dementia showed negative effects. CONCLUSION: The complete lockdown of Dutch nursing homes had a substantial impact on the well-being of the residents. The reopening was welcomed by all stakeholders, but provided a high organizational workload as well as feelings of ambivalence among care staff. In the second wave, a more tailored approach is being implemented. However, facilities are sometimes still struggling to find the right balance between infection control and well-being.","output":"Reopening the doors of Dutch nursing homes during the COVID-19 crisis: results of an in-depth monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seven coronavirus (CoV) species are known human pathogens: the epidemic viruses SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV and those continuously circulating in human populations since initial isolation: HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63. All have associations with human central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. In infants and young children, the most common CNS phenomena are febrile seizures; in adults, non-focal abnormalities that may be either neurologic or constitutional. Neurotropism and neurovirulence are dependent in part on CNS expression of cell surface receptors mediating viral entry, and host immune response. In adults, CNS receptors for epidemic viruses are largely expressed on brain vasculature, whereas receptors for less pathogenic viruses are present in vasculature, brain parenchyma, and olfactory neuroepithelium, dependent upon viral species. Human coronaviruses can infect circulating mononuclear cells, but meningoencephalitis is rare. Well-documented human neuropathologies are infrequent and, for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, can entail cerebrovascular accidents originating extrinsically to brain. There is evidence of neuronal infection in the absence of inflammatory infiltrates with SARS-CoV, and CSF studies of rare patients with seizures have demonstrated virus but no pleocytosis. In contrast to human disease, animal models of neuropathogenesis are well developed, and pathologies including demyelination, neuronal necrosis, and meningoencephalitis are seen with both native CoVs as well as human CoVs inoculated into nasal cavities or brain.

Understanding hesitancy towards immunization is even more important nowadays, with the continuous threat of COVID-19 pandemic. Medical conspiracy beliefs, scientific skepticism, as well as low trust in governmental institutions, and evidence-based knowledge all have troubling effects on immunization. OBJECTIVE: To examine how these factors cross-react to influence vaccine behavior against any vaccine preventable disease (VPD), we hypothesized a model consisting of the belief in conspiracy theories as the predictor, and as the mediators subjective and objective vaccine knowledge, and trust in the health care system and science. The model was tested by examining the vaccine intentions for the children and self for any VPD. METHODS: Two separate studies were conducted on the representative samples of Serbian population; the first study investigated the intentions for child vaccination and the second study examined the vaccine intentions against any VPD, including adult vaccination. We used path analysis followed by logistic regression to analyze the data. RESULTS: The results revealed high vaccine hesitancy motivated by the belief in the vaccine conspiracy theories, through its effect on reduced trust in medical science and institutions, and low objective vaccine knowledge.

Chronic metabolic diseases are known risk factors for increased mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In turn, COVID pandemics imposed sudden changes in lifestyle and social isolation with consequent potential cardiometabolic sequelae. The present study aimed at investigating the impact of changes in lifestyle and social life on metabolic profile in hyperprolactinemic or osteoporotic patients without pre-existing cardiometabolic diseases at the time of COVID-19. METHODS: The primary study outcome measurement was the prevalence of obesity, arterial hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome after COVID-19 outbreak. Seventy-four patients (21 men and 53 women, aged 51.8  17.8 years) were admitted to the outpatient clinic of the Neuroendocrine Disease Unit at University \\"Federico II\\" of Naples, Italy, as per their routine clinical practice because of tumoral and non-tumoral hyperprolactinemia in 52 patients (70.3%), and osteoporosis/osteopenia in 22 (29.7%).

Over the following 6 months, it was interpolated by manifestations of popular disapproval to the actual political regimewith multiple protests sprouting throughout the country. Large social gatherings seeded novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) variants in big cities and propagated their facile spread, leading to increased rates of hospitalizations and deaths. METHODS: In this article, we evaluate the effective reproduction number (Rt) dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Cali, Colombia, between 4 April 2021 and 31 July 2021 based on the analysis of 228 genomes. RESULTS: Our results showed clear contrast in Rt values between the period of frequent protests (Rt > 1), and the preceding and following months (Rt < 1). Genomic analyses revealed 16 circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages during the initial periodincluding variants of concern (VOCs) (Alpha, Gamma, and Delta) and variants of interest (VOIs) (Lambda and Mu). Furthermore, we noticed the Mu variant dominating the COVID-19 distribution schema as the months progressed. We identified four principal clusters through phylogenomic analyseseach one of potentially independent introduction to the city. Two of these were associated with the Mu variant, one associated with the Gamma variant, and one with the Lambda variant. CONCLUSION: Our results chronicle the impact of large group assemblies on the epidemiology of COVID-19 during this intersection of political turmoil and sanitary crisis in Cali, Colombia.

The cell line was isolated from the dorsal fin, named as rabbit fish fin (RFF) cell line, and which was sub-cultured for 50 cycles since the development. This cell line was tested for growth in different temperatures and serum concentrations, and the best growing condition was at 20% serum at 28 C. In cultured RFF cells, amplification of 18S rRNA from genomic DNA and immunostaining of cellular cytokeratin confirmed the proper identity of S. fuscescens fish. After 30th passage of cultures, the cells were exposed to challenge of inflammation, triggered by LPS, and hypoxia, mimicked by CoCl(2). Cultured RFF cells showed robust sensitive responses to inflammation and hypoxia in directing the expressions of cytokines and hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). The water extract of aerial part of Scutellaria baicalensis (SBA) has been shown in rabbit fish to prevent inflammation. Here, we extended this notion of testing the efficacy of SBA extract in the developed cultured RFF cells. Application of SBA extract inhibited the expression of LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines, i.e. IL-1, IL-6, as well as the signaling of NF-B. The application of CoCl(2) in cultured RFF cells triggered the hypoxia-induced cell death and up regulation of HIF-1. As expected, applied SBA extract in the cultures prevented the hypoxia-induced signaling.

To investigate potential changes in the oligomerization of virion-associated envelope proteins, we performed SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions but without thermal denaturation. This revealed the presence of SDS-resistant trimers of E1 in the context of cell-cultured HCV (HCVcc) as well as in the context of HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp). The formation of E1 trimers was found to depend on the coexpression of E2. To further understand the origin of E1 trimer formation, we coexpressed in bacteria the transmembrane (TM) domains of E1 (TME1) and E2 (TME2) fused to reporter proteins and analyzed the fusion proteins by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As expected for strongly interacting TM domains, TME1-TME2 heterodimers resistant to SDS were observed. These analyses also revealed homodimers and homotrimers of TME1, indicating that such complexes are stable species. The N-terminal segment of TME1 exhibits a highly conserved GxxxG sequence, a motif that is well documented to be involved in intramembrane protein-protein interactions. Single or double mutations of the glycine residues (Gly354 and Gly358) in this motif markedly decreased or abrogated the formation of TME1 homotrimers in bacteria, as well as homotrimers of E1 in both HCVpp and HCVcc systems. A concomitant loss of infectivity was observed, indicating that the trimeric form of E1 is essential for virus infectivity. Taken together, these results indicate that E1E2 heterodimers form trimers on HCV particles, and they support the hypothesis that E1 could be a fusion protein. IMPORTANCE HCV glycoproteins E1 and E2 play an essential role in virus entry into liver cells as well as in virion morphogenesis. In infected cells, these two proteins form a complex in which E2 interacts with cellular receptors, whereas the function of E1 remains poorly understood. However, recent structural data suggest that E1 could be the protein responsible for the process of fusion between viral and cellular membranes. Here we investigated the oligomeric state of HCV envelope glycoproteins. We demonstrate that E1 forms functional trimers after virion assembly and that in addition to the requirement for E2, a determinant for this oligomerization is present in a conserved GxxxG motif located within the E1 transmembrane domain. Taken together, these results indicate that a rearrangement of E1E2 heterodimer complexes likely occurs during the assembly of HCV particles to yield a trimeric form of the E1E2 heterodimer. Gaining structural information on this trimer will be helpful for the design of an anti-HCV vaccine.","output":"Hepatitis C Virus Envelope Glycoprotein E1 Forms Trimers at the Surface of the Virion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to analyze the site usability evaluation system using the WEBUSE method on one of the information sites about COVID-19 namely the website covid19 go id The basic analysis was carried out on 24 usability criteria classified into 5 usability categories, namely: content, organization, and readability, navigation and links, user interface design, performance and effectiveness, educational purpose Each category deals with one aspect of usability Data from respondents' answers were analyzed using the WEBUSE method to get the usage point and usability level of the website that has been studied This research produces a usability evaluation information system that provides an online evaluation questionnaire and this analysis is useful to present high-quality system information and user satisfaction aspects of the website covid19 go id The case studyon the website covid19 go id, shows that the level of usability and overall level of user satisfaction is good and acceptable for the general public from all walks of life And in terms of satisfaction in the user interface design category, it is possible that some people are still uncomfortable with the look of the website ? 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd","output":"Usability Evaluation of the Website Services Using the WEBUSE Method (A Case Study: Covid19.go.id)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global environment is being constantly degraded, placing humans at increased risk for outbreaks of infectious diseases.

Given the crucial role of ACE2, being the main target for virus entry into the cell, the potential consequences of ACE2 up-regulation have been a source of debate. The aim of this retrospective cohort study on COVID-19-positive patients who died is to investigate whether previous long-term exposure to ACE-I and/or ARB was associated with higher mortality due to COVID-19 infection, compared to all other types of drug treatment. Methods: We analysed the clinical and demographic data of 615 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at the two hospitals of the Vasta Area n.5, between March 2020 and April 2021. Among them, 86 patients, treated with ACE-Is and/0 ARBs for about 12 months, died during hospitalization following a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure. Several quantitative and qualitative variables were recorded for all patients by reading their medical records. Results: The logistic model showed that the variables that increase mortality are age and comorbid diseases. There were no demonstrable mortality effects with ACE-I and ARB intake. Conclusions: The apparent increase in morbidity in patients with COVID-19 who received long-term treatment with ACE-I or ARB is not due to the drugs themselves, but to the conditions associated with their use.","output":"Sartans and ACE Inhibitors: Mortality in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19.

Here, we demonstrate that dexamethasone sensitizes to ferroptosis, a form of iron-catalyzed necrosis, previously suggested to contribute to diseases such as acute kidney injury, myocardial infarction, and stroke, all of which are triggered by glutathione (GSH) depletion. GSH levels were significantly decreased by dexamethasone. Mechanistically, we identified that dexamethasone up-regulated the GSH metabolism regulating protein dipeptidase-1 (DPEP1) in a glucocorticoid receptor (GR)Cdependent manner. DPEP1 knockdown reversed the phenotype of dexamethasone-induced ferroptosis sensitization. Ferroptosis inhibitors, the DPEP1 inhibitor cilastatin, or genetic DPEP1 inactivation reversed the dexamethasone-induced increase in tubular necrosis in freshly isolated renal tubules. Our data indicate that dexamethasone sensitizes to ferroptosis by a GR-mediated increase in DPEP1 expression and GSH depletion. Together, we identified a previously unknown mechanism of glucocorticoid-mediated sensitization to ferroptosis bearing clinical and therapeutic implications.","output":"Dexamethasone sensitizes to ferroptosis by glucocorticoid receptorCinduced dipeptidase-1 expression and glutathione depletion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"India has recorded 142,186 deaths over 36 administrative regions placing India third in the world after the US and Brazil for COVID-19 deaths as of 12 December 2020. Studies indicate that south-west monsoon season plays a role in the dynamics of contagious diseases, which tend to peak post-monsoon season. Recent studies show that vitamin D and its primary source Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation may play a protective role in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. However, the combined roles of the monsoon season and UVB radiation in COVID-19 in India remain still unclear. In this observational study, we empirically study the respective roles of monsoon season and UVB radiation, whilst further exploring, whether the monsoon season negatively impacts the protective role of UVB radiation in COVID-19 deaths in India. We use a log-linear Mundlak model to a panel dataset of 36 administrative regions in India from 14 March 2020C19 November 2020 (n = 6751). We use the cumulative COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable. We isolate the association of monsoon season and UVB radiation as measured by Ultraviolet Index (UVI) from other confounding time-constant and time-varying region-specific factors. After controlling for various confounding factors, we observe that a unit increase in UVI and the monsoon season are separately associated with 1.2 percentage points and 7.5 percentage points decline in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths in the long run. These associations translate into substantial relative changes. For example, a permanent unit increase of UVI is associated with a decrease of growth rates of COVID-19 deaths by 33% (= ? 1.2 percentage points) However, the monsoon season, mitigates the protective role of UVI by 77% (0.92 percentage points). Our results indicate a protective role of UVB radiation in mitigating COVID-19 deaths in India. Furthermore, we find evidence that the monsoon season is associated with a significant reduction in the protective role of UVB radiation.

In this review, we present advantages and disadvantages of cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating phytocannabinoid from the cannabis plant, as a potential agent for the treatment of COVID-19. CBD has been shown to downregulate proteins responsible for viral entry and to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Preclinical studies have demonstrated its effectiveness against diseases of the respiratory system as well as its cardioprotective, nephroprotective, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective and anti-convulsant properties, that is, effects that may be beneficial for COVID-19. Only the latter two properties have been demonstrated in clinical studies, which also revealed anxiolytic and antinociceptive effects of CBD (given alone or together with (9)-tetrahydrocannabinol), which may be important for an adjuvant treatment to improve the quality of life in patients with COVID-19 and to limit post-traumatic stress symptoms. However, one should be aware of side effects of CBD (which are rarely serious), drug interactions (also extending to drugs acting against COVID-19) and the proper route of its administration (vaping may be dangerous).

However, this disease is still orphaned in the country; large-scale control actions are rare, and little is known about its management. OBJECTIVE: To assess current practices in the management of SCD in Kisangani, DRC. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in six health facilities in Kisangani. It involved 198 presumed sickle cell patients attending the above health facilities. The study focused on the sociodemographic and clinical data of the participants, obtained through a clinical examination and their medical records. Diagnostic confirmation of SCD was made by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0. RESULTS: The diagnosis of SCD was confirmed in 194 (98.0%; 95% CI: 94.9-99.2) participants, while it was not confirmed in 4 (2.0%; 95% CI: 0.8-5.1) participants. The diagnosis was mainly made by the Emmel test (42.9%). 45.8% of participants had previously been transfused with the blood of their parents. Folic acid was taken by 48.5% of participants and the previous intake of hydroxyurea was reported in 5.1% of participants.

Although adding salt is a generally recognized strategy to improve protein stability, this improvement does not necessarily occur. The lack of an effect upon the addition of salt was previously confirmed for the tenth fibronectin type III domain from human fibronectin (FN3) by thermal stability analysis. However, the detailed molecular mechanism is unknown. In the present study, by employing the negatively charged carboxyl triad on the surface of FN3 as a case study, the molecular mechanism of the inefficient NaCl effect on protein stability was experimentally addressed using spectroscopic methods. Complementary analysis using Raman spectroscopy and 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid fluorescence revealed the three-phase behavior of the salt-protein interaction between NaCl and FN3 over a wide salt concentration range from 100 mM to 4.0 M, suggesting that the Na+-specific binding to the negatively charged carboxyl triad causes a local conformational change around the binding site with an accompanying structural change in the overall protein, which contributes to the protein's structural destabilization. This spectroscopic evidence clarifies the molecular understanding of the inefficiency of salt to improve protein stability.

A total of 158 groups of cattle (15,388 animals) from one slaughter facility were included in the study. A 4-point mobility scoring system was used to assess cattle mobility. Cattle at the facility with normal mobility scores were reduced from the historical average of 96.19% to 74.55%. No increase in highly elevated mobility scores was observed. Mobility was impacted by weight, temperature humidity index (THI), distance hauled, sex, and DOF, with results differing by mobility category. Weather was a key contributor to mobility challenges;the relative risk of observing an elevated mobility score was 45.76% greater when the THI changed from No Stress to Mild Stress.

Targeted NGS analysis revealed the presence of mutations in major and minor variants in 57% of fatal cases, with the proportion of viral variants with mutations varying from 1% to 98% in each individual sample in the epidemic season 2018C2019 in Russia. Co-occurrence of the mutations D222G and D222N was detected in a substantial number of the studied fatal cases (41%). The D222G/N mutations were detected at a low frequency (less than 1%) in the rest of the studied samples from fatal and nonfatal cases of influenza. The presence of HA D222Y/V/A mutations was detected in a few fatal cases. The high rate of occurrence of HA D222G/N mutations in A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, their increased ability to replicate in the LRT and their association with fatal outcomes points to the importance of monitoring the mutations in circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses for the evaluation of their epidemiological significance and for the consideration of disease prevention and treatment options.","output":"Evaluation of HA-D222G/N polymorphism using targeted NGS analysis in A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus in Russia in 2018C2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"World Gastroenterology Organization define acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) a syndrome in patients with chronic liver disease with or without previously diagnosed cirrhosis, characterized by acute hepatic decompensation resulting in liver failure and one or more extrahepatic organ failures, associated with increased mortality up to three months.

SARS-Cov-2 infection can overlap with pre-existing chronic liver disease or induce liver damage directly or indirectly. From the data of the literature and from what is inferred from the case report it clearly emerges that alcohol related liver disease (ALD) patients are particularly vulnerable to SARS-Cov-2 infection. Thereafter, some considerations can be deduced from the analysis of the case report. In subjects with pre-existing cirrhosis hepatologists should play more attention to hepatic injury and monitor risk of hepatic failure caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is appropriate to promptly define the alcoholic etiology and investigate whether the patient is actively consuming. In fact, withdrawal symptoms may be present, and the prognosis of these patients is also worse.

Leventhal's self-regulation educational model is based on the cognitive and emotional experiences of threat responses to symptoms and relates to coping responses. This study aims to investigate the effect of the implementation of a psychoeducational intervention, based on the self-regulation model of menstrual distress in adolescents. METHODS/DESIGN In this randomized controlled trial, 120 adolescent girls with moderate to severe menstrual pain (based on visual analog scale (VAS)  4) from twelve randomly selected high schools in Qazvin City will be enrolled in the study and will be randomly assigned to either a 3-session psychoeducational intervention (n = 60) or control (n = 60) groups. The sessions will be between 60 and 90 min apiece, and they will run for three consecutive weeks (one session per week). The data collection tools will include questionnaire eliciting menstrual information and demographics, the VAS, the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire, and the illness perception questionnaire. One month prior to the intervention, both groups will participate in an initial assessment to assess the severity of their pain and level of menstrual distress. Finally, all questionnaires will be completed for three consecutive months after the intervention is completed. DISCUSSION It is anticipated that findings of this study will provide evidence for the effectiveness of the Leventhal self-regulation model. Implications for improved practice, understanding, and treatment for menstrual distress may also arise.

Respiratory cilia are also one of the first contact points between host and inhaled pathogens. Impaired ciliary function is a common pathological feature in patients with chronic airway diseases, increasing susceptibility to respiratory infections. Common respiratory pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi, have been shown to target cilia and/or ciliated airway epithelial cells, resulting in a disruption of mucociliary clearance that may facilitate host infection. Despite being an integral component of airway innate immunity, the role of respiratory cilia and their clinical significance during airway infections are still poorly understood. This review examines the expression, structure, and function of respiratory cilia during pathogenic infection of the airways. This review also discusses specific known points of interaction of bacteria, fungi, and viruses with respiratory cilia function.

As COVID-19 rapidly overwhelmed the healthcare system in 2020, oncology departments found that space, staff, and funds were reallocated to address patient needs during the pandemic. Traditional outpatient services were required to operate with reduced resources, with special attention to additional measures to protect workers and patients from exposure to the virus. Little is known about how these changes affected the nature of the practice of oncology social work. Methods: We compared data on OSW interventions for three months (March-May) 2019 to the same period in 2020. Mount Sinai Downtown Cancer Center's Department of Social Work routinely collects data on services provided by social workers using a validated instrument. As NYC became the epicenter of the COVID-19 in March 2020, the comparison of these time periods creates a natural experiment to examine whether and how the presence of the virus impacted the services provided by OSWs. Findings: There was little difference in the number of encounters that took place between the two time periods (2186 encounters in 2019 and 2084 encounters in 2020); however, there were notable differences in the types of interventions. While interventions involving supportive counseling decreased in 2020, we identified a significant increase specific to bereavement counseling. Conclusion: The study shows a remarkable consistency in the volume and types of services provided by OSWs, in spite of the radical increase in stressors they experienced during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that the OSWs did not allow these stressors to interfere with their work with patients. This study demonstrates how routine use of an instrument to measure OSW interventions can be used to examine services provided over time and to evaluate potential influences of external factors.","output":"Did COVID-19 change the interventions provided by oncology social workers in the epicenter of the pandemic?

METHODS: Seventy-five children, 6C12 years of age, admitted with M. pneumoniae pneumonia were enrolled. Two patient groups were defined: the children with known asthma (N = 40) and non-asthmatic children (N = 35). Interleukin (IL)-18 and selected chemokines, IL-8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and regulation upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were measured by means of ELISA in the plasma samples of the patients collected on admission. We investigated the values of these mediators in relation to the asthma status and symptom severity of the patients. Twenty age-matched, non-infected controls were also studied. RESULTS: Plasma levels of IL-18 and the chemokines increased significantly in the patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia compared to non-infected, age-matched controls (P < 0.01). However, the asthmatic patients showed significantly reduced IL-18 and CXCL10 responses (P < 0.01, <0.05, respectively) and had more severe pneumonia symptoms (P < 0.01) compared to non-asthmatic patients. IL-18 was significantly lower in severe pneumonia group than in non-severe group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that IL-18 and the chemokines are importantly involved in the pathogenesis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The survey was distributed among 7109 subscribers of the Parkinson and Movement Disorders Alliance (PMD Alliance) News and Information list and was open only to people with PD (PwP) and care partners (CP, defined as main caregivers of PwP and serving as proxy respondents). No attempt was made to identify PwP and CP pairs. The survey was distributed online using Survey Monkey between 01/06/2021 and 02/27/2021. Respondents were grouped by level of social support from outside of their household during the pandemic (decreased or maintained [ie, the same as pre-pandemic or increased]). RESULTS: Of 7109 invited participants, 718 responded to the survey (response rate 10.1%). PwP (self-reports) accounted for 70.6% of respondents and CP (proxy reports) for 29.4%. Decreased social support from outside of the household during the COVID-19 pandemic (58.5% of all responses) was significantly associated with increases in sadness/depression and anxiety, compared with maintained levels of social support (p < 0.0001 for both comparisons). It was also associated with increased burden of several non-motor (decline in memory, problem solving, or communication, p = 0.0009; new or worsening confusion, p < 0.0001; new or worsening delusions, p = 0.018) and motor PD symptoms. CONCLUSION: Decline in social support from outside of the household during the COVID-19 pandemic showed a statistically significant and negative association with the burden of mood and non-motor symptoms of PD. These results call for increased vigilance towards non-motor symptoms in PwP experiencing social isolation and highlight the need for stronger provider focus on encouraging PwP and their CPs to build and maintain social connections and engagements.","output":"Impact of Isolation During the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Patient Burden of Parkinsons Disease: A PMD Alliance Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND To provide an overview of the empirical research linking self-reports of racial discrimination to health status and health service utilization.

Whether this has been associated with delayed reperfusion and worse outcomes in French patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is unknown. AIM: To compare the rate of STEMI admissions, treatment delays, and outcomes between the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in France and the equivalent period in 2019. METHODS: In this nationwide French survey, data from consecutive STEMI patients from 65 centres referred for urgent revascularization between 1 March and 31 May 2020, and between 1 March and 31 May 2019, were analysed. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital death or non-fatal mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction. RESULTS: A total of 6306 patients were included. During the pandemic peak, a 13.9  6.6% (P = 0.003) decrease in STEMI admissions per week was observed. Delays between symptom onset and percutaneous coronary intervention were longer in 2020 versus 2019 (270 [interquartile range 150?705] vs 245 [140?646] min; P = 0.013), driven by the increase in time from symptom onset to first medical contact (121 [60?360] vs 150 [62?420] min; P = 0.002). During 2020, a greater number of mechanical complications was observed (0.9% vs 1.7%; P = 0.029) leading to a significant difference in the primary outcome (112 patients [5.6%] in 2019 vs 129 [7.6%] in 2020; P = 0.018). No significant difference was observed in rates of orotracheal intubation, in-hospital cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock. CONCLUSIONS: During the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in France, there was a decrease in STEMI admissions, associated with longer ischaemic time, exclusively driven by an increase in patient-related delays and an increase in mechanical complications.

The use of the convolution layer from COVIDNet ensures the extraction of representations relevant to the CXR modality.

Experimental results show that HCN architecture is capable of achieving better results in comparison with the existing studies.

We first demonstrated that the REV infection affected the TRIM62 expression first upregulated and then downregulated in CEF cells. Next, we evaluated the effect of TRIM62 on viral replication. Overexpression of TRIM62 decreased REV replication. On the contrary, silencing of endogenously expressed TRIM62 increased viral replication. Then, to explore the necessity of domains in TRIM62's negative regulation on viral replication, we transfected CEF cells with TRIM62 domain deletion mutants. Deletion domain partially abolished TRIM62's antiviral activity. The effect of SPRY domain deletion was the highest and that of coiled-coil was the lowest. Further, we identified 18 proteins that coimmunoprecipitated and interacted with TRIM62 by immunocoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis. Strikingly, among which, both Ras-related protein Rab-5b (RAB5B) and Arp2/3 complex 34-kDa subunit (ARPC2) were involved in actin cytoskeletal pathway.

With this aim, we have improved our chemical procedure based on atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), which allows a good control of kinetics and polydispersity: the reaction takes place in a polar solvent, and the reaction medium remains always crystal clear. For such small particles, in contrary to direct space imaging, SANS is appropriate for characterization of the polymer corona as well as of the silica core using contrast matching provided by mixing normal and deuterated solvent. This allows checking of the level of aggregation at the nanoscale, which is found to be limited to a few percent of the particles in the reaction batch. After an initial slight increase, it is reduced by further polymerization, while the polymer layer grows progressively. After purification, grafted silica can be characterized accurately: its scattering can be fitted by a model of a silica core containing three to five particles surrounded by a polymer shell of thickness 7 nm. This is in good agreement with chain length and grafting density (214 sites per particle) evaluated by chemical analysis; hence SANS provides quantitative insight on chemical synthesis.","output":"Polymer grafting from 10-nm individual particles: proving control by neutron scattering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, a new strain of coronavirus family, was identified at the end of 2019 in China The COVID-19 virus spread rapidly all over the world Scientists strive to find virus-specific antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19 The present study reports a molecular docking study of the stilbenolignans and SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro) inhibitors The detailed interactions between the stilbenolignan analogues and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors were determined as hydrophobic bonds, hydrogen bonds and electronic bonds, inhibition activity, ligand efficiency, bonding type and distance and etc The binding energies of the stilbenolignan analogues were obtained from the molecular docking of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro Lehmbachol D, Maackolin, Gnetucleistol, Gnetifolin F, Gnetofuran A and Aiphanol were found to be -7 7, -8 2, -7 3, -8 5, -8 0 and -7 3 kcal/mol, respectively Osirus, Molinspiration and SwissADME chemoinformatic tools were used to examine ADMET properties, pharmacokinetic parameters and and toxicological characteristics of the stilbenolignan analogues All analogues obey the Lipinskis rule of five Furthermore, stilbenolignan analogues were studied to predict their binding affinities against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using molecular modeling and simulation techniques, and the binding free energy calculations of all complexes were calculated using the molecular mechanics/Poisson?Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method With the data presented here it has been observed that these analogues may be a good candidate for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in vivo studies, so more research can be done on stilbenolignan analogues","output":"In silico studies on stilbenolignan analogues as SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the spatial differences in the occurrence of COVID-19 in Brazilian Tropical Zone and its relationship with climatic, demographic, and economic factors based on data from February 2020 to May 2021. METHODS: A Linear Regression Model with the GDP per capita, demographic density and climatic factors from 5.534 Brazilian cities with (sub)tropical climate was designed and used to explain the spread of COVID-19 in Brazil. MAIN RESULTS: The model shows evidence that economic, demographic and climate factors maintain a relationship with the variation in the number of cases of COVID-19. The K?ppen climate classification defines climatic regions by rainfall and temperature. Some studies have shown an association between temperature and humidity and the survival of SARS-CoV-2. In this cohort study, Brazilian cities located in tropical regions without a dry season (monthly rainfall > 60 mm) showed a greater prevalence than in cities located in tropical regions with a dry season (some monthly rainfall < 60 mm). CONCLUSION: Empirical evidence shows that the Brazil's tropical-climate cities differ in the number (contamination rate) of COVID-19 cases, mainly because of humidity. This study aims to alert the research community and public policy-makers to the trade-off between temperature and humidity for the stability of SARS-COV-2, and the implications for the spread of the virus in tropical climate zones.","output":"Climatic factors associated with economic determinants significantly affect the spread of COVID-19 in tropical Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 viral pandemic of 2020 changed organ transplantation.

Pre-operative COVID-19 testing was required for all recipients and living donors. All patients underwent a rapid nasopharyngeal (NP) swab test. After testing negative by NP swab, recipients also underwent a low radiation dose CT scan to rule out any radiographic changes suggestive of a COVID-19 infection Results We performed 8 living donor and 9 deceased donor kidney transplants. In comparison, we performed 10 living donor and 4 deceased donor transplants during the same time period in the previous year. Our testing protocol enabled efficient utilization of all suitable organs offered during the viral pandemic. No recipients or living donors tested positive or developed COVID-19 Conclusions Creation of a viral testing protocol, developed in conjunction with our infectious disease team, permitted kidney transplantation to be performed safely and the number of deceased donor transplants increased considerably, without adversely affecting our outcomes.","output":"Navigating Kidney Transplantation in the Early Phase of COVID-19: Screening Patients with RT-PCR and Low Radiation Dose Chest CT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Liver fibrosis progression in chronic liver disease leads to cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma and often ends in liver transplantation.

Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases. Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images compatible with COVID-19 infection. No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms. Moreover, the endoscopic surgeons may themselves be at significant risk of contamination. Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms. In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis.

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with unsuccessful ECMO weaning. Propensity score matching was used to match patients who received veno-venous ECMO with those who received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)-only therapy. Of 88 patients receiving ECMO therapy, 27 and 61 patients were and were not successfully weaned from ECMO, respectively. Additionally, 15, 15, and 65 patients were further weaned from IMV, discharged from hospital, or died during hospitalization, respectively. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, a lymphocyte count &#8804;0.5109/L and D-dimer concentration >4 the upper limit of normal level at ICU admission, a peak PaCO2 >60 mmHg at 24 h before ECMO initiation, and no tracheotomy performed during the ICU stay were independently associated with lower odds of ECMO weaning. In the propensity score-matched analysis, a mixed-effect Cox model detected a lower hazard ratio for 120-day all-cause mortality after ICU admission during hospitalization in the ECMO group. The presence of lymphocytopenia, higher D-dimer concentrations at ICU admission and hypercapnia before ECMO initiation could help to identify patients with a poor prognosis.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the natural history, clinical management and outcomes of community-dwelling patients with COVID-19, who received support from a family medicine-led, virtual CovidCare@Home program in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. METHODS: Observational, descriptive study conducted by retrospective chart review of 98 patients enrolled during the first 5 weeks of program implementation (8 April-11 May 2020); 73 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, with symptom onset &#8804; 14 days before initial consult were included for analysis. Patients were classified as mild, moderate or severe based on WHO Criteria. RESULTS: All patients in the program experienced mild (88%) or moderate (12.3%) disease. No patients were hospitalized or died. Patients were mainly female (70%); with mean age of 43.3 years. Most patients (82.2%) worked in higher risk, healthcare settings. Almost 40% had no medical co-morbidities. Common symptoms were cough (65.8%), fatigue (60.3%), headache (42.5%) and myalgia (39.7%), followed by fever (32.9%), sore throat (21.9%), nasal congestion (21.9%) and rhinorrhea (20.5%).

Shifts that are not met with immediate and appropriate responses from the healthcare system can lead to public health crises with tragic levels of morbidity and mortality, as experienced Europe in the early 1990s and as is the case in North America currently. The major feature of the current drug market shift in North America is towards highly potent synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and fentanyl analogues. An additional spike in stimulant use further complicates this issue. Without understanding the ever-changing dynamics of drug markets and consequent patterns of drug use, the healthcare system will continue to be ineffective in its response, and morbidity and mortality will continue to increase. Economic perspectives are largely neglected in research and clinical contexts, but better treatment alternatives need to consider the large-scale macroeconomic conditions of drug markets as well as the behavioural economics of individual substance use. It is important for policy makers, health authorities, first responders and medical providers to be aware of the clinical implications of drug market changes in order to best serve people who use drugs.

SUMMARY The initial focus on the mechanisms of action of aldosterone was directed primarily on its role in modulating renal excretory function. In contrast, many recent studies have demonstrated a wider and expanded role for aldosterone in modulating inflammation, collagen formation, fibrosis, and necrosis. Increasing evidence has accrued that implicates the pathophysiological overactivation of the MR as a major determinant of progression of CKD. By promoting inflammation and fibrosis, MR overactivation constitutes a pivotal determinant of CKD progression and its associated morbidity and mortality. In accord with this mechanism of action, blockade of the MR is currently being investigated as a novel treatment regimen to slow the progression of CKD. The recently reported FIDELIO-DKD (FInerenone in reducing kiDnEy faiLure and dIsease prOgression in Diabetic Kidney Disease) study demonstrated that patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes who were treated with finerenone (a novel nonsteroidal MRA) manifested a lower risk of a composite primary outcome event compared with patients in the placebo arm (defined as kidney failure, or a sustained decrease of 40% in the estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline, or death from renal causes). In addition, patients in the finerenone group also manifested a lower risk of a key secondary outcome event (defined as death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure). Key Messages: Based on the success of the FIDELIO-DKD study, future studies should be implemented testing the hypothesis that a wide array of nondiabetic CKD is modulated by overactivation of the MR, and consequently may be amenable to treatment with novel nonsteroidal MRAs. Future studies are encouraged to elucidate the clinical implications of the interplay of nonsteroidal MRAs and the components of the renin-angiotensin cascade. The unique and recently reported interrelationship of fibroblast growth factor (FGF23) and aldosterone may also constitute a propitious subject for future investigation.","output":"Aldosterone and Mineralocorticoid Receptor Signaling as Determinants of Cardiovascular and Renal Injury: From Hans Selye to the Present."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic generated by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to a forced increase in the number of hours spent at home. In many cases, the lockdown situations, both in social and work terms, have meant that homes have suddenly also become workplaces. Based on all the indicators, this new relational scenario in the labor market displays a clear upward trend and is far from being a temporary situation. It is known that sunlight affects peoples circadian rhythm and that its reduction and even absence during this period of isolation has had a psychological impact on the population. This makes it necessary to reconsider the regulations applied in homes, in order to guarantee their habitability, given their recent widespread use as offices, as well as domestic spaces. In historic centers, the comprehensive renovations being carried out include improvements in energy efficiency and thermal comfort, which play a fundamental role. However, the energy consumption linked to artificial lighting and the quality of this lighting itself have remained in the background, as improvement strategies consist mainly in the replacement of incandescent or fluorescent lamps with LED lamps. Prior to the pandemic, the electric consumption of lighting systems accounted for 10C15% of the total, a figure which increased to 40C50% during the lockdown period. Aiming to improve peoples well-being while reducing energy expenditure on lighting, this article presents a quantitative approach to improving the levels of natural lighting in residential heritage buildings located in historic centers. According to data obtained from previous surveys of a sector of the population, homes built prior to 1950 were characterized by good natural lighting conditions and a very low incidence of health issues among occupants compared to contemporary homes. The objective was to quantify the circadian stimulus and lighting levels and to identify the areas or work areas in homes in order to optimize consumption related to lighting and to generate healthy and comfortable spaces. Results show that historic homes have enough naturally lit areas to perform office work during business hours. However, in the most unfavorable seasons, winter and autumn, it is necessary to use artificial lighting at the start and end of the working day.","output":"Natural Lighting in Historic Houses during Times of Pandemic.

Methods: HRQoL was assessed using the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) v2 mental and physical component summary (MCS;PCS) scores (higher scores = better HRQoL) and the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey II (HFS-II;higher scores = greater fear). Factors associated with HRQoL over time were assessed using longitudinal multivariable regression models. Results: Of 14 691 DISCOVER patients from 37 countries, baseline and  1 follow-up MCS, PCS and HFS-II scores were available for 7880, 7854 and 5387 patients, respectively. Over time, SF-36 scores decreased (change per 6 months from baseline: MCS ?0.04 [95% CI: ?0.05 to ?0.04];PCS ?0.03 [95% CI: ?0.03 to ?0.02]), and HFS-II scores increased (change: 0.10 [95% CI: 0.09 to 0.12]).

The ease of performing complete viral studies in our on site laboratory allowed us to assess the clinical implications of the absence of conventional culture results in previously healthy hospitalized children with CRV infections. METHODS From June 1997 through May 2000, the results of direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA) of 1069 nasopharyngeal swab (NP) specimens were compared with simultaneously inoculated conventional tube cell cultures for detection of CRVs. In addition the medical records of 140 previously healthy infants and children hospitalized for management of lower respiratory tract infections caused by culture-proved CRVs were reviewed. RESULTS Viruses were isolated or detected by DFA or viral culture or both in 468 (30%) of the 1557 NP samples evaluated. The most common CRV isolated was respiratory syncytial virus (49%), followed by parainfluenza viruses (15%), influenza A viruses (14%), rhinoviruses (8%), adenoviruses (4%), enteroviruses (4%) and influenza B viruses (1%). Of the 1069 NP specimens for which both viral culture and rapid antigen testing were performed, 190 specimens were DFA-positive and culture-positive, 7 specimens were DFA-positive and culture-negative, 35 specimens were DFA-negative and culture-positive and 837 specimens were DFA-negative and culture-negative. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of DFA were 84, 99, 96 and 96%, respectively. Of the 140 hospitalized patients with culture-proved viral cultures (89 respiratory syncytial virus, 22 influenza A, 20 parainfluenza virus and 9 adenovirus), the mean duration of hospital stay was 3.6 days, and the mean time for viral cultures to become positive was 7.7 days (P < 0.001, signed rank test). One hundred twenty (86%) viral cultures did not become positive until after the patient had been discharged from the hospital. In no case was the clinical decision regarding the patient's treatment or discharge from the hospital based on the results of viral culture.

Antibiotherapy was administered for 10 days with the diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infection. However, her condition did not improve and she was admitted to the hospital. In physical examination, crepitant rales were heard in both lungs. Anemia and thrombocytopenia were detected in laboratory tests and she was referred to the hematology clinic. Bone marrow aspiration and flow cytometry showed she had acute myeloid leukemia. Computed tomography-integrated positron emission tomography with a history of previous breast cancer revealed a heterogeneous mass-like lesion in the left lung.

A questionnaire was developed in SurveyMonkey, an online tool, and was distributed by email during FebruaryCMay 2020 to 470 veterinarians practicing across the UAE. A total of 110 individuals completed the survey, giving a response rate of 23.4% (110/470). Results indicate that reported hand hygiene, sharps management, barrier or isolation practices, and personal choices for personal protective equipment (PPE) in common practice scenarios varied among practitioners. The majority (>75%) of veterinarians in all practice types reported always washing their hands before eating, drinking, or smoking at work. The survey revealed that 19% and 10% of large and small animal veterinarians indicated they sterilized and reused disposable needles. Veterinarians among all practices indicated high rates (75% to 80%) of recapping needles before disposal. When handling an animal suspected of having a zoonotic disease, most (90%) of small animal veterinarians reported always using practices such as isolating the animal and removing outwear before contact with other animals. However, only half (55%) of the large animal respondents reported always isolating the animal or sterilizing all equipment used on the animal of concern. Fewer than half of the large animal (35%) and mixed practice (44%) veterinarians indicated they would always be limiting human contact with the animal of concern. All of the small animal respondents reported full compliance with PPE while performing surgery and necropsy. Among large animal veterinarians, 44% reported not using respiratory or eye protection when aiding with parturition or handling conception products. Failure to use appropriate PPE when handling blood samples was the second most common noncompliant practice among large animal (39%) veterinarians and mixed practice (41%) respondents. Our study indicates a need for continuous education regarding ICPs in the veterinary community in the UAE. Better awareness of the risk of zoonotic disease exposure and options for managing this risk and liability issues could drive the adoption of infection control practices.","output":"Zoonotic Disease Management and Infection Control Practices Among Veterinarians in the United Arab Emirates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses have evolved to interact with their hosts.

The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting stay-at-home orders in the United States have created an optimal situation for the use of telehealth services for non-life-threatening health care use. A retrospective cohort study was performed using Kantar's Claritis&#8482; database, which links insurance claims encounters (Komodo Health) with patient-reported data (Kantar Health, National Health & Wellness Survey). Logistic regression models (odds ratios [OR], 95% confidence intervals [CI]) examined predictors of telehealth versus in-person encounters. Adults ages &#8805;18 years eligible for payer-complete health care encounters in both March 2019 and March 2020 were identified (n = 35,376). Telehealth use increased from 0.2% in 2019 to 1.9% in 2020. In adjusted models of respondents with &#8805;1 health care encounter (n = 11,614), age, marital status, geographic residence (region; urban/rural), and presence of anxiety or depression were significant predictors of telehealth compared with in-person use in March 2020.

Traditional seizure detection products (e.g., wearables), however, are either very costly, uncomfortable, or unreliable. In this paper, we then propose to utilize everyday WiFi signals for robust, fast, and non-invasive detection of nocturnal seizures. We first present a new and rigorous mathematical characterization for the spectral content/bandwidth of the WiFi signal, measured on a WiFi device placed near a sleeping patient, during different kinds of sleep motions: seizures, normal movements (e.g. posture adjustments), and breathing. Based on this mathematical modeling, we propose a novel pipeline for processing the received WiFi signals to robustly detect all nocturnal non-breathing movements, and then classify them into normal body movements or seizures. In order to validate this, we carry out extensive experiments in 7 different typical bedroom locations, where a set of 20 actors simulate the state of having seizures (total of 260 instances), as well as normal sleep movements (total of 410 instances). Our proposed system detects 93.85% of the seizures with a mean response time of only 5.69 seconds since the onset of the seizure. Moreover, our proposed system achieves a probability of false alarm of only 0.0097, when classifying normal sleep movements.

Many institutions that reopened cautiously in the fall experienced a massive wave of infections and colleges were soon declared as the new hotspots of the pandemic. However, the precise effects of college outbreaks on their immediate neighborhood remain largely unknown. Here we show that the first two weeks of instruction present a high-risk period for campus outbreaks and that these outbreaks tend to spread into the neighboring communities. By integrating a classical mathematical epidemiology model and Bayesian learning, we learned the dynamic reproduction number for 30 colleges from their daily case reports. Of these 30 institutions, 14 displayed a spike of infections within the first two weeks of class, with peak seven-day incidences well above 1,000 per 100,000, an order of magnitude larger than the nation-wide peaks of 70 and 150 during the first and second waves of the pandemic. While most colleges were able to rapidly reduce the number of new infections, many failed to control the spread of the virus beyond their own campus: Within only two weeks, 17 campus outbreaks translated directly into peaks of infection within their home counties. These findings suggests that college campuses are at risk to develop an extreme incidence of COVID-19 and become superspreaders for neighboring communities. We anticipate that tight test-trace-quarantine strategies, flexible transition to online instruction, and-most importantly-compliance with local regulations will be critical to ensure a safe campus reopening after the winter break.","output":"Are college campuses superspreaders?

Collaborative mental health care in school forms a particular practice of school-based mental health care provision. Developed in Canada and inspired by systemic intervention approaches, collaborative mental health care in schools involves the formation of an interdisciplinary care network, in which mental health care providers and school partners collaborate with each other and the refugee family in a joint assessment of child development and mental health, as well as joint intervention planning and provision. It aims to move away from an individual perspective on refugee children's development, toward an engagement with refugee families' perspectives on their migration histories, cultural background and social condition in shaping assessment and intervention, as such fostering refugee empowerment, equality, and participation in the host society. Relating to the first stage of van Yperen's four-stage model for establishing evidence-based youth care, this article aims to engage in an initial exploration of the effectiveness of a developing school-based collaborative mental health care practice in Leuven, Belgium. First, we propose a detailed description, co-developed through reflection on case documents, written process reflections, intervision, an initial identification of intervention themes, and articulating interconnections with scholarly literature on transcultural and systemic refugee trauma care. Second, we engage in an in-depth exploration of processes and working mechanisms, obtained through co-constructed clinical case analysis of case work collected through our practice in schools in Leuven, Belgium.

Despite these variations, some bat SARSr-CoVs can utilize the orthologs of the human SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry. It is speculated that the interaction between bat ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike proteins drives diversity. Here, we identified a series of R. sinicus ACE2 variants with some polymorphic sites involved in the interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Pseudoviruses or SARSr-CoVs carrying different spike proteins showed different infection efficiencies in cells transiently expressing bat ACE2 variants. Consistent results were observed by binding affinity assays between SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV spike proteins and receptor molecules from bats and humans. All tested bat SARSr-CoV spike proteins had a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 than to bat ACE2, although they showed a 10-fold lower binding affinity to human ACE2 compared with that of their SARS-CoV counterpart. Structure modeling revealed that the difference in binding affinity between spike and ACE2 might be caused by the alteration of some key residues in the interface of these two molecules. Molecular evolution analysis indicates that some key residues were under positive selection. These results suggest that the SARSr-CoV spike protein and R. sinicus ACE2 may have coevolved over time and experienced selection pressure from each other, triggering the evolutionary arms race dynamics.IMPORTANCE Evolutionary arms race dynamics shape the diversity of viruses and their receptors. Identification of key residues which are involved in interspecies transmission is important to predict potential pathogen spillover from wildlife to humans. Previously, we have identified genetically diverse SARSr-CoVs in Chinese horseshoe bats. Here, we show the highly polymorphic ACE2 in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. These ACE2 variants support SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV infection but with different binding affinities to different spike proteins. The higher binding affinity of SARSr-CoV spike to human ACE2 suggests that these viruses have the capacity for spillover to humans. The positive selection of residues at the interface between ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike protein suggests long-term and ongoing coevolutionary dynamics between them. Continued surveillance of this group of viruses in bats is necessary for the prevention of the next SARS-like disease.","output":"Evolutionary Arms Race between Virus and Host Drives Genetic Diversity in Bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus Spike Genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exponential growth in digital information outlets and the race to publish has made scientific misinformation more prevalent than ever.

Evidence suggests that the transition from an animal virus to a human pathogen is incremental and requires a considerable number of spillover events and considerable time before a pandemic variant emerges. This evolutionary view argues for the refocusing of public health resources on novel respiratory virus surveillance at human-animal interfaces in geographical hotspots for emerging infectious diseases. Where human-animal interface surveillance is not possible, a secondary high-yield, cost-efficient strategy is to conduct novel respiratory virus surveillance among pneumonia patients in these same hotspots. When novel pathogens are discovered, they must be quickly assessed for their human risk and, if indicated, mitigation strategies initiated.

Exposures: Telehealth implementation owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: (1) Conversion rate defined as the rate of weekly new patient telehealth visits divided by mean weekly number of total new patient visits in 2019. This outcome adjusts for a substantial decrease in outpatient care during the pandemic. (2) Weekly number of new patient telehealth visits divided by weekly number of total new patient visits. Results: Among 4405 surgeons in the cohort, 2588 (58.8%) performed telehealth in any patient care context. Specifically for new patient visits, 1182 surgeons (26.8%) used telehealth. A total of 109 610 surgical new outpatient visits were identified during the pandemic. The median (interquartile range) age of telehealth patients was 46.8 (34.1-58.4) years compared with 52.6 (38.3-62.3) years for patients who received care in-person. Prior to March 2020, less than 1% (8 of 173a?939) of new patient visits were conducted through telehealth. Telehealth use peaked in April 2020 (week 14) and facilitated 34.6% (479 of 1383) of all new patient visits during that week. The telehealth conversion rate peaked in April 2020 (week 15) and was equal to 8.2% of the 2019 mean weekly new patient visit volume. During period 2, a mean (SD) of 16.6% (12.0%) of all new patient surgical visits were conducted via telehealth (conversion rate of 5.1% of 2019 mean weekly new patient visit volumes). During period 3, 3.0% (2168 of 71 819) of all new patient surgical visits were conducted via telehealth (conversion rate of 2.5% of 2019 new patient visit volumes).

By combining this with calculations of the effective reproduction number (R), we aim to shed light on the patterns of infections in South Africa. RESULTS: Two of the largest provinces, Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, had a slow growth rate on the number of detected cases, while in Western Cape and Eastern Cape the epidemic is spreading fast. Our estimates of transmission potential suggest a decrease towards R = 1 since the first cases and deaths but a subsequent estimated R average of 1.39 between 6-18(th) of May 2020.

Moreover, the proportion of patients with severe pneumonia was significantly higher in the G group than in the NG group. Conclusion: In Wuhan, the proportion of COVID-19 patients who experience gastrointestinal symptoms is relatively high. Patients who experience gastrointestinal symptoms are more likely to suffer from severe pneumonia, which may help clinicians identify patients at high risk of COVID-19 and thus reduce the incidence of this condition.","output":"Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients with gastrointestinal symptoms: A report of 164 cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lungs from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have shown typical signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), formation of hyaline membrane mainly composed of fibrin and 'ground-glass' opacity. Previously, we showed plasminogen itself is a key regulator in fibrin degradation, wound healing and infection. AIM: We aimed to investigate whether plasminogen can improve lung lesions and hypoxemia of COVID-19. DESIGN: Thirteen clinically moderate, severe or critical COVID-19 patients were treated with atomization inhalation of freeze-dried plasminogen. METHODS: Levels of their lung lesions, oxygen saturation and heart rates were compared before and after treatment by computed tomography scanning images and patient monitor. RESULTS: After plasminogen inhalation, conditions of lung lesions in five clinically moderate patients have quickly improved, shown as the decreased range and density of 'ground glass' opacity. Improvements of oxygen saturation were observed in six clinically severe patients. In the two patients with critical conditions, the oxygen levels have significantly increased from 79-82% to 91% just about 1 h after the first inhalation. In 8 of 13 patients, the heart rates had slowed down. For the five clinically moderate patients, the difference is even statistically significant. Furthermore, a general relief of chest tightness was observed. CONCLUSION: Whereas it is reported that plasminogen is dramatically increased in adults with ARDS, this study suggests that additional plasminogen may be effective and efficient in treating lung lesions and hypoxemia during COVID-19 infections. Although further studies are needed, this study highlights a possible hope of efficiently combating this rapid epidemic emergency.","output":"Plasminogen improves lung lesions and hypoxemia in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to examine the economic impact of COVID\\\\19 virus on family dynamics and college\\\\age children's mental health in China and to identity personal and social or relational resilience factors that could buffer the negative consequences of COVID\\\\19. BACKGROUND: Since an outbreak of COVID\\\\19 was first reported in China in December 2019, it has profoundly changed the lives of families and children of all ages. In particular, it has created challenges among families with college\\\\age young adult children. METHOD: Using a sample of 484 college students from 21 universities in China, an online survey design was utilized to obtain information from these students on their family demographics and economic situation, parentCchild interactions, and individual well\\\\being during COVID\\\\19. RESULTS: Results from structural equation modeling suggested that family income loss due to COVID\\\\19 was related to economic pressure. Economic pressure was associated with negative interactions between parents and young adult children, which were associated with problems in young adult children's mental health (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms). Further, self\\\\control was found to buffer the association between family income loss and economic pressure, and respect for family was found to weaken the association between economic pressure and negative parentCchild interactions. CONCLUSION: Findings supported the hypotheses of the negative impacts of COVID\\\\19 on young adult children's mental health and the resilience factors that buffered the negative impacts.

We conducted a retrospective population-based study in Alberta, Canada (population 4.4 million), where there have been approximately 1550 hospital admissions for COVID-19, to determine the impact of COVID-19 on hospital admissions and emergency department (ED visits), following initiation of a public health emergency act on March 15, 2020. METHODS: We used multivariable negative binomial regression models to compare daily numbers of medical/surgical hospital admissions via the ED between March 16-September 23, 2019 (pre COVID-19) and March 16-September 23, 2020 (post COVID-19 public health measures). We compared the most frequent diagnoses for hospital admissions pre/post COVID-19 public health measures. A similar analysis was completed for numbers of daily ED visits for any reason with a particular focus on ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC). FINDINGS: There was a significant reduction in both daily medical (incident rate ratio (IRR) 0.86, p<0.001) and surgical (IRR 0.82, p<0.001) admissions through the ED in Alberta post COVID-19 public health measures. There was a significant decline in daily ED visits (IRR 0.65, p<0.001) including ACSC (IRR 0.75, p<0.001). The most common medical/surgical diagnoses for hospital admissions did not vary substantially pre and post COVID-19 public health measures, though there was a significant reduction in admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a significant increase in admissions for mental and behavioral disorders due to use of alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a relatively low volume of COVID-19 hospital admissions in Alberta, there was an extensive impact on our healthcare system with fewer admissions to hospital and ED visits. This work generates hypotheses around causes for reduced hospital admissions and ED visits which warrant further investigation. As most publicly funded health systems struggle with health-system capacity routinely, understanding how these reductions can be safely sustained will be critical.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on hospital admissions and emergency department visits: A population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inhaled nebulized interferon (IFN)- and IFN- have been shown to be effective in the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

In many countries, including Italy, national registries are missing. METHODS: This study aims to assess T1D incidence in the pediatric population of the Calabria region (southern Italy) in the period 2019C2021. The secondary objective was to describe the main demographical, clinical and immunological features of incident cases. Case ascertainment and all clinical data were assessed by retrospectively reviewing the electronic medical records of children and adolescents diagnosed with diabetes at any Pediatric Diabetes Center belonging to the Rete Diabetologica Calabrese (Calabria Region Diabetes Network), from January 2019 to December 2021. The incidence of T1D was estimated for the entire region and was stratified according to age group (0C4 years, 5C9 years, and 10C14 years) and gender. Standardized incidence ratios for each province in the region were also calculated. RESULTS: The crude incidence of T1D was 20.6/100,000 person/years.

We sought to identify whether changes in hospital policies and provider practices, driven by COVID-19, would influence delivery outcomes in nulliparous, term, singleton, vertex (NTSV) pregnancies in Rhode Island. OBJECTIVE We compare the delivery outcomes and associated factors for NTSV deliveries during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Rhode Island compared to patients who delivered the year prior. STUDY DESIGN This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who presented to Women & Infants Hospital for NTSV deliveries during April 2019, pre-COVID-19, and April 2020, during COVID-19. RESULTS During COVID-19, patients were more likely to have abnormal electronic fetal monitoring (AEFM) as an indication for cesarean section (p<.02) and less likely to have an elective cesarean delivery (p<.01). Patients during COVID-19 were more likely to have a midwife involved in their care compared to pre-COVID-19 (p<.001). The cesarean section rate was not statistically different between the two time periods. CONCLUSION Those delivering during the pandemic were more likely to have AEFM as an indication for cesarean delivery and less likely to have elective cesareans. They were more likely to have a midwife involved in their care.

In latest smart surveillance cameras, high quality of video transmission is maintained through various video encoding techniques such as high efficiency video coding.

This review provides a summary of the main literature of MRVP for patients with regard to 3 different topics. Can the results of MRVP reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics, can they guide the use of appropriate antiviral therapy and do they have an added value with respect to infection control measures? Literature was searched for based on a defined search string using both the PubMed and Embase database. Twenty-five articles report on the impact of MRVP on antibiotic therapy. In all the articles where active antimicrobial stewardship was performed (e.g., education/advice on interpreting results of MRVP) (N = 9), a reduction in antibiotic therapy was shown (with exception of 2 studies). Three studies evaluating the effect of MRVP on antimicrobial use in a population that is not suspected of having bacterial pneumonia (e.g., absence of radiology suggestive for bacterial infection or low PCT) found a positive impact on antibiotic therapy. Eight studies with a short TAT (< 7 h) had a positive impact on use of antibiotic therapy. Eleven studies focused on the impact of MRVP on antiviral use. In contrast to antibiotic reduction, all studies systematically objectified improved antiviral use as a consequence of MRVP results. With regard to the impact of MRVP on infection control, eleven articles were withheld. All these studies led to a more accurate use of infection control measures by detecting unidentified pathogens or stopping isolation precautions in case of a negative MRVP result. MRVP dont reduce antibiotic therapy in all populations. Reduction seems more likely if the following factors are present: active antimicrobial stewardship, low likelihood of a bacterial infection, and a short turnaround time to result. With respect to antiviral therapy, all studies have an impact but the targeted use of antivirals is so far not that evidence based for all viral respiratory pathogens. Regarding infection control measures, the potential impact of MRVP is high because of the need of additional isolation precautions for many respiratory viruses, although logistical problems can occur.","output":"Impact of multiplexed respiratory viral panels on infection control measures and antimicrobial stewardship: a review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Firearm mortality has been a constant issue plaguing the United States for many decades.

None of these studies examined how unmet student expectations (here, unexpected changes in course delivery) might increase perceptions of studentCinstructor\\\\university psychological contract breaches (PCBs) and, ultimately, perceived SLOs within and across modalities. The COVID\\\\19 pandemic provided an opportunity to study these potential relationships because many residential institutions of higher education opted into, or were required to, offer distance and/or blended learning to accommodate COVID\\\\19 safety mandates. This study sampled undergraduate students (n = 155) from a university, which, before the pandemic, offered exclusively face\\\\to\\\\face classroom instruction. During the Fall 2020 semester, however, this university offered three modalities of instruction: (1) face\\\\to\\\\face;(2) blended learning;and (3) distance education. The results of this study suggest that perceived PCBs by instructors and universities negatively influence underling indices of student achievement in terms of motivation, engagement, and learning within and across modalities of instruction. Given this and near universal decrements in student enrollment and retention in institutions of higher education, it is important for universities and instructors to understand, explicitly and transparently negotiate, and meet student expectations to improve student progression to graduation and maintain competitiveness among similar institutions. Highlights The first study to examine the extent to which unexpected pivots to distance and blended learning impact student perceptions of their learning experiences through the lens of the psychological contract theory. Study results reveal interesting and consistent trends, indicating that psychological contracts, or breaches thereof, do play a part in determining whether students may prefer and be more motivated and engaged in one modality of instruction over another. Perceived psychological contract breaches on the part of instructors who taught via a specific learning modality (F2F, distance, or blended) were related to (1) generally preferring the other two modalities over that modality;and (2) lower levels of motivation, engagement, and learning within that modality as compared to the other two. Results suggest that when courses were offered in the expected format (i.e., F2F), then any unmet expectations were attributed to the instructor.

Expression of angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2 \\\\ the functional receptor for SARS\\\\CoV) \\\\ is upregulated in adipocytes of obese and diabetic patients, which turns adipose tissue into a potential target and viral reservoir. This may explain why obesity and diabetes are potential comorbidities for COVID\\\\19 infections.

To reduce the severity and mortality with COVID\\\\19, we propose to probe for the clinical response to thiazolidinediones (TZDs), PPAR agonists, that are the well\\\\known anti\\\\diabetic drugs.

Rapid molecular testing for convenient and timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections represents a challenge that could help to control the current pandemic and prevent future outbreaks. We aimed to develop and validate a multiplex and colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay using lyophilized LAMP reagents for sensitive and rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. LAMP primers were designed for a set of gene targets identified by a genome-wide comparison of viruses. Primer sets that showed optimal features were combined into a multiplex RT-LAMP assay. Analytical validation included assessment of the limit of detection (LoD), intra- and inter-assay precision, and cross-reaction with other respiratory pathogens. Clinical performance compared to that of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was assessed using 278 clinical RNA samples isolated from swabs collected from individuals tested for COVID-19. The RT-LAMP assay targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), membrane (M), and ORF1ab genes achieved a comparable LoD (0.65 PFU/mL, CT=34.12) to RT-qPCR and was 10-fold more sensitive than RT-qPCR at detecting viral RNA in clinical samples. Cross-reactivity to other respiratory pathogens was not observed. The multiplex RT-LAMP assay demonstrated a strong robustness and acceptable intra- and inter-assay precision (mean coefficient of variation, 4.75% and 8.30%). Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity values were 100.0% (95% CI: 97.4C100.0%) and 98.6% (95% CI: 94.9C99.8%), respectively, showing high consistency (Cohens kappa, 0.986; 95% CI: 0.966C1.000; p<0.0001) compared to RT-qPCR.

Dysregulated or overexpression of NO contributes to neurologic damage associated with various pathologies, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurological disease. Previous studies suggest that HIV-infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) produce low levels of NO in vitro and that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is expressed in the brain of patients with neurologic disease. However, the levels of NO could not account for the degree of neural toxicity observed. In this study, we found that induction of iNOS with concomitant production of NO occurred in primary human astrocytes, but not in MDM, when astrocytes were cocultured with HIV-1-infected MDM. This coincided with decreased HIV replication in infected MDM. Supernatants from cocultures of infected MDM and astrocytes also stimulated iNOS/NO expression in astrocytes, but cytokines known to induce iNOS expression (interferon-gamma, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) were not detected. In addition, the recombinant HIV-1 envelope protein gp41, but not rgp120, induced iNOS in cocultures of uninfected MDM and astrocytes. This suggests that astrocytes may be an important source of NO production due to dysregulated iNOS expression and may constitute one arm of the host response resulting in suppression of HIV-1 replication in the brain. It also leads us to speculate that neurologic damage observed in HIV disease may ensue from prolonged, high level production of NO.","output":"Human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected macrophages induce inducible nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide (NO) production in astrocytes: astrocytic NO as a possible mediator of neural damage in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: People with physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases report lower levels of physical activity and well-being than the general population, which potentially is exacerbated through the COVID-19 pandemic.

The condition can impair motor function by creating involuntary movements, predominantly in the upper extremities or the embouchure. The pathophysiology of the disorder is not fully understood, and complete recovery is extremely rare. While most of the literature views the condition through a neurological lens, a handful of recent studies point out certain psychological traits and the presence of adverse playing-related experiences and preceding trauma as possible contributors to the onset. The nature and the frequency of these factors, however, are under-researched. The present quasi-experimental study aimed to compare musicians with and without MFD in terms of the frequency of various adverse psychosocial and psychological factors to explore their contribution to the onset of the condition.

Here, we performed a comprehensive proteomics-based investigation of nasopharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 patients to study the host response by employing simple extraction strategies. Few of the host proteins such as Interleukin-6, L-lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, Ferritin and Aspartate aminotransferase were found to be up-regulated only in COVID-19 positive patients using targeted Multiple Reaction Monitoring studies. The most important pathways identified by enrichment analysis were neutrophil degranulation, interleukin-12 signaling pathways and mRNA translation of proteins thus providing the detailed investigation of host response in COVID-19 infection. Thus, we conclude that mass spectrometry-detected host proteins have a potential for disease severity progression; however, suitable validation strategies should be deployed for the clinical translation.

METHODS: The study was an electronic survey open from March 27th to May 2nd, 2020. Patients with COVID-19 who developed barotrauma while on invasive mechanical ventilation from 61 hospitals of the COVID-19 Lombardy Intensive Care Unit Network were involved. RESULTS: The response rate was 38/61 (62%). The incidence of barotrauma was 145/2041 (7.1%; 95%-CI: 6.1-8.3%). Only a few cases occurred with ventilatory settings that may be considered non-protective such as a plateau airway pressure >35 cmH2O (2/113 [2%]), a driving airway pressure >15 cmH2O (30/113 [27%]), or a tidal volume >8 ml/kg of ideal body weight and a plateau airway pressure >30 cmH2O (12/134 [9%]).

However, there have been high rates of failure of entrepreneurial start-ups within their first 5 years across the globe. In this regard, the aim of the study was to explore ways of improving the sustainability of entrepreneurial start-ups. The study employed a thematic synthesis exploratory analysis on 105 articles. The paper sheds light on survival tools which may be applicable particularly during the setting-up of entrepreneurial ventures as well as in the course of difficult economic periods. The research findings were that, firstly, the entrepreneurial start-ups are prone to risks that if left uncontrolled would impact on their survival. Secondly, there exists a strong theoretical basis for birth (start-up) and death (failure/exit) of start-ups although failure is a learning opportunity. Thirdly, club theory provides a platform for a sharing economy which resource constrained start-ups would find cost friendly. Fourthly, building of relationships through collaboration and social networking has been in existence but favourably emerging approach that could offer start-ups a lifeline through accruing social capital. Fifthly, incubation and responsible innovation have continually been embraced wherein science and research are key ingredients for start-ups sustainability. Finally, sustainability of entrepreneurial start-ups is a cumulative effect from existing and new product(s) and process(es) aspects. The insights emanating from this exploratory study may serve as signals to governments and private stakeholders of the urgency to initiate frameworks that would incorporate and facilitate entrepreneurial start-ups in implementing sustainability programmes. The findings derived from the study are expected to influence the sustainability management theory especially for entrepreneurial start-ups. Based on the limitations of manual exploratory analysis, the study recommends consideration of machine learning methods in conducting future exploratory studies.","output":"Steering the sustainability of entrepreneurial start-ups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For a searchable version of these abstracts, please visit www.acrabstracts.org.","output":"ACR Convergence 2020 Abstract Supplement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Execution of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is controlled by the BCL-2 proteins at the level of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). This family of proteins consists of prosurvival (e.g., BCL-2, MCL-1) and proapoptotic (e.g., BIM, BAD, HRK) members, the functional balance of which dictates the activation of BAX and BAK. Once activated, BAX/BAK form pores in the MOM, resulting in cytochrome c release from the mitochondrial intermembrane space, leading to apoptosome formation, caspase activation, and cleavage of intracellular targets. This pathway is induced by cellular stress including DNA damage, cytokine and growth factor withdrawal, and chemotherapy/drug treatment. A well-documented defense of leukemia cells is to shift the balance of the BCL-2 family in favor of the prosurvival proteins to protect against such intra- and extracellular stimuli. Small molecule inhibitors targeting the prosurvival proteins, named BH3 mimetics, have come to the fore in recent years to treat hematological malignancies, both as single agents and in combination with standard-of-care therapies. The most significant example of these is the BCL-2-specific inhibitor venetoclax, given in combination with standard-of-care therapies with great success in AML in clinical trials.

METHODS: In a 5-day screening project in Inner Mongolia, 3345 women volunteered following a community awareness campaign, and self-swabbed to permit rapid HPV testing. Two AmpFire? HPV detection systems (Atila Biosystems) were sufficient to provide pooled 15-HPV type data within an hour. HPV+ patients had same-day digital colposcopy (DC) performed by 1 of 6 physicians, using the EVA? system (MobileODT). Digital images were obtained and, after biopsy of suspected lesions for later confirmatory diagnosis, women were treated immediately based on colposcopic impression. Suspected low- grade lesions were offered treatment with thermal ablation (Wisap), and suspected high-grade lesions were treated with LLETZ. RESULTS: Of 3345 women screened, 624 (18.7%) were HPV+. Of these, 88.5% HPV+ women underwent same-day colposcopy and 78 were treated. Later consensus histology results obtained on 197 women indicated 20 CIN2+, of whom 15 were detected and treated/referred at screening (10 by thermal ablation, 4 by LLETZ, 1 by referral). CONCLUSIONS: Global control of cervical cancer will require both vaccination and screening of a huge number of women. This study illustrates a cervical screening strategy that can be used to screen-and-treat large numbers of women. HPV self-sampling facilitates high-volume screening. Specimens can be tested rapidly, promoting minimal loss-to-follow-up. Specifically, the AmpFire? system used in this study is highly portable, simple, rapid (92 specimens per 65 min per unit), and economical. Visual triage can be performed on HPV+ women with a portable digital colposcope that provides magnification, lighting, and a recorded image. Diagnosis and appropriate treatment remain the most subjective elements.

These two urgent emergency projects are unprecedented. In general, substantial literature suggests that the possibility of shortening a schedule by more than a quarter of its original duration is implausible. By contrast, the two projects had successfully compressed the schedules from months and years to about ten days. This study aims to investigate how this was done and provide references for future projects. Design/methodology/approach The study uses qualitative case study techniques to analyze the project practices in two urgent emergency projects. Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews and archival research. During interviews, interviewees were asked to describe the project practices adopted to overcome the challenges and freely share their experiences and knowledge. Findings The results illustrate that a high degree of schedule compression is achievable through tactful crashing, substitution and overlapping applications. The successful practices heavily rely on the high capacity of participants and necessary organization, management and technology innovations, such as three-level matrix organizational structure, reverse design method, site partition, mock-up room first strategies and prefabricated construction technology. For instance, the reverse design method is one of the most significant innovations to project simplification and accelerate and worthy of promotion for future emergency projects. Practical implications The empirical findings are significant as they evoke new thinking and direction for addressing the main challenges of sharp schedule compression and provide valuable references for future emergency projects, including selecting high-capacity contractors and replacing the conventional design methods with reverse design. Originality/value Substantial studies indicate that the maximum degree of schedule compression is highly unlikely to exceed 25%, but this study suggests that sharp compression is possible. Although with flaws in its beauty (i.e. compressing schedule at the expense of construction cost and quality), it is also a breakthrough.

To date, no effective and approved drugs are available for the treatment of COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a crucial role in the invasion into host cells by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19. Notably, ACE2 density is influenced by medical conditions, such as hypertension, or by drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which can change the fate of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. ACE2 is a target for these drugs and can be manipulated to limit the viral entry and replication within the cells. Different strategies that are aimed at blocking ACE2 with small molecules, peptides, and antibodies, or by neutralizing the virus through its competitive binding with human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) are currently under investigation. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge that emphasizes the need to find effective therapeutic agents against COVID-19 by exploiting ACE2 as a potential target. The increased soluble ACE2 levels and the application of hrsACE2 in patients with COVID-19 can be implemented to control the disease.

Research focusing on the psychological aspect of human financial behavior and well-being is scarce, focusing more on the cognitive side such as financial literacy and numeracy. The aim of this research study is to find the role played by the non-cognitive factors such as self-esteem, self-control, optimism and deliberative thinking, in forming the financial behavior and financial well-being of the young adults. A sample of 429 university students from public and private sector was collected via an online and field survey using purposive sampling technique. The survey contained measures for demographics, self-esteem, optimism, deliberative thinking, self-control, general financial behavior and financial well-being. SPSS and PLS-SEM tools were used for the exploration of the relationships among dependent and independent variables. The results of PLS path analysis demonstrate that among the non-cognitive factors, self-control and deliberative thinking show a significant association with both financial behavior, and financial security. Self-esteem plays no significant role in forming the financial behavior of the young adults when all the variables are taken together but it exhibits a significant association with financial well-being (financial security and financial anxiety). Optimism on the other hand exhibits no significant association with both financial behavior and financial well-being (financial security and financial anxiety). The results of this study complement the previous studies and also put forth new outcomes. This research is unique as it is the first of its kind conducted in a consumption-oriented economy like Pakistan. In addition to the previous studies which have often established the link of self-esteem with general well-being, this study goes further by analyzing the association between self-esteem and financial well-being and by the identification of the role played by non-cognitive factors like self-esteem, optimism, deliberative thinking and self-control together on the financial behavior and financial well-being of the individuals using PLS-SEM approach.","output":"The role of self-esteem, optimism, deliberative thinking and self-control in shaping the financial behavior and financial well-being of young adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emerging coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly around the world.

Because they often co-exist, it is difficult to assess if age is a risk factor on its own. METHODS: We used administrative register data of the total Swedish population from 01/2015 until 07/2020. We stratified the population aged 70+ into three groups according to level of care (in care homes, with home care, and in independent living). Within these groups, we explored the level of excess mortality in 2020 by estimating expected mortality with Poisson regression and compared it to observed levels. We investigated if excess mortality has been of the same magnitude in the three groups, and if age constitutes a risk factor for death during the pandemic regardless of level of care. FINDINGS: Individuals living in care homes experienced the highest excess mortality (75- >100% in April, 25C50% in May, 0C25% in June, depending on age). Individuals with home care showed the second highest magnitude (30C60% in April, 15C40% in May, 0C25% in June), while individuals in independent living experienced excess primarily at the highest ages (5C50% in April, 5C50% in May, 0C25% in June). Although mortality rates increased, the age-pattern of mortality during the pandemic resembled the age-pattern observed in previous years. INTERPRETATION: We found stepwise elevated excess mortality by level of care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden, suggesting that level of frailty or comorbidities plays a more important role than age for COVID-19 associated deaths. Part of our findings are likely attributable to differences in exposure to the virus between individuals receiving formal care and those living independently, and not only different case fatality between the groups. Although age is a strong predictor for mortality, the relative effect of age on mortality was no different during the pandemic than before. We believe this is an important contribution to the discussion of the pandemic, its consequences, and which groups need the most protection.

The diagnosis of POEMS syndrome is 2 of the mandatory major criteria (polyneuropathy and monoclonal plasma cell disorder), 1 of the other major criteria (Castleman's disease, sclerotic bone lesions, or vascular endothelial growth factor elevation), and at least 1 of the minor criteria (organomegaly, extravascular volume overload, endocrinopathy, skin changes, papilledema, thrombocytosis, or polycythemia). However, some cases do not fully meet the diagnostic criteria, such cases are referred to as incomplete or atypical POEMS syndrome. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 58-year-old Chinese female was admitted to our department of neurology with weakness of both arms and legs. In addition,it's found that she had skin manifestations, lymphadenopathies, pedal edema, immunoglobin - A-&#955; restricted paraproteinemia, and elevated vascular endothelial growth factor and other features, but without polyneuropathy. DIAGNOSES:: we made a diagnosis of atypical POEMS syndrome without polyneuropathy. INTERVENTIONS: Two drug regimens were recommended: VAD (Vincristine, Adriamycin, Dexamethasone) and bortezomib. Finally, the VAD strategy was performed. OUTCOMES: The patient's limb strength and pain improved and enzyme parameters decreased gradually after 4 weeks. However, the treatment was still not perfect. CONCLUSION: We reported a rare case of POEMS syndrome without polyneuropathy.

Poor knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) toward COIVD-19 prevention measures among healthcare workers may lead to further transmission of the disease. Lack of attention towards non-frontline healthcare workers may put them at higher risk of infection from undetected cases. Here, we evaluate medical interns KAP toward COVID-19 prevention measures in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Methods: : We conducted a cross-sectional online survey. We distributed a structured questionnaire to the medical interns through different social media. Data was collected between April and May 2020. We estimated the prevalence of good KAP toward COVID-19 prevention measures. We did T -test or ANOVA to investigate the mean differences in KAP between socio-demographic groups. In addition, we did multivariable logistic regression analysis to investigate the socio-demographic determinants of good KAP. Results: : Of the total 250 participants, 60% were males, 64% were aged between 20 and 25 years, and 90% was Saudi. 24% interns are relying on social media, newspaper, television or friends as primary source of COVID-19 information, while others are relying on formal sources like official websites of national and international bodies. Overall, the prevalence of good knowledge, attitude and practices are 38% (95% CI: 32.2-44.2), 55.2% (48.9-61.3) and 24% (19.1-29.7), respectively. Graduating from government universities are associated with higher odds of good knowledge (aOR: 3.87;95% CI: 1.05-14.22) and positive attitude (aOR: 4.84;95% CI: 1.28-18.23) than private or foreign universities.

Conclusions: : Our findings reveal gaps in KAP among medical interns. Medical interns in Saudi Arabia are not deployed as front-line health worker to combat COVID-19. However, community transmission of COVID-19 make it critical to improve KAP of medical interns toward COVID-19 prevention measures.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is not transmissible by transfusion, but bloodborne pathogens remain a risk in regions with high endemic prevalence of disease. Pathogen reduction can mitigate this risk; thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of riboflavin and ultraviolet light (R + UV) pathogen reduction technology on the functional properties of COVID-19 CP (CCP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: COVID-19 convalescent plasma units (n = 6) from recovered COVID-19 research donors were treated with R + UV. Pre- and post-treatment samples were tested for coagulation factor and immunoglobulin retention. Antibody binding to spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), S1 and S2 epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by ELISA. Neutralizing antibody (nAb) function was assessed by pseudovirus reporter viral particle neutralization (RVPN) assay and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). RESULTS: Mean retention of coagulation factors was &#8805;70%, while retention of immunoglobulins was 100%. Starting nAb titres were low, but PRNT50 titres did not differ between pre- and post-treatment samples. No statistically significant differences were detected in levels of IgG (P &#8805; 03665) and IgM (P &#8805; 01208) antibodies to RBD, S1 and S2 proteins before and after treatment. CONCLUSION: R + UV PRT effects on coagulation factors were similar to previous reports, but no significant effects were observed on immunoglobulin concentration and antibody function.

Causes for this decline fall into three broad categories: habitat loss, illegal hunting, and disease. Contributing factors to all of these causes are linked to pressure from the expanding human population competing for forest resources. We have moved beyond the time of debating the pros and cons of including human engagement activities in conservation. If humans are part of the problem, they must also be part of the solution. To move our understanding of which human engagement activities are effective, what methodologies are being used and best practices for setting up a successful framework, we interviewed practitioners representing 53 projects working in great ape habitat in Africa. The interviewees represented almost 900 years of experience with African great ape conservation. We found that all practitioners agreed that for conservation to succeed, projects must engage with humans utilizing resources from great ape habitats. However, evaluation of such work was elusive. Projects that employed at least one person designated as an educator were more likely to have structured programs, regular engagement activities, and to evaluate their work. To date, little information on the success or failure of the activities has been published, thus perpetuating the problem of relying on personal experience rather than evidence when developing new engagement programs. Additionally, linking human engagement activities to biological impact remains a challenge.

Although pressure ventilators have partial compensatory capacity, excessive leakage can compromise the effectiveness of treatment. Home ventilators are equipped with built-in software which provides information on leakage. However, the values of leakage and their effects in routine clinical practice are currently little known. OBJECTIVE To measure leakage in stable patients on nocturnal HMV and its impact on treatment effectiveness. METHODS Consecutive outpatients on HMV were recruited. Nocturnal pulse oximetry was performed at home and leakage was measured using the ventilator's built-in software. We measured: mean SpO(2), percentage of time with SpO(2) <90% (T90), mean leakage (meanL), maximum leakage (maxL), and minimum leakage (minL) during the ventilation session. We estimated ventilator capacity to compensate for leakage according to inspiratory positive airway pressure and divided the patients into two groups: those with leak compensation and those without. RESULTS The study included 41 patients [mean age, 64 years (SD 11.9); 23 (56%) women]. Nocturnal pulse oximetry showed an SpO(2) of 94% (2.9) and a T90 of 10% (21.7). Leakage (in l/min) was: meanL, 32.2 (15.3); maxL, 64.8 (28.5), and minL, 18.8 (10.6). Seven cases (17%) had leakage greater than the ventilator compensatory capacity, but no significant difference in SpO(2) or T90 was observed between patients with or without leak compensation. CONCLUSIONS A wide variation between maxL and minL was observed in our series; 17% of cases had higher leakage values than the compensatory capacity of the ventilator, but this did not affect nocturnal oxygenation.","output":"Home mechanical ventilation through mask: monitoring leakage and nocturnal oxygenation at home."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, one potential cause of concern is that some discharged COVID-19 patients are testing positive again for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA.

Some studies described variation in total volume of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) during the pandemic. We aimed to describe the changes in volume and characteristics of OHCA patients and resuscitations in one urban EMS system. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of all recorded atraumatic OHCA in Marion County, Indiana, from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019 and from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020. We described patient, arrest, EMS response, and survival characteristics. We performed paired and unpaired t-tests to evaluate the changes in those characteristics during COVID-19 as compared to the prior year. Data were matched by month to control for seasonal variation. RESULTS: The total number of arrests increased from 884 in 2019 to 1034 in 2020 (p = 0.016). Comparing 2019 to 2020, there was little difference in age [median 62 (IQR 59C73) and 60 (IQR 47C72), p = 0.086], gender (38.5% and 39.8% female, p = 0.7466, witness to arrest (44.3% and 39.6%, p = 0.092), bystander AED use (10.1% and 11.4% p = 0.379), bystander CPR (48.7% and 51.4%, p = 0.242).

In todays interconnected global society, such contagion processes can cause global public health hazards, as exemplified by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. It is therefore of great practical relevance to investigate the network transmission of contagious diseases from the perspective of statistical inference. An important and widely studied boundary condition for contagion processes over networks is the so-called epidemic threshold. The epidemic threshold plays a key role in determining whether a pathogen introduced into a social contact network will cause an epidemic or die out. In this paper, we investigate epidemic thresholds from the perspective of statistical network inference. We identify two major challenges that are caused by high computational and sampling complexity of the epidemic threshold. We develop two statistically accurate and computationally efficient approximation techniques to address these issues under the Chung-Lu modeling framework. The second approximation, which is based on random walk sampling, further enjoys the advantage of requiring data on a vanishingly small fraction of nodes. We establish theoretical guarantees for both methods and demonstrate their empirical superiority.","output":"Scalable Estimation of Epidemic Thresholds via Node Sampling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a serious public health challenge despite enormous eradication efforts.

Methods: We used secondary data from 2016 to 2020 in the MyTB surveillance system. Malaysian aborigines with smear-positive pulmonary TB were enrolled and followed until the end of the intensive phase. Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression were used for data analysis. Results: Of 725 Malaysian aborigines with pulmonary TB, 572 (78.9%) were smear-positive and 487 (78.9%) fulfilled the study criteria.

This question is at the core of an extensive debate about the social and long-run costs of stopping the economic activity and human capital accumulation from reducing the contagion. In principle, many confounding factors, such as climate, health system treatment, and other forms of restrictions, may impede disentangling the link between schooling and Covid-19 cases when focusing on a country or regional-level data. This work sheds light on the potential impact of school opening on the upsurge of contagion by combining a weekly panel of geocoded Covid-19 cases in Sicilian census areas with a unique set of school data. The identification of the effect takes advantage of both a spatial and time-variation in school opening, stemming from the flexibility in opening dates determined by a Regional Decree, and by the occurrence of a national referendum, which pulled a set of poll-station schools towards opening earlier or later September 24th. The analysis finds that census areas where schools opened earlier observed a significant and positive increase in the growth rate of Covid-19 cases between 2.5C3.7%. This result is consistent across several specifications, including accounting for several determinants of school opening, such as the number of temporary teachers, Covid-19 cases in August, and pupils with special needs. Finally, the analysis finds lower effects in more densely populated areas, on younger population, and on smaller class size. The results imply that school reopening generated an increase of one third in cases.","output":"Schools opening and Covid-19 diffusion: Evidence from geolocalized microdata()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGOUND: Bacterial or viral infections often cause acute and severe systemic inflammation, which affects the lungs lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a pathogenic component of the membrane of gram-negative bacteria, stimulates active innate immune cells, monocytes, macrophages to produce inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).

The impacts of the different scenarios on the price elasticity of demand are determined along with the slope (or the rate of change) of elasticity. Some of these results differ when a non-linear demand curve is considered instead. The equilibrium mask prices increase when masks are universally mandated, whereas the consumer surplus is higher when masks are recommended but not mandated. However, the ranking of consumer surplus is shown to be sensitive to the supply elasticity of masks.

This is why increasingly in developed countries the first trimester anomaly scan is being offered as part of standard care. We have developed a Virtual Reality (VR) approach to improve the diagnostic abilities of 2D ultrasound. Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound datasets are used in VR assessment, enabling real depth perception and unique interaction. The aim of this study is to investigate whether first trimester 3D VR ultrasound is of additional value in terms of diagnostic accuracy for the detection of fetal anomalies. Health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness and also the perspective of both patient and ultrasonographer on the 3D VR modality will be studied. METHODS Women in the first trimester of a high risk pregnancy for a fetus with a congenital anomaly are eligible for inclusion. This is a randomized controlled trial with two intervention arms. The control group receives 'care as usual': a second trimester 2D advanced ultrasound examination. The intervention group will undergo an additional first trimester 2D and 3D VR ultrasound examination. Following each examination participants will fill in validated questionnaires evaluating their quality of life and healthcare related expenses. Participants' and ultrasonographers' perspectives on the 3D VR ultrasound will be surveyed. The primary outcome will be the detection of fetal anomalies. The additional first trimester 3D VR ultrasound examination will be compared to 'care as usual'. Neonatal or histopathological examinations are considered the gold standard for the detection of congenital anomalies. To reach statistical significance and 80% power with a detection rate of 65% for second trimester ultrasound examination and 70% for the combined detection of first trimester 3D VR and second trimester ultrasound examination, a sample size of 2800 participants is needed. DISCUSSION First trimester 3D VR detection of fetal anomalies may improve patients' quality of life through reassurance or earlier identification of malformations.

Understanding the spatial codistribution of these diseases is critical for designing geographically targeted and integrated disease control programmes. This study investigated the spatial overlap and drivers of HIV, TB and malaria prevalence in Ethiopia. METHODS: HIV, TB and malaria data were obtained from different nationwide prevalence surveys, and geospatial covariates were obtained from publicly available sources. A Bayesian model-based geostatistical framework was applied to each survey leveraging the strength of high-resolution spatial covariates to predict continuous disease-specific prevalence surfaces and their codistribution. RESULTS: The national prevalence was 1.54% (95% CI 1.40 to 1.70) for HIV, 0.39% (95% CI 0.34 to 0.45) for TB and 1.1% (95%CI 0.95 to 1.32) for malaria. Substantial subnational variation was predicted with the highest HIV prevalence estimated in Gambela (4.52%), Addis Ababa (3.52%) and Dire Dawa (2.67%) regions. TB prevalence was highest in Dire Dawa (0.96%) and Gambela (0.88%), while malaria was highest in Gambela (6.1%) and Benishangul-Gumuz (3.8%). Spatial overlap of their prevalence was observed in some parts of the country, mainly Gambela region. Spatial distribution of the diseases was significantly associated with healthcare access, demographic, and climatic factors. CONCLUSIONS: The national distribution of HIV, TB and malaria was highly focal in Ethiopia, with substantial variation at subnational and local levels.

While much research has focused on social-psychological determinants of vaccine hesitancy, less is known about the attitudes and behaviors of the vaccinated populations towards those who are unvaccinated. Building on Weiner's attribution theory (2005, 1985, 1980), we predict that vaccination status determines the attribution of personal responsibility and blame in Covid-19 social dilemmas. This in turn explains people's affective and behavioral responses towards those who have fallen ill or infected others with COVID-19. Approach Through two preregistered experiments (total N = 1200) we show that people attribute greater personal responsibility when unvaccinated (vs. vaccinated) people fall ill from, or infect others with COVID-19. This attribution of responsibility manifested in less sympathy towards unvaccinated COVID-19 patients, which was associated with a lower willingness to help patients and their families (Study 1). Likewise, higher perceived responsibility results in greater anger towards unvaccinated people who had (involuntarily) infected others with the virus, which was associated with a greater desire for punitive actions (Study 2). Conclusion These findings suggest that unvaccinated people experience blame as well as negative attitudes and behaviors from the vaccinated population.

Objective: We investigated whether self-isolation due to COVID-19 and using cannabis to cope with depression were unique and/or interactive predictors of cannabis use during the pandemic, after controlling for pre-pandemic levels of cannabis use. Method: A sample of 70 emerging adults (mean age = 23.03; 34.3% male) who used both alcohol and cannabis pre-pandemic completed measures of cannabis use (i.e., quantity x frequency) and a novel COVID-19 questionnaire between March 23 and June 15, 2020.

METHODS: Twenty-four patients hospitalized with H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia at our hospital between September 2009 and January 2010 were included. The patients underwent thin-section CT 3 years after recovery. Abnormal pulmonary lesion patterns (ground-glass opacity, consolidation, parenchymal bands, air trapping, and reticulation) and evidence of fibrosis (architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, or honeycombing) were evaluated on follow-up thin-section CT. Patients were assigned to Group 1 (with CT evidence of fibrosis) and Group 2 (without CT evidence of fibrosis). Demographics, rate of mechanical ventilation therapy, rate of intensive care unit admission, cumulative prednisolone-equivalent dose, laboratory tests results (maximum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase [AST], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and creatine kinase [CK]), and peak radiographic opacification of 24 patients during the course of their illness in the hospital were compared between two groups. RESULTS: Parenchymal abnormality was present in 17 of 24 (70.8%) patients and fibrosis occurred in 10 of 24 (41.7%) patients.

Preventing travel and gatherings, as well as applying house quarantine in Apr 2020, reduced COVID-19 somewhat but then due to lack of attention to social distancing, reducing the use of masks by the people and inappropriate decisions by the national committee on combating coronavirus (NCCC), including reducing the working hours of public offices and shops, reducing the staff of government offices, monopoly on the distribution of essential materials and supplies, the presence of overcrowding in clinics of medical centers, hospitals, and private clinics caused the decline of the disease in the country to decrease. Measures can be taken to prevent the spread of the virus as much as possible, including: rapid detection of infected people, their isolation, contact tracing, quarantine of people over 65 and under 15, protection of the elderly, prevention of gatherings, forcing the use of protective equipment in possible gatherings, and electronicizing public services.","output":"Why the COVID-19 Is Not Significantly Reduced in Iran?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Online mental health services were previously found to be effective in many studies. However, this method was not generally used in Israel. By the end of 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic erupted, forcing mental health services to transition to online meetings to maintain the standard of care. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the attitudes of adolescent patients toward this involuntary new mode of care. METHODS: Forty-four adolescents (mean age 14.62  2.12 years, 54.5% females) and 40 of their primary caregivers completed a battery of questionnaires that included the telemedicine satisfaction questionnaire, session evaluation questionnaire, working alliance inventory, and pediatric symptom checklist. RESULTS: Both adolescents and their caregivers reported a reasonable experience with the online medium and a feeling that the meetings were overall powerful, helpful, and comfortable as demonstrated by medium to high scores on the telemedicine satisfaction questionnaire and session evaluation questionnaire questionnaires. A therapeutic alliance was generally maintained according to working alliance inventory scores. However, working alliance inventory scores were negatively correlated with higher levels of internalizing symptoms and parental stress. DISCUSSION: Our findings point to the possibility that anxious/depressed adolescents will have greater difficulties re-establishing therapeutic alliance when transitioned from in-person to online meetings. This may be due to the introduction of an \\"invisible\\" third party to the therapeutic setting-the computer. Psychologists and psychiatrists should be aware of these difficulties and respond adequately to maintain the standard of care.","output":"Internalizing symptoms impede adolescents' ability to transition from in-person to online mental health services during the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper uses weekly data from July 01, 2011 to July 09, 2021 to examine the dynamic nonlinear connectedness between the green bonds, clean energy, and stock price around the COVID-19 outbreak in the global markets. By building a time-varying parameter vector autoregression model (TVP-VAR), the comparison analyses of pre- and during the COVID-19 sample groups verify the existence of nonlinear and dynamic correlation among the three variables. First, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the simultaneous impacts of clean energy on stock price increased over time. Second, the results of impulse responses at different horizons indicate that green bonds lead to a short-term increase of clean energy, and it exerts an increasingly positive impacts after the COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19 has weakened the negative impacts of green bonds on stock price in the medium term. Finally, through the analysis of impulse responses at different points, we find that stock prices will rise when clean energy is subjected to a positive shock, and this positive effect is stronger during economic recovery period than in the other two periods.","output":"Dynamic nonlinear connectedness between the green bonds, clean energy, and stock price: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aquaculture industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors in animal food production. However, farming of carnivorous fish strongly relies on the use of wild fish-based meals, a practice that is environmentally and economically unsustainable. Insect-based diets constitute a strong candidate for fishmeal substitution, due to their high nutritional value and low environmental footprint. Nevertheless, data on the impact of insect meal (IM) on the gut microbiome of farmed fish are so far inconclusive, and very scarce in what concerns modulation of microbial-mediated functions. Here we use high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR to evaluate the impact of different IMs on the composition and chitinolytic potential of the European sea bass gut digesta- and mucosa-associated communities. Our results show that insect-based diets of distinct origins differently impact the gut microbiota of the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). We detected clear modulatory effects of IM on the gut microbiota, which were more pronounced in the digesta, where communities differed considerably among the diets tested. Major community shifts were associated with the use of black soldier fly larvae (Hermetia illucens, HM) and pupal exuviae (HEM) feeds and were characterized by an increase in the relative abundance of the Firmicutes families Bacillaceae, Enterococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae and the Actinobacteria family Actinomycetaceae, which all include taxa considered beneficial for fish health. Modulation of the digesta community by HEM was characterized by a sharp increase in Paenibacillus and a decrease of several Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidota members. In turn, a mealworm larvae-based diet (Tenebrio molitor, TM) had only a modest impact on microbiota composition. Further, using quantitative PCR, we demonstrate that shifts induced by HEM were accompanied by an increase in copy number of chitinase ChiA-encoding genes, predominantly originating from Paenibacillus species with effective chitinolytic activity. Our study reveals an HEM-driven increase in chitin-degrading taxa and associated chitinolytic activity, uncovering potential benefits of adopting exuviae-supplemented diets, a waste product of insect rearing, as a functional ingredient.","output":"Differential Modulation of the European Sea Bass Gut Microbiota by Distinct Insect Meals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among the natural bases, guanine is the most oxidizable base.

During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, this international study aimed to explore changes in the workload of general practitioners, as well as their interactions with patients and colleagues, and their self-confidence and concerns. METHODS: An online survey was conducted among GPs in Austria and Germany. Participants were asked to answer a basic questionnaire and participate in a subsequent longitudinal survey containing closed and open-ended items. All data were pseudonymized. RESULTS: Overall, 723 general practitioners from Austria and Germany took part in the longitudinal survey over a period of 12 weeks (April 3CJuly 2, 2020). The majority of GPs had less direct contact with patients at the beginning of the survey (96 vs. 49% at the end of the study period). At first, doctors were mainly concerned with pandemic-related issues and had to care for the patients of GP colleagues that were in quarantine, which meant they had less time for routine work such as screenings and treating chronic diseases. Over the survey period, GPs' self-confidence increased and their concerns about income loss decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Following a difficult initial phase when protective equipment and information were lacking, physicians in primary care adapted quickly to new situations. Experience with telemedicine should help them face future challenges and may help prevent a decline in the delivery of routine health care and care for chronically ill patients.

T. cruzi parasites are mainly transmitted to human by the infected feces of blood-sucking triatomine insects. The persistent disease is endemic in many regions of South America, mostly affecting residents of rural areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate epidemiological aspects of ChD in the state of Piau located in northeastern Brazil. This is an analytical cross-sectional study carried out from the collection of data of the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN, in Portuguese, Sistema de Informa??es de Agravos de Notifica??o) of suspected and confirmed cases of acute ChD in the state of Piau, in the period 2010-2019. Associations between T. cruzi positivity and the study variables were determined by the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and were raised as prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence interval. According to this survey, 517 suspected cases of acute ChD were reported in Piau, with 70 cases (13.5%) confirmed. In 88.5% of confirmed cases, confirmation occurred by laboratory diagnosis. Most of the confirmed cases occurred in municipalities located in the semiarid region, with the municipality of S?o Jo?o do Piau presenting the highest number of cases.

The principles that are at the heart of such an approach include a reckoning with all of the harms involved in policy choice, including harms that might be given rise to by policy implementation itself; a focus on the harms to which already vulnerable populations are susceptible; and a strong preference for policies that economize on the use of prohibitions and of coercive state enforcement, and that instead emphasize the agency of citizens in realizing health-promoting behavior change.

While both the identities and sites of mutations are typically modelled as being random, recent investigations of sequence diversity of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have identified a preponderance of C->U transitions, potentially driven by an APOBEC-like RNA editing process. The current study investigated whether this phenomenon could be observed in the more genetically diverse datasets of other RNA viruses. Using a 5% divergence filter to infer directionality, 18 from 32 datasets of aligned coding region sequences from a diverse range of mammalian RNA viruses (including Picornaviridae, Flaviviridae, Matonaviridae, Caliciviridae and Coronaviridae) showed a >2-fold base composition normalised excess of C->U transitions compared to U->C (range 2.1xC7.5x). C->U transitions showed a favoured 5 U upstream context consistent with previous analyses of APOBEC-mediated RNA targeting. Amongst several genomic compositional and structural parameters, the presence of genome scale RNA secondary structure (GORS) was associated with C->U/U->C transition asymmetries (p < 0.001), potentially reflecting the documented structure dependence of APOBEC-mediated RNA editing. Using the association index metric, C->U changes were specifically over-represented at phylogenetically uninformative sites, consistent with extensive homoplasy documented in SARS-CoV-2. Excess C->U substitutions accounted for 15-20% of standing sequence variability of HCV and other RNA viruses; RNA editing may therefore represent a potent driver of RNA virus sequence diversification and longer term evolution. Author Summary The rapid evolution of RNA viruses is thought to arise from high mutation frequencies during replication and the rapid accumulation of genetic changes over time in response to its changing environments. This study describes an additional potent factor that contributes to the evolution of RNA infecting mammals, the deliberate mutation of the viral genome by host antiviral pathways active within the cell when it becomes infected. This so called genome editing by one or more APOBEC enzymes leads to characteristic C->U mutations that damage the viruss ability to replicate. While this pathway is well characterised as an antiviral defence against HIV and other retroviruses, this study provides evidence for its activity against a wide range of human and veterinary viruses, including HCV and foot and mouth disease virus. APOBEC-driven mutations accounted for 15-20% of standing sequence variability of RNA virus groups, representing a potent driver of RNA virus sequence diversification.","output":"Mutation bias implicates RNA editing in a wide range of mammalian RNA viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care arterial blood gas (ABG) is a blood measurement test and a useful diagnostic tool that assists with treatment and therefore improves clinical outcomes. However, numerically reported test results make rapid interpretation difficult or open to interpretation. The arterial blood gas algorithm (ABG-a) is a new digital diagnostics solution that can provide clinicians with real-time interpretation of preliminary data on safety features, oxygenation, acid-base disturbances and renal profile. The main aim of this study was to clinically validate the algorithm against senior experienced clinicians, for acid-base interpretation, in a clinical context. METHODS: We conducted a prospective international multicentre observational cross-sectional study. 346 sample sets and 64 inpatients eligible for ABG met strict sampling criteria. Agreement was evaluated using Cohen's kappa index, diagnostic accuracy was evaluated with sensitivity, specificity, efficiency or global accuracy and positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) for the prevalence in the study population. RESULTS: The concordance rates between the interpretations of the clinicians and the ABG-a for acid-base disorders were an observed global agreement of 84,3% with a Cohen's kappa coefficient 0.81; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.86; p < 0.001. For detecting accuracy normal acid-base status the algorithm has a sensitivity of 90.0% (95% CI 79.9 to 95.3), a specificity 97.2% (95% CI 94.5 to 98.6) and a global accuracy of 95.9% (95% CI 93.3 to 97.6). For the four simple acid-base disorders, respiratory alkalosis: sensitivity of 91.2 (77.0 to 97.0), a specificity 100.0 (98.8 to 100.0) and global accuracy of 99.1 (97.5 to 99.7); respiratory acidosis: sensitivity of 61.1 (38.6 to 79.7), a specificity of 100.0 (98.8 to 100.0) and global accuracy of 98.0 (95.9 to 99.0); metabolic acidosis: sensitivity of 75.8 (59.0 to 87.2), a specificity of 99.7 (98.2 to 99.9) and a global accuracy of 97.4 (95.1 to 98.6); metabolic alkalosis sensitivity of 72.2 (56.0 to 84.2), a specificity of 95.5 (92.5 to 97.3) and a global accuracy of 93.0 (88.8 to 95.3); the four complex acid-base disorders, respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, respiratory and metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis, the sensitivity, specificity and global accuracy was also high. For normal acid-base status the algorithm has PPV 87.1 (95% CI 76.6 to 93.3) %, and NPV 97.9 (95% CI 95.4 to 99.0) for a prevalence of 17.4 (95% CI 13.8 to 21.8). For the four-simple acid-base disorders and the four complex acid-base disorders the PPV and NPV were also statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The ABG-a showed very high agreement and diagnostic accuracy with experienced senior clinicians in the acid-base disorders in a clinical context. The method also provides refinement and deep complex analysis at the point-of-care that a clinician could have at the bedside on a day-to-day basis. The ABG-a method could also have the potential to reduce human errors by checking for imminent life-threatening situations, analysing the internal consistency of the results, the oxygenation and renal status of the patient.","output":"Automatic real-time analysis and interpretation of arterial blood gas sample for Point-of-care testing: Clinical validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating direct consequences on the health of affected patients.

Within the frame of Semiotic Cultural Psychosocial Theory, the study pursued two main goals: first, to explore the symbolic universes (SUs) through which Italian people represented the pandemic crisis and its meaning in their life; and second, to examine how the interpretation of the crisis varies over societal segments with different sociodemographic characteristics and specific life challenges. An online survey was available during the Italian lockdown. Respondents were asked to write a passage about the meaning of living in the time of COVID-19. A total of 1,393 questionnaires (mean = 35.47; standard deviation = 14.92; women: 64.8%; North Italy: 33%; Center Italy: 27%; South Italy: 40%) were collected.

Dependents cohabiting with an essential worker have a 17% higher likelihood of being Covid-positive compared to those cohabiting with a non-essential worker. Roommates cohabiting with an essential worker experience a 38% increase in likelihood of being Covid-positive.

Google has released Community Mobility Reports (CMRs) containing data about the movement of people, collated from mobile devices. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the use of CMRs to assess the role of mobility in spreading COVID-19 infection in India. METHODS: In this ecological study, we analyzed CMRs to determine human mobility between March and October 2020. The data were compared for the phases before the lockdown (between March 14 and 25, 2020), during lockdown (March 25-June 7, 2020), and after the lockdown (June 8-October 15, 2020) with the reference periods (ie, January 3-February 6, 2020). Another data set depicting the burden of COVID-19 as per various disease severity indicators was derived from a crowdsourced API. The relationship between the two data sets was investigated using the Kendall tau correlation to depict the correlation between mobility and disease severity. RESULTS: At the national level, mobility decreased from C38% to C77% for all areas but residential (which showed an increase of 24.6%) during the lockdown compared to the reference period. At the beginning of the unlock phase, the state of Sikkim (minimum cases: 7) with a C60% reduction in mobility depicted more mobility compared to C82% in Maharashtra (maximum cases: 1.59 million). Residential mobility was negatively correlated (C0.05 to C0.91) with all other measures of mobility. The magnitude of the correlations for intramobility indicators was comparatively low for the lockdown phase (correlation 0.5 for 12 indicators) compared to the other phases (correlation 0.5 for 45 and 18 indicators in the prelockdown and unlock phases, respectively). A high correlation coefficient between epidemiological and mobility indicators was observed for the lockdown and unlock phases compared to the prelockdown phase. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile-based open-source mobility data can be used to assess the effectiveness of social distancing in mitigating disease spread. CMR data depicted an association between mobility and disease severity, and we suggest using this technique to supplement future COVID-19 surveillance.","output":"Exploring the Utility of Google Mobility Data During the COVID-19 Pandemic in India: Digital Epidemiological Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that African Americans were twice as likely as White Americans to die from COVID-19 in 2020.

However, the number of negative data that is higher than positive data can result in a data imbalance situation that affects the classification performance, resulting in a bias in the model evaluation results.

It is still challenging to develop the oversampling technique due to the datas generalization issue. The proposed method is based on pruning by looking for specific minority areas while retaining data generalization, resulting in minority data seeds that serve as benchmarks in creating new synthesized data using bootstrap resampling techniques.

Studies have shown that risk factors of NCDs were associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and mortality. However, it is unclear whether NCD risk factors are also risks for new COVID-19 infection. This study aimed to obtain the NCD risk profiles among university's employees and its association with COVID-19 infection. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in October 2021. Participants were administrative employees of Universitas Indonesia (UI), Depok City, West Java. Assessment of NCDs risk factors was based on the World Health Organization STEPwise approach to NCD risk factor surveillance (WHO STEPS). Demographics, working and medical history data were obtained electronically by using a Google Form. Physical and laboratory examination were done in the Integrated Post for NCDs. Risks were expressed as adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) and 95% confidence interval (CI) in multivariate analyses. Results: A total of 613 employees were enrolled. Men were predominant (54.8%) and about 36% of them work in shift as security personnel. About 66.7% were overweight or obese and 77.8% had hypertension. There were 138 (22.8%) employees who had COVID-19 infection. Nearly all (95.6%) have completed COVID-19 vaccination. At-risk waist circumference (ORadj 1.74, 95% CI 1.17-2.60, p=0.007) and total cholesterol level of 200-239 mg/dL (ORadj 2.24, 95% CI 1.15-4.33, p=0.017) were independent risk factors, but shift work (ORadj 0.54, 95% CI 0.24-0.84, p=0.006) was protective to COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: The prevalence of NCDs risk factors among university administrative employees was high, increasing the risk for COVID-19 infection.

As the pandemic continues to affect these services an evaluation was conducted to determine whether telephone consultations implemented during the pandemic should be maintained long term. The objective was to evaluate this new service and to understand patient experience. METHODS: This study was conducted via a telephone survey. Staff working in the Macmillan centres across the Trust called patients to survey them about their experience of telephone consultations. Data were collected 23/06/20 - 17/07/20. A mix of eight open and closed questions were asked. Data were collected on an Excel spreadsheet and patient identifiable information was anonymised. RESULTS: 55 patients accepted to participate in this study. Out of 55, 39 patients rated the phone consultation they had as either 4 or 5 out of 5. When asked if they would like to continue with phone clinics 33 said they would. The majority of consultations were conducted by doctors (43/55). Patients commented they had received great support from their healthcare professionals and they felt that phone consultations were safer in the current climate. Three of the patients felt the calls were rushed and others found it difficult to discuss pain management, sides effects and post-surgery issues.

METHODS: We conducted an observational study of 136 EDs from January 2019 to September 2020, using 2020-to-2019 3-week moving ratios for ED visits, complexity, revenue, and staffing expenses. We tabulated 2020-to-2019 staffing ratios and calculated hour and full-time-equivalent changes. RESULTS: Following the COVID-19 pandemic's onset, geriatric (age &#8805;65), adult (age 18 to 64), and pediatric (age <18) ED visits declined by 43%, 40%, and 73%, respectively, compared to 2019 visits and rose thereafter but remained below 2019 levels through September. Relative value units per visit rose by 8%, 9%, and 18%, respectively, compared to 2019, while ED admission rates rose by 32%. Both fell subsequently but remained above 2019 levels through September. Revenues dropped sharply early in the pandemic and rose gradually but remained below 2019 levels. In medium and large EDs, staffing and expenses were lowered with a lag, largely compensating for lower revenue at these sites, and barely at freestanding EDs. Staffing and expense reductions could not match revenue losses in smaller EDs. During the pandemic, emergency physician and advanced practice provider clinical hours and compensation fell 15% and 27%, respectively, corresponding to 174 lost physician and 193 lost advanced practice provider full-time-equivalent positions. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted the economics of ED care, with large drops in overall and, in particular, low-acuity ED visits, necessitating reductions in clinical hours.

The effects of some previously tested interventions for vasovagal symptoms, for example, applied tension (AT), may be related to reduction of hyperventilation. More targeted breathing techniques might be useful. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS This was a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of AT, a slow, shallow \\"anti-hyperventilation\\" breathing technique previously tested in phobic individuals (respiration control [RESP]), the combination of AT and RESP, and no intervention on blood donors participating in university clinics. A total of 547 eligible donors were assigned randomly to one of these four groups. Observational, self-report, and physiologic measures (primarily via respiratory capnometry) were obtained. RESULTS Although both RESP and AT had some positive impact on blood donation outcome, the effects of RESP were more numerous, albeit limited primarily to donors who had less general fear of medical procedures. For example, lower-fear donors assigned to practice RESP had significantly lower Blood Donation Reaction Inventory scores and were significantly less likely to require treatment for symptoms than no-treatment individuals. In general, RESP led to a significant decrease in respiration rate, though it did not influence end-tidal CO2 , a more precise measure of hyperventilation. CONCLUSION While the mechanisms remain somewhat unclear and the interventions did not benefit more fearful, higher-risk donors, respiration control is a promising additional approach to reducing vasovagal symptoms.","output":"Respiration and applied tension strategies to reduce vasovagal reactions to blood donation: A randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on all aspects of life.

At our centers, over 1000 patients are followed on a digital platform, including those at risk of heart failure and device wearers. In addition, there is an annual trend of over 400 patients who are diagnosed electronically with AMI and relative percutaneous coronary treatment. The use of remote systems has allowed for some patients to early highlight threatening arrhythmias and/or device malfunctions, for others to prematurely intercept symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure. A clear improvement in prognosis and quality of life was therefore observed. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in Western countries.

Such a relationship has been well defined for temperate regions. However, to date no models capable of capturing the diverse seasonal pattern in tropical and subtropical climates exist. In addition, multiple influenza viruses could cocirculate and shape epidemic dynamics. Here we construct seven mechanistic epidemic models to test the effect of two major climate drivers (humidity and temperature) and multi-strain co-circulation on influenza transmission in Hong Kong, an influenza epidemic center located in the subtropics. Based on model fit to long-term influenza surveillance data from 1998 to 2018, we found that a simple model incorporating the effect of both humidity and temperature best recreated the influenza epidemic patterns observed in Hong Kong. The model quantifies a bimodal effect of absolute humidity on influenza transmission where both low and very high humidity levels facilitate transmission quadratically; the model also quantifies the monotonic but nonlinear relationship with temperature. In addition, model results suggest that, at the population level, a shorter immunity period can approximate the co-circulation of influenza virus (sub)types. The basic reproductive number R(0) estimated by the best-fit model is also consistent with laboratory influenza survival and transmission studies under various combinations of humidity and temperature levels. Overall, our study has developed a simple mechanistic model capable of quantifying the impact of climate drivers on influenza transmission in (sub)tropical regions. This model can be applied to improve influenza forecasting in the (sub)tropics in the future.","output":"Modeling influenza seasonality in the tropics and subtropics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ethical principles and laws have developed as medical practice and research have grown.

One well-cited theoretical account for this attractiveness effect (White et al., 2013) holds that it reflects an adaptive psychological response to disease threats. Voters are predicted to upregulate preferences for attractiveness because it constitutes a cue to health. The global COVID-19 pandemic constitutes an ecologically relevant and realistic setting for further testing this prediction. Here, we report the results from six tests of the prediction based on two large and nationally representative surveys conducted in Denmark (n=3,297) at the outbreak of the pandemic and one year later. Utilizing experimental techniques, validated individual difference measures of perceived disease threat and geographic data on COVID-19 severity, we do not find that disease threats like the COVID-19 pandemic upregulate preferences for attractive and healthy political or non-political leaders. Instead, respondents display heightened preferences for health in socially proximate relations (i.e. colleagues). Moreover, individuals who react aversively to situations involving risks of pathogen transmission (scoring high in Germ Aversion) report higher importance of a wide range of leadership traits, rather than for health and attractiveness in particular.

As the experience of working in the context of a pandemic shows, it is advisable to use the principles of military epidemiology in the practical activities of various specialists in the national health system. They are based on a grouping of medical and non-medical measures aimed at preventing infection drifts, its spread in groups of people and in specific territories, and its removal outside of epidemic foci. Specific immunization of the population against the new coronavirus infection is important, which will ensure the stabilization and smooth out the course of the epidemic process. Aims. To analyze the current state of the global spread of the new coronavirus infection and to consider the possibility of applying the principles of military epidemiology in the fight against the new coronavirus infection.

Based on the results of the analysis of literature sources and personal practical experience in the fight against COVID-19, the most effective measures of anti-epidemic protection of the population to date are summarized. Approaches to the organization of sanitary and anti-epidemic (preventive) measures based on the principles of military epidemiology are proposed: the separation of medical care for infectious patients and their sorting according to the severity of the disease;the maximum approach to the served contingents of anti-epidemic forces and means, taking into account the current sanitary and epidemiological situation;continuous implementation of sanitary and anti-epidemic measures until the elimination of epidemic foci;ensuring the mobility and constant readiness of the forces and means involved in carrying out sanitary and anti-epidemic measures. ? 2021, Numikom.

Controversy continues to exist regarding optimal treatment and rehabilitation protocols. The objective of this study was to investigate the temporal effects of surgical repair and immobilization or activity on Achilles tendon healing and limb function after complete transection in rodents. METHODS Injured tendons were repaired (n = 64) or left nonrepaired (n = 64). The animals in both cohorts were further randomized into groups immobilized in plantar flexion for 1, 3, or 6 weeks that later resumed cage and treadmill activity for 5, 3, or 0 weeks, respectively (n = 36 for each regimen), which were euthanized at 6 weeks after injury, or into groups immobilized for 1 week and then euthanized (n = 20). RESULTS At 6 weeks after injury, the groups that had 1 week of immobilization and 5 weeks of activity had increased range of motion and decreased ankle joint toe stiffness compared with the groups that had 3 weeks of immobilization and 3 weeks of activity. The groups with 6 weeks of immobilization and no activity period had decreased tendon cross-sectional area but increased tendon echogenicity and collagen alignment. Surgical treatment dramatically decreased fatigue cycles to failure in repaired tendons from groups with 1 week of immobilization and 5 weeks of activity. Normalized comparisons between 1-week and 6-week postinjury data demonstrated that changes in tendon healing properties (area, alignment, and echogenicity) were maximized by 1 week of immobilization and 5 weeks of activity, compared with 6 weeks of immobilization and no activity period. DISCUSSION This study builds on an earlier study of Achilles tendon fatigue mechanics and functional outcomes during early healing by examining the temporal effects of different immobilization and/or activity regimens after initial postinjury immobilization. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates how the temporal postinjury healing response of rodent Achilles tendons depends on both surgical treatment and the timing of immobilization/activity timing. The different pattern of healing and qualities of repaired and nonrepaired tendons suggest that two very different healing processes may occur, depending on the chosen immobilization/activity regimen.","output":"Temporal Healing of Achilles Tendons After Injury in Rodents Depends on Surgical Treatment and Activity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) has gained attention as an alternative respiratory support for critically ill COVID-19 patients, however, the evidence behind HFNC has been unbalanced as it covers various comorbidities in hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure We sought to identify what group of patients needed HFNC and to assess whether its use impacted length of stay and survival METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed at a single center urban academic center Data collected included age, gender, BMI, medical comorbidities, length of hospital stay and mortality for all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 We compared the characteristics of the patients who received HFNC at any point during their hospitalization to all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 RESULTS: The total number of COVID-19 patients was 363 HFNC was used in 115 admitted patients, of which, 74 were in the ICU with a mean length of stay of 7 days Overall this group had an average hospital length of stay of 15 days in total as opposed to 10 2 days in non-HFNC utilizers The most common comorbidities seen in the cohort were hypertension (76 4%), diabetes mellitus (37 4%), asthma (14 6%), COPD (11 24%), and obstructive sleep apnea (4 5%) In patients who received HFNC, 41 2% survived compared to 71 8% of all COVID-19 patients CONCLUSIONS: Factors determining the outcome of patients using HFNC are not well understood Our patients who received HFNC were more likely to have underlying cardiopulmonary disease than non-HFNC utilizers Furthermore, they had a longer length of stay and a higher mortality rate in comparison to all COVID-19 patients While we specifically identified patients who received HFNC, some of these patients received other forms of supplemental oxygen therapy during their hospital stay which may confound the characteristics of this group It is also possible that patients receiving HFNC were sicker in general, which may explain their disparity in mortality and hospital stay duration Further research needs to be done in order to clarify if HFNC in COVID-19 patients, particularly those with cardiopulmonary comorbidities, is beneficial in delaying escalation of oxygen therapy and potentially prolonging survival","output":"Do COVID-19 patients who receive high-flow nasal cannula have more comorbidities and worse outcomes?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Facing the unprecedented situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, public officials at the municipality-level have no clear benchmarks or tested policies.

To describe common pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS In a single-centre parallel group pragmatic trial, 50 dogs presenting with moderate grade DBW were prospectively randomised to receive amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (group A) or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and enrofloxacin (group B). Swabs were taken for culture and susceptibility testing at admission. Stabilisation, wound care and surgical debridement were performed at the discretion of admitting clinicians. The primary outcome was complication due to infection at 10 days, with Bayesian inference used to estimate the difference in proportions between treatment groups. RESULTS Of the 24 dogs in treatment group A, 1 required the addition of enrofloxacin at re-examination. None of the 26 dogs in group B required alteration of antimicrobial coverage. The difference in complication rate due to infection between treatment groups was 4.2%. Twenty-one different organisms were identified: Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Neisseria spp., Pasteurella multocida and P. canis were the most common.

Further, cumulative COVID-19 incidence during the first three months of the pandemic was moderately correlated with both asthma hospitalizations and estimated prevalence, suggesting similar underlying factors may be affecting both conditions. Additionally, 137 CTs were identified where social and environmental vulnerabilities co-existed, of which 75 (55%) had high estimated prevalence of asthma.

We estimate that VOC 202012/01 is 56% more transmissible (95% credible interval across three regions 50-74%) than preexisting variants of SARS-CoV-2. We were unable to find clear evidence that VOC 202012/01 results in greater or lesser severity of disease than preexisting variants. Nevertheless, the increase in transmissibility is likely to lead to a large increase in incidence, with COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths projected to reach higher levels in 2021 than were observed in 2020, even if regional tiered restrictions implemented before 19 December are maintained. Our estimates suggest that control measures of a similar stringency to the national lockdown implemented in England in November 2020 are unlikely to reduce the effective reproduction number Rt to less than 1, unless primary schools, secondary schools, and universities are also closed.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the number of Red Knots found at Delaware Bay dramatically declined from ~50,000 to ~13,000. Horseshoe crabs have been harvested for use as bait in eel and whelk fisheries since at least 1990, and some avian conservation biologists hypothesized that harvest levels in the 1990s prevented sufficient refueling for successful migration to the breeding grounds, nesting, and survival for the remainder of the annual cycle. Since 2013, the harvest of horseshoe crabs in the Delaware Bay region has been managed using an Adaptive Resource Management (ARM) framework. The objective of the ARM framework is to manage sustainable harvest of Delaware Bay horseshoe crabs while maintaining ecosystem integrity and supporting Red Knot recovery with adequate stopover habitat for Red Knots and other migrating shorebirds. For annual harvest recommendations, the ARM framework requires annual estimates of horseshoe crab population size and the Red Knot stopover population. We conducted a mark-recapture-resight investigation to estimate the passage population of Red Knots at Delaware Bay in 2021.

Social determinants and pre-existing health conditions place homeless people at increased risk of severe disease. Described outbreaks in homeless shelters resulted in high proportions of infected residents and staff members. In addition to other infection prevention strategies, regular shelter-wide (universal) testing for COVID-19 may be valuable, depending on the level of community transmission and when resources permit. MethodsThis was a prospective feasibility cohort study to evaluate universal testing for COVID-19 at a homeless shelter with 106 beds in Berlin, Germany. Co-researchers were recruited from the shelter staff. A PCR analysis of saliva or self-collected nasal/oral swab was performed weekly over a period of 3 weeks in July 2020. Acceptability and implementation barriers were analyzed by process evaluation using mixed methods including evaluation sheets, focus group discussion and a structured questionnaire. ResultsNinety-three out of 124 (75%) residents were approached to participate in the study. Fifty-one out of the 93 residents (54.8%) gave written informed consent. High retention rates (88.9% - 93.6%) of a weekly respiratory specimen were reached, but repeated collection attempts, as well as assistance were required. A self-collected nasal/oral swab was considered easier and more hygienic to collect than a saliva specimen. No resident was tested positive. Language barriers were the main reason for non-participation. Flexibility of sample collection schedules, the use of video and audio materials, and concise written information were the main recommendations of the co-researchers for future implementation. ConclusionVoluntary universal testing for COVID-19 is feasible in homeless shelters. Universal testing of high-risk facilities will require flexible approaches, considering the level of the community transmission, the available resources, and the local recommendations. Lack of human resources and laboratory capacity may be a major barrier for implementation of universal testing, requiring adapted approaches compared to standard individual testing. Assisted self-collection of specimens and barrier free communication may facilitate implementation in homeless shelters.

Among 809 KTRs, 64 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 disease between April 2020 and February 2021, were evaluated. Twenty-nine patients with pneumonia confirmed by chest computed tomography (CCT) were hospitalized. The treatment protocol included high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, favipiravir, enoxaparin, and empirical antibiotics. Patients with pneumonic involvement of more than 25% on CCT with or without respiratory failure were given a total of 2 g/kg intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy. Nonresponders received tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antibody. Of the 29 patients with pneumonia, 6 were treated in other hospitals. These six patients did not receive IVIg and 5 of them deceased. In our center, IVIg treatment was applied to 15 of 23 patients. Seven of them required tocilizumab.

Parents have authority over their children, but during adolescence there is an increasing desire for independence. The aim of the study was to explore adolescents experience of challenges identified by adolescents ages 10C19 years attending HIV care and treatment at Temeke Regional Referral Hospital in Tanzania. METHODS: An exploratory descriptive qualitative design was employed in the HIV Care and Treatment Centre (CTC) in the Out-Patient Department at the Temeke Regional Referral Hospital in Tanzania with adolescents living with HIV who were 10C19 years of age. A total of 22 adolescents participated in semi-structured face-to-face interviews after parental consent and adolescent assent were obtained. Participants were interviewed about their participation in decisions to be tested for HIV and enrolled in the CTC, concerns surrounding disclosure of their HIV status to the adolescent or to others, stigma and discrimination, and the effect of these challenges on their adherence to medication. All interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim in Swahili, and back-translated to English. Data analysis included both inductive and deductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Qualitative themes identified included lack of participation in decisions about HIV testing, challenges to enrollment in care and treatment; issues around disclosure of HIV status, such as delays in disclosure to the adolescent and disclosure to other persons and benefits and harms of such disclosures; and factors supporting and interfering with adherence to ART, such as parental support, organizational (clinic) support and problems, and self-stigmatization and shame. CONCLUSION: Lack of adolescents involvement in their care decision making and delayed disclosure of HIV status to the adolescent were identified concerns, leading to poor adherence to ART among adolescents. Disclosure to others, especially teachers, helped adolescents at school to take their medication properly. Disclosure to others led to stigma and discrimination for some adolescents.

On one hand, one of the first protective barriers set up to prevent viral replication, spread or persistence involves the induction of apoptotic cell death that aims to limit the availability of the cellular components for viral amplification. On the other hand, while they completely depend on the host molecular machinery, viruses also need to evade the cellular responses that are meant to destroy them. The existence of numerous antiapoptotic products within the viral kingdom proves that apoptosis constitutes a major threat that should better be bypassed. Among the different strategies developed to deal with apoptosis, one is based on what viruses do best: backfiring the cell on itself. Several unrelated viruses have been described to take advantage of apoptosis induction by expressing proteins targeted by caspases, the key effectors of apoptotic cell death.

In this work, we introduced a non-Newtonian flow model to describe the flow of lithium in lithium metal and incorporate the contributions of viscous dissipation, surface energy, kinetic energy and strain energy in the analysis of the stress relaxation and the growth of a Li-sphere and a Li-whisker. Nonlinear second-order differential equations are derived for the growth of the Li-sphere and the Li-whisker. Closed-form solutions for the temporal evolution of the Li-sphere and the Li-whisker are obtained under the conditions such that the contributions of the surface energy, kinetic energy and strain energy stored in the cantilever beam to the stress relaxation in the lithium metal are negligible. Using the Lippmann relation in specific surface energy, we demonstrated that increasing the electric potential reduces the resistance to the flow of lithium into the Li-sphere and the Li-whisker.

We present the case of a 42-year-old female healthcare worker who was diagnosed with subacute thyroiditis 4 days after receiving her second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Her clinical course followed the classical pattern for thyroiditis with spontaneous return to euthyroidism at 6 months post-presentation. The autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants has been implicated as a cause of autoimmune conditions post-vaccination and is a potential mechanism for subacute thyroiditis in our case. LEARNING POINTS: Subacute thyroiditis should be considered in all patients who receive any kind of vaccine for COVID-19 and subsequently develop symptoms or signs of hyperthyroidism or neck pain. Subacute thyroiditis is a self-limiting condition, and recognising it is important as no specific thyroid treatment (antithyroid drugs or thyroid hormone replacement) is necessary for most patients. The autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants may be an under-recognised cause of endocrinopathies and should particularly be considered post-vaccination.","output":"Subacute thyroiditis post-Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccination for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The United States is facing an opioid epidemic that has only worsened with the COVID-19 pandemic. There is little evidence regarding patterns of opioid use among patients with total hip replacement (THR). Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has put forward guidelines for prescribing opioids, it does not include guidance specifically for THR patients suffering from presurgical and postsurgical pain. The purpose of this study was to (1) compare presurgical and postsurgical opioid rates, (2) compare presurgical and postsurgical morphine milligram equivalents (MME), and (3) determine whether having a presurgical opioid prescription predicts the receipt of postsurgical opioid prescriptions among patients undergoing THR surgery. Retrospective cohort analysis of 4,405 patients undergoing THR at a major academic medical center in the United States from April 30, 2015, to April 30, 2018, was done. Patient characteristics, opioid rates, and average MME/day/person were described. Logistic regression was used to determine whether presurgical opioid prescription and opioid risk level predicted postsurgical opioid prescribing. Median age was 64 years (range = 18-85 years); patients were primarily Caucasian/White (78.8%) and female (54.7%). Opioid prescription rates in this sample for the 12-month presurgical and postsurgical periods were 66.1% and 95.6%, respectively. Oxycodone was the most common opioid prescribed in both periods. Among those prescribed an opioid, moderate/high risk for overdose and/or death was 6.3% presurgery and 19.8% postsurgery. Patients with a comorbidity were two times more likely to receive an opioid prescription in the postsurgical period. The median average MME/day/person was 26.5 (range = 0.3-180.0) for patients with an opioid prescribed during the presurgery period and 40.4 (range = 1.5-270.0) during the postsurgery period. Opioid use, regardless of strength, in the presurgical period as well as having one or more comorbidities predicted opioid use in the postsurgical period.","output":"Preoperative and Postoperative Opioid Prescription Rates in the Total Hip Replacement Surgical Patient."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) afflicts genetically predisposed individuals and is associated with T lymphocyte-mediated damage to the myelin sheath of neurons in the central nervous system, resulting in severely impaired signal transmission. The mechanisms of the induction and manifestation of MS are not entirely understood. The control of autoimmune disorders is accomplished by both central tolerance in which autoreactive T lymphocytes are eliminated in the thymus and by tolerance mechanisms that operate in the periphery. Among the many mechanisms described, T regulatory (Treg) cells derived from the thymus (tTregs) and induced (iTregs) in the periphery as well as T regulatory type 1 cells (Tr1) are involved in many disease models. However, the precise details of the generation and perpetuation of these various Treg subsets and their relevance to the regulation of autoimmune diseases remain elusive.

However, little is known about the features of these effector cells from people living with HIV (PLWH), particularly from those who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) during acute infection. Our study design was to use 42-parameter CyTOF to conduct deep phenotyping of paired blood- and lymph node (LN)-derived T and NK cells from three groups of HIV+ aviremic individuals: elite controllers (N = 5), and ART-suppressed individuals who had started therapy during chronic (N = 6) vs. acute infection (N = 8), the latter of which is associated with better outcomes. We found that acute-treated individuals are enriched for specific subsets of T and NK cells, including blood-derived CD56-CD16+ NK cells previously associated with HIV control, and LN-derived CD4+ T follicular helper cells with heightened expansion potential. An in-depth comparison of the features of the cells from blood vs. LNs of individuals from our cohort revealed that T cells from blood were more activated than those from LNs. By contrast, LNs were enriched for follicle-homing CXCR5+ CD8+ T cells, which expressed increased levels of inhibitory receptors and markers of survival and proliferation as compared to their CXCR5- counterparts. In addition, a subset of memory-like CD56(bright)TCF1+ NK cells was enriched in LNs relative to blood. These results together suggest unique T and NK cell features in acute-treated individuals, and highlight the importance of examining effector cells not only in blood but also the lymphoid tissue compartment, where the reservoir mostly persists, and where these cells take on distinct phenotypic features.","output":"Deep Phenotypic Analysis of Blood and Lymphoid T and NK Cells From HIV+ Controllers and ART-Suppressed Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this chapter, the biology of HIV infection is discussed, with a focus on HIV virology and patient prognosis and the process of seroconversion (very early HIV infection).

The positive implications of mitigation generally accrue as these measures are adopted early, with the most striking effects seen when the reproductive number is lowered to a level Rc1.0. As the delay in adopting measures exceeds approximately the half-way point to the peak of an outbreak, the effects of lowering R0 markedly decrease. Aiming for reproduction numbers close to 1.0 can substantially reduce fatality probabilities over short time scales, particularly for larger populations. We conclude that research is urgently needed on how mitigation measures impact R0 and how these can be optimized so as to achieve Rc1.0 whilst supporting individual freedoms, society and the economy.","output":"Countries should aim to lower the reproduction number R close to 1.0 for the short-term mitigation of COVID-19 outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High air pollutant emissions in China have become serious environmental issues threatening public health.

In light of these benefits, it is imperative to learn the antecedents and underlying mechanisms for this to maintain and enhance engagement. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the factors and influencing mechanisms related to citizen engagement with the TikTok account of the National Health Commission of China during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using a web crawler, 355 short videos were collected from the Healthy China account on TikTok (with more than 3 million followers throughout China), covering the period from January 21, 2020, to April 25, 2020. The title and video length, as well as the number of likes, shares, and comments were collected for each video. After classifying them using content analysis, a series of negative binomial regression analyses were completed. RESULTS: Among the 355 videos, 154 (43.4%) related to guidance for clinicians, patients, and ordinary citizens, followed by information concerning the government's handling of the pandemic (n=100, 28.2%), the latest news about COVID-19 (n=61, 17.2%), and appreciation toward frontline emergency services (n=40, 11.3%). Video length, titles, dialogic loop, and content type all influenced the level of citizen engagement. Specifically, video length was negatively associated with the number of likes (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=0.19, P<.001) and comments (IRR=0.39, P<.001). Title length was positively related to the number of shares (IRR=24.25, P=.01), likes (IRR=8.50, P=.03), and comments (IRR=7.85, P=.02). Dialogic loop negatively predicted the number of shares (IRR=0.56, P=.03). In comparison to appreciative information, information about the government's handling of the situation (IRR=5.16, P<.001) and guidelines information (IRR=7.31, P<.001) were positively correlated with the number of shares, while the latest news was negatively related to the number of likes received (IRR=0.46, P=.004). More importantly, the relationship between predictors and citizen engagement was moderated by the emotional valence of video titles. Longer videos with positive titles received a higher number of likes (IRR=21.72, P=.04) and comments (IRR=10.14, P=.047). Furthermore, for short videos related to government handling of the pandemic (IRR=14.48, P=.04) and guidance for stakeholders (IRR=7.59, P=.04), positive titles received a greater number of shares. Videos related to the latest news (IRR=66.69, P=.04) received more likes if the video title displayed higher levels of positive emotion. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, videos were frequently published on government social media platforms. Video length, title, dialogic loop, and content type significantly influenced the level of citizen engagement. These relationships were moderated by the emotional valence of the video's title. Our findings have implications for maintaining and enhancing citizen engagement via government social media.","output":"Factors Driving Citizen Engagement With Government TikTok Accounts During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Model Development and Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Nodal and distant metastases of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas are very rare and lead to dismal prognoses. Immunotherapy is approved only for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma patients not amenable to surgery or curative radiation therapy. Radiation therapy has a clear role as an adjuvant treatment for locally advanced disease. Radiation therapy may also have an important role in inoperable and metastatic disease. Oligometastatic disease is a condition that needs to be defined for this carcinoma. This review aims to offer to the readers a comprehensive overview of studies about the role of radiotherapy in the management of advanced or metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, also assuming possible further developments in the light of the recent discoveries about tumor biology. The present paper has the merit of re-focusing great attention on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of radiotherapy in these not yet properly explored scenarios. ABSTRACT: Radiation therapy (RT) is an effective therapeutic option for small localized cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) among patients who are not eligible for or refuse surgery. RT also has a defined role as an adjuvant treatment in cases of adverse features that predispose to tumor recurrence after local excision. Since the development of cSCC is often a late consequence of chronic sun exposure, its occurrence is more common among elderly patients whose comorbidities may contraindicate surgical procedures. These could be impeded not only by frail medical conditions but also by technical issues. Indeed, an aggressive locoregional behavior of cSCC may culminate in unresectability due to widespread invasion of neighboring tissues. Moreover, cSCC could develop distant metastases. Both locally advanced and metastatic cSCCs carry a poor prognosis. In these scenarios, recent discoveries of tumor molecular targets are promoting the use of promising systemic therapies, especially immunotherapy, over RT. However, the results from using immunotherapy and, even more so, of chemotherapy are still not optimal. By contrast, advances in radiation delivery equipment can safely treat even large and complex-shaped cSCC targets in challenging body sites. In addition, RT could also have a role in metastatic cSCC settings by enhancing the effectiveness of concomitant immunotherapy. The aim of this review is to summarize and comment on the body of literature about the use of radiotherapy for operable and inoperable locally advanced cSCCs and for metastatic ones in an attempt to define its current and future role.","output":"Advanced or Metastatic Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma: The Current and Future Role of Radiation Therapy in the Era of Immunotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as global pandemic since there are tremendous growing numbers of confirmed cases for SARS-C0V-2 infection, the number of affected countries and high mortality rate.

Results: Medical directors from all 13 helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) bases, the 7 search and rescue (SAR) helicopter bases, and the 4 blood banks that support HEMS with LTOWB responded to the survey. All HEMS and SAR helicopter services carry LTOWB or blood components. Four of 20 (20%) HEMS bases have implemented LTOWB. A majority of services (18/20, 90%) have a preference for LTOWB, primarily because LTOWB enables early balanced transfusion and has logistical benefits in time-critical emergencies and during prolonged evacuations.

The recently characterized E protein ion channel activity (EIC) has also been implicated in modulating viral pathogenesis. In this study, we used infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) as a model to study EIC. Two recombinant IBVs (rIBVs) harboring EIC-inactivating mutations C rT16A and rA26F C were serially passaged, and several compensatory mutations were identified in the transmembrane domain (TMD). Two rIBVs harboring these putative EIC-reverting mutations C rT16A/A26V and rA26F/F14N C were recovered. Compared with the parental rIBV-p65 control, all four EIC mutants exhibited comparable levels of intracellular RNA synthesis, structural protein production, and virion assembly. Our results showed that the IBV EIC contributed to the induction of ER stress response, as up-regulation of ER stress-related genes was markedly reduced in cells infected with the EIC-defective mutants. EIC-defective mutants also formed smaller plaques, released significantly less infectious virions into the culture supernatant, and had lower levels of viral fitness in cell culture. Significantly, all these defective phenotypes were restored in cells infected with the putative EIC revertants. EIC mutations were also implicated in regulating IBV-induced apoptosis, induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and viral pathogenicity in vivo. Taken together, this study highlights the importance of CoV EIC in modulating virion release and various aspects of CoV C host interaction.","output":"Regulation of the ER Stress Response by the Ion Channel Activity of the Infectious Bronchitis Coronavirus Envelope Protein Modulates Virion Release, Apoptosis, Viral Fitness, and Pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In a time of global uncertainty, understanding the psychological health of the American public is imperative. There are no current data on anxiety trends among adults in the United States (US) over time. This study aimed to investigate prevalence of anxiety among US adults from 2008-2018. METHODS: Data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which is an annual, cross-sectional survey on substance use and mental health in the US, were analyzed in 2020. Prevalence of past-month anxiety was estimated among those ages 18, by survey year from 2008 to 2018. Time trends were tested using logistic regression. RESULTS: Anxiety increased from 5.12% in 2008 to 6.68% in 2018 (p<.0001) among adult Americans. Stratification by age revealed the most notable increase from 7.97% to 14.66% among respondents 18-25 years old (p<.001), which was a more rapid increase than among 26-34 and 35-49 year olds (differential time trend p<.001). Anxiety did not significantly increase among those ages 50 and older. Anxiety increased more rapidly among those never married and with some college education, relative to their respective counterparts. Apart from age, marital status and education, anxiety increased consistently among sociodemographic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety is increasing among adults under age 50 in the US, with more rapid increase among young adults.

Besides theoretical assumptions, there is no evidence that OSA may favor SARS-CoV-2 acquisition or may lead to a more severe disease. Taking the opportunity of the Atahualpa Project cohort, we aimed to assess the relationship between previously diagnosed OSA and SARS-CoV-2 infection in older adults living in rural Ecuador. PATIENTS AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were determined in 180 individuals aged > 60 years that underwent polysomnography previously to this novel pandemic. Those with OSA remained untreated due to income limitations. Exposure-effect models were fitted with OSA as the exposure, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and symptomatology as the outcomes, and confounders - age, gender, obesity, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, individuals per house, home confinement - as independent variables. RESULTS: A total of 87 (48%) individuals were seropositive to SARS-CoV-2, 77% of whom were symptomatic. The mean apnea/hypopnea index was 11.1  11.7 episodes per hour, with 83 (46%) individuals having mild, and 38 (21%) moderate-to-severe OSA. Exposure-effect models demonstrated lack of relationship between OSA and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and symptomatology.

Surveys from Australia and the United Kingdom show high clinical consistency in SLP tracheostomy management, and that practice follows guidelines, research evidence and protocols. Swedish SLPs work with tracheostomised patients, however, the content and extent of this practice, and how it compares to international research is unknown. This study reports how SLPs in Sweden work with tracheostomised patients, investigating (a) the differences and similarities in SLPs tracheostomy management and (b) the facilitators and barriers to tracheostomy management, as reported by SLPs. Methods: A study-specific, online questionnaire was completed by 28 SLPs who had managed tracheostomised patients during the previous year. This study was conducted in 2018, pre Covid-19 pandemic. The answers were analysed for exploratory descriptive comparison of data. Content analyses were made on answers from open-ended questions. Results: Swedish SLPs manage tracheostomised patients, both for dysphagia and communication. During this study, the use of protocols and guidelines were limited and SLPs were often not part of a tracheostomy team. Speech-language pathologists reported that the biggest challenges in tracheostomy management were in (a) collaboration with other professionals, (b) unclear roles and (c) self-perceived inexperience. Improved collaboration with other professionals and clearer roles was suggested to facilitate team tracheostomy management.

Data regarding the immunogenicity of anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 messenger RNA (anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA) vaccines in dialysis patients were published recently. We assessed the immunogenicity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine in dialysis patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred-nine patients on hemodialysis (n = 85) or peritoneal dialysis (n = 24) have received two injections of 30-g doses of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech), that were administered intramuscularly 28 days apart. Those who were still seronegative after the second dose were given a third dose one month later. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were tested before and after vaccination. RESULTS: Ninety-one out of the 102 patients who had at least a one-month follow-up after the second (n = 97) or the third (n = 5) vaccine doses had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroconversion rate was 88.7% (86 out of 97 patients) among SARS-CoV-2 seronegative patients at the initiation of vaccination. Receiving immunosuppressive therapy was an independent predictive factor for non-response to vaccination. CONCLUSION: Due to high immunogenicity and safety of mRNA vaccines, we strongly recommend prioritizing a two-doses vaccination of dialysis patients. A third dose can be required in non-responders to two doses.

The unprecedented level of uncertainty associated with the pandemic may be a contributing factor to stress and anxiety, especially among individuals with high intolerance to uncertainty (Rettie & Daniels, 2021). Individual differences in need for cognitive closure have also been linked to mental distress during unpredictable situations (Berenbaum et al., 2008). The present study tested the hypothesis that individuals with a high need for cognitive closure would experience relatively higher stress and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. College students (N = 400) completed an abbreviated Need for Closure Scale (Roets & Van Hiel, 2011), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (Spitzer et al., 2006), and the short-version of the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen & Williamson, 1988). Results supported the hypothesized relationship between high need for cognitive closure and higher levels of stress and anxiety.

Balance retraining programs are effective in reducing falls and in improving balance and mobility. Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation is a low-level electrical stimulation used to reduce the threshold for the firing of vestibular neurons via a mechanism of stochastic resonance. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the feasibility of using noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation to augment a balance training program for older adults at risk of falls. We hypothesize that noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation will enhance the effects of balance retraining in older adults at risk of falls METHODS: In this 3-armed randomized controlled trial, community dwelling older adults at risk of falling will be randomly assigned to a noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation plus balance program (noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation group), sham plus balance program (sham group), or a no treatment group (control). Participants will attend the exercise group twice a week for 8 weeks with assessment of balance and gait pretreatment, posttreatment, and at 3 months postintervention. Primary outcome measures include postural sway, measured by center of pressure velocity, area and root mean square, and gait parameters such as speed, step width, step variability, and double support time. Spatial memory will also be measured using the triangle completion task and the 4 Mountains Test. RESULTS: Recruitment began in November 2020. Data collection and analysis are expected to be completed by December 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This study will evaluate the feasibility of using noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation alongside balance retraining in older adults at risk of falls and will inform the design of a fully powered randomized controlled trial.

The journey of e-Governance initiatives in court administration started mainly in the mid-1990s and was further enhanced after enactment of the Information Technology Act 2000 (amended 2008). E-courts were launched as a part of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) way back in 2006. However, it appears that the sudden and unexpected advent of COVID-19 crisis has provided a greater fillip in bringing about a rapid transformation in the manner of court administration in the country. As physical appearances by lawyers and litigants were discouraged in courts due to the strict safety protocols of the COVID-19 crisis, greater use of technology, already put in place, came in handy in justice and court administration. This paper aims to broadly cover the situation in India before the COVID-19 crisis, and examine how the court administration reacted to various challenges thrown up by the COVID-19 crisis, particularly, in the period after lockdown. It will outline the major technological initiatives existing in court administration in India before the advent of the COVID-19 crisis, such as court related apps, before discussing how courts at various levels, including Lok Adalats (Peoples Courts), the Supreme Court, the High Courts and the District and Subordinate Court, modified the manner of court functioning during COVID, accelerating the move towards e-Judiciary. It will then discuss some of the challenges that have been encountered, including reservations of the Bar, and major hurdles facing the court administration post-COVID 19. ? 2021 The Author(s).

Findings were based on data published by the Mississippi State Department of Health between March 11 and July 16, 2020. The COVID-19 case rate and case fatality rate (CFR) differed by gender and race, while MR only differed by race. Residents aged 80 years or older and those who live in a non-metro area had a higher case rate, CFR, and MR. After controlling for selected factors, researchers found that the percent of residents who are obese, low income, or with certain chronic conditions were associated with the county COVID-19 case rate, CFR, and/or MR, though some were negatively related. The findings may help the state to identify counties with higher COVID-19 case rate, CFR, and MR based on county demographics and the degree of its chronic conditions.","output":"Subgroup comparison of COVID-19 case and mortality with associated factors in Mississippi: findings from analysis of the first four months of public data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current consensus is that 2 doses of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are needed for people without COVID-19 history, while for those who had suffered COVID-19, a single dose may be enough to achieve high levels of immunization. This consensus has been based on results obtained in middle-aged populations, whereas only few data exist for the oldest and most frail adults such as nursing home residents (NH-Res) that is, the population most vulnerable to develop severe forms of COVID-19. In this study, we studied the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG(S) level of NH-Res and healthcare workers (HCWs) with or without a history of COVID-19 infection taking into account the time since immunization (COVID-19 and/or vaccination). 654 subjects were analyzed: 397 NH-Res (median age 88, IQR 82-93 years, 75% women) and 257 Health Care Workers (HCWs, median 46, IQR 38-54 years, 81% women). NH-Res and HCWs were classified in one of the following 3 groups: No-COVID history and 2 vaccine shots (COV-NO/2VACC); Yes-COVID history and 1 (COV-YES/1VACC) or 2 (COV-YES/2VACC) vaccine injections. The time-related decrease in IgG (S) in subjects without COVID-19 history, SARS-COV-2 serology would be negative in HCWs approximately 220 days and in residents 180 days after vaccination. This time-related decrease was much slower in those with history of COVID. NH-Res belonging into the COV-NO/2VACC and the COV-YES/1VACC groups showed lower IgG (S) levels than the same groups of HCWs (for both groups, p<0.0001), whereas in the group COV-YES/2VACC, IgG (S) levels were similar in NH-Res and HCWs (p=0.88). These results remained unchanged after adjustment for age and duration since immunization. Thus, in NH-Res, 2 vaccine shots were associated with a more pronounced immune response, whereas in HCWs, 1 or 2 vaccine shots in patients with COVID-19 history did make any difference. These results indicate significant differences in mRNA vaccination between NH-Res and middle-aged controls, and could contribute to the specification of vaccine policy in this very old, frail population.","output":"Comparative analysis of post-vaccination anti-spike IgG antibodies in old Nursing Home Residents and in middle-aged Healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disasters connected to natural hazards can at the same time be unfolding events, as well as structural phenomena with unequal disaster risk constructed over an extended timespan. Hence, in disaster studies, temporality and spatiality are central, yet often implicit, concepts employed to make sense of the disaster phenomena. In this article we explicitly focus on temporality and spatiality within qualitative disaster studies, particularly those containing ethnographic elements. We use Doreen Masseys idea of space-time trajectories to analyze and illustrate how in qualitative disaster studies the trajectories of the disaster, research participants, and the researcher entangle in diverse ways. The focus is on how temporality and spatiality are present in the construction of data. The article is mainly conceptual, with illustrations drawn from empirical fieldwork on Valparaso fire of 2014 in Chile. We interrogate how researchers sensitivity to temporality and spatiality challenges the conventional notions and practices of data in qualitative disaster studies.

OBJECTIVES To identify and synthesise findings from existing qualitative studies that have explored the experiences of fathers of children with a life-limiting condition. METHODS A systematic review of qualitative research was conducted using thematic synthesis. Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Social Science Citation Index. RESULTS Findings from 30 studies were included, representing the experiences of 576 fathers of children with a range of diagnoses including cancer, cystic fibrosis, genetic and neurological conditions. Themes detailed fathers' experiences of uncertainty and shock around the time of their child's diagnosis, their accounts of a 'new normal', difficulties in discussing their emotions, forming relationships with and seeking support from professionals and working fathers' role conflicts. They discussed the life-changing nature of their child's diagnosis, an event that affected all aspects of their lives from everyday activities, to their relationships, spirituality, values and ambitions.

Data were analyzed using a six-phase thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: The discussion focused on two major areas, which resulted in multiple derived themes and subthemes. The first theme centered on the daily life of persons with tetraplegia, including changes after SCI, gain of function prioritization, and identification of psychosocial support systems that facilitate community reintegration after injury. The second theme centered on participant perceptions and recommendations for a physical activity program delivered via a telemonitoring platform. Desired design features included variations in schedule, diverse activities, or exercises included in each class, and optional two-way video to enable social interactions with classmates. CONCLUSIONS: Participants favorably viewed the concept of a physical activity program delivered via a telemonitoring platform and contributed program design ideas.

This review examines recent research studies in humans to determine whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may be used effectively and safely to target potentially deadly lung damage that may follow infection. METHODS A literature search was conducted to find published manuscripts on the treatment of ARDS and COVID-19 symptoms, disease presentation, and available treatment regimens. Electronic data bases of scientific articles and records of printed documents of JAMA journals were searched to find research publications on MSC treatment of ARDS and COVID-19. Outcome variables included mortality over varying time periods, hospital days, days on ventilator, and biological factors. RESULTS Two randomized double-blind clinical trials, 2 pilot studies, and 2 case reports described MSC use to treat ARDS with specific focus on COVID-19 and lung symptoms of cytokine storm. The MSCs were well-tolerated across studies. No significant differences in treatment outcome were found in randomized double-blind trials; however, results of 1 pilot study and 1 case report showed that MSCs led to lung symptom resolution and survival in severely ill treatment patients. CONCLUSIONS There is little published research on disease and survival outcomes among patients suffering severe lung disease associated with ARDS and COVID-19, and studies available are limited by lack of consistency in design and numerous flaws and limitations. Comparisons across studies are difficult. Nevertheless, it is documented that 8 ARDS patients with COVID-19 experienced symptom recovery and survival subsequent to MSC administration. MSCs are potentially life-saving treatment approaches for some patients who exhibit severe lung distress and have not responded to standard treatments.

Using data from Cook County Jail, we examine temporal patterns in the relationship between jail cycling (i.e., arrest and processing of individuals through jails before release) and community cases of COVID-19 in Chicago ZIP codes. We use multivariate regression analyses and a machine-learning tool, elastic regression, with 1,706 demographic control variables. We find that for each arrested individual cycled through Cook County Jail in March 2020, five additional cases of COVID-19 in their ZIP code of residence are independently attributable to the jail as of August. A total 86% of this additional disease burden is borne by majority-Black and/or -Hispanic ZIPs, accounting for 17% of cumulative COVID-19 cases in these ZIPs, 6% in majority-White ZIPs, and 13% across all ZIPs. Jail cycling in March alone can independently account for 21% of racial COVID-19 disparities in Chicago as of August 2020. Relative to all demographic variables in our analysis, jail cycling is the strongest predictor of COVID-19 rates, considerably exceeding poverty, race, and population density, for example. Arrest and incarceration policies appear to be increasing COVID-19 incidence in communities. Our data suggest that jails function as infectious disease multipliers and epidemiological pumps that are especially affecting marginalized communities.

The causal impact of these risk factors is unknown at present. METHODS: We conducted multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the observational associations between obesity traits (body mass index [BMI], waist circumference [WC]), quantitative cardiometabolic parameters (systolic blood pressure [SBP], serum glucose, serum glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and triglycerides [TG]) and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the UK Biobank cohort. One-sample MR was performed by using the genetic risk scores of obesity and cardiometabolic traits constructed from independent datasets and the genotype and phenotype data from the UK Biobank. Two-sample MR was performed using the summary statistics from COVID-19 host genetics initiative. Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to assess the risk conferred by different genetic quintiles of causative exposure traits. RESULTS: The study comprised 1,211 European participants who were tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 387,079 participants who were either untested or tested negative between 16 March 2020 to 31 May 2020. Observationally, higher BMI, WC, HbA1c and lower HDL-cholesterol were associated with higher odds of COVID-19 infection. One-sample MR analyses found causal associations between higher genetically determined BMI and LDL cholesterol and increased risk of COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR]: 1.15, confidence interval [CI]: 1.05C1.26 and OR: 1.58, CI: 1.21C2.06, per 1 standard deviation increment in BMI and LDL cholesterol respectively). Two-sample MR produced concordant results. Cox models indicated that individuals in the higher genetic risk score quintiles of BMI and LDL were more predisposed to COVID-19 (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24, CI: 1.03C1.49 and HR: 1.37, CI: 1.14C1.65, for the top vs the bottom quintile for BMI and LDL cholesterol, respectively). CONCLUSION: We identified causal associations between BMI, LDL cholesterol and susceptibility to COVID-19. In particular, individuals in higher genetic risk categories were predisposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Humans who inherit mutant TP53 alleles develop a wide range of early onset cancers, a disorder called Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS). Trp53-deficient mice recapitulate most but not all of the cancer phenotypes observed in TP53-deficient human cancers, indicating that new animal models may complement current mouse models and better inform on human disease development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The recent application of CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering technology has permitted the emergence of golden Syrian hamsters as genetic models for wide range of diseases, including cancer. Here, the first cancer phenotype of TP53 knockout golden Syrian hamsters is described. RESULTS: Hamsters that are homozygous for TP53 mutations become moribund on average ~ 139 days of age, while hamsters that are heterozygous become moribund at ~ 286 days. TP53 homozygous knockout hamsters develop a wide range of cancers, often synchronous and metastatic to multiple tissues, including lymphomas, several sarcomas, especially hemangiosarcomas, myeloid leukemias and several carcinomas. TP53 heterozygous mutants develop a more restricted tumor spectrum, primarily lymphomas.

In Canada, despite relatively high vaccine availability and uptake, willingness to accept booster shots and maintain mitigation behaviors in the post-acute phase of COVID-19 remain uncertain. The aim of the Canadian COVID-19 Experiences Project (CCEP) is threefold: 1) to identify social-cognitive and neurocognitive predictors of mitigation behaviors, 2) to identify optimal communication strategies to promote vaccination and mitigation behaviors, and 3) to examine brain health outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection and examine their longevity. METHODS: The CCEP is comprised of two components: a conventional population survey (Study 1) and a functionally interconnected laboratory study (Study 2). Study 1 will involve 6 waves of data collection. Wave 1, completed between 28 September and 21 October 2021, recruited 1,958 vaccine-hesitant (49.8%) and fully vaccinated (50.2%) adults using quota sampling to ensure maximum statistical power. Measures included a variety of social cognitive (e.g., beliefs, intentions) and neurocognitive (e.g., delay discounting) measures, followed by an opportunity to view and rate a set of professionally produced COVID-19 public service announcement (PSA) videos for perceived efficacy. Study 2 employs the same survey items and PSAs but coupled with lab-based eye tracking and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to directly quantify neural indicators of attention capture and self-reflection in a smaller community sample. In the final phase of the project, subjective impressions and neural indicators of PSA efficacy will be compared and used to inform recommendations for construction of COVID-19 PSAs into the post-acute phase of the pandemic. DISCUSSION: The CCEP provides a framework for evaluating effective COVID-19 communication strategies by levering conventional population surveys and the latest eye-tracking and brain imaging metrics.

We study how fathers and mothers are coping with this crisis in terms of childcare provision, employment, working arrangements, and psychological distress levels. We find that women have carried a heavier load than men in the provision of childcare during the COVID-19 crisis, even while still working. Mothers' current working situations appear to have a limited influence on their provision of childcare. This division of childcare is, however, associated with a reduction in working hours and an increased probability of transitioning out of employment for working mothers. Finally, we observe a small but new gap in psychological distress that emerged between mothers and women without school-age children in the household in early April. This new gap appears to be driven by higher levels of psychological distress reported by mothers of elementary school-age and younger children.","output":"Gender differences in couples' division of childcare, work and mental health during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: With the COVID-19 pandemic lasting over a year and affecting all continents, a new problem has arisenthat of convalescents, who continue to have various symptoms at more than 4 and up to 12 weeks after the acute disease, the so called post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. In this article, we tried to determine if previously healthy adults with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome also have cardiac complications related to the number of persisting symptoms, the quality of life scores and the initial pulmonary injury. Using transthoracic echocardiography, we found cardiac abnormalities (pulmonary hypertension, systolic and diastolic dysfunction, pericarditis) in about a quarter of the 150 participants in our study. Their gravity was significantly correlated with the severity of COVID-19, the number of weeks passed since the acute illness, the number of persisting symptoms, and the quality of life. Post-acute COVID-19 is a recently proposed term which aims to characterize the various symptoms persisting after an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, their severity being explained partially by residual multi-system alterations, with an important impact on the functional status and quality of life of the affected individuals. ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic affected over 130 million individuals during more than one year. Due to the overload of health-care services, a great number of people were treated as outpatients, many of them subsequently developing post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. Our study was conducted on 150 subjects without a history of cardiovascular diseases, treated as outpatients for a mild/moderate form of COVID-19 4 to 12 weeks prior to study inclusion, and who were diagnosed with post-acute COVID-19 and attended a cardiology evaluation with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for persisting symptoms. We detected various cardiac abnormalities in 38 subjects (25.33%), including pulmonary hypertension (9.33%), impaired left ventricular performance (8.66%), diastolic dysfunction (14%) and/or evidence of pericarditis (10%). We highlighted statistically significant correlations between the intensity of symptoms and quality of life scores with the severity of initial pulmonary injury, the number of weeks since COVID-19 and with TTE parameters characterizing the systolic and diastolic performance and pulmonary hypertension (p < 0.001). (Post-acute COVID-19 is a complex syndrome characterized by various symptoms, the intensity of which seem to be related to the severity and the time elapsed since the acute infection, and with persisting cardiac abnormalities.","output":"Associations between the Severity of the Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome and Echocardiographic Abnormalities in Previously Healthy Outpatients Following Infection with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Suicidal ideation is a major risk factor for suicide and can negatively affect self-care and health behaviors among the older adults. There are limited data on the prevalence and risk factors of suicidal ideation among the older population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the present study was to examine the prevalence and risk factors of suicidal ideations among Iranian older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 803 older community adults in Shiraz (Southwestern Iran) were surveyed to determine potential factors influencing suicidal ideation, including demographic factors, physical health status, access to healthcare, current depression status, fear of COVID-19, perceived social support, and social engagement. Data were collected utilizing face-to-face interviews between November and December 2020. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent variables associated with suicidal ideations. RESULTS: Among the 803 participants, 69 reported suicidal ideations (8.6%). Individuals with suicidal ideations were more likely to have greater fear of COVID-19. However, based on the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis, current depression (OR: 2.07, CI 95%: 1.18C3.65), not being married (OR: 1.82, CI 95%: 1.06C3.13), inability to pay for medical bills (OR: 2.16, CI 95%: 1.23C3.79), low perceived social support (OR: 2.03, CI95%: 1.11C3.71), and having limited social network (OR:1.77, CI 95%: 1.02C3.10) appeared to be more powerful influencing factors. CONCLUSION: Suicidal ideation appears to be relatively common among Iranian older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. A lack of longitudinal data makes it difficult to establish an association between suicidal ideations and the COVID-19 pandemic. Systematic monitoring of suicidal ideation is recommended among high-risk groups, particularly the older population.","output":"Suicidal ideation and its related factors among older adults: a population-based study in Southwestern Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine how compositions of 24-h time use and time reallocations between movement behaviors are associated with cardiometabolic health in a population-based sample of middle-age Finnish adults. METHODS: Participants were 3443 adults 46 yr of age from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 study. Participants wore a hip-worn accelerometer for 14 d from which time spent in sedentary behavior (SB), light-intensity physical activity (LPA), and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) were determined. These data were combined with self-reported sleep to obtain the 24-h time-use composition. Cardiometabolic outcomes included adiposity markers, blood lipid levels, and markers of glucose control and insulin sensitivity. Multivariable-adjusted regression analysis, using a compositional data analysis approach based on isometric log-ratio transformation, was used to examine associations between movement behaviors with cardiometabolic outcomes. RESULTS: More daily time in MVPA and LPA, relative to other movement behaviors, was consistently favorably associated with all cardiometabolic outcomes. For example, relative to time spent in other behaviors, 30 mind(?1) more MVPA and LPA were both associated with lower 2-h postCglucose load insulin level (?11.8% and ?2.7%, respectively). Relative to other movement behaviors, more daily time in SB was adversely associated with adiposity measures, lipid levels, and markers of insulin sensitivity, and more daily time asleep was adversely associated with adiposity measures, blood lipid, fasting plasma glucose, and 2-h insulin. For example, 60 mind(?1) more SB and sleep relative to the remaining behaviors were both associated with higher 2-h insulin (3.5% and 5.7%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Altering daily movement behavior compositions to incorporate more MVPA at the expense of any other movement behavior, or more LPA at the expense of SB or sleep, could help to improve cardiometabolic health in midadulthood.","output":"Compositional Associations of Sleep and Activities within the 24-h Cycle with Cardiometabolic Health Markers in Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The social distancing measures adopted during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to a profound change in the behavioral habits of the population. This study analyzes the impact of restriction measures on the shaping of the epidemiology of common winter respiratory pathogens in the pediatric population of northeast of Italy. From August 2020 to March 2021, a total of 1,227 nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic pediatric patients were tested for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza A and B, adenovirus, other coronaviruses, parainfluenza virus 1C4, enterovirus, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. To relate virus positivity with the clinic characteristics of the subjects enrolled, multinomial logistic models were estimated. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 5.2% of the children; fever resulted as risk factor for infection [relative risk ratio (RRR) = 2.88, p = 0.034]. Rhinovirus was detected in the 40.7% of the subjects, with cough and rhinitis as risk factors (respectively, RRR = 1.79, p = 0.001 and RRR = 1.53, p = 0.018). Other coronaviruses were found in 10.8% of children and were associated to pharyngodynia (RRR = 4.94, p < 0.001). Adenovirus, observed in 11.6% of subjects, showed to have fever as risk factor (RRR = 6.44, p < 0.001). Bocavirus was detected in 3.2% of children. In conclusion, our results showed that social isolation measures had an impact on the circulation of RSV and influenza, although children under the age of 2 were most affected by the other respiratory infections. Therefore, this study highlights the need for continuing surveillance for a delayed spread of RSV and other respiratory pathogens.","output":"Spread of Respiratory Pathogens During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Children in the Northeast of Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe an implementation of gradient boosting and neural guidance of saturation-style automated theorem provers that does not depend on consistent symbol names across problems.

This means that approximative inference rounds done by the GNN are efficiently interleaved with precise symbolic inference rounds done inside E.

They were divided into two groups according to different methods of thrombus prevention and treatment. Among them, 63 patients in group A did not use IPC and 3M thermometer;64 cases in group B were treated with IPC combined with 3M thermometer. Color Doppler ultrasound was used to dynamically monitor the DVT and changes of lower limbs during perioperative period. The venous thrombosis of lower limbs was monitored at 0, 24, 72 h and > 72 h after operation(recheck every 3 days until discharge). RESULTS: Occurrence of DVT of lower limbs after PFNA operation in two groups:there were 5 cases (7.8%) in group B and 20 cases (31.7%) in group A, there was significant difference between two groups (P=0.001). There was no significant difference in lower limb DVT between two groups at 0, 72 and > 72 h after operation(P>0.05), but the formation rate of group A was significantly higher than that of group B at 24 h after operation (P=0.049). There was no significant difference in DVT formation between group A and group B(P>0.05). However, the formation of DVT in group A was significantly higher than that in group B(P=0.012).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In an observational cohort study, 116 men aged 4565 years were followed. Of these, 57 patients with AF, AH and AO and a control group including 59 patients with AF, AH and without AO. Testing of polymorphism rs1378942 of the CSK gene and rs2200733 of chromosome 4q25 using polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism. All statistical calculations were performed using the Rstudio program (version 0.99.879 20092016 RStudio, Inc., USA). RESULTS: The average age of all studied patients was 53.37.1 years. When dividing patients with AF and AH into groups based on the presence/absence of AO, it turned out that in the subgroups of carriers of different genotypes of the rs1378942 polymorphism of the CSK gene there are significant differences in BMI: in the group with BMI, there is an increase in the indicator in the series of CC, AC, AA genotypes. The highest BMI value in carriers of the CC genotype (p0.03) was in the group with AO. In the subgroups of carriers of different rs2200733 genotypes of chromosome 4q25, CC has the highest BMI (p0.05). It was proved that in the group with AO, the progression of AF occurred 2.57 times more often than in the group without AO (p0.003). CONCLUSION: In men with AF and AH, single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1378942 of the CSK gene and rs2200733 of chromosome 4q25 are associated with BMI. The heterozygous genotype AC rs1378942 in the CSK gene is significantly more common in patients, regardless of the presence of AO.

We find that the first local diagnosis leads to an immediate increase in racist Google searches and Twitter posts, with the latter mainly coming from existing Twitter users posting the slur for the first time. This increase could indicate a rise in future hate crimes, as we document a strong correlation between the use of the slur and anti-Asian hate crimes using historic data. Moreover, we find that the rise in the animosity is directed at Asians rather than other minority groups and is stronger on days when the connection between the disease and Asians is more salient, as proxied by President Trump's tweets mentioning China and Covid-19 at the same time. In contrast, the negative economic impact of the pandemic plays little role in the initial increase in racial animus.

Materials and Methods: An educational brochure was developed by the REI department and distributed to Oncology Nurse Navigators to provide to new oncology patients starting in June 2020. A cohort of patients prior to brochure availability was identified from July 2019- March 2020. A second cohort was followed from April 2020-June 2020 due to clinic reorganization during the COVID-19 pandemic. The cohort following brochure availability was identified from July 2020 C March 2021. All female and male patients age <45 years old (yo) seen for a new diagnosis of cancer at the institution were eligible for inclusion. The number of patients seen for an outpatient fertility preservation consultation were identified using ICD 10 and CPT codes. The cancer center identified the total number of patients seen from July 2019 through October 2020 for a new diagnosis of cancer.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (the virus causing COVID-19) is known to use the receptor-binding domain (RBD) at viral surface spike (S) protein to interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on many human cell types. The RBD-ACE2 interaction is a crucial step to mediate the host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies indicate that the ACE2 interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has a higher affinity than its binding with the structurally identical S protein of SARS-CoV-1, the virus causing the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. However, the biophysical mechanism behind such binding affinity difference is unclear. This study utilizes combined single-molecule force spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation approaches to quantify the specific interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 RBD and ACE2. Depending on the loading rates, the unbinding forces between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 range from 70 to 105 pN and are 30-40% higher than those of SARS-CoV-1 RBD and ACE2 under similar loading rates. SMD results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 RBD interacts with the N-linked glycan on Asn90 of ACE2. This interaction is mostly absent in the SARS-CoV-1 RBD-ACE2 complex. During the SMD simulations, the extra RBD-N-glycan interaction contributes to a greater force and prolonged interaction lifetime. The observation is confirmed by our experimental force spectroscopy study. After removing N-linked glycans on ACE2, its mechanical binding strength with SARS-CoV-2 RBD decreases to a similar level of the SARS-CoV-1 RBD-ACE2 interaction. Together, the study uncovers the mechanism behind the difference in ACE2 binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 and could help develop new strategies to block SARS-CoV-2 entry.","output":"Biomechanical characterization of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and human ACE2 protein-protein interaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: A key priority for the UK National Health Service and patients is to ensure that medicines are used safely and effectively. However, medication changes are not always optimally communicated and implemented when patients transfer from hospital into community settings. Heart failure is a common reason for admission to hospital. Patients with heart failure have a high burden of morbidity, mortality and complex pharmacotherapeutic regimens. The Improving the Safety and Continuity Of Medicines management at Transitions of care programme comprises a cluster randomised controlled trial which will test the effectiveness of a complex behavioural intervention aimed at improving medications management at the interface between hospitals discharge and community care. We will conduct a rigorous process evaluation to inform interpretation of the trial findings, inform implementation of the intervention on a wider scale and aid dissemination of the intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The process evaluation will be conducted in six purposively selected intervention sites (ie, hospital trusts and associated community pharmacies) using a mixed-methods design. Fidelity and barriers/enablers of implementation of the Medicines at Transitions Intervention (MaTI) will be explored using observation, interviews (20 patients, 40 healthcare professionals), surveys and routine trial data collection on adherence to MaTI. A parallel mixed analysis will be applied. Qualitative data will be thematically analysed using Framework analysis and survey data will be analysed descriptively. Data will be synthesised, triangulated and mapped to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research where appropriate.

METHODS: Between March and April 2020, old adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder (single or recurrent episode) as defined by the DSM-5 were recruited from psychiatric clinics or inpatient wards, whereas 31 healthy older adults without a history of depression or other psychiatric illnesses were recruited from voluntary organisations or elderly community centres. Their depressive symptoms, perceived severity of the pandemic, perceived time spent on receiving related information, perceived health, levels of loneliness, perceived coping efficacy, suicidal ideation, and the level of symptomatic responses to a specific traumatic stressor in the past week were assessed. RESULTS: In total, 21 men and 43 women aged 61 to 89 years were interviewed through telephone by trained research assistants. Of them, 33 were older adults with LLD (cases) and 31 were healthy older adults (controls). Older people with LLD had a higher level of suicidal ideation than healthy controls, after controlling for the level of depression and medical comorbidity (F (1, 59) = 5.72, p = 0.020). Regression analyses showed that coping efficacy and loneliness accounted for a significant portion of the variance in suicidal ideation, and loneliness significantly predicted the level of stress. Mediation analyses reveal an indirect effect between group and suicidal ideation through coping efficacy (Z = 2.43, p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Older people with LLD are at increased suicidal risk and require timely mental health support.

METHODS We searched five electronic databases and the grey literature up to end of September 2020. Prospective longitudinal studies that described the association between ENDS/ENNDS use, and subsequent tobacco use in those aged < 20 years who were non-smokers at baseline were included. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist was used to assess risk of bias. Data were extracted by two reviewers and pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. We generated unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios (ARRs) describing associations between ENDS/ENNDS and tobacco use. FINDINGS A total of 36 publications met the eligibility criteria, of which 25 were included in the systematic review (23 in the meta-analysis) after exclusion of overlapping studies. Sixteen studies had high to moderate risk of bias. Ever users of ENDS/ENNDS had over three times the risk of ever cigarette use (ARR 301 (95% CI: 237, 382; p<0001, I2: 823%), and current cigarette use had over two times the risk (ARR 256 (95% CI: 161, 407; p<0001, I2: 773%) at follow up. Among current ENDS/ENNDS users, there was a significant association with ever (ARR 263 (95% CI: 194, 357; p<0001, I2: 212%)), but not current cigarette use (ARR 188 (95% CI: 034, 1030; p = 047, I2: 0%)) at follow up. For other tobacco use, ARR ranged between 155 (95% CI 107, 223) and 832 (95% CI: 120, 5704) for waterpipe and pipes, respectively. Additionally, two studies examined the use of ENNDS (non-nicotine devices) and found a pooled adjusted RR of 256 (95% CI: 047, 1394, p = 0.035). CONCLUSION There is an urgent need for policies that regulate the availability, accessibility, and marketing of ENDS/ENNDS to children and adolescents. Governments should also consider adopting policies to prevent ENDS/ENNDS uptake and use in children and adolescents, up to and including a ban for this group.","output":"Association between electronic nicotine delivery systems and electronic non-nicotine delivery systems with initiation of tobacco use in individuals aged < 20 years.

Few qualitative studies have described the experience of perinatal depression among WLWH to identify the underlying social-structural determinants of poor mental health and potential strategies to intervene. We conducted a longitudinal qualitative study applying semi-structured interviews with 30 WLWH at three timepoints (28C38 weeks pregnant, 6-weeks postpartum and 5C7 months postpartum) to understand mental health experiences of perinatal WLWH in western Kenya. Financial insecurity emerged as the central theme impacting the mental health of women across time. Financial insecurity was often attributed to the loss of employment, related to pregnancy and the demands of breastfeeding and caring for an infant, as well as a lack of support from male partners. The loss of income and subsequent financial strain contributed to worsening levels of food insecurity and relationship stress and challenged engagement in HIV care. In this way, increased financial strain during the perinatal period negatively impacted the mental health of perinatal WLWH. Our findings suggest support to meet basic needs and remain engaged in HIV care during pregnancy and postpartum could improve perinatal mental health for WLWH in this setting.","output":"I Found Out I was Pregnant, and I Started Feeling Stressed: A Longitudinal Qualitative Perspective of Mental Health Experiences Among Perinatal Women Living with HIV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Shared accommodation may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In April 2020, an increasing number of asylum seekers at a reception centre in Espoo, Finland presented with COVID-19 despite earlier implementation of preventive measures. We decided to screen the entire population of the centre for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We offered nasopharyngeal swab collection and SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to the centre's clients. Symptoms were recorded at the time of diagnostic sample collection using electronic forms and followed up for two weeks through phone interviews and a review of medical records. Findings: 260 clients were screened. Of them, 96 (37%) were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 and isolated. The high attack rate prompted the local public health authority to set the other clients in quarantine for 14 days to prevent further spread. Of the positive cases, 61 (64%) reported having had symptoms at the time of the screening or one week prior. Of the 35 initially asymptomatic individuals, 12 developed symptoms during follow-up, while 23 (or 18% of all screened SARS-CoV-2 positive clients) remained asymptomatic. No widespread transmission of COVID-19 was detected after the quarantine was lifted. Interpretation: In this large COVID-19 outbreak, voluntary mass screening provided valuable information about its extent and helped guide the public health response.

The research considers how routine surveillance data might provide initial insights and identify risk factors, setting COVID-19 deaths early in the pandemic into context. This will facilitate the understanding of wider consequences of a pandemic from the earliest stage, reducing fear, aiding in accurately assessing disease burden and ensuring appropriate disease mitigation. SETTING: UK, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: The study is a secondary analysis of routine, public domain, surveillance data and information from Office for National Statistics (ONS), National Health Service (NHS) 111 and Public Health England (PHE) on deaths and disease. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Our principal focus is ONS data on deaths mentioning COVID-19 on the death certificate. We also consider information provided in NHS 111 and PHE data summaries. RESULTS: Deaths with COVID-19 significantly contributed to, yet do not entirely explain, abnormally elevated all-cause mortality in the UK from weeks 12-18 of 2020. Early in the UK epidemic, COVID-19 was the greatest threat to those with underlying illness, rarely endangering people aged under 40 years. COVID-19-related death rates differed by region, possibly reflecting underlying population structure. Risk of COVID-19-related death was greater for healthcare and social care staff and black, Asian and minority ethnic individuals, having allowed for documented risk factors. CONCLUSION: Early contextualisation of public health data is critical to recognising who gets sick, when and why. Understanding at-risk groups facilitates a targeted response considering indirect consequences of society's reaction to a pandemic alongside disease-related impacts. COVID-19-related deaths mainly mirror historical patterns, and excess non-COVID-19-related deaths partly reflect reduced access to and uptake of healthcare during lockdown. Future outbreak response will improve through better understanding of connectivity between disease monitoring systems to aid interpretation of disease risk patterns, facilitating nuanced mitigation measures.","output":"Use of routine death and illness surveillance data to provide insight for UK pandemic planning: lessons from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the popularity of Location-based Social Networks, Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has become an important task, which learns the users preferences and mobility patterns to recommend POIs.

However, despite being extensively studied, these sequential methods still suffer from three limitations. First, existing methods mostly utilize attention on the behavior of users, which is not always suitable for CTR prediction, because users often click on new products that are irrelevant to any historical behaviors. Second, in the real scenario, there exist numerous users that have operations a long time ago, but turn relatively inactive in recent times. Thus, it is hard to precisely capture user's current preferences through early behaviors. Third, multiple representations of user's historical behaviors in different feature subspaces are largely ignored. To remedy these issues, we propose a Multi-Interactive Attention Network (MIAN) to comprehensively extract the latent relationship among all kinds of fine-grained features (e.g., gender, age and occupation in user-profile).

Among them, 9 ssDNA-FQ reporters were found to be suitable for direct visual colorimetric detection, with especially very strong performance using ROX-labeled reporters. We optimized the reaction concentrations of these ssDNA-FQ reporters for naked-eye read-out of assay results (no transducing component required for visualization).

OBJECTIVE: Patient and health care provider surveys with regard to current perceptions of nasal allergy burden, symptoms, and treatments were conducted to compare with previous surveys and provide insight into the use of SLIT-tablets and AIT shared decision-making tools. METHODS: From November-December 2019, adults (N = 510) diagnosed with nasal allergies and health care providers (N = 304) who treated nasal allergies in the United States completed surveys with regard to nasal allergy management. RESULTS: Of the patient respondents, 42% reported that their symptoms were only somewhat controlled and 48% had avoided activities because of their nasal allergies. In all, 38% were using only over-the-counter (OTC) medications for treatment, and 42%, 7%, and 8% had ever received subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), sublingual allergy drops, or SLIT-tablets, respectively; 56% and 85% reported that they had never discussed SCIT or SLIT, respectively, with their health care provider. Of the health care provider respondents, 45%, 58%, and 20% were very likely to discuss OTC medications, SCIT, or SLIT, respectively. Allergists were more inclined to discuss SCIT with their patients than other health care providers (82% versus 33%, respectively). Most allergists (67%) and other health care providers (62%) reported that they did not use an AIT shared decision-making tool, primarily because of unawareness. CONCLUSION: The patients with nasal allergies continued to report inadequate symptom control and activity impairment.SLIT-tablets and AIT shared decision-making tools were underused. In the coronavirus disease 2019 era, social distancing may limit office visits, which impacts SCIT administration and prompts increased use of telemedicine and a possible advantage for at-home-administered SLIT-tablets over SCIT.","output":"Shifts in allergy practice in a COVID-19 world: Implications of pre-COVID-19 national health care provider and patient surveys of treatments for nasal allergies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To describe the current state of telemedicine within pediatric training programs to inform development of a national telemedicine training curriculum for pediatric trainees.

The EudraVigilance database has provided similar data for the European Economic Area. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to characterize the evolution over time of spontaneous reports of suspected ADRs to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and to observe the effect of a publicized reaction (cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis [CVST]) on reporting rates. METHODS: We used publicly available data on reports of suspected ADRs and doses of vaccine administered, published by the MHRA, EudraVigilance, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to calculate reporting rates. RESULTS: Approximately 4814 Yellow Card reports (23 fatal) per million doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) and 2890 (13 fatal) per million doses of tozinameran (Pfizer/BioNTech) have been lodged. Between 15 March and 31 October 2021, cumulative European reports of CVST rose from 0 to 443 (183 with thrombocytopenia, 72 fatal) with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and from 2 to 315 (9 with thrombocytopenia, 28 fatal) with tozinameran. European cases of retinal vein occlusion and thrombosis rose from 0 to 168 with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and from 1 to 220 with tozinameran; four of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 cases were associated with thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: Reports of fatal adverse reactions to coronavirus vaccines are very rare. Reports of CVST have been made in relation to both vaccines. Most were submitted after the reaction had been publicized. Thrombocytopenia occurred in a minority of cases. Reports linked both vaccines to cases of retinal vein thrombosis, just four cases with thrombocytopenia. This suggests two different mechanisms of thrombosis associated with the vaccines.","output":"Spontaneous Reporting to Regulatory Authorities of Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions to COVID-19 Vaccines Over Time: The Effect of Publicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infections may act with variable impact on the physiopathology of the reproductive organs, determining infertility or reducing the outcomes of assisted reproduction technology.

The objective of the present work is to develop a method that is able to automatically determine mental status of vigilance, i.e., a person's state of alertness. Such a task is relevant to diverse domains, where a person is expected or required to be in a particular state of mind. Aiming at the EEG feature selection and classification model in the identification of fatigue driving, the discretization algorithm using rough set theory is proposed to select the channel and EEG signal feature quantities. The support vector machine (SVM) is selected as the fatigue driving recognition model, and the risk of fatigue misjudgment is taken as SVM model parameters for model optimization. The experimental results of subjects show that compared with the principal component method, the rough set discretization algorithm selects fewer features, and the compatibility threshold 0.8. The number of features selected among the candidate features is 208. The features selected by different subjects are different and have an impact on the establishment of the support vector machine recognition model. Fatigue misjudgment risk control parameters can adjust the support vector machine recognition model error judgment risk.

Existing research mainly focuses on indoor droplet dispersion, but the mechanism of its dispersion and exposure in outdoor environment is unclear. By conducting CFD simulations, this paper investigates the evaporation and transport of solid-liquid droplets in an open outdoor environment. Droplet initial sizes (dp = 10 m, 50 m, 100 m), background relative humidity (RH = 35%, 95%), background wind speed (Uref = 3 m/s, 0.2 m/s) and social distances between two people (D = 0.5 m, 1 m, 1.5 m, 3 m, 5 m) are investigated. Results show that thermal body plume is destroyed when the background wind speed is 3 m/s (Froude number Fr ~ 10). The inhalation fraction (IF) of susceptible person decreases exponentially when the social distance (D) increases from 0.5 m to 5 m. The exponential decay rate of inhalation fraction (b) ranges between 0.93 and 1.06 (IF=IF0e-b(D-0.5)) determined by the droplet initial diameter and relative humidity. Under weak background wind (Uref = 0.2 m/s, Fr ~ 0.01), the upward thermal body plume significantly influences droplet dispersion, which is similar with that in indoor space. Droplets in the initial sizes of 10 m and 50 m disperse upwards while most of 100 m droplets fall down to the ground due to larger gravity force. Interestingly, the deposition fraction on susceptible person is ten times higher at Uref = 3 m/s than that at Uref = 0.2 m/s. Thus, a high outdoor wind speed does not necessarily lead to a smaller exposure risk if the susceptible person locating at the downwind region of the infected person, and people in outdoors are suggested to not only keep distance of greater than 1.5 m from each other but also stand with considerable angles from the prevailing wind direction.","output":"Airborne transmission of pathogen-laden expiratory droplets in open outdoor space."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A majority of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are zoonotic, mainly caused through spillover events linked to human-animal interactions.

This study aimed to 1) describe variation in reported high-risk behaviors by community type and 2) assess the relationship between specific behaviors and self-reported illnesses. Behavioral trends were assessed in R via Fishers exact tests. A generalized linear mixed model with Lasso penalization (GLMMLasso) was used to assess correlations between behaviors and participants self-reported illness within the past year, with reported behaviors as independent variables and reported priority symptoms as the outcome.

Today, the scientific community is investing all the resources available to find any therapy and prevention strategies to defeat COVID-19. In this context, immunonutrition can play a pivotal role in improving immune responses against viral infections. Immunonutrition has been based on the concept that malnutrition impairs immune function. Therefore, immunonutrition involves feeding enriched with various pharmaconutrients (Omega 3 Fatty Acids, Vitamin C, Arginine, Glutamine, Selenium, Zinc, Vitamin, E and Vitamin D) to modulate inflammatory responses, acquired immune response and to improve patient outcomes. In literature, significant evidences indicate that obesity, a malnutrition state, negatively impacts on immune system functionality and on host defense, impairing protection from infections. Immunonutrients can promote patient recovery by inhibiting inflammatory responses and regulating immune function. Immune system dysfunction is considered to increase the risk of viral infections, such as SARS-CoV-2, and was observed in different pathological situations. Obese patients develop severe COVID-19 sequelae, due to the high concentrations of TNF-, MCP-1 and IL-6 produced in the meantime by visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue and by innate immunity. Moreover, leptin, released by adipose tissue, helps to increase inflammatory milieu with a dysregulation of the immune response. Additionally, gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the maturation, development and functions of both innate and adaptive immune system, as well as contributing to develop obese phenotype. The gut microbiota has been shown to affect lung health through a vital crosstalk between gut microbiota and lungs, called the gut-lung axis. This axis communicates through a bi-directional pathway in which endotoxins, or microbial metabolites, may affect the lung through the blood and when inflammation occurs in the lung, this in turn can affect the gut microbiota. Therefore, the modulation of gut microbiota in obese COVID-19 patients can play a key role in immunonutrition therapeutic strategy.

It further explored the association between patient demographic, clinical, and services variables on relapse rates. Inpatient admissions and therapeutic services (group and individual therapy and peer support) were lower amongst the COVID-19 sample than prior to the onset of COVID-19 while lengths of stay were longer. Relapse rates did not differ between cohorts. Patients with prior emergent services use as well as substance abuse or personality disorder diagnoses were at higher risk for relapse. Receiving group therapy while admitted was associated with lower risk of relapse. Inpatient mental health services saw substantial disruptions across the cohort. Inpatient mental health services, including group therapy, may be an important tool to prevent subsequent relapse.","output":"Inpatient Mental Healthcare before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beban pada sistem perawatan kesehatan berasal dari insiden tertinggi yakni COVID-19.

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of canakinumab, an anti-interleukin-1? antibody, in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial was conducted at 39 hospitals in Europe and the United States. A total of 454 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, hypoxia (not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV]), and systemic hyperinflammation defined by increased blood concentrations of C-reactive protein or ferritin were enrolled between April 30 and August 17, 2020, with the last assessment of the primary end point on September 22, 2020. Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a single intravenous infusion of canakinumab (450 mg for body weight of 40-<60 kg, 600 mg for 60-80 kg, and 750 mg for >80 kg; n = 227) or placebo (n = 227). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was survival without IMV from day 3 to day 29. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19-related mortality, measurements of biomarkers of systemic hyperinflammation, and safety evaluations. Results: Among 454 patients who were randomized (median age, 59 years; 187 women [41.2%]), 417 (91.9%) completed day 29 of the trial. Between days 3 and 29, 198 of 223 patients (88.8%) survived without requiring IMV in the canakinumab group and 191 of 223 (85.7%) in the placebo group, with a rate difference of 3.1% (95% CI, -3.1% to 9.3%) and an odds ratio of 1.39 (95% CI, 0.76 to 2.54; P = .29). COVID-19-related mortality occurred in 11 of 223 patients (4.9%) in the canakinumab group vs 16 of 222 (7.2%) in the placebo group, with a rate difference of -2.3% (95% CI, -6.7% to 2.2%) and an odds ratio of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.30 to 1.50). Serious adverse events were observed in 36 of 225 patients (16%) treated with canakinumab vs 46 of 223 (20.6%) who received placebo.

Automated tools are needed to remotely monitor all the pigs on the farm and provide early alerts to the farm caretaker for situations that need immediate attention. With this goal, we developed a sensor board that can be mounted on the ears of individual pigs to generate data on the animals activity, vocalization, and temperature. The generated data will be used to develop machine learning models to classify the behavioral traits associated with each animal over a testing period. A number of factors influencing the technology adoption by farm caretakers are also discussed. ABSTRACT: Precision swine production can benefit from autonomous, noninvasive, and affordable devices that conduct frequent checks on the well-being status of pigs. Here, we present a remote monitoring tool for the objective measurement of some behavioral indicators that may help in assessing the health and welfare statusnamely, posture, gait, vocalization, and external temperature. The multiparameter electronic sensor board is characterized by laboratory measurements and by animal tests. Relevant behavioral health indicators are discussed for implementing machine learning algorithms and decision support tools to detect animal lameness, lethargy, pain, injury, and distress. The roadmap for technology adoption is also discussed, along with challenges and the path forward. The presented technology can potentially lead to efficient management of farm animals, targeted focus on sick animals, medical cost savings, and less use of antibiotics.","output":"Behavioral Monitoring Tool for Pig Farmers: Ear Tag Sensors, Machine Intelligence, and Technology Adoption Roadmap"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One-hundred sixtyEscherichia coli isolates obtained from piglets with diarrhea from different parts of Slovakia were examined for the presence of genes coding for F4, F5, F6 and F41 fimbrial adhesins, and hemolytic activity.

In Lebanon, a country that has endured a prolonged history of conflict and economic and political uncertainty, mental health surveys in children and adolescents have been limited to specific disorders or specific settings or cities. PALS (Psychopathology in Children and Adolescents in Lebanon Study) is the first study to screen a nationally representative sample of children and adolescents for psychiatric disorders and estimate the national prevalence of children and adolescents at risk of having a psychiatric disorder. METHODS: A nationally representative household sample of 1517 children and adolescents (aged 5 years 0 months to 17 years 11 months) was recruited through a multi-stage stratified proportionate sampling technique between February 2018 and November 2018. Parents and adolescents completed a battery of self-reported scales including the Strengths and Feelings Questionnaire (SDQ), Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ), Screen for Child Anxiety and Emotional Related Disorders (SCARED), the Peer Relations Questionnaire (PRQ), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), and Conflict Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ), Child Revised Impact of Events Scale (CRIES), and a demographic/clinical information questionnaire. Logistic regression models were used to examine the correlates of screening positive for psychiatric disorders. RESULTS: About a third of children and adolescents (32.7%, n = 497) screened positive for at least one psychiatric disorder, of whom only 5% (n = 25) reported ever seeking professional mental health help. Academic performance, having a chronic physical illness, higher parental GHQ scores, and involvement in bullying were associated with a higher odds of screening positive for a psychiatric disorder. Higher family income was negatively associated with screening positive for a psychiatric disorder. CONCLUSION: This first national study shows a high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in Lebanese children and adolescents and an alarming treatment gap.

The aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate the performance characteristics of a new Bioelectric Recognition Assay (BERA) regarding Sars-CoV-2 detection in clinical samples and its potential to be used as a point of care test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All tests were performed using a custom portable hardware device developed by EMBIO DIAGNOSTICS (EMBIO DIAGNOSTICS Ltd, Cyprus). 110 positive and 136 negative samples tested by RT-PCR were used in order to define the lower limit of detection (L.O.D.) of the system, as well as the sensitivity and the specificity of the method. RESULTS: The system was able to detect a viral concentration of 4 genome copies/L. The method displayed total sensitivity of 92.7 % (95 %CI: 86.2-96.8) and 97.8 % specificity (95 %CI: 93.7-99.5). When samples were grouped according to the recorded Ct values the BERA biosensor displayed 100.00 % sensitivity (95 %CI: 84.6-100.0) for Ct values <20-30. For the aforementioned Ct values the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of the method was estimated at 31.4 % for COVID-19 prevalence of 1% and at 70.5 % for 5% prevalence. At the same time the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the BERA biosensor was at 100.0 % for both prevalence rates.

We calibrate this mortality model on annual death counts and exposures at the level of individual ages. This type of mortality data are typically collected, produced and reported with a significant delay offor some countriesseveral years on a platform such as the Human Mortality Database. To enable a timely evaluation of the impact of a pandemic data point, we have to rely on other data sources (e.g., the Short-Term Mortality Fluctuations Data series) that swiftly publish weekly mortality data collected in age buckets. To be compliant with the design and calibration strategy of the Li and Lee model, we transform the weekly mortality data collected in age buckets to yearly, age-specific observations. Therefore, our paper constructs a protocol to ungroup the death counts and exposures registered in age buckets to individual ages. To evaluate the impact of a pandemic shock, like COVID-19 in the year 2020, we weigh this data point in either the calibration or projection step. Obviously, the more weight we place on this data point, the more impact we observe on future estimated mortality rates and life expectancies.

Patients in an age group of 0-17 years with acute neurological signs (including ascending weakness with areflexia, diminished visual acuity, encephalopathy, ataxia, stroke, or weakness with plasma creatinine kinase (CK) elevation) were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of 23 patients with neurological manifestations, 10 (43%) had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the infected patients, 5 (50%) were males aged 2-16 years old (median age 11.8 years old). Four (40%) patients confirmed a close contact with a relative positive for SARS-CoV-2, while 6 (60%) cases had a history of SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms over the previous 2 weeks.

Ten subjects remained healthy and 10 developed common cold with significant symptoms from day 2 to day 6. Starting on day 3 at 8.00 h and repeated at 4 h intervals until 4.00 h on day 4, nasal lavages were carried out by employment of a nasal pool-device which fills the entire unilateral nasal cavity and gently but effectively irrigates its surface. Lavage fluid levels of albumin (Mw 69,000 D) and fibrinogen (Mw 340,000 D) were determined. In the healthy subjects the levels of albumin and fibrinogen remained low throughout the experiment, however, with mean peak values of the two proteins occurring at 4.00 h (p < 0.05 compared to daytime nadir at 16.00 h). In subjects with common cold both albumin (p < 0.05) and fibrinogen (p < 0.01) exhibited marked variation with individual and mean peak levels recorded at 8.00 h day 3, and 4.00 h day 4. These mean peak values were 5-20 times higher (p < 0.01 - p < 0.05) than the mean levels recorded in these subjects at the other time periods. The present data indicate a marked day-night difference in the occurrence of plasma proteins on the airway surface in common cold, whereas in health the difference is much less.

In this study, we show that in human T cells, SDF-1&#945;-mediated ?2 integrin activation is driven by a, so far, not-described reactive oxidative species (ROS)-regulated calcium influx. Furthermore, we show that CD4+CD28null T cells represent a highly reactive subset showing 25-fold stronger ?2 integrin activation upon SDF-1&#945; stimulation compared with CD28+ T cells. Interestingly, ROS-dependent Ca release was much more prevalent in the pathogenetically pivotal CD28null subset compared with the CD28+ T cells, whereas the established mediators of the classical pathways for ?2 integrin activation (PKC, PI3K, and PLC) were similarly activated in both T cell subsets. Thus, interference with the calcium flux attenuates spontaneous adhesion of CD28null T cells from acute coronary syndrome patients, and calcium ionophores abolished the observed differences in the adhesion properties between CD28+ and CD28null T cells. Likewise, the adhesion of these T cell subsets was indistinguishable in the presence of exogenous ROS/H2O2 Together, these data provide a molecular explanation of the role of ROS in pathogenesis of plaque destabilization.","output":"Reactive Oxidative Species-Modulated Ca2+ Release Regulates ?2 Integrin Activation on CD4+ CD28null T Cells of Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Multimorbidity prevalence is increasing globally.

INCLUSION CRITERIA Studies were included if they used a qualitative design, conducted primary data collection, included references to financial burden and had at least one community-dwelling adult participant with two or more chronic conditions. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Screening and critical appraisal were conducted by two reviewers independently. One reviewer extracted data from the results section; this was checked by a second reviewer. GRADE-CERQual was used to summarize the certainty of the evidence. Data were analysed using thematic synthesis. MAIN RESULTS Forty-six studies from six continents were included. Four themes were generated: the high costs people with multimorbidity experience, the coping strategies they use to manage these costs, and the negative effect of both these on their well-being. Health insurance and government supports determine the manageability and level of costs experienced. DISCUSSION Financial burden has a negative effect on people with multimorbidity.

In less than six months since its first diagnosis in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 infectious disease due to the novel coronavirus has infected over 5,000,000 people and claimed over 350,000 lives. In the United States, most of the cases are in large urban settings along the coasts, but the disease is slowly progressing through the mainland. Kansas, with its particular location in the midwest United States, has seen a relatively small number of cases, but these are increasing. The Kansas government took radical measures to prevent the spread of the disease. According to the Health Beliefs Model, an individuals perception of risk will dictate engagement with preventive behaviors. Knowledge about the disease and preventive measures drive the risk assessment. Knowledge is dependant on the sources of information used. This study explored these metrics in a sample of Kansans living in the times of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A combination of snowball samples and random distribution through social media was used to recruit participants to an online survey. The risk and knowledge instrument was developed and validated by WHO Europe. Data collection lasted 96 hours. RESULTS: The attitudes and behaviors of Kansans concerning COVID-19 were consistent with its location in an area of the country with a relatively lower incidence of the disease. Participants had good knowledge about the disease and preventive measures and were willing to comply with recommendations from local authorities.

Convenience sampling was adopted for questionnaire survey of experts, and random sampling was adopted for questionnaire survey of patients. After collecting and sorting out the questionnaire, a descriptive analysis of the data was performed. RESULTS Within 24 h from the distribution of questionnaires to the deadline, a total of 808 and 321 valid questionnaires from patients and experts were collected across China, respectively. There were 83.81% of the experts performed moderately and strongly anti-tumor therapy for patients with NSCLC during the COVID-19 pandemic. 76.6% of patients mainly receive online public welfare treatment, and the patient satisfaction rate reached up to 64.97%. For driver gene-positive patients with advanced NSCLC and nonCOVID-19, 82.87% of the experts recommended first-line simple targeted therapy, and 12.77% of the experts recommended targeted therapy with oral anti-angiogenic drugs. For patients who were unable to return to the hospital for treatment and showed resistance to the TKI therapy, 92.21% of the experts recommended oral anti-angiogenic drugs as the third-line home-based therapy and above. For patients with advanced NSCLC combined with COVID-19, 98.76% and 95.95% of the experts recommended discontinuation of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS During COVID-19, most Chinese patients with NSCLC were still able to receive timely diagnosis and treatment either by online public welfare consultation or at nearby hospitals.","output":"Current status of diagnosis and treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer in China during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 leads to radiological evidence of lower respiratory tract lesions, which support analysis to screen this disease using chest X-ray.

With MERS outbreaks resulting in over 35% fatalities and now spread to 27 countries, MERS-CoV poses a significant ongoing threat to global human health. As part of its viral genome, MERS-CoV encodes a papain-like protease (PLpro) that has been observed to act as a deubiquitinase and deISGylase to antagonize type I interferon (IFN-I) immune pathways. This activity is in addition to its viral polypeptide cleavage function. Although the overall impact of MERS-CoV PLpro function is observed to be essential, difficulty has been encountered in delineating the importance of its separate functions, particularly its deISGylase activity. As a result, the interface of MERS-CoV and human interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (hISG15) was probed with isothermal calorimetry, which suggests that the C-terminal domain of hISG15 is principally responsible for interactions. Subsequently, the structure of MERS-CoV PLpro was solved to 2.4 ? in complex with the C-terminal domain of hISG15. Utilizing this structural information, mutants were generated that lacked appreciable deISGylase activity but retained wild-type deubiquitinase and peptide cleavage activities. Hence, this provides a new platform for understanding viral deISGylase activity within MERS-CoV and other CoVs.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), encode a papain-like protease (PLpro) that possesses the ability to antagonize interferon immune pathways through the removal of ubiquitin and interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) from target proteins. The lack of CoV proteases with attenuated deISGylase activity has been a key obstacle in delineating the impact between deubiquitinase and deISGylase activities on viral host evasion and pathogenesis. Here, biophysical techniques revealed that MERS-CoV PLpro chiefly engages human ISG15 through its C-terminal domain. The first structure of MERS-CoV PLpro in complex with this domain exposed the interface between these two entities. Employing these structural insights, mutations were employed to selectively remove deISGylase activity with no appreciable impact on its other deubiquitinase and peptide cleavage biochemical properties. Excitingly, this study introduces a new tool to probe the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and related viruses through the removal of viral deISGylase activity.","output":"Structurally Guided Removal of DeISGylase Biochemical Activity from Papain-Like Protease Originating from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2020-2021 school year has been a challenging year like no other.

Sylvain Trepanier, DNP, RN, CENP, FAONL, FAAN Deborah Zimmermann, DNP, RN, NEA-BC, FAAN, is chair of the American Organization for Nursing Leadership (AONL) Foundation. ST: Can you tell us a little about yourself? DZ: Nursing is my passion. I am the eldest of 4 children and the daughter of a registered nurse. I knew from a young age that nursing was my calling. I regularly talked to my mother about her patients, the many specialties within the profession, and the impact of advances in bedside technology on her critical care practice. With 4 children, my family could provide moral, but no financial, support for college. In 1976, when women were first admitted into the military academies, ROTC [Reserve Officers Training Corps] scholarships were offered to women. I accepted a scholarship, and upon graduation, began my nursing career as an army nurse. The military was foundational to both my nursing practice and leadership. As a young officer, I was given opportunities to lead and advance my practice. After 4 years of active duty, my husband, daughter, and I moved to Rochester, New York, where I attended graduate school and for 25 years practiced as a nurse practitioner and leader. For many years, I balanced practice and leadership. It was not easy, but I found great joy in caring for patients and interfacing with clinical nurses as a practitioner. I served as a chief nursing officer in Rochester, New York, and Richmond, Virginia. In both cities, I worked with incredible clinicians who used their knowledge and expertise to improve the health of their communities. They made a difference in their patients lives, and it was my honor to work with these teams. Fairly early in my career, I became involved in the regional and state chapters of AONL. I had the opportunity to work with New York legislators and nursing leaders on prescriptive authority for nurse practitioners. I facilitated the introduction of bills on nursing education, commonly known as the BSN in Ten legislation. As president of the New York Organization of Nurse Executives and Leaders and chair the ANCC Commission on Magnet?, I had the opportunity to see how professional organizations and nursing leaders impacted nursing standards and practice. Currently, I serve on the boards of the American Organization for Nursing Leadership and chair of the AONL Foundation. AONL is dedicated to strengthening the development and influence of nurses, creation of collaborative interprofessional care models, and quantifying the contribution of nurses in improving health outcomes. A privilege beyond compare best describes my years on the AONL board of directors and the AONL Foundation. It is an honor to serve with colleagues from around the nation who, without ego, volunteer their time and generously share their expertise for the purpose of setting standards, driving excellence, and transforming health care. Their passion is nursing and improving the health of our citizens. [Figure presented] ST: Can you tell us about the mission of AONL's Foundation? DZ: The AONL Foundation for Nursing Leadership Research and Education (AONL Foundation) was established in 2010 to support the research and educational priorities of AONL. The AONL Foundation's activities and programs include grants to fund nursing research, financial aid awards for nurse leader continuing education, and the annual Nurse Researcher Award. The AONL Foundation accomplishes its mission by supporting its members, individuals, foundations, and corporations. A healthier future is possible by bridging science and practice. The Foundation supports research, which is essential for nurse leaders and the challenges they face. Evidence-based practice is as critical to nurse leaders as it is for any specialty within the profession. Over its history, the Foundation has fu ded 54 studies and awarded more than $450,000 for nursing leadership research. The studies have focused on patient experience, population health, staffing, and clinicians well-being. The Foundation set a goal to raise 10 million dollars and disseminate the findings of 15 studies by December 2025. Since 2010, the Foundation has awarded 3 scholarships to nursing leaders for the nurse manager and director fellowships, and has set a goal to award 4 scholarships annually by 2025. If we can attain a sustainable fund, the Foundation plans to award $100,000 annually for research and $100,000 for scholarships, and grow from there. [Figure presented] ST: Can you tell us why did you choose to serve as the chair of AONL's Foundation? DZ: Researchers have repeatedly reported findings supporting the relationship between clinical outcomes and nursing education. When the Institute of Medicines pivotal report, The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health called for 80% of the nursing workforce to be baccalaureate-prepared by 2020;it was a call to action beyond the degree. It was a call for nurses to step up and to lead. Educated leaders have the confidence, knowledge, and the expertise to lead complex health systems. I am delighted to be part of an organization that supports science and innovation. It is a privilege to serve as chair of the Foundation and support the mission of nursing leadership research and the development of nursing leaders. [Figure presented] ST: Can you share with us what are the current and future nursing research needs? DZ: The Foundation is focused on funding research that demonstrates nursing leadership's impact on maximizing leadership effectiveness, improving the health care experience, and achieving equity in health care. There is a need for more evidence on team-based interprofessional care, innovative roles across the care continuum, and the measurement of outcomes from nursing care. The research funded by AONL can reshape care delivery. Nora Warshawsky, PhD, RN, NEA-BC, FAAN, assesses the impact of nurse managers in achieving the quadruple aim. Jennifer Rainer, PhD, MBA, RN, recently published the results of her study on the influences of nurses speaking up when patients are at risk. The impact of leadership on remote visual monitoring of patients was published in the Journal of Nursing Management in December 2020, and phase 2 of research by Eva Keeling, MSN, RN, NE-BC, is underway. Of course, the research by Diana Meyer, DNP, RN, NEA-BC, FAAN, on cultivating joy and resilience through a practice playbook is timely. The team was finalizing their report and manuscript in early 2021. Other studies that are receiving Foundation funding include an analysis on nurse residencies by Nancy Hoffart, PhD, RN;testing of a professional governance scale by Joanne Clavelle, DNP, RN, NEA-BC, FAAN;and the relationship between staff nurses perceptions of nurse manager caring behaviors and patient satisfaction by Kelley Kostich, PhD(c), RN, NE-BC. In addition, Cheryl Jones, PhD, RN, FAAN, and Donna Havens, PhD, RN, FAAN, are updating the AONL Foundation's work to understand CNO turnover. An exciting study by the Association of Leadership Science in Nursing (ALSN) in conjunction with the AONL Foundation was led by Esther Chipps, PhD, RN, NEA-BC, and M. Lindell Joseph, PhD, RN, FAAN. In their study, nursing leaders identified a need for research on healthy practice environments and the impact on patient outcomes, workforce, and staffing, research on innovative care models, and a need for research on effective nurse leader development. These findings will be utilized in establishing Foundation priorities. The AONL Foundation has been able to fund these studies thanks to the generous support of AONL members, friends, and several organizations. I would be remiss if I didn't recognize them here: AMN Healthcare, Atrium Health, AvaSure, Careismatic, and the Versant Center for the Advancement of Nursing. There are too many individual members and friends who have given generously to name each person here, but w publish the annual Honor Roll of Donors online. Thank you for helping make this work possible. [Figure presented] ST: In what ways can our readers support the foundation? DZ: In 2020, the Foundation celebrated 10 years of supporting nursing leader research and leadership development. This was only possible because of the philanthropy of AONL members and our corporate partners. As I mentioned earlier, we have some big goals that will have significant impacts on nurse leaders in research and education. There are several ways that people can help support the Foundation, including opportunities to leave a legacy to nursing leadership and recognize people with special naming opportunities. You can explore those opportunities on our website. One easy way AONL members and friends can get involved is to join the AONL Foundation's 10 for 10 campaign, which we are continuing through June 2021. We invite members to give a special gift of $10 a month for 10 months to help ensure sustainability and fund research and financial aid for leadership development. We need leaders to support their teams in conducting research and, when possible, donate to the research fund. Together, we can transform health care. ST: 2020 was a year you, me, and all our leaders will never forget. What lessons have you learned personally and professionally? DZ: The challenges we faced in 2020 and continue to face in 2021 have been unprecedented. The pandemic of 2020 has given excellent visibility to the frontline health care workforce, with nurses front and center. Nursing practice has changed because of this pandemic, and the contributions of nurses will leave a permanent imprint on health care. Nurses leaned into and did not run from the complex, challenging health care issues of COVID-19. Asboth part of and leaders of the largest group in the health care professions, nursing leaders have led the health care response as full participants of team-based approaches to care. Nurses adopted innovative and nontraditional methods when the evidence was unknown, and leaders supported research efforts to discover the best care approaches. Nurses were behind the rapid adoption of technology for communication, remote monitoring, and televisits. Realizing a community is only as healthy as its most vulnerable citizens, nursing leaders supported education, acquired PPE [personal protective equipment], and treatment standards in prisons and skilled nursing facilities. Nurses have redefined patient-centered care by becoming surrogate family members, so no patient dies alone. As is typical throughout history, nurses demonstrated extraordinary courage, tenacity, and dedication. ST: Thank you for being actively involved with AONL's foundation. In my experience, many are not aware of the work the Foundation does;will you share the importance of this for nurse leaders in particular? DZ: Nurse leaders must model the way and support practice based on evidence and science. Leadership matters and influential nurse leaders save lives. We must support research and our responsibility to support the development of future and new leaders.

(Finance Stoch 22(1):1C37, 2018), while an epidemic is spreading according to dynamics given by compartmental stochastic SIS or SIR models, as proposed respectively by Gray et al.

More precisely, to limit the spread of a virus, the population can decrease the transmission rate of the disease by reducing interactions between individuals. However, this effortwhich cannot be perfectly monitored by the governmentcomes at social and monetary cost for the population. To mitigate this cost, and thus encourage the lockdown of the population, the government can put in place an incentive policy, in the form of a tax or subsidy. In addition, the government may also implement a testing policy in order to know more precisely the spread of the epidemic within the country, and to isolate infected individuals. In terms of technical results, we demonstrate the optimal form of the tax, indexed on the proportion of infected individuals, as well as the optimal effort of the population, namely the transmission rate chosen in response to this tax. The governments optimisation problems then boils down to solving an HamiltonCJacobiCBellman equation. Numerical results confirm that if a tax policy is implemented, the population is encouraged to significantly reduce its interactions. If the government also adjusts its testing policy, less effort is required on the population side, individuals can interact almost as usual, and the epidemic is largely contained by the targeted isolation of positively-tested individuals.","output":"Incentives, lockdown, and testing: from Thucydides analysis to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus (COVID-19) is a viral disease that was classified as a pandemic situation on a global scale in early 2020.

This paper documents our efforts to build a corpus of 79,000 Mori-language tweets using computational methods. The Reo Mori Twitter (RMT) Corpus was created by targeting Mori-language users identified by the Indigenous Tweets website, pre-processing their data and filtering out non-Mori tweets, together with other sources of noise. Our motivation for creating such a resource is three-fold: (1) it serves as a rich and unique dataset for linguistic analysis of te reo Mori on social media; (2) it can be used as training data to develop and augment Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools with robust, real-world Mori-language applications; and (3) it will potentially promote awareness of, and encourage positive interaction with, the growing community of Mori tweeters, thereby increasing the use and visibility of te reo Mori in an online environment. While the corpus captures data from 2007 to 2020, our analysis shows that the number of tweets in the RMT Corpus peaked in 2014, and the number of active tweeters peaked in 2017, although at least 600 users were still active in 2020. To the best of our knowledge, the RMT Corpus is the largest publicly-available collection of social media data containing (almost) exclusively Mori text, making it a useful resource for language experts, NLP developers and Indigenous researchers alike.

This study aimed to propose a clinical staging proposal of the disease course in non-severe patients with COVID-19. In this retrospective study, 108 non-severe patients with COVID-19 were grouped according to the duration from symptoms onset to hospital admission:  1 week, > 1 to 2 weeks, > 2 to 3 weeks, > 3 to 5 weeks, respectively. The dynamic changes of clinical signs were profiled across the four groups. A clinical staging proposal of the disease course over time was proposed from the perspective of the interaction between the virus and host. The prodromal phase, characterized by pneumonia, significant lymphopenia, and slightly elevated inflammatory markers, occurred in the first week after symptoms onset. In the second week, all the hematological and inflammatory markers were at the peak or bottom. Meanwhile, progressive pneumonia as well as the secondary damage of other organs (e.g. cardiac damage, coagulopathy, etc.) was significant during this period, making the disease progress into the apparent manifestation phase. In the third week, the improvement of the majority of clinical signs accompanied by a relatively high degree of inflammatory response defined the remission phase. After 3 weeks, patients were in the convalescent phase, in which all the indicators were maintained at a relatively normal level. We concluded that the disease course over time in non-severe patients with COVID-19 could be divided into four phases: the prodromal phase (in the first week), the apparent manifestation phase (in the second week), the remission phase (in the third week), and the convalescent phase (after 3 weeks), respectively.

Best care for dysphagic residents with, or at risk of, malnutrition should target adequate nutritional intake and the safety and efficacy of swallowing. The effect of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) suitable for nursing home residents with concurrent OD and malnutrition (risk) on nutritional status has not been investigated before. The current study aims to investigate the effect of daily use of a range of pre-thickened ONS on the body weight of nursing home residents with OD and malnutrition (risk) compared to standard OD and nutritional care. METHODS / DESIGN: The DYNAMO study is a randomized, controlled, multi-center, open label trial with two parallel groups. Study participants will be recruited in nursing homes of several care organizations in the south of the Netherlands. Study duration is 12 weeks. Residents in the control group will receive standard OD and nutritional care, and residents in the test group will receive standard OD and nutritional care with extra daily supplementation of pre-thickened ONS. The main outcome parameter is the difference in body weight change between the control and test groups. An a priori estimation of the required sample size per group (control / test) totals 78. Other outcome parameters are differences in: nutritional intake, health-related quality of life, OD-specific quality of life, activities of daily living, vital signs, and blood nutrient and metabolite levels. DISCUSSION: Regular ONS could address the nutritional needs of nursing home residents with malnutrition (risk), but might be too thin and unsafe for residents with OD. Pre-thickened ONS is suitable for residents with OD. It offers the advantage of being a ready-to-use amylase-resistant product available in several consistencies which are able to increase swallowing efficacy and safety.

The rapidity of its transmission from human to human is far greater than all previous human corona viruses which came into existence like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, etc. The nucleotide sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (isolates Wuhan-Hu-1) is 29,875 bp in ss-RNA. Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infected pneumonia include from asymptomatic to high fever and/or respiratory illnesses. Coronavirus virion (spherical/round /elliptical in shape) consists of three parts- outer membrane or envelope, nucleocapsid and genome (RNA). SARS-CoV-2 was shown to use receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for attachment to the cells through its surface spike (S) protein (S1), and the virion enters into the host cell through two routes- direct membrane fusion and endocytotic pathway. The RNA of SARS-CoV acts directly as mRNA and here minus(-) 1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (-1PRF) is being operated by slippery sequence and pseudoknot, so it translates 16 nonstructural proteins including RNA dependent RNA replicase. Then genomic RNA replicated continuously on Cstrand RNA template and subgenomic RNA transcribed discontinuously on CRNA template to sgmRNA. Subgenomic RNAs/sgmRNAs synthesize all structural proteins.

A complementary approach has been to adopt the concept of biomimicry of natural products and metabolites so as to improve multiple drug-like features of the parent molecule. In this effort, promiscuous and weak interactions between ligands and receptors are often ignored in a drug discovery process. In this emerging concepts' article, we highlight microbial metabolite mimicry, whereby parent metabolites have weak interactions with their receptors, that then have led to discrete examples of more potent and effective drug-like molecules. We show specific examples of parent metabolite mimics with potent effects in vitro and in vivo. Further we show examples of emerging microbial ligand-receptor interactions and provide a context in which these ligands could be improved as potential drugs. A balanced conceptual advance is provided in which we also acknowledge potential pitfalls - hyperstimulation of finely balanced receptor-ligand interactions could also be detrimental. However, on balance, we provide examples of where this emerging concept needs to be tested. Significance Statement The concept of microbial metabolite mimicry as a means to expand drug repertoires is new. Hitherto, there are very few proof-of-concept papers demonstrating utility of this concept. More recently, papers demonstrating mimicry of intestinal microbial metabolites could potentially expand the drug repertoire for diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

We hypothesized that perturbing the functionally active conformation of spike protein through reduction of its solvent accessible disulfide bond, thereby disintegrating its structural architecture, may be a feasible strategy to prevent infection. Proteomics data showed that N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant and mucolytic agent been widely in use in clinical medicine, forms covalent conjugates with solvent accessible cysteine residues of spike protein that were disulfide bonded in the native state. In silico analysis indicated that this covalent conjugation perturbed the stereo specific orientations of the interacting key residues of spike protein that resulted in threefold weakening in the binding affinity of spike protein with ACE2 receptor. Antiviral assay using VeroE6 cells showed that NAC caused 54.3% inhibition in SARS-CoV-2 replication. Interestingly, almost all SARS-Cov-2 variants conserved cystine residues in the spike protein.

Blocking astroglial glutamate uptake reduces evoked Ca2+ entry but has little effect on resting Ca2+ whereas both appear boosted by the constitutive activation of group 1/2 metabotropic glutamate receptors.

This study examined the effects of COVID-19 on male sex work globally and investigated how men who sold sex responded to and engaged with the virus in the context of work. METHODS: This study made use of an existing database of deidentified data extracted from the online profiles maintained by male sex workers on a large, international website. Website engagement metrics were calculated for the periods before (September to December 2019) and during COVID-19 (January to May 2020); Poisson regression analyses were used to assess changes over time before and after, while a content analysis was undertaken to identify modes of engagement with the virus. RESULTS: Data were collected from 78 399 profiles representing 19 388 individuals. In the 'before' period, the number of active profiles was stable (inter-rate ratio (IRR)=1.01, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.01, p=0.339) but during COVID-19 decreased by 26.3% (IRR=0.90, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.91, p<0.001). Newly created profiles also decreased during COVID-19 (59.4%; IRR=0.71, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.74, p<0.001) after a period of stability. In total, 211 unique profiles explicitly referenced COVID-19; 185 (85.8%) evoked risk reduction strategies, including discontinuation of in-person services (41.2%), pivoting to virtual services (38.9%), COVID-19 status disclosure (20.9%), enhanced sanitary and screening requirements (12.3%) and restricted travel (5.2%). Some profiles, however, seemed to downplay the seriousness of COVID-19 or resist protective measures (14.7%). CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the contention that COVID-19 has dramatically impacted the sex industry; globally, male sex workers may be facing considerable economic strain. Targeted education and outreach are needed to support male sex workers grappling with COVID-19, including around the most effective risk reduction strategies.

The Australian fashion industry has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic. Drawing upon a qualitative methodology and associated set of methods consisting of 24 semi\\\\structured interviews with key industry actors, we explore three key themes. First, we examine the impact of COVID\\\\19 on firm dynamics, investigating how fashion brands have navigated a period of significant uncertainty through a combination of highly nimble internal business practices and industry collaborations. Second, in light of unstable globalised supply chains, we consider the important role of local garment production in supporting industrial resilience.

METHODS: Database searches (PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, ProQuest, Ovid, Scopus, and Web of Science) updated to December 2020 were conducted. Articles that identified challenges or barriers to neuro-rehabilitation, impact on disability status and health care services were included. Full-text articles limited to the English language with no restrictions on study design were included. Data was synthesized based on recurrent themes that were identified. RESULTS: Thirty-seven studies were included in this review. Neurological populations considered: stroke, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, parkinson's disease, autism, developmental disabilities, and those who required neurosurgical care. Barriers were grouped into categories as increased disease risk and complications, delayed or restricted access to neuro-rehabilitation, limited hospital access, telerehabilitation limitations, and shutdown of special centers of aid. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to barriers that affect almost every aspect of healthcare and rehabilitation in neurologically challenged populations prompting an increase in their disability level. This can assist policymakers in designing mitigation strategies to minimize the detrimental effects on this vulnerable population.Implications for rehabilitationPandemic has led to the worsening of existing motor and non-motor symptoms, which need to be monitored, assessed and managed medically, and through rehabilitation in neurologically challenged populations.Notable decline of cognition and physical activity in neurologically challenged populations needs to be assessed and efforts to reverse these outcomes should be attempted.Rehabilitation services, hospital care and centers of aid need to be made more accessible for neurologically challenged populations with COVID-19 precautionary measures.Telemedicine and telerehabilitation need to be upgraded to enhance further face to face like interactions and for tracking of progressive disease.","output":"Barriers leading to increased disability in neurologically challenged populations during COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 spreads across the United States, people experiencing homelessness (PEH) are among the most vulnerable to the virus. To mitigate transmission, municipal governments are procuring isolation facilities for PEH to utilize following possible exposure to the virus. Here we describe the framework for anticipating isolation bed demand in PEH communities that we developed to support public health planning in Austin, Texas during March 2020. Using a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission, we projected that, under no social distancing orders, a maximum of 299 (95% Confidence Interval: 223, 321) PEH may require isolation rooms in the same week. Based on these analyses, Austin Public Health finalized a lease agreement for 205 isolation rooms on March 27th 2020. As of October 7th 2020, a maximum of 130 rooms have been used on a single day, and a total of 602 PEH have used the facility. As a general rule of thumb, we expect the peak proportion of the PEH population that will require isolation to be roughly triple the projected peak daily incidence in the city. This framework can guide the provisioning of COVID-19 isolation and post-acute care facilities for high risk communities throughout the United States.","output":"Projecting COVID-19 isolation bed requirements for people experiencing homelessness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interleukin 13 (IL-13) is an immunoregulatory cytokine that is primarily released by activated T-helper 2 cells. It induces the pathogenesis of many allergic diseases, such as airway hyperresponsiveness, glycoprotein hypersecretion and goblet cell hyperplasia. IL-13 also inhibits tumor immunosurveillance, which leads to carcinogenesis. In recent studies, elevated IL-13 serum levels have been shown in severe COVID-19 patients. Thus it is important to predict IL-13 inducing peptides or regions in a protein for designing safe protein therapeutics particularly immunotherapeutic. This paper describes a method developed for predicting, designing and scanning IL-13 inducing peptides. The dataset used in this study contain experimentally validated 313 IL-13 inducing peptides and 2908 non-inducing homo-sapiens peptides extracted from the immune epitope database (IEDB). We have extracted 95 key features using SVC-L1 technique from the originally generated 9165 features using Pfeature. Further, these key features were ranked based on their prediction ability, and top 10 features were used for building machine learning prediction models. In this study, we have deployed various machine learning techniques to develop models for predicting IL-13 inducing peptides. These models were trained, test and evaluated using five-fold cross-validation techniques; best model were evaluated on independent dataset. Our best model based on XGBoost achieves a maximum AUC of 0.83 and 0.80 on the training and independent dataset, respectively. Our analysis indicate that certain SARS-COV2 variants are more prone to induce IL-13 in COVID-19 patients.

Analyzing plants for new antidiabetic remedies has become an impressive territory for life science researchers. Gynura procumbens has long been used to treat diabetes. Thus, we strived to ascertain the hypoglycemic potentiality of extract of leaves of G. procumbens by in vivo and in silico approaches. METHODS: Fresh leaves of G. procumbens were collected and shade-dried to prepare ethanolic extracts to evaluate pharmacological parameters. Diabetes was induced in rats via injecting alloxan through the intraperitoneal route at a dose of 150 mg/kg body weight. Humalyzer 3000 was used to perform a biochemical assay of collected samples from rats. Anti-hyperglycemic activity study along with overdose toxicity test was performed. The pharmacological activity of this plant was also evaluated through a molecular docking study. This in silico study investigated the binding affinity of natural ligands from G. procumbens against glycoside hydrolase enzymes. RESULTS: We detected a peak plasma concentration of G. procumbens at 3 hours 45 minutes that is roughly similar to the peak plasma concentration of metformin. Again, in OGTT and anti-hyperglycemic tests, it has been ascertained that both plant extract and metformin can exert significant (P < 0.05) and highly significant (P < 0.01) hypoglycemic activity in a dose-dependent manner. Metformin exhibited better therapeutic efficacy than that of plant extract, but it possessed null statistical significance. Also, our safety profile expressed that, similar to metformin, the plant extract can restore the disturbed pathological state in a dose-oriented approach with a wide safety margin. In silico study also validated the potentialities of natural constituents of G. procumbens. Conclusion. This study suggested that G. procumbens can be considered as potential antidiabetic plant. Robust and meticulous investigation regarding plant chemistry and pharmacology in the future may bring about a new dimension that will aid in discovering antidiabetic drugs from this plant in the diabetes management system.","output":"In Vivo and In Silico Assessment of Diabetes Ameliorating Potentiality and Safety Profile of Gynura procumbens Leaves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Multiple technologies have developed the endovascular approach to MCA aneurysms. We assess the safety and the efficacy of a systematic endovascular approach in nonselected patients with MCA aneurysms and determine predictors of treatment outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed data collected between January 2007 and January 2012 in a prospective clinical registry. All patients with MCA aneurysms treated by means of the endovascular approach were included. A multivariate analysis was conducted to identify predictors of complications, recanalization, and outcome. RESULTS A total of 120 patients with 131 MCA aneurysms were included. Seventy-nine patients (65.8%) were treated electively and 41 (34.2%) in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Thirty-three of 131 aneurysms (25.2%) were treated with simple coiling, 79 aneurysms (60.3%) with balloon-assisted coiling, and 19 aneurysms (14.5%) with stent-assisted coiling. Complications occurred in 13.7% of patients. Stent-assisted coiling was significantly associated with more complications (P = .002; OR: 4.86; 95% CI, 1.60-14.72). At 1 month after treatment, both the permanent morbidity (mRS 2) and mortality rates were 3.3%, without any significant difference according to the endovascular techniques. Mean angiographic follow-up was 16.3 months. The rate of recanalization was 15.6% without a statistical difference, according to the technique. Larger aneurysms were a predictor of recanalization (P = .016; OR: 1.183; 95% CI, 1.02-1.36). Retreatment was performed in 10 of 131 aneurysms (7.6%). CONCLUSIONS Even though stent-assisted coiling significantly increases the risk of procedural complications, endovascular treatment of MCA aneurysms is safe, effective, and provides durable aneurysm closure in nonselected patients.","output":"Endovascular treatment of middle cerebral artery aneurysms for 120 nonselected patients: a prospective cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Injury to major white matter pathways during language-area associated glioma surgery often leads to permanent loss of neurological function. The aim was to establish standardized tractography of language pathways as a predictor of language outcome in clinical neurosurgery. METHODS We prospectively analyzed 50 surgical cases of patients with left perisylvian, diffuse gliomas. Standardized preoperative Diffusion-Tensor-Imaging (DTI)-based tractography of the 5 main language tracts (Arcuate Fasciculus [AF], Frontal Aslant Tract [FAT], Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus [IFOF], Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus [ILF], Uncinate Fasciculus [UF]) and spatial analysis of tumor and tracts was performed. Postoperative imaging and the resulting resection map were analyzed for potential surgical injury of tracts. The language status was assessed preoperatively, postoperatively and after 3 months using the Aachen Aphasia Test and Berlin Aphasia Score. Correlation analyses, two-step cluster analysis and binary logistic regression were used to analyze associations of tractography results with language outcome after surgery. RESULTS In 14 out of 50 patients (28%), new aphasic symptoms were detected 3 months after surgery. The preoperative infiltration of the AF was associated with functional worsening (cc = 0.314; p = 0.019). Cluster analysis of tract injury profiles revealed two areas particularly related to aphasia: the temporo-parieto-occipital junction (TPO; temporo-parietal AF, middle IFOF, middle ILF) and the temporal stem/peri-insular white matter (middle IFOF, anterior ILF, temporal UF, temporal AF). Injury to these areas (TPO: OR: 23.04; CI: 4.11 - 129.06; temporal stem: OR: 21.96; CI: 2.93 - 164.41) was associated with a higher-risk of persisting aphasia. CONCLUSIONS Tractography of language pathways can help to determine the individual aphasia risk profile pre-surgically. The TPO and temporal stem/peri-insular white matter were confirmed as functional nodes particularly sensitive to surgical injuries.","output":"Towards a tractography-based risk stratification model for language area associated gliomas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using the state-level panel data for India, we establish that Covid infections are clustered in more urbanized, and prosperous states.

OBJECTIVE: To better understand the characteristics and perceptions of care partners who read patients' electronic visit notes. PATIENT INVOLVEMENT: Focus groups with diverse patients from a community health center provided input into survey development. METHODS: We contacted patient portal users at 3 geographically distinct sites in the US via email in 2017 for an online survey including open ended questions which we qualitatively analyzed. RESULTS: Respondents chose whether to answer as care partners (N = 874) or patients (N = 28,782). Among care partner respondents, 44% were spouses, 43% children/other family members, and 14% friends/neighbors/other. Both care partners and patients reported that access to electronic notes was very important for promoting positive health behaviors, but care partners' perceptions of importance were consistently more positive than patients' perceptions of engagement behaviors. Open-ended comments included positive benefits such as: help with remembering the plan for care, coordinating care with other doctors, decreasing stress of care giving, improving efficiency of visits, and supporting patients from a geographical distance. They also offered suggestions for improving electronic portal and note experience for care partners such as having a separate log on for care partners; having doctors avoid judgmental language in their notes; and the ability to prompt needed medical care for patients. DISCUSSION: Care partners value electronic access to patients' health information even more than patients. The majority of care partners were family members, whose feedback is important for improving portal design that effectively engages these care team members. PRACTICAL VALUE: Patient care in the time of COVID-19 increasingly requires social distancing which may place additional burden on care partners supporting vulnerable patients. Access to patient notes may promote quality of care by keeping care partners informed, and care partner's input should be used to optimize portal design and electronic access to patient information.","output":"Care partners reading patients' visit notes via patient portals: Characteristics and perceptions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A heartfelt commentary on the rise of virtual medicine and medical education as told from the perspective of a 3rd year medical student during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"A Viral Connection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contact tracing in the COVID-19 pandemic is key to prevent the further spread of COVID-19.

The majority of participants have basic (40.7%) and intermediate (47.5%) computer skills and more than half of them lack any experience in TB\\\\learning. The overall satisfaction and positive attitude toward TB\\\\learning was less than 50%. Students at final grade, with advanced computer skills and TB\\\\learning experience showed higher satisfaction (OR: 3.031, 2.876, 3.644, respectively) and a more positive attitude (OR: 3.172, 3.035, 3.477, respectively) toward TB\\\\learning than those at earlier grades. Total evaluation scores for lecturers were higher among females (11.5 5.8) than males (9.9 7.2) as well as among participants at final grade (14.0 6.2), with advanced computer skills (13.8 6.1), and TB\\\\learning experience (16.2 6.0). CONCLUSIONS: Dental students demonstrated low\\\\moderate satisfaction and positive attitude toward TB\\\\learning and the quality of material presented to them. Integrating TB\\\\learning into the dental education curriculum is an essential step in enhancing the acceptance of TB\\\\learning in the future.","output":"Evaluation of technology\\\\based learning by dental students during the pandemic outbreak of Corona virus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disease with complex pathological mechanisms. We explored the potential molecular mechanisms behind the therapeutic functions of Qingzi Zhitong decoction (QZZTD) in the treatment of UC by network pharmacology and molecular docking. QZZTD is a formula of Chinese traditional medicine consisting of 10 herbs. The potential active ingredients of QZZTD and their target genes were obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform database, and UC-related target genes were obtained from GeneCards and OMIM databases. A total of 138 co-identified target genes were obtained by plotting the intersection target Venn diagram, and then the STRING database and Cytoscape software were used to establish proteinCprotein interaction networks and herbCingredientCtarget networks. Four key active compounds and nine key proteins were identified. Then, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses showed that the biological functions of potential target genes were associated with DNA transcription, signaling receptor and ligand activity, cytokine activity, cellular autophagy, and antioxidant pathways, with related pathways involving the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)CAkt signaling pathway, advanced glycosylation end product (AGE)CRAGE signaling pathway, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, and IL-17 signaling pathway. Moreover, the binding activities of key target genes and essential active compounds of Chinese herbal medicines in QZZTD were further validated by molecular docking. This demonstrated that quercetin, luteolin, hyndarin, and beta-sitosterol had good binding to eight key proteins, and Akt1 was the target protein with the best binding activity, suggesting that Akt1 could be the essential mediator responsible for signaling transduction after QZZTD administration. The rat experiment verified that QZZTD inhibited PI3K-Akt pathway activation and reduced inflammation in UC. In conclusion, our study suggested four potential key active components, including quercetin, were identified in QZZTD, which could interact with Akt1 and modulate the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway. The other three pathways may also be involved in the signaling transduction induced by QZZTD in the treatment of UC.","output":"Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Analysis on Molecular Mechanism of Qingzi Zhitong Decoction in the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Labor and delivery nurses were asked about their perceptions of mask wearing in the clinical setting during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study aims to identify the the psychological state and related factors on Chinese college students during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: From February 23 to March 5, 2020, a cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 3606 college students from seven provinces in China using standard questionnaires measuring adverse psychological outcomes and related factors including Impact of Event Scale-6 (IES-6), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) were used to determine underlying constructs of the perceived threat items. Multivariate regression was used to explore the determinants of adverse psychological impact. Results: Posttraumatic stress (PTS) were prevalent in this sample of college students, and 34.22% met the cut-off for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The proportion of having mild to extremely severe symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were 15.70%, 13.31% and 7.10%, respectively. The impact of closed-off management on life, perceived threat and passive coping strategies were positively correlated to PTS and DASS scores, while knowledge score, perceived social support and active coping strategies were negatively correlated to DASS scores.

The cationic cotton contains polycationic short chains produced by a self-propagation of 2-diehtylaminoehtyl chloride (DEAE-Cl) on the surface of cotton fibers. Then, the fabric (i.e., polyDEAE@cotton) can be readily functionalized with anionic photosensitizers like rose Bengal and sodium 2-anthraquinone sulfate to produce biocidal reactive oxygen species (ROS) under light exposure and consequently provide the photo-induced biocidal functions. The biocidal properties of the photo-induced fabrics (PIFs) were demonstrated by ROS production measurements, bactericidal performance against bacteria (e.g., E coli and L. innocua), and antiviral results against T7 bacteriophage. The PIFs achieved 99.9999% (6 log) reductions against bacteria and the bacteriophage within 60 min of daylight exposure. Moreover, the PIFs showcase excellent washability and photostability, making them ideal materials for reusable face masks and protective suits with improved biological protections compared with traditional PPE. This work demonstrated that the cationized cotton could serve as a platform for different functionalization applications, and the resulting fiber materials could inspire the development of reusable and sustainable PPE with significant bioprotective properties to fight the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the spread of other contagious diseases.","output":"Daylight-Induced Antibacterial and Antiviral Cotton Cloth for Offensive Personal Protection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health crisis, one major challenge is to identify the susceptibility factors of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in order to adapt the recommendations for populations, as well as to reduce the risk of COVID-19 development in the most vulnerable people, especially patients with chronic respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Airway epithelial cells (AECs) play a critical role in the modulation of both immune responses and COVID-19 severity. SARS-CoV-2 infects the airway through the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and a host protease, transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), plays a major role in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Here, we show that Pseudomonas aeruginosa increases TMPRSS2 expression, notably in primary AECs with deficiency of the ion channel CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Further, we show that the main component of P. aeruginosa flagella, the protein flagellin, increases TMPRSS2 expression in primary AECs and Calu-3 cells, through activation of Toll-like receptor-5 and p38 MAPK. This increase is particularly seen in Calu-3 cells deficient for CFTR and is associated with an intracellular increased level of SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, with no effect on the amount of virus particles released. Considering the urgency of the COVID-19 health crisis, this result may be of clinical significance for CF patients, who are frequently infected with and colonized by P. aeruginosa during the course of CF and might develop COVID-19.","output":"Flagellin From Pseudomonas aeruginosa Modulates SARS-CoV-2 Infectivity in Cystic Fibrosis Airway Epithelial Cells by Increasing TMPRSS2 Expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It appears to be almost self-evident that most people look towards past experiences for guidance during times of crisis.

The outbreak of the Corona pandemic in Germany, starting in March 2020, opens the possibility to collect several preliminary findings by analysing relevant press coverage in the newspapers. Articles from different sections of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (F.A.Z.) and from the Handelsblatt were evaluated. As our main interest focuses on economic historical (not e. g. medical historical) research questions, we chose the F.A.Z. First, because its business reporting is important within the German newspaper environment in general. Second, because its reporting on the Corona pandemic was award-winning. Additionally, we focused on the Handelsblatt because the newspaper provides press coverage explicitly on financial, business, and political issues-all subjects directly affected by the Corona crisis. The analysis concluded that there was a rise in articles with historical references in general while the number of articles linked to businesses did not increase at the same time which can be linked to the absence of expert business history opinions on offer. ? 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","output":"Nutzen von Erfahrungswissen in Krisen.

RESULTS: Data showed coronavirus affects men more than women because of more expression of 2019 nCoV receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) in testicular cells. Also, \\"Bioinformatics Analysis\\" suggests that sperm production may be damaged, since \\"Pseudo Time Analysis\\" has shown disruption in spermatogenesis. \\"Gene Ontology\\" (GO) showed an increase in viral reproduction and a decrease in sperm production-related terms. Recently, SARS-COV-2 mRNA and protein were detected in the semen of patients that had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the probable disruption of blood-testis barrier (BTB) in febrile diseases is suspected in the acute phase of the disease enabling viral entry into the testes. Not only is spermatogenesis disturbed, but also disturbs gonadotropin, androgens, and testosterone secretion during SARS-CoV-2 infection. No sexual transmission has been reported yet; however, detection of the virus in semen still makes the sexual transmission an open question.

Therefore, in this study, the interaction of natural phenolic antioxidants, ellagic acid (ELA), and its derivatives-urolithins A (ULA) and B (ULB)-with BSA was investigated. The results of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) indicated a high affinity of ELA, ULA, and ULB to BSA, with KD value < 1  10-6 M. Furthermore, the KD values of binding of the studied compounds to BSA increased with temperature, revealing a reduction in affinity with an increase in temperature. Fluorescence data showed that the quenching of BSA by tested compounds occurred via a static quenching process. However, the affinity of ELA for BSA was higher than that of ULA and ULB, which may be because of the presence of a large number of hydroxyl groups in its structure. Additionally, the assessment of the antioxidant activity of BSA and BSA-ELA/ULA/ULB complexes using the DPPH assay indicated that the DPPH scavenging activity of BSA increased after complex formation with ELA/ULA/ULB in the following order: BSA-ELA > BSA-ULA > BSA-ULB > BSA, which was due to their structural differences.

It is vital we ensure tailored public health messaging regarding the COVID-19 vaccine is delivered to all communities. Facebook provides an opportunity for large-scale, targeted health promotion. Description of practice Our goal is to increase COVID-19 vaccination uptake across the US, with a specific focus on reaching underrepresented communities most affected by the pandemic. We created a public health campaign centered on a representative group of physicians conveying their own short (<1 minute) video messages that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective. We placed these videos as advertisements on Facebook and directed them using geotargeting to reach zip codes in the US with the highest COVID-19 death rates cross-referenced with zip codes in which >50% of the population is Black or Latinx. We launched the campaign in California on April 9, and nationwide on April 12 2021. The primary outcome measures of the campaign were reach (number of individuals exposed, frequency and duration of views) and engagement (number of likes and shares). Results During our campaign (April 9-April 30), the videos appeared on Facebook newsfeeds 54.4 million times, reaching 9.9 million individuals an average of 5.5 times each. Overall, the videos received 10,053 reactions and 1,161 shares. 1.8 million video plays ran for at least 25% of the video.

This observational, exploratory, multicenter study aims to evaluate the oncology patient's perception about the psychosocial impact of cancer treatment in the scenario of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data were collected from cancer patients who voluntarily answered two self-applied questionnaires. The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) were also used to assess the presence of depression and anxiety symptoms. High score was defined by cutoff &gt; 8. Clinical characteristics and patients perception were reported as frequencies. Chi Square test was used to compare risk of anxiety/depression through HADS and categorical variables, including gender, type of cancer treatment and psychosocial aspects. Odds-Ratio was calculated using logistic regression. Results: 122 patients were included, 86% were receiving chemotherapy, 53.3% with palliative intention. Mean age was 54.8, and 59% were female. Most patients attended the hospital for cancer treatment every 14 days (44.2%). Regarding social isolation, 47.5% only left home when necessary;62.3% of respondents reported not being afraid of being infected by the virus when going to the hospital for treatment. This fact can be understood as 100% of the patients reported that the protocol changes adopted by the hospital in the pandemic were positive and beneficial. A total of 77.8% noticed changes during the pandemic, mainly related to reduced physical activity (53.4%), loss of family (62.2%) or social (54,9%) contact. According to HADS, anxiety and depression symptoms were reported in 17% and 15,5% respectively. Female patients scored higher on HADS-A (OR 4,091 (CI95% 1,114-15,021)). No difference was observed in HADS independently of line of chemotherapy or type of treatment. HADS score was not higher in inpatients. 52,4% of patients were more afraid of cancer than COVID infection. Patients who answered that the fear of cancer was higher than the fear of COVID-19 infection scored higher at HADS-D (OR 4,712 (CI95% 1,77-15,028)). Conclusions: Patients were more afraid of cancer than COVID-19 infection. Female patients had a higher anxiety score and more depression was observed in patients who were more afraid of cancer.

We examined associations between a broad set of risk and protective factors with symptoms of depression, anxiety, alcohol problems, and eating pathology, and investigated interactions between objective stress due to COVID-19 and risk/protective variables in predicting psychopathology. Methods: Participants were 877 adults (73.7% female) recruited via internet sources from around the globe, but primarily residing in North America (87.4%). Results: Structural equation modelling revealed that certain risk and protective factors (e.g., loneliness, latent protective factor, mindfulness) were broadly related to psychopathology, whereas others showed unique relations with specific forms of psychopathology (e.g., greater repetitive thinking and anxiety;low meaning and purpose and depression).

METHODS: Five databases were searched from inception to April 23, 2020 for randomized clinical trials comparing the failure rate of these materials. After duplicate study removal, data extraction and risk of bias assessment with the Cochrane tool, data synthesis was conducted, comparing all five tooth-coloured materials in pairs and computing the overall success rate for each one, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 5615 articles were obtained by electronic and hand literature search. After the application of the eligibility criteria, ten RCTs were included in this systematic review and six RCTs for meta-analysis. Their risk of bias was assessed to be high to moderate. Due to the small number of RCTs comparing the five restorative materials in pairs investigated in the same study, only three MAs were available for heterogeneity assessment. These were: (1) between CO-RMGI (RR 1.04 [0.59, 1.84]; p = 0.88; I2 = 1%), (2) CR-CO (RR 1.12 [0.41, 3.02]; p = 0.83; I2 = 57%), and (3) between CR-RMGI (RR 1.10 [0.74, 1.63]; p = 0.65; I2 = 0%). No statistically significant differences were found between the two materials in all three comparisons. CONCLUSION: CR, RMGI and CO presented no statistical differences. In comparison to other tooth-coloured materials, studies on GI were too few to allow recommendations about its use. More studies on HGVI are needed for evidence-based recommendations to be made. The evidence extracted from this meta-analysis was not strong enough (moderate), due to the small number of RCTs and the risk of bias ranging from high to moderate.

The connectivity context was emphasized that possibly had inflicted the outbreak. Using the modes of transmission data for the available cases, the diffusion of this disease was explained. Metropolitans contributed three-fourths of total cases from the beginning. The transport networks attributed significantly in transmitting the virus from the urban containment zones. Later, there was a gradual shift of infections from urban to rural areas; however, the numbers kept increasing in the former. The massive reverse migration after lockdown spiked the infected cases further. Districts with airports reported more with influx of international passengers. A profound east-west division in April with higher infections in the southern and western districts existed. By mid-May eastern India saw a steep rise in active cases. Moran's I analysis showed a low autocorrelation initially which increased over time. Hotspot clustering was observed in western Maharashtra, eastern Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and around Kolkata by the second week of August. The diffusion was due to travel, exposure to infected individuals and among the frontline workers.

We aimed to describe the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC), including virological characteristics and clinical severity in contemporaneous patients with and without the variant. METHODS: In this cohort study, samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR that were collected from Nov 9, 2020, for patients acutely admitted to one of two hospitals on or before Dec 20, 2020, in London, UK, were sequenced and analysed for the presence of VOC-defining mutations. We fitted Poisson regression models to investigate the association between B.1.1.7 infection and severe disease (defined as point 6 or higher on the WHO ordinal scale within 14 days of symptoms or positive test) and death within 28 days of a positive test and did supplementary genomic analyses in a cohort of chronically shedding patients and in a cohort of remdesivir-treated patients. Viral load was compared by proxy, using PCR cycle threshold values and sequencing read depths. FINDINGS: Of 496 patients with samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR and who met inclusion criteria, 341 had samples that could be sequenced. 198 (58%) of 341 had B.1.1.7 infection and 143 (42%) had non-B.1.1.7 infection. We found no evidence of an association between severe disease and death and lineage (B.1.1.7 vs non-B.1.1.7) in unadjusted analyses (prevalence ratio [PR] 097 [95% CI 072-131]), or in analyses adjusted for hospital, sex, age, comorbidities, and ethnicity (adjusted PR 102 [076-138]). We detected no B.1.1.7 VOC-defining mutations in 123 chronically shedding immunocompromised patients or in 32 remdesivir-treated patients. Viral load by proxy was higher in B.1.1.7 samples than in non-B.1.1.7 samples, as measured by cycle threshold value (mean 288 [SD 47] vs 320 [48]; p=00085) and genomic read depth (1280 [1004] vs 831 [682]; p=00011).

HYPOTHESES The following hypotheses were tested: (1) nurses' sense of preparedness for infectious disease outbreaks and naturally occurring disasters will be higher than for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN)-type disasters associated with terrorist attacks; (2) perceptions of preparedness will vary according to previous outbreak experience; and (3) perceptions of personal preparedness will be related to perceived institutional preparedness. METHODS Nurses from emergency departments and intensive care units across Canada were recruited via flyer mailouts and e-mail notices to complete a 30-minute online survey. RESULTS A total of 1,543 nurses completed the survey (90% female; 10% male). The results indicate that nurses feel unprepared to respond to large-scale disasters/attacks. The sense of preparedness varied according to the outbreak/disaster scenario with nurses feeling least prepared to respond to a CBRN event. A variety of socio-demographic factors, notably gender, previous outbreak experience (particularly with SARS), full-time vs. part-time job status, and region of employment also were related to perceptions of risk. Approximately 40% of respondents were unaware if their hospital had an emergency plan for a large-scale outbreak. Nurses reported inadequate access to resources to support disaster response capacity and expressed a low degree of confidence in the preparedness of Canadian healthcare institutions for future outbreaks.

However, direct measurements of the vagal control are difficult. The novel deceleration capacity (DC) of heart rate measure has been used to characterize the vagal modulation. This study aimed to assess vagal control in VVS patients and evaluate the diagnostic value of the DC in VVS. Methods - Altogether 161 consecutive VVS patients (43  15 years; 62 males) were enrolled.

DC and heart rate variability (HRV) in 24-hour electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and biochemical examinations were compared between the syncope and control groups. Results - DC was significantly higher in the syncope group than in the control group (9.6  3.3 ms vs. 6.5  2.0 ms, P0.001). DC was similarly increased in VVS patients with a positive and negative TTT (9.73.5 ms and 9.42.9 ms, P=0.614). In multivariable logistic regression analyses, DC was independently associated with syncope (OR=1.518, 95% CI 1.301-1.770, P =0.0001).

METHOD: Reductions in projected suicide mortality over the period 2021C2031 were calculated for scenarios in which combinations of four and five suicide prevention and mental health services interventions (selected from 13 possible interventions) are implemented separately in each PHN catchment. State-level impacts were estimated by summing reductions in projected suicide mortality for each intervention combination across PHN catchments. RESULTS: The most effective state-level combinations of four and five interventions prevent, respectively, 20.3% and 22.9% of 10 312 suicides projected under a business-as-usual scenario (i.e. no new policies or programmes, constant services capacity growth).

We aimed to assess feasibility and reliability of 2 central adjudication methods of mRS in the setting of a randomized endovascular stroke trial. METHODS This is a secondary analysis derived from the Randomized Trial of Revascularization With Solitaire FR Device Versus Best Medical Therapy in the Treatment of Acute Stroke Due to Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion Presenting Within Eight Hours of Symptom Onset (REVASCAT) trial cohort. Primary outcome was distribution of mRS at 90 days. Local evaluation was done by certified investigators masked to treatment assignment using structured face-to-face interviews. In addition, central assessment was performed by 2 independent raters via structured phone interview (n=120) and via video recordings of the face-to-face interviews with local investigators (n=106). Interrater agreement was evaluated using kappa and discordance statistics. Sensitivity analyses for the primary end point using different adjudication approaches were performed. Correlation between mRS obtained with each modality and 24-hour follow-up infarct volumes was studied. RESULTS Using local evaluation as the reference, higher agreement rates were noted with central video than with central phone evaluations (kw 0.92 [0.88-0.96] versus 0.77 [0.72-0.83]). Discrepancies in mRS scoring between local and central raters (phone- and video-based) were similar in both treatment allocation arms. Sensitivity analyses showed benefit of endovascular treatment irrespective of adjudication method, but higher odds ratios were observed with local evaluations. Final infarct volume was similarly correlated with mRS across all 3 evaluation modalities. CONCLUSIONS Central adjudication of mRS is feasible, reducing interrater variability and avoiding potential problems related to lack of blinding.

Content analysis of the literature identified categories related to adapting standards of care that have been considered by individuals or groups that should be considered in Australia, should a dialogue be undertaken. The categories include ethical expectations of professional practice; legal interpretation of care requirements, resource priority between hospital and public health and informing communities. Literature reviews and commentary may provide the background for a national dialogue on the nursing response in an extreme event. However, it is only with the engagement of a broadly representative segment of the professional nursing community that appropriate guidance on adapting standards of care under extreme conditions can be developed and then integrated into the professional worldview of nursing in Australia.","output":"Call for national dialogue: Adapting standards of care in extreme events.

Exposure to household members with confirmed COVID\\\\19 is the most common source of infection among children. Children are just as likely as adults to get infected with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. Most children are asymptomatic and when symptoms occur, they are usually mild. Infants <12 months old are at a higher risk for severe or critical disease. COVID\\\\19 is diagnosed the same way in pediatric population as adults by testing specimen obtained from upper respiratory tract for nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) using reverse transcriptase viral polymerase chain reaction (RT\\\\PCR). The common laboratory findings in hospitalized patient include leukopenia, lymphopenia, and increased levels of inflammatory markers. Chest X\\\\ray findings are variable and computed tomography scans of the chest may show ground glass opacities similar to adults or non\\\\specific findings. Prevention is the primary intervention strategy. Recently the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided emergency authorization of the Pfizer\\\\BioNTech COVID\\\\19 vaccine and many other vaccine candidates are in the investigational stage. There is limited data in children on the use of antivirals, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, monoclonal antibody, and convalescent plasma. Oxygen therapy is required in hypoxic children (saturation <92%). Similar to adults, other measures to maintain oxygenation such as high flow nasal cannula, CPAP, or ventilatory support may be needed. Ventilatory management strategies should include use of low tidal volumes (5C6 cc/kg), high positive expiratory pressure, adequate sedation, paralysis, and prone positioning. Recently, a new entity associated with COVID\\\\19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS\\\\C) has emerged. Clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological criteria are the basis for this diagnosis. Management options include ICU admission, steroids, intravenous gamma globulin, aspirin, anakinra, and anticoagulants. Vasoactive\\\\inotropic score (VIS) is used to guide vasopressor support.","output":"COVID 19 infection: Pediatric perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To compare gynecologic oncology surgical treatment modifications and delays during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic between a publicly funded Canadian versus a privately funded American cancer center. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of all planned gynecologic oncology surgeries at University Health Network (UHN) in Toronto, Canada and Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) in Boston, USA, between March 22,020 and July 302,020. Surgical treatment delays and modifications at both centers were compared to standard recommendations. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: A total of 450 surgical gynecologic oncology patients were included; 215 at UHN and 235 at BWH. There was a significant difference in median time from decision-to-treat to treatment (23 vs 15 days, p < 0.01) between UHN and BWH and a significant difference in treatment delays (32.56% vs 18.29%; p < 0.01) and modifications (8.37% vs 0.85%; p < 0.01), respectively. On multivariable analysis adjusting for age, race, treatment site and surgical priority status, treatment at UHN was an independent predictor of treatment modification (OR = 9.43,95% CI 1.81-49.05, p < 0.01). Treatment delays were higher at UHN (OR = 1.96,95% CI 1.14-3.36 p = 0.03) and for uterine disease (OR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.11-5.33, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: During the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic, gynecologic oncology patients treated at a publicly funded Canadian center were 9.43 times more likely to have a surgical treatment modification and 1.96 times more likely to have a surgical delay compared to an equal volume privately funded center in the United States.","output":"Gynecologic oncology treatment modifications or delays in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in a publicly funded versus privately funded North American tertiary cancer center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The humoral intrathecal immune response in coronavirus-induced demyelinating encephalomyelitis in rats associated with an autoimmune reaction to brain antigen, was analysed.

The main endpoint of this epidemiological, observational, prospective and monocentric study was to identify the number, types, and severity of adverse events following immunisation that occurred in subjects who had been previously infected with COVID-19, and in those who had not, after vaccination with Comirnaty, and to compare the two groups of subjects looking at events that occurred within a month after the first and the second dose. METHODS: Data were gathered by a questionnaire. The results included the responses of all healthcare workers (2030) of the IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital (Italy) vaccinated between 1st January and 28th February 2021. Adverse effects of the vaccine were reported after the first and the second doses. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant increase (p<0.001, (2)=35.60) in participants who experienced some side-effects after receiving the first dose of the vaccine and who had previously been infected with the coronavirus, compared with participants who had not previously been infected. 46.76% (136) of the participants who had previously been infected experienced some side-effects after the first dose of vaccine, and 63.23% (184) experienced some side-effects after the second dose, compared with 29.15% (507) after the first dose and 70.79% (1231) after the second dose in those who had not been previously infected. The number of participants who experienced side-effects after the second dose and had previously been infected was significantly lower compared with participants who had not previously been infected (p=0.0094, (2)=6.743). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the side-effects identified in this trial were also reported by the manufacturer and the US Food and Drug Administration.

Histone methylation, which is mediated mainly by lysine methyltransferases, lysine demethylases, and protein arginine methyltransferases, has emerged as an essential mechanism regulating pathological processes in digestive cancers. Under certain conditions, aberrant expression of these modifiers leads to abnormal histone methylation or demethylation in the corresponding cancer-related genes, which contributes to different processes and phenotypes, such as carcinogenesis, proliferation, metabolic reprogramming, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and migration, during digestive cancer development. In this review, we focus on the association between histone methylation regulation and the development of digestive cancers, including gastric cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer, as well as on its clinical application prospects, aiming to provide a new perspective on the management of digestive cancers.","output":"The role of histone methylation in the development of digestive cancers: a potential direction for cancer management."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The WHO Global Vaccine Safety Multi-Country Collaboration study on safety in pregnancy aims to estimate the minimum detectable risk for selected perinatal and neonatal outcomes and assess the applicability of standardized case definitions for study outcomes and maternal immunization in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper documents the operational lessons learned from the study. A prospective observational study was conducted across 21 hospitals in seven countries. All births occurring at sites were screened to identify select perinatal and neonatal outcomes from May 2019 to August 2020. Up to 100 cases per outcome were recruited to assess the applicability of standardized case definitions. A multi-pronged study quality assurance plan was implemented. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on site functioning and project implementation was also assessed. Multi-layered ethics and administrative approvals, limited clinical documentation, difficulty in identifying outcomes requiring in-hospital follow-up, and poor quality internet connectivity emerged as important barriers to study implementation. Use of electronic platforms, application of a rigorous quality assurance plan with frequent interaction between the central and site teams helped improve data quality. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted data collection for up to 6 weeks in some sites. Our study succeeded in establishing an international hospital-based surveillance network for evaluating perinatal and neonatal outcomes using common study protocol and procedures in geographically diverse sites with differing levels of infrastructure, clinical and health-utilization practices.

DS patients often present with several congenital defects and chronic diseases, including immunity disorders. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;) have been seen, which appear to vary with age. At birth, patients present with combined immunodeficiency, with frequent infections that decrease with age. Furthermore, high levels of IL-4 and IL-10 with anti-inflammatory properties and low levels of IL-6 and TNF-&#945; are described in children. The immune system is believed to play an essential role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and it has been associated with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an exaggerated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that may eventually trigger a severe situation called cytokine storm. On the other hand, genetic features seem to be involved in the predisposition to illness and its severity. Overexpression of DSCR1 and ZAKI-4 inhibits the translocation of activated T lymphocyte nuclear factor (NF-AT) to the nucleus, a main step in the inflammatory responsiveness. We discuss here the possible role of immunology and genetic features of DS in the infection and prognosis in COVID-19.","output":"Down's syndrome and COVID-19: risk or protection factor against infection?

METHODS: Travel restrictions were imposed in most areas of the country between 23 January 2020 and 25 February 2020 owing to the COVID-19 epidemic. Travel restrictions were lifted from 26 February 2020 to 12 March 2020. The number of new confirmed cases significantly reduced after 12 March 2020. Study participants, comprised of individuals from three distinct groups: (1) 835 cancer patients who attended Zhejiang Cancer Hospital between 26 February 2020 and 12 March 2020; (2) 185 healthy volunteers recruited between 26 February 2020 and 12 March 2020; (3) 168 cancer patients who attended the hospital during the non-epidemic period (after 12 March 2020). Two outcome measures including patients' posttraumatic stress responses and general psychological distress (GPD) were assessed using the Chinese versions of the Impact of Events Scale-Revised and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Treatment delay was assessed via counting the time interval from diagnosis to treatment initiation, or from planned treatment date to actual date of therapy. Communication satisfaction was evaluated via a self-report questionnaire. An independent sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for comparison. Statistical analysis included Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: All 1188 participants (835 patients with cancer and 185 controls during the outbreak, and 168 patients with cancer during the non-epidemic period) completed and submitted the questionnaires. A positive association was observed between treatment delays and increased GPD levels (OR 1.716; 95% confidence interval ,CI 1.254-2.348; p = 0.001) as well as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (OR: 1.545, 95% CI: (1.166-2.047), p = 0.002). Patients who reported good communication with their doctors showed a significantly lower risk of GPD (OR: 0.526, 95% CI (0.348-0.794), p = 0.002) and PTSD (OR: 0.683, 95% CI (0.490-0.951), p = 0.024) compared with patients who reported unsatisfactory communication or had no contact with their doctors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that treatment at a local hospital, treatment delays and unsatisfactory or no communication with cancer-care professionals were significantly correlated with severe GPD and PTSD symptoms of patients (all p  0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that cancer patients who underwent treatment delays during the COVID-19 pandemic may become vulnerable to psychological distress. The results showed that effective communication with doctors and cancer-care professionals during outbreak significantly reduces GPD levels and PTSD symptoms.","output":"Psychological distress of cancer patients caused by treatment delay during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Access to the Internet is necessary to ensure equity for the right to education. However, about 75% of school-age children in rural areas of the world do not have access to the Internet at home. In the Ecuadorian context, only 5.1% of the rural population uses the Internet in public/state schools. Therefore, actions are necessary to reduce the digital gap to improve the quality of education in rural communities in Ecuador. An initiative of IEEE Ecuador, with the support of IEEE SIGHT and the Municipality of Nabn, allowed the rehabilitation of a data network in 40 schools in the Nabn community in 2020. This paper examines the impact of the project, through of the collection of quantitative and qualitative data through stakeholder surveys, to evaluate the impact of data network rehabilitation in the community during the first year of operation. The results show that the Internet in schools has improved the quality of education for students, has allowed children and young people to have access to online education during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has decreased the dropout rate in the benefited schools.

METHODS: A convergent mixed methods approach was undertaken. Four hundred and thirty HCWs in the Mid West and South of Ireland responded to an online survey in terms of their use of psychological support resources during Wave 1 (April/May 2020) of COVID-19. Thirty-nine HCWs undertook in depth interviews at Wave 3 (January/February 2021), and a further quantitative survey was distributed and completed by 278 HCWs at this time. Quantitative data arising at Wave 1 and Wave 3, were synthesised with Qualitative data collected at Wave 3. A Pillar Integration Process (PIP) was utilised in the analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data. RESULTS: Five pillars were identified from the integration of results. These were: a) the primacy of peer support, b) the importance of psychologically informed management, c) a need to develop the organisational well-being ethos, d) support for all HCWs, and e) HCWs ideas for developing the well-being path. These pillars encapsulated a strong emphasis on collegial support, an emphasis on the need to support managers, a questioning of the current supports provided within the healthcare organisations and critical reflections on what HCWs viewed as most helpful for their future support needs. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs who utilised supportive resources indicated in house supports, primarily collegial resources, were the most frequently used and perceived as most helpful. While formal psychological supports were important, the mechanism by which such psychological support is made available, through utilising peer support structures and moving towards psychologically informed supervisors and workplaces is likely to be more sustainable and perceived more positively by HCWs.","output":"Healthcare workers use of psychological support resources during COVID-19; a mixed methods approach utilising Pillar Integration Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are growing concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic has facilitated a sedentary shift in our physical activity habits.

Coronaviruses have produced two pandemics and one epidemic in the last two decades. The current pandemic has created a worldwide catastrophe threatening the lives of over 15 million as of July 2020. Current research efforts have been focused on producing a vaccine or repurposing current drug compounds to develop a therapeutic. There is, however, a need to study the active site preferences of relevant targets, such as the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro), to determine ways to optimize these drug compounds. The ensemble docking and characterization work described in this article demonstrates the multifaceted features of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site, molecular guidelines to improving binding affinity, and ultimately the optimization of drug candidates. A total of 220 compounds were docked into both the 5R7Z and 6LU7 SARS-CoV-2 Mpro crystal structures. Several key preferences for strong binding to the four subsites (S1, S1', S2, and S4) were identified, such as accessing hydrogen binding hotspots, hydrophobic patches, and utilization of primarily aliphatic instead of aromatic substituents. After optimization efforts using the design guidelines developed from the molecular docking studies, the average docking score of the parent compounds was improved by 6.59 -log10(Kd) in binding affinity which represents an increase of greater than six orders of magnitude. Using the optimization guidelines, the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor cinanserin was optimized resulting in an increase in binding affinity of 4.59 -log10(Kd) and increased protease inhibitor bioactivity. The results of molecular dynamic (MD) simulation of cinanserin-optimized compounds CM02, CM06, and CM07 revealed that CM02 and CM06 fit well into the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession number 6LU7] and formed strong and stable interactions with the key residues, Ser-144, His-163, and Glu-166.

In this work, we have evaluated the effectiveness of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), a surfactant, as a tableting lubricant. If adequate lubrication efficiency is achieved, the use of SLS may be suitable to mitigate problems associated with hydrophobic lubricants. Results show that SLS, when applied in the proper amount to typical pharmaceutical powder mixtures, achieved lubrication efficiency comparable to a grade of magnesium stearate (MgSt) without deteriorating tabletability. Moreover, SLS-containing tablets of celecoxib also exhibited improved in vitro dissolution compared to MgSt-containing tablets. The enhancement in dissolution properties was attributed to the improved wetting by the dissolution medium due to the presence of SLS.","output":"A systematic evaluation of dual functionality of sodium lauryl sulfate as a tablet lubricant and wetting enhancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Neuroendocrine neoplasia (NEN) of the thymus is a very rare entity with poor prognosis.

We describe our long term experience with everolimus and give a thorough review of the therapeutic strategies used so far. PATIENTS AND METHODS 4 patients (mean age 46 years, range 37-55) with progressing thymic NEN (two well differentiated atypical carcinoids and two atypical carcinoids with large cell characteristics) were treated with everolimus 10 mg/d after failure of at least one previous medical therapy. Everolimus was applied after a mean interval of 32.4 months (range 5 - 56) after first diagnosis. The follow up included clinical examination, imaging, and chromogranin A testing in 3 or 6 monthly intervals. RESULTS We observed stable disease for a mean of 20.8 months. Both patients with large cell characteristics thymic NEN (Ki-67 of 20 %) had rapid progress after 7 and 10 months and had more previous therapies (3 and 6) than the patients with well differentiated thymic NEN (Ki-67 5 % and 10 %, progress after 24 and 42 months, 1 and 2 previous therapies).

Changes to the microbiome are determined by the stage, grade, origin (NST/lobular), and receptor status of the tumor. This year is the 50th anniversary of when Hill and colleagues first showed that changes to the gut microbiome can support breast cancer growth, namely that the oncobiome can reactivate excreted estrogens. The currently available human and murine data suggest that oncobiosis is not a cause of breast cancer, but can support its growth. Furthermore, preexisting dysbiosis and the predisposition to cancer are transplantable. The breasts and breast cancers inherent microbiome and the gut microbiome promote breast cancer growth by reactivating estrogens, rearranging cancer cell metabolism, bringing about a more inflammatory microenvironment, and reducing the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Furthermore, the gut microbiome can produce cytostatic metabolites, the production of which decreases or blunts breast cancer. The role of oncobiosis in the urinary tract is largely uncharted. Oncobiosis in breast cancer supports invasion, metastasis, and recurrence by supporting cellular movement, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cancer stem cell function, and diapedesis. Finally, the oncobiome can modify the pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutic drugs.

Although coagulation abnormalities have found in novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) patients, still little is known about the association between the disease and changes in coagulation parameters. Our purpose is to evaluate the differences between the coagulation parameters between COVID-19 patients and healthy counterparts. PATIENTS AND METHODS 63 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were admitted to the present study. We evaluated coagulation value in these patients and in 40 healthy individuals. RESULTS We found that although there was no significant difference between PT and PTT values in patients and healthy counterparts, the fibrinogen values in patients were higher than the control group (p < 0.05). Moreover, the values of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) and D-dimer in all COVID-19 cases were considerably higher than those in control people (p < 0.05). Of note, FDP and D-dimer in patients with regular COVID-19 infection were lower than patients with severe forms. CONCLUSIONS It seems that the conduction of routine blood coagulation test could be a beneficial supplementary approach for early diagnosis of COVID-19.

Calcification is sometimes observed in thymomas using computed tomography (CT), and it is more frequent in invasive thymomas than in noninvasive thymomas. However, the significance of calcification in thymomas remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the significance of calcification in thymomas on invasiveness to surrounding organs and investigate the characteristics of thymoma cases with calcification at our institution. METHODS: We included thymoma patients treated at our institution between 2000 and 2016, and evaluated their characteristics, including demographics, calcification on CT, histology, Masaoka stage, and myasthenia gravis status. The patients were categorized into calcification (C) and noncalcification (NC) groups. RESULTS: Among 51 included patients, 11 (21.6%) had calcification. A higher proportion of group C patients had World Health Organization histological type B2 and B3 tumors (high-risk) than type A, AB, and B1 tumors (low-risk; p = 0.0477). The number of patients with Masaoka stages III and IV were significantly higher in the C group than in the NC group (p < 0.0001). The C group patients had significantly higher rates of invasion to the mediastinal pleura, pericardium, lung, phrenic nerve, and chest wall and pleural dissemination than the NC group patients. CONCLUSIONS: Calcification reflects invasiveness of tumors to surrounding organs and tissues, and may thus predict thymoma stage and histologically high-risk thymomas. Calcification in thymomas may also predict the pathological stage and help decide therapeutic methods and surgical approaches to treat thymomas based on the calcification status according to CT findings.","output":"Calcification in thymomas can predict invasiveness to surrounding organs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transdermal vaccination route using biodegradable microneedles is a rapidly progressing field of research and applications. The fear of painful needles is one of the primary reasons most people avoid getting vaccinated. Therefore, developing an alternative pain-free method of vaccination using microneedles has been a significant research area. Microneedles comprise arrays of micron-sized needles that offer a pain-free method of delivering actives across the skin. Apart from being pain-free, microneedles provide various advantages over conventional vaccination routes such as intramuscular and subcutaneous. Microneedle vaccines induce a robust immune response as the needles ranging from 50 to 900 m in length can efficiently deliver the vaccine to the epidermis and the dermis region, which contains many Langerhans and dendritic cells. The microneedle array looks like band-aid patches and offers the advantages of avoiding cold-chain storage and self-administration flexibility. The slow release of vaccine antigens is an important advantage of using microneedles. The vaccine antigens in the microneedles can be in solution or suspension form, encapsulated in nano or microparticles, and nucleic acid-based. The use of microneedles to deliver particle-based vaccines is gaining importance because of the combined advantages of particulate vaccine and pain-free immunization. The future of microneedle-based vaccines looks promising however, addressing some limitations such as dosing inadequacy, stability and sterility will lead to successful use of microneedles for vaccine delivery.

In other words, for every nice graph G, there should exist a locally irregular multigraph M with the same adjacencies and having few edges.

In Barrett's esophagus, esophageal impedance monitoring is hampered by low baseline impedance values. Whether these low baselines are caused by an intrinsically low impedance of cylindrical epithelium or by the excessive reflux itself is hitherto unknown. Data on esophageal motility after RFA are scarce. Our aim was to examine the effect of RFA on esophageal motility and esophageal baseline impedance in patients with Barrett's esophagus. METHODS In 10 patients, conventional esophageal manometry and 24-h pH-impedance measurements were performed before and after RFA. The number and type of reflux episodes were assessed and baseline impedance values were measured in all recording segments. In another five patients, high-resolution manometry was performed before and after RFA. RESULTS Complete regression of all Barrett's epithelium was achieved in all 15 patients after 3  1 RFA sessions. Overall, no significant motility changes were found after RFA. Patients had excessive acid exposure times before and after RFA [25 (17-42) and 16 (9-24)%, respectively]. Baseline esophageal impedance values were low, with the lowest values in the distal recording segments. RFA increased baseline impedance in all recording segments in the upright position; in the supine position, the effect just failed to reach statistically significant levels. CONCLUSION RFA did not alter esophageal motility significantly. Low esophageal baseline impedance levels in patients with Barrett's esophagus reflect, at least in part, intrinsic impedance properties of cylindrical epithelium, as baselines increased after conversion into neosquamous epithelium.","output":"Esophageal motility and impedance characteristics in patients with Barrett's esophagus before and after radiofrequency ablation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To characterize the incidence, risk factors, and consequences of delirium in older adults undergoing spine surgery.

MEASUREMENTS Postoperative delirium and delirium severity were assessed using validated methods, including the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), CAM for the Intensive Care Unit, Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98, and chart review. Hospital-based outcomes were obtained from the medical record and hospital charges from data reported to the state. RESULTS Thirty-six participants (40.5%) developed delirium after spine surgery, with 17 (47.2%) having purely hypoactive features. Independent predictors of delirium were lower baseline cognition, higher average baseline pain, more intravenous fluid administered, and baseline antidepressant medication. In adjusted models, the development of delirium was independently associated with higher quintile of length of stay (odds ratio (OR) = 3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.48-9.04, P = .005), higher quintile of hospital charges (OR = 3.49, 95% CI = 1.35-9.00, P = .01), and lower odds of discharge to home (OR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.07-0.69, P = .009).

Nevertheless, predictive biomarkers that can help identify patients more likely to develop these irAEs could enhance the management of these toxicities. METHODS: To identify candidate predictive biomarkers associated with GI irAEs, gene expression profiling was performed on whole blood samples from 162 advanced melanoma patients at baseline, 3 and 11 weeks after the start of ipilimumab treatment in two phase II clinical trials (CA184004 and CA184007). Overall, 49 patients developed Grade 2 or higher (grade 2+) GI irAEs during the course of treatment. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the differences in mean expression levels between the GI irAE and No-GI irAE groups of patients at the three time points. RESULTS: In baseline samples, 27 probe sets showed differential mean expression ( 1.5 fold, P  0.05) between the GI irAE and No-GI irAE groups. Most of these probe sets belonged to three functional categories: immune system, cell cycle, and intracellular trafficking. Changes in gene expression over time were also characterized. In the GI irAE group, 58 and 247 probe sets had a  1.5 fold change in expression from baseline to 3 and 11 weeks after first ipilimumab dose, respectively. In particular, on-treatment expression increases of CD177 and CEACAM1, two neutrophil-activation markers, were closely associated with GI irAEs, suggesting a possible role of neutrophils in ipilimumab-associated GI irAEs. In addition, the expression of several immunoglobulin genes increased over time, with greater increases in patients with grade 2+ GI irAEs. CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression profiling of peripheral blood, sampled before or early in the course of treatment with ipilimumab, resulted in the identification of a set of potential biomarkers that were associated with occurrence of GI irAEs. However, because of the low sensitivity of these biomarkers, they cannot be used alone to predict which patients will develop GI irAEs. Further investigation of these biomarkers in a larger patient cohort is warranted.","output":"Gene expression profiling of whole blood in ipilimumab-treated patients for identification of potential biomarkers of immune-related gastrointestinal adverse events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We compared the characteristics of hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients who had coronavirus disease in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

Compared to the original virus, Omicron is characterized by several mutations in its genomic region, including the spike proteins receptor-binding domain (RBD). We have computationally investigated the interaction between the RBD of both the wild type and Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor using molecular dynamics and molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA)-based binding free energy calculations. The mode of the interaction between Omicrons RBD with the hACE2 receptor is similar to the original SARS-CoV-2 RBD except for a few key differences. The binding free energy difference shows that the spike protein of Omicron has an increased affinity for the hACE2 receptor. The mutated residues in the RBD showed strong interactions with a few amino acid residues of hACE2. More specifically, strong electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) and hydrogen bonding were observed between R493 and R498 residues of the Omicron RBD with D30/E35 and D38 residues of the hACE2, respectively. Other mutated amino acids in the Omicron RBD, e.g., S496 and H505, also exhibited hydrogen bonding with the hACE2 receptor. A pi-stacking interaction was also observed between tyrosine residues (RBD-Tyr501: hACE2-Tyr41) in the complex, which contributes majorly to the binding free energies and suggests that this is one of the key interactions stabilizing the formation of the complex. The resulting structural insights into the RBD:hACE2 complex, the binding mode information within it, and residue-wise contributions to the free energy provide insight into the increased transmissibility of Omicron and pave the way to design and optimize novel antiviral agents.","output":"Improved Binding Affinity of Omicrons Spike Protein for the Human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 Receptor Is the Key behind Its Increased Virulence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vietnam is widely praised for its successful fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this study, the usability of a smartphone app for teleconsultation among orthopedic specialists was investigated to explore issues informing further recommendations for improvement in the following iterations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore usability issues emerging from users interactions with MEDIC app, a smartphone-based patient-centered physician-to-physician teleconsultation system. METHODS: Five attending physicians in the Department of Orthopedics in a large medical school in Bangkok, Thailand, were recruited and asked to perform 5 evaluation tasks, namely, group formation, patient registration, clinical data capturing, case record form creation, and teleconsultation. In addition, one expert user was recruited as the control participant. Think aloud was adopted while performing the tasks. Semistructured interviews were conducted after each task and prior to the exit. Quantitative and qualitative measures were used to identify usability issues in 7 domains based on the People At the Centre of Mobile Application Development model: effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, learnability, memorability, error, and cognitive load. RESULTS: Several measures indicate various aspects of usability of the app, including completion rates, time to completion, number of clicks, number of screens, errors, incidents where participants were unable to perform tasks, which had previously been completed, and perceived task difficulty. Major and critical usability issues based on participant feedback were rooted from the limitation of screen size and resolution. Errors in data input (eg, typing errors, miscalculation), action failures, and misinterpretation of data (ie, radiography) were the most critical and common issues found in this study. A few participants did not complete the assigned tasks mostly owing to the navigation design and misreading/misunderstanding icons. However, the novice users were quite positive that they would be able to become familiar with the app in a short period of time. CONCLUSIONS: The usability issues in physician-to-physician teleconsultation systems in smartphones, in general, are derived from the limitations of smartphones and their operating systems. Although some recommendations were devised to handle these usability issues, usability evaluation for additional development should still be further investigated.","output":"Exploring Usability Issues of a Smartphone-Based Physician-to-Physician Teleconsultation App in an Orthopedic Clinic: Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The IMF is firmly fixed to the chest wall, but not physiologically, and it is difficult to determine the correct IMF position in the supine position and in the absence of an implant. METHODS With our new IMF reconstruction method (i.e., drawstring method), the IMF is recreated by drawing a barbed suture, penetrating the dermis, along the IMF. The barbed suture is fixed to the costal cartilage at the medial IMF, and the head is drawn and cut externally at the lateral IMF. The IMF level and depth can be finely adjusted by the tension, in a seated position after implant insertion. Furthermore, the approach can be from a small incision, and a smooth IMF curve is reconstructed. RESULTS Our drawstring method was performed in 102 patients who underwent reconstruction using a breast implant (n = 95) or flap (n = 7). The mean patient age was 52.0 years (range 33-77 years) and the follow-up period was 12 months (range 3-18 months). Suture or implant infection or exposure did not occur. Suture slack occurred in ten patients with implant-based reconstruction; their IMF became shallow. Insufficient skin expansion (P < 0.005) and strong traction of the barbed suture from the caudal side (P < 0.05) were related to IMF slack. The total revision rate was 2.9 %. CONCLUSIONS With sufficient skin expansion, the drawstring method using a barbed suture enables smooth and symmetrical IMF reconstruction.

In this study we estimate susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to those of adults. Understanding the age-structured transmission dynamics of the outbreak provides precious and timely information to guide epidemic modelling and public health policy. Data were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak, Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR. To estimate relative transmission parameters in the absence of data on who infected whom, we developed an estimation method based on a discrete stochastic dynamic model of the spread of the epidemic within a household. The model describes the propagation of the disease between household members allowing for susceptibility and infectivity parameters to vary among two age groups. The parameter estimates are obtained by a maximum likelihood method, where the likelihood function is computed based on the stochastic model via simulations. Inspection of the data reveals that children are less likely to become infected compared to adults (25% of children infected over all households, 44% of adults infected over all households, excluding index cases), and the chances of becoming infected increases with age. An interesting exception is that infants up to age one year are more likely to be infected than children between one and four. Using our modelling approach, we estimate that the susceptibility of children (under 20 years old) is 45% [40%, 55%] of the susceptibility of adults. The infectivity of children was estimated to be 85% [65%,110%] relative to that of adults. It is widely observed that the percentage of children within confirmed cases is low. A common explanation is that children who are infected are less likely to develop symptoms than adults, and thus are less likely to be tested. We estimate that children are less susceptible to infection, which is an additional factor explaining their relatively low rate of occurrence within confirmed cases. Moreover, our results indicate that children, when infected, are somewhat less prone to infect others compared to adults; however, this result is not statistically significant. The resulting estimates of susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to adults are crucial for deciding on appropriate interventions, and for controlling the epidemic outbreak and its progress. These estimates can guide age-dependent public health policy such as school closure and opening. However, while our estimates of children's susceptibility and infectivity are lower than those of adults within a household, it is important to bear in mind that their role in the spread of COVID-19 outside the household, is also affected by different contact patterns and hygiene habits.","output":"The role of children in the spread of COVID-19: Using household data from Bnei Brak, Israel, to estimate the relative susceptibility and infectivity of children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that mainly affects the upper and lower respiratory tract and is responsible for extremely different degrees of disease, ranging from flu-like symptoms to atypical pneumonia that may evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome and, ultimately, death.

EUS-GBD is efficient and safe, with a low rate of adverse events. A 2016 systematic review by Anderloni and others that evaluated stent outcomes showed pooled technical and clinical success rates in 98.6% and 94.4% of cases, respectively. Materials and methods: A 54-year-old man who had been admitted to a rehabilitation unit after prolonged ICU hospitalization for severe COVID-19 pneumonia, was referred to the surgical unit for AC and sepsis. Medical therapy could not improve his condition, and he rapidly worsened. Results: Due to his recent ICU admission, further intubation was strongly discouraged. Following multidisciplinary evaluation, he was moved to the endoscopy suite for drainage. EUS-GBD was achieved using a 10x15-mm electrocautery-enhanced lumen-apposing metal stent (Video 1). Up to now his follow-up is regular and after prolonged rehabilitation he can be considered for elective surgery. Conclusions: The patient didn't experience any symptom related to recurrent cholecystitis nor long term complications. EUS-GBD is a valuable option in order to reduce surgical interventions and intensive-care admissions. The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted further use of interventional endoscopic ultrasound as an alternative to surgery.","output":"Eus-guided Gallbladder Drainage: a Valuable Option in the Covid-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a havoc across the globe, and has significantly affected oncology services, especially radiation therapy due to the need of social distancing as a measure for the pandemic mitigation.

It requires a significant amount of resources and personnel, thereby increasing the risk of exposure to the virus. There has been a significant amount of papers published providing the best available alternatives to external radiation; however, there is a lack of literature on the practice of brachytherapy.

Such strategies, however, are frequently modified to fit local populations, settings, and contexts. While such modifications can be crucial to implementation success, the literature on documenting and evaluating them is virtually nonexistent. In this paper, we therefore describe the development of a new framework for documenting modifications to implementation strategies. DISCUSSION: We employed a multifaceted approach to developing the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications to Evidence-based Implementation Strategies (FRAME-IS), incorporating multiple stakeholder perspectives. Development steps included presentations of initial versions of the FRAME-IS to solicit structured feedback from individual implementation scientists (think-aloud exercises) and larger, international groups of researchers. The FRAME-IS includes core and supplementary modules to document modifications to implementation strategies: what is modified, the nature of the modification (including the relationship to core elements or functions), the primary goal and rationale for the modification, timing of the modification, participants in the modification decision-making process, and how widespread the modification is. We provide an example of application of the FRAME-IS to an implementation project and provide guidance on how it may be used in future work. CONCLUSION: Increasing attention is being given to modifications to evidence-based practices, but little work has investigated modifications to the implementation strategies used to implement such practices. To fill this gap, the FRAME-IS is meant to be a flexible, practical tool for documenting modifications to implementation strategies. Its use may help illuminate the pivotal processes and mechanisms by which implementation strategies exert their effects.

Herein, we examine the effects of Favipiravir (FPV) versus Lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV) for the treatment of COVID-19. Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who received oral FPV (Day 1: 1600 mg twice daily; Days 2-14: 600 mg twice daily) plus interferon (IFN)-&#945; by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the FPV arm of this study, whereas patients who were treated with LPV/RTV (Days 1-14: 400 mg/100 mg twice daily) plus IFN-&#945; by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the control arm. Changes in chest computed tomography (CT), viral clearance, and drug safety were compared between the two groups. For the 35 patients enrolled in the FPV arm and the 45 patients in the control arm, all baseline characteristics were comparable between the two arms. A shorter viral clearance time was found for the FPV arm versus the control arm (median (interquartile range, IQR), 4 (2.5-9) d versus 11 (8-13) d, P < 0.001). The FPV arm also showed significant improvement in chest imaging compared with the control arm, with an improvement rate of 91.43% versus 62.22% (P = 0.004). After adjustment for potential confounders, the FPV arm also showed a significantly higher improvement rate in chest imaging. Multivariable Cox regression showed that FPV was independently associated with faster viral clearance. In addition, fewer adverse reactions were found in the FPV arm than in the control arm. In this open-label nonrandomized control study, FPV showed significantly better treatment effects on COVID-19 in terms of disease progression and viral clearance; if causal, these results should be important information for establishing standard treatment guidelines to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Experimental Treatment with Favipiravir for COVID-19: An Open-Label Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic causes upheaval in New York City (NYC), 1 consequence is the accessibility of sexual health services.

Clinical variables, disease activity, damage, and mortality were compared. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using Cox proportional hazard adjusted for potential confounders for time to damage and mortality. RESULTS A total of 66 (5.6%) patients had familial lupus, and 1110 (94.4%) had sporadic lupus. Both groups were predominantly female, of comparable age, and of similar ethnic distribution. Discoid lupus (OR = 1.97; 95% CI 1.08-3.60) and neurologic disorder (OR = 1.65; 95% CI 1.00-2.73) were significantly associated with familial SLE; pericarditis was negatively associated (OR = 0.35; 95% CI 0.14-0.87). The SLE Disease Activity Index and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI) were similar in both groups, although the neuropsychiatric (45.4% vs. 33.5%; p = 0.04) and musculoskeletal (6.1% vs. 1.9%; p = 0.02) domains of the SDI were more frequent in familial lupus.

Abstract In March 2003 the healthcare system of Toronto had to respond to an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. This infectious disease due to a novel coronavirus spread rapidly because this infectious agent was highly contagious and contaminated many caregivers. The increase in the demand in critical care beds with concomitantly a decrease in the number of caregivers sick or in quarantine, deeply disorganized the emergency and critical care system. Lack of preparedness, absence of coordination and leadership, poor communication were identified as factors amplifying the impact of this outbreak. Rapidly, however a disaster plan was implemented allowing for better organizing the response of hospitals, allowing the control of the outbreak. During the second phase of the outbreak in April 2003, a coordinated network of hospital is designed to isolate the patients and provide best evidenced care with optimal protection of the caregivers. Several recommendations resulted from the retrospective analysis of these events. These were used to develop a transformation of the healthcare system in Ontario, with creation of local health integrated networks, reorganization of the acute care system with increased capacity, development of infectious disease control. In preparation of a new outbreak, provincial and local task forces have been implemented to provide recommendations in collaboration with the newly created Public Health Agency of Canada.","output":"Consquences de l'pidmie de SRAS sur le systme hospitalier de l'Ontario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In COVID-19, higher than expected level of intrapulmonary shunt has been described, in association with a discrepancy between the initial relatively preserved lung mechanics and the hypoxia severity. This study aim was to measure the shunt fraction and variations of PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio and oxygen alveolar-arterial gradient (A-a O(2)) at different FiO(2). METHODS: Shunt was measured by a non-invasive system during spontaneous breathing in 12 patients hospitalized at COVID-19 Semi-Intensive Care Unit of Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy, between October 22 and November 23, 2020. RESULTS: Nine patients were men, mean age (SD) 6215 years, mean BMI 27.54.8 Kg/m(2). Systemic hypertension, diabetes type 2 and previous myocardial infarction were referred in 33%, 17%, and 7%, respectively. Mean PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio was 23466 and 11 patients presented a bilateral chest X-ray involvement. Mean shunt was 216%. Mainly in patients with a more severe respiratory failure, we found a progressive decrease of PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio with higher FiO(2). Considering (A-a O(2)), we found a uniform tendency to increase with FiO(2) increasing. Even in this case, the more severe were the patients, the higher was the slope, suggesting FiO(2) insensitiveness due to a shunt effect, as strengthened by our measurements. CONCLUSION: Relying on a single evaluation of PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, especially at high FiO(2), could be misleading in COVID-19. We propose a two steps evaluation, the first at low SpO(2) value (e.g., 92-94%) and the second one at high FiO(2) (i.e., &gt;0.7), allowing to characterize both the amendable (ventilation/perfusion mismatch), and the fixed (shunt) contribution quote of respiratory impairment, respectively.","output":"Worsening of gas exchange parameters at high FiO(2) in COVID-19: misleading or informative?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on five stakeholders (the central government, local governments, hospitals, businesses and local communities), the Republic of Korea must shift from its current indecisive approach to a decisive approach to the COVID-19 outbreak.

We aimed to compare the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa with the risk of acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection through visiting routine vaccination service delivery points. METHODS: We considered a high-impact scenario and a low-impact scenario to approximate the child deaths that could be caused by immunisation coverage reductions during COVID-19 outbreaks. In the high-impact scenario, we used previously reported country-specific child mortality impact estimates of childhood immunisation for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, rotavirus, measles, meningitis A, rubella, and yellow fever to approximate the future deaths averted before 5 years of age by routine childhood vaccination during a 6-month COVID-19 risk period without catch-up campaigns. In the low-impact scenario, we approximated the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation on only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks during the COVID-19 risk period. We assumed that contact-reducing interventions flattened the outbreak curve during the COVID-19 risk period, that 60% of the population will have been infected by the end of that period, that children can be infected by either vaccinators or during transport, and that upon child infection the whole household will be infected. Country-specific household age structure estimates and age-dependent infection-fatality rates were applied to calculate the number of deaths attributable to the vaccination clinic visits. We present benefitCrisk ratios for routine childhood immunisation, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. FINDINGS: In the high-impact scenario, for every one excess COVID-19 death attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infections acquired during routine vaccination clinic visits, 84 (95% UI 14C267) deaths in children could be prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa. The benefitCrisk ratio for the vaccinated children is 85 000 (4900C546 000), for their siblings (<20 years) is 75 000 (4400C483 000), for their parents or adult carers (aged 20C60 years) is 769 (148C2700), and for older adults (>60 years) is 96 (14C307). In the low-impact scenario that approximates the health benefits to only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks, the benefitCrisk ratio to the households of vaccinated children is 3 (0C10); if the risk to only the vaccinated children is considered, the benefitCrisk ratio is 3000 (182C21 000). INTERPRETATION: The deaths prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa outweigh the excess risk of COVID-19 deaths associated with vaccination clinic visits, especially for the vaccinated children. Routine childhood immunisation should be sustained in Africa as much as possible, while considering other factors such as logistical constraints, staff shortages, and reallocation of resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, article 12(2) also provides that [t]his right may only be subject to restrictions, provided for by law for the protection of national security, law and order, public health or morality.

This raises the question of whether the right to return to ones country is reserved for citizens or nationals only. In answering this question, one of two arguments could be made. The first argument is that the right to return under article 12(2) is reserved for citizens only (the strict approach). The second argument is that it is applicable to both citizens and to a few categories of foreign nationals (the broader approach). The jurisprudence of the African Commission and the African Court shows that these bodies have adopted the strict approach. This could be attributed to the fact that the communications they have so far dealt with have been filed by citizens (de jure or de facto) or on behalf of citizens. However, these bodies are likely to adopt a broad approach should the facts of the case(s) so require. In the constitutions of most African countries, states have also taken a strict approach. This article explains why it is better to take a broader approach when dealing with article 12(2) of the African Charter. This argument is made by partly comparing and contrasting article 12(2) of the African Charter with other regional and international instruments that protect the right to return. The article also demonstrates how the right to enter or return to ones county has been approached in the constitutions of different African countries. ? 2021, Pretoria University Law Press.

Thus, this work aimed to study postpartum women's mental health in Argentina during mandatory social isolation. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May to July 2020, which included five validated questionnaires to assess postpartum depression (Postpartum Depression Screening Scale-Short Form), insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index), memory complaints (Memory Complaint Scale), metacognition (Brief Metamemory and Metaconcentration Scale), and breastfeeding self-efficacy (Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form). Sociodemographic variables, social isolation characteristics, and breastfeeding practices were also collected. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Statistical analysis included zero-order correlations, multiple logistic regressions, and a set of structural equation models (SEM) to test direct and indirect effects. Goodness-of-fit indices were calculated for SEM. SETTING: Postpartum women were recruited from public hospitals, private health clinics, and online community recruitment in the Cordoba province (Argentina). PARTICIPANTS: 305 postpartum women from Argentina. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: 37% of women reported postpartum depression, 46% insomnia, 42% memory impairment, 60% low metaconcentration, 50% low metamemory, and 23% low breastfeeding efficacy. Also, significant associations were found demonstrating that social isolation promoted postpartum depression and insomnia were reciprocally related, which compromised female cognition and efficacy. This situation was aggravated in women during late postpartum, with previous children, and by low social support (e.g., family, health professionals), with non-exclusive breastfeeding being increased. KEY CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study addressing postpartum women's mental status during social isolation in Argentina, which was a promoting factor for postpartum depression and insomnia that were reciprocally related. This situation was also aggravated by reproductive factors, such as late postpartum, multiparity, breastfeeding frequency, and non-exclusive breastfeeding. Additionally, breastfeeding self-efficacy depended on mental health status, and euthymia therefore favoured the practice of exclusive breastfeeding.","output":"Triggering of postpartum depression and insomnia with cognitive impairment in Argentinian women during the pandemic COVID-19 social isolation in relation to reproductive and health factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nature Play Therapy combines the therapeutic powers of play with the healing benefits of nature.

METHODS We tested 594 nasopharyngeal swab samples from individuals with COVID-19 (RT-PCR cycle threshold [Ct] values  40) or non-COVID-19 (Ct values > 40) diagnoses. RT-PCR positive samples were assigned to diagnostic, screening, or monitoring groups of testing. RESULTS With a limit of detection of 1.2  104 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/ml, Lumipulse showed positive percent agreement (PPA) of 79.9% (155/194) and negative percent agreement of 99.3% (397/400), whereas PPAs were 100% for samples with Ct values of <18 or 18-<25 and 92.5% for samples with Ct values of 25-<30. By three groups, Lumipulse showed PPA of 87.0% (60/69), 81.1% (43/53), or 72.2% (52/72), respectively, whereas PPA was 100% for samples with Ct values of <18 or 18-<25, and was 94.4, 80.0, or 100% for samples with Ct values of 25-<30, respectively. Additional testing of RT-PCR positive samples for SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA showed that, by three groups, PPA was 63.8% (44/69), 62.3% (33/53), or 33.3% (24/72), respectively. PPAs dropped to 55.6, 20.0, or 41.7% for samples with Ct values of 25-<30, respectively.

The results of the study found that there is a long-run relationship and there is a causality between these variables, indicating that renewable energy consumption, output, and export are related to CO(2) emissions. Specifically, from a long-term perspective, the results of co-integration and causality reveal that there is a two-way causal relationship between renewable energy consumption, output, export, and CO(2) emissions, supporting the feedback hypothesis; that is, output and export have an adverse impact on the environment, while renewable energy consumption has a favorable impact on the environment. In the short term, there is a direct or indirect one-way causal relationship between export, CO(2) emissions, and renewable energy consumption, which supports the growth hypothesis. The impulse response analysis has further verified the causality test results and supported this hypothesis. However, there is a strong negative correlation between industrial and agricultural export and renewable energy consumption, which will cause the use of renewable energy to fail to meet the peak demand for industrial and agricultural export in the short term. Conversely, large amounts of fossil fuels will be consumed to meet output and export demand. Therefore, on the road to social, economic, and environmental sustainability, it is necessary to consider the impact of economic growth and energy consumption (renewable and non-renewable energy) of related industries on CO(2) emissions, which also provides a strong basis for the development and reduction of Chinas renewable energy and the long-term implementation of the emission control policy.","output":"The relationship between renewable energy consumption, carbon emissions, output, and export in industrial and agricultural sectors: evidence from China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has widened many existing nutrition disparities. In response, federal nutrition assistance programs have introduced flexibility waivers in programs, including the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), to rapidly respond to support the nutritional health status of income-eligible participants during COVID-19. Waivers were approved that permitted flexibilities in the WIC food package, WIC vendor guidelines, and WIC clinic experience. The impact of these waivers on WIC participants' retail and clinic experiences remains unknown. OBJECTIVES Our aims were to understand the experiences of WIC participants in food retail settings and with WIC clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore WIC participants' perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on their family's overall health, well-being, and daily lives. DESIGN We conducted semi-structured phone interviews between April 30 and May 7, 2020. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING Participants were 24 adults in WIC-enrolled families residing in Tennessee. ANALYSIS Using grounded theory as the analytical framework, 2 coders completed an iterative, data-driven analytic process within NVivo, version 12. Hierarchical maps, coding matrices, and concept maps were used to aid direct content analysis for theme detection. RESULTS Five primary themes emerged, including shopping barriers (existing compounded with new), coping strategies, impact on mental and emotional health, social comparison, and unintended consequences of COVID-19 on WIC families. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 created additional barriers to food security among WIC families and negatively affected their health and well-being. To meet the needs of this vulnerable population during and beyond the pandemic, the carryover of WIC flexibilities (ie, physical presence and food package substitution waivers) after COVID-19 may improve the ease of overall program participation.","output":"A Qualitative Exploration of Predominantly White Non-Hispanic Tennessee WIC Participants' Food Retail and WIC Clinic Experiences During COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, several environmental factors have influenced activities and protection policy measures in cities.

The immune responses induced by the COVID 19 virus, during the incubation and non-severe stages, requires the early initiation of a specific adaptive immune response to eliminate the virus and prevent the progress to severe stages. In patients with a dysfunctional bridge adaptive immunity, the innate immune response becomes exaggerated due to the lack of feedback from the adaptive immune cells. The resultant cytokine storm is responsible for the severe lung injury leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome seen in COVID 19 patients.

As a result, an actual hospital was used to observe the transport of aerosol from a nursing station and general patient room to a nearby airborne infectious isolation room (AIIR). Aerosols 3.0m (viruses and most airborne bacteria) were found to be capable of migrating 14.5m from a general patient room to an AIIR anteroom entrance in <14minutes at concentrations 2-5 times greater than ambient (e.g. background). Concentrations of aerosols within the anteroom and isolation room, however, remained virtually unchanged from ambient levels, indicating the effectiveness of door position and (or) ventilation.

Rural poor communities rely greatly for their survival on agriculture and livestock keeping that are amongst the most climate-sensitive economic sectors.

Statistics showed that infected patients in China who received combined treatment of Traditional Chinese Medicine and modern medicine exhibited lower fatality rate and relatively better clinical outcomes. Both Lian-Hua-Qing-Wen Capsule (LHQWC) and Jin-Hua-Qing-Gan Granule (JHQGG) have been recommended by China Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of COVID-19 and have played a vital role in the prevention of a variety of viral infections. Here, we desired to analyze the broad-spectrum anti-viral capacities of LHQWC and JHQGG, and to compare their pharmacological functions for rational clinical applications. Based on literature mining, we found that both LHQWC and JHQGG were endowed with multiple antiviral activities by both targeting viral life cycle and regulating host immune responses and inflammation. In addition, from literature analyzed, JHQGG is more potent in modulating viral life cycle, whereas LHQWC exhibits better efficacies in regulating host anti-viral responses. When translating into clinical applications, oral administration of LHQWC could be more beneficial for patients with insufficient immune functions or for patients with alleviated symptoms after treatment with JHQGG.","output":"Broad Anti-Viral Capacities of Lian-Hua-Qing-Wen Capsule and Jin-Hua-Qing-Gan Granule and Rational use Against COVID-19 Based on Literature Mining"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital services have the potential to improve rural entrepreneurs' access to wider markets and increase their competitiveness among other benefits. Moreover, during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic in which movement and physical contacts have been limited, businesses relied much on digital services. However, many Namibian rural entrepreneurs have not been able to use digital services to maintain their livelihood. Therefore, this study investigated the factors affecting the adoption of ICT enabled services by rural entrepreneurs. The study applied a cross-sectional survey of 77 respondents comprising 14 rural entrepreneurs and 63 rural community members from four sites. It was found that the five main factors affecting the adoption of digital services by rural entrepreneurs are a lack of awareness of digital services, electricity, skills to navigate smart devices, high cost of both devices and mobile internet and cybercrime. We recommend a tailor-made training program for rural entrepreneurs which includes raising awareness of digital services and associated benefits, capacity building on digital skills and best practice for cybersecurity. In addition, we propose that the Namibian Government should enhance digital inclusion through a policy initiative to reduce the cost to make both data and smart devices affordable for the poor and rural communities.","output":"An Exploration of Factors Influencing the Adoption of ICT Enabled Entrepreneurship Applications in Namibian Rural Communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) techniques are used routinely by computational chemists in drug discovery and development to analyze datasets of compounds. Quantitative numerical methods like Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been used on QSAR to establish correlations between molecular properties and bioactivity. However, ANN may be advantageous over PLS because it considers the interrelations of the modeled variables. This study focused on the HIV-1 Protease (HIV-1 Pr) inhibitors belonging to the peptidomimetic class of compounds. The main objective was to select molecular descriptors with the best predictive value for antiviral potency (Ki). PLS and ANN were used to predict Ki activity of HIV-1 Pr inhibitors and the results were compared. To address the issue of dimensionality reduction, Genetic Algorithms (GA) were used for variable selection and their performance was compared against that of ANN. Finally, the structure of the optimum ANN achieving the highest Pearson's-R coefficient was determined. On the basis of Pearson's-R, PLS and ANN were compared to determine which exhibits maximum performance. Training and validation of models was performed on 15 random split sets of the master dataset consisted of 231 compounds. For each compound 192 molecular descriptors were considered. The molecular structure and constant of inhibition (Ki) were selected from the NIAID database. Study findings suggested that non-covalent interactions such as hydrophobicity, shape and hydrogen bonding describe well the antiviral activity of the HIV-1 Pr compounds.

Suboptimal T and B cell responses can delay viral clearance in MERS and SARS patients. The role of leukomonocytes in viral clearance of COVID-19 patients is not yet well defined.Methods: From January 26 to February 28, 2020, an observational study was launched at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. We enrolled 25 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, whose throat-swab specimens were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by qRT-PCR. We comprehensively analyzed clinical records, counts of lymphocyte subsets including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells in the patients who successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2, and compared to those that failed to, after a standardized treatment of 8-14 days. Findings: In 25 enrolled COVID-19 patients, lymphopeniawas a common feature. After the treatment, 14 patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. The patients that cleared the infection had restored the numbers of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cellsand B cells as compared to the still viral RNA positive patients, while the recovered patients had a higher count of leukomonocytes. Conclusions: By comparison of leukomonocytes counts in COVID-19 patients at different stages of the disease, we found that CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells and B cells appear to play important roles in viral clearance. The restoration of leukomonocytes counts from peripheral blood can be used as prognosis for the recovery of an COVID-19 infection.

Although there is a significant variation in codon usage bias among different SARSCoV genes, codon usage bias in SARSCoV is a little slight, which is mainly determined by the base compositions on the third codon position. By comparing synonymous codon usage patterns in different viruses, we observed that synonymous codon usage pattern in these virus genes was virus specific and phylogenetically conserved, but it was not host specific. Phylogenetic analysis based on codon usage pattern suggested that SARSCoV was diverged far from all three known groups of Coronavirus. Compositional constraints could explain most of the variation of synonymous codon usage among these virus genes, while gene function is also correlated to synonymous codon usages to a certain extent. However, translational selection and gene length have no effect on the variations of synonymous codon usage in these virus genes.","output":"Analysis of synonymous codon usage in SARS Coronavirus and other viruses in the Nidovirales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic indicated high levels of IL-6 in patients with severe COVID-19. This led to the off-label use of tocilizumab (TCZ) during the first wave of the pandemic.We aimed to monitor IL-6 and several inflammatory cytokines in critically ill COVID-19 patients receiving off-label TCZ. Fifteen critically ill SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed cases were enrolled and serum samples were collected during 8 days, before and following administration of a single dose of TCZ. In parallel, a control group consisting of 8 non-treated COVID-19 patients not receiving TCZ was established. Serum profile of 12 cytokines (IL-1, -2, -4, -6, -8, -10, -12, -13, -17, -18, TNF- and INF-) and of IL-6R were assessed in these two groups. Although the increased IL-6 concentrations after TCZ infusion were expected, we observed an unexpected increase in IL-1, -2, -4, -10, -12p70, -18 and IL-6R levels in the treated patients with maximal values reached 2 to 4 days after TCZ. In contrast, no change in cytokine levels was observed in the control group. There was no significant difference in cytokine levels between survivors (TCZ/S) or non-survivors (TCZ/D). This observation suggests that some inflammatory pathways escape IL-6R blockade leading to an increase in several pro-inflammatory cytokines.

We provide state of the art information about the risks of SARSCoV- 2 infection for patients on clozapine and we give advice on measures to be taken, especially in regard to the monitoring of clozapine plasma levels, WBC count and differentiation during COVID-19 and after vaccination. We present an overview of relevant editorials, observational studies, and case studies, in which COVID-19 was reported in patients on clozapine. Patients using clozapine may have a higher risk of infection than patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) using other antipsychotics. SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in a dangerous increase of clozapine plasma levels, and granulocytopenia and lymphocytopenia (generally mild and short-term) may also occur, usually not as a result of clozapine treatment. Clozapine intoxication, pneumonia and delirium are the main complications of COVID-19 in patients on clozapine. In order to prevent clozapine intoxication, reduction of the original dose by half is generally recommended in clozapine users who contract COVID-19. When a cytokine storm is suspected in an advanced stage of COVID-19, reduction by three quarters seems more appropriate. If COVID-19 patients on clozapine develop granulocytopenia, SARS-CoV-2, rather than clozapine, should be considered as the cause. Schizophrenia patients in general and clozapine users in particular belong to a high-risk group that warrants early vaccination on a medical indication.

CASE AND OUTCOMES: A 48-year-old man with no previous history of lung disease was admitted to the emergency room with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure due to SARS-COV2. The patient did not improve saturation with the use of the reservoir mask. Oxygenation was started using an adapted snorkel mask with a PEEP valve with an alveolar recruitment function and double oxygen flow. The patient presented clinical and radiological improvement after 2 days of use and was discharged 16 days later. DISCUSSION: The use of a snorkel mask is an important, viable, and simpler NIV modality for the management of patients with COVID-19 with respiratory failure who fail to use a reservoir mask, and it can be an alternative before the use of a mechanical ventilator.

This study aims to assess the prevalence and impact of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. Method: We conducted a consecutive cohort study of COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches following a major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020. Hematuria, proteinuria, serum creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters were extracted from the electronic hospitalization databases and laboratory databases. Incidence rate for acute kidney injury (AKI) was examined during the study period. Association between kidney impairment and in-hospital death was analyzed. Results: We included 710 consecutive COVID19 patients, 89 (12.3%) of whom died in hospital. The median age of the patients was 63 years (inter quartile range, 51-71), including 374 men and 336 women. On admission, 44% of patients have proteinuria hematuria and 26.9% have hematuria, and the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 15.5% and 14.1% respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 3.2% patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney impairment have higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated serum creatinine, elevated urea nitrogen, AKI, proteinuria and hematuria was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, leukocyte count and lymphocyte count. Conclusion: The prevalence of kidney impairment (hematuria, proteinuria and kidney dysfunction) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was high.

Those with severe disease are treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) but with poor outcomes. Concomitant right ventricular assist device (RVAD) may be beneficial. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of intensive care unit patients admitted with COVID-19 ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) was performed. Nonintubated patients, those with acute kidney injury, and age > 75 were excluded. Patients who underwent RVAD/ECMO support were compared with those managed via invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) alone. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-d mortality, acute kidney injury, length of ICU stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 145 patients were admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. Thirty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 21 received IMV, and 18 received RVAD/ECMO. In-hospital (52.4 versus 11.1%, P = 0.008) and 30-d mortality (42.9 versus 5.6%, P= 0.011) were significantly lower in patients treated with RVAD/ECMO. Acute kidney injury occurred in 15 (71.4%) patients in the IMV group and zero RVAD/ECMO patients (P< 0.001). ICU (11.5 versus 21 d, P= 0.067) and hospital (14 versus 25.5 d, P = 0.054) length of stay were not significantly different. There were no RVAD/ECMO device complications. The duration of mechanical ventilation was not significantly different (10 versus 5 d, P = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS: RVAD support at the time of ECMO initiation resulted in the no secondary end-organ damage and higher in-hospital and 30-d survival versus IMV in specially selected patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS.

Among the far-reaching implications of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial improvement in air quality was observed worldwide after the lockdowns imposed by many countries. We aimed to assess the implications of different lockdown measures on air pollution levels in Europe and China, as well as the short-term and long-term health impact. METHODS: For this modelling study, observations of fine particulate matter (PM25) concentrations from more than 2500 stations in Europe and China during 2016-20 were integrated with chemical transport model simulations to reconstruct PM25 fields at high spatiotemporal resolution. The health benefits, expressed as short-term and long-term avoided mortality from PM25 exposure associated with the interventions imposed to control the COVID-19 pandemic, were quantified on the basis of the latest epidemiological studies. To explore the long-term variability in air quality and associated premature mortality, we built different scenarios of economic recovery (immediate or gradual resumption of activities, a second outbreak in autumn, and permanent lockdown for the whole of 2020). FINDINGS: The lockdown interventions led to a reduction in population-weighted PM25 of 145 g m-3 across China (-297%) and 22 g m-3 across Europe (-171%), with unprecedented reductions of 40 g m-3 in bimonthly mean PM25 in the areas most affected by COVID-19 in China. In the short term, an estimated 24a??200 (95% CI 22a??380-26a??010) premature deaths were averted throughout China between Feb 1 and March 31, and an estimated 2190 (1960-2420) deaths were averted in Europe between Feb 21 and May 17. We also estimated a positive number of long-term avoided premature fatalities due to reduced PM25 concentrations, ranging from 76a??400 (95% CI 62a??600-86a??900) to 287a??000 (233a??700-328a??300) for China, and from 13a??600 (11a??900-15a??300) to 29a??500 (25a??800-33a??300) for Europe, depending on the future scenarios of economic recovery adopted. INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that lockdown interventions led to substantial reductions in PM25 concentrations in China and Europe. We estimated that tens of thousands of premature deaths from air pollution were avoided, although with significant differences observed in Europe and China. Our findings suggest that considerable improvements in air quality are achievable in both China and Europe when stringent emission control policies are adopted.

The results showed that, during the COVID-19 outbreak, 55.8% of the children asked to sleep in their parents bed and 45% expressed fears they did not have before. Most of the children showed increased irritability, constant mood swings and nervousness about limits and messages, and 41.4% showed sleep difficulties. Concerning adaptive behaviors, more than 50% of the parents reported that their child became wiser, lazier, and was able to adapt the limits and restriction of the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, the children tended to increase their use of screens, used to sleep more time, and were less active physically. The results suggest that children are vulnerable to the COVID-19 outbreak psychological effects and highlight the need to reduce the psychological burden of this pandemic and the necessity of immediate intervention.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Behavioral and Emotional Aspects and Daily Routines of Arab Israeli Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION hand injuries are a common emergency mainly caused by domestic accidents or sport injuries. During the COVID-19 pandemic confinement period, with a cut off in transportation as well as in occupational and physical activities, we observed a decrease in medical and elective surgical activities but emergency cases of upper limb and hand surgery increased. MATERIALS AND METHODS we conducted a retrospective epidemiological study to analyze two periods between the same dates in 2019 and 2020, for all the duration of the confinement period. We compared the numbers of consultations in the emergency department, elective surgeries, hand and upper limb emergency cases in our center and urgent limb surgeries in the nearby hospital. Then we compared the mechanisms and severity of injuries and the type of surgery. RESULTS between 2019 and 2020 there was a decrease of consultations in the emergency department in our institution of 52%, a decrease of total elective surgeries of 75%, a decrease in surgeries for urgent peripheral limb injuries of 50%, whereas the hand and upper limb emergency remained stable or even increased by 4% regard to occupational and domestic accidents. There was a significant difference in the mechanism of injury with an increase of domestic accident and a decrease of occupational, road traffic and sport accidents. Severity of the injuries increased, with augmentation of the number of tissues involved and longer expected time of recovery. CONCLUSION during the confinement period of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an important reduction of medical activities, the amount and severity of hand emergency cases increased. A specific plan regarding duty shift organization for hand trauma should be maintained regardless of the sanitary situation.","output":"Epidemiology of hand traumas during the COVID-19 confinement period."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Crossbred, spring-calving cows (yr 1, n = 136; yr 2, n = 113; yr 3, n = 113) were used in a 3-yr experiment to evaluate the influence of supplemental protein prepartum and grazing subirrigated meadow postpartum on pregnancy rates and calf feedlot performance. A 2  2 factorial arrangement of treatments was used in a switchback design. From December 1 to February 28, cows grazed dormant upland range in 8 pastures (32  2 ha each). The equivalent of 0.45 kg of supplement/cow per d (42% CP) was provided to half of the cows on a pasture basis 3 d/wk. For 30 d before the beginning of breeding (May 1 to May 31), half of the cows grazed a common subirrigated meadow (58 ha), and the remainder was fed grass hay in a drylot. Cow BW and BCS were monitored throughout the year, and steer calf performance was determined until slaughter. Feeding supplement prepartum improved (P = 0.01 to P < 0.001) BCS precalving (5.1 vs. 4.7) and prebreeding (5.1 vs. 4.9) and increased (P = 0.02) the percentage of live calves at weaning (98.5 vs. 93.6%) but did not affect (P = 0.46) pregnancy rate (93 vs. 90%).

However, it has been reported that the relationship between OM-85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections is variable. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate this relationship. METHODS: A systematic literature search up-to May 2020 was performed and 14 studies were detected with 1859 paediatric subjects, of them 890 consumed OM-85. They were reporting relationships between OM-85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections. Odds ratio (OR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated to evaluate the prognostic role of OM-85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections using the dichotomous or continuous method with a random or fixed-effect model. RESULTS: OM-85 consumption was significantly related to lower frequency of respiratory tract infections (MD, -1.16; 95% CI, -1.66 to -0.65, P < .001); lower total duration of respiratory tract infections (MD, -19.51; 95% CI, -23.00 to -16.01, P < .001); lower incidence of respiratory tract infections (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21-0.77, P = .006); lower number of antibiotic courses (MD, -1.40; 95% CI, -2.63 to 0.17, P = .03); and lower antibiotic use (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.29-0.52, P < .001). However, OM-85 consumption was not significantly related to adverse event rate (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.52-2.03, P = .94); or to wheezing attacks frequency (MD, -0.25; 95% CI, -0.59 to 0.08, P = .14). CONCLUSIONS: The impact of OM-85 consumption on recurrent respiratory tract infections may have a great effect as a tool to improve subjects' immunity against recurrent respiratory tract infections, which could be helpful in crucial situations, eg, COVID-19 pandemic.

To date, reducing and tracking human movement during the pandemic have proven effective in limiting the spread of COVID-19. Existing methods for monitoring and modeling the spatial spread of infectious diseases rely on various data sources as proxies of human movement, such as airline travel data, mobile phone data, and dollar bills tracking. However, intrinsic limitations of these data sources prevent us from systematic monitoring and analyses of human movement from different spatial scales (from local to global). OBJECTIVE: Big social media data such as geotagged tweets have been widely used in human mobility studies, yet more research is needed to validate the capabilities and limitations of using such data for studying human movement at different geographic scales (e.g., from local to global) in the context of global infectious disease transmission. This study aims to develop a novel data-driven public health approach using big Twitter data coupled with other human mobility data sources and AI to monitor and analyze human movement at different spatial scales (from global to regional to local) for enhancing situational awareness and risk prediction in public health emergency response and disease surveillance systems. METHODS: This research will first develop a database with optimized spatiotemporal indexing to store and manage the multi-source datasets collected in this project. This database will be connected to our in-house Hadoop computing cluster for efficient big data computing and analytics. This research will then develop innovative data models, predictive models, and computing algorithms, to effectively extract and analyze human movement patterns from big geotagged Twitter data and other human mobility data sources for enhancing situational awareness and risk prediction in public health emergency response and disease surveillance systems. RESULTS: This project was funded as of May 2020. We have started the data collection, processing, and analysis for the project. CONCLUSIONS: Research findings can help government officials, public health managers and emergency responders, and researchers to answer critical questions during the pandemic regarding the current and future infectious risk of a state, county, or community and the effectiveness of the social/physical distancing practice in curtaining the spread of the virus.

The suspension of in-person dance classes during the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a transition to remote provision via live and recorded digital media. An online survey explored accessibility of and engagement with home-based dance programs, as well as potential benefits and processes involved in participation. The survey was co-developed by researchers and dance program providers, with input from people with PD and physiotherapists. Responses were collected from 276 individuals, including 178 current users of home-based programs, the majority of whom were participating at least once per week. Among respondents not currently using digital resources, lack of knowledge and motivation were the primary barriers. Most participants (94.9%) reported that home based practise provided some benefits, including physical (e.g., balance, posture) and non-physical (e.g., mood, confidence) improvements. Participants valued the convenience and flexibility of digital participation, but noted limitations including reductions in social interaction, support from instructors and peers, and motivation. There was a strong preference (70.8%) for continuing with home-based practise alongside in-person classes in the future. The results indicate that at-home dance is accessible and usable for people with PD, and that some of the previously-reported benefits of dance may be replicated in this context.

Here, we use molecular dynamic simulations to probe the factors that modulate the stability of this fibril model. Our simulations suggest that fibril formation starts with the stacking of two misfolded monomers into metastable dimers, with the stacking depending on the N-terminal amyloidogenic regions of different chains forming anchors. The resulting dimers pack in a second step into a 2-fold two-layer tetramer that is stable enough to nucleate fibril formation. The stability of the initial dimers is enhanced under acidic conditions by a strong salt bridge and side-chain hydrogen bond network in the C-terminal cavity (residues 23-51) but is not affected by the presence of the disordered C-terminal tail.","output":"Stability of Human Serum Amyloid A Fibrils"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, produced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly throughout the world. Latin American and the Caribbean countries have been harshly affected by the pandemic mainly due to less prepared healthcare systems and fragmented social safety nets. In the region, health status population-based indicators are worse than compared to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Recent evidence suggests that the progression and severity of COVID-19 are associated with the prior health status of individuals, and studies have shown that the case fatality rate is highly stratified among different populations. This narrative review aims to describe factors associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19 in the context of social determinants of health in Latin American and Caribbean countries. In this review, we state that genetic and biological factors interact in a sophisticated way with social determinants of health, impacting the rapid spread of COVID-19 in Latin American and Caribbean countries. Behavioral factors, such as physical inactivity, smoking, and unhealthy diets, are related to chronic systemic inflammation. Also, air pollution can prolong inflammation and the hyper-activation of the immune system. Air pollutants could facilitate the spread of the virus. Finally, frailty and comorbidities can be associated with COVID-19 severity through increasing vulnerability to stressors and leading to more severe symptoms of COVID-19 disease, including a higher mortality risk. All these factors contribute to increasing the impact of COVID-19 in Latin American and Caribbean countries. We highlight the relevance of considering social determinants of health in Latin American and the Caribbean countries, not only in controlling the likelihood of getting the disease but also its progression and severity. All these social determinants can guide the design and implementation of tailored interventions promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors, which should lower the spread of the disease, its severity, and lethality.","output":"Pre-existing conditions in Latin America and factors associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19: A review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected profoundly all parties and health-care delivery.

Family members are distressed and traumatized because they are unable to support or advocate for their loved ones and feel disconnected from the health-care team. Health-care professionals (HCPs) experience psychological and moral distress because the absence of families negatively affects their ability to provide quality, compassionate, and timely care. As a result, there have been calls for revisions of policies and procedures to reprioritize patient- and family-centered care (PFCC). Building upon their experience as frontline HCPs, health-care team leaders, and patients and family members who are also frontline HCPs, the interprofessional team (psychologists, psychiatrists, hospitalists, nurses, and specialists) of co-authors reviewed the literature and developed collegial consensus on a roadmap for PFCC during the pandemic that includes guiding principles along with associated best practices and implementation strategies for their operationalization. The guiding principles focus on providing safe yet compassionate and ethical PFCC;balancing community health and the mitigation of viral transmission with appreciating family members as essential partners in care;fostering communication between patients and their families;and promoting interactions and decision-making among HCPs, patients, and families.

Results indicated that the current mechanism for emergency responses to emerging communicable diseases in China has made great achievements in terms of command and decision-making, organization and collaboration, monitoring and early warning systems, protection, and international communication and cooperation. This mechanism for responding to emerging communicable diseases allowed China to successfully deal with outbreaks of the H5N1 bird flu, H1N1 flu, and H7N9 bird flu. However, a better coordination system, a more complete Office of Responses to Public Health Emergencies, administrative responsibility and error correction, better personnel training, and government responsibility may help to improve the response to emerging communicable diseases. Such improvements are eagerly anticipated.","output":"From SARS to H7N9: the mechanism of responding to emerging communicable diseases has made great progress in China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), also known as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome, is a new dangerous childhood disease that is temporally associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to describe the typical presentation and outcomes of children diagnosed with this hyperinflammatory condition. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to communicate the clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, imaging results, and outcomes of individuals with MIS-C. We searched four medical databases to encompass studies characterizing MIS-C from January 1st, 2020 to July 25th, 2020. Two independent authors screened articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. This review was registered with PROSPERO CRD42020191515. FINDINGS: Our search yielded 39 observational studies (n = 662 patients). While 710% of children (n = 470) were admitted to the intensive care unit, only 11 deaths (17%) were reported. Average length of hospital stay was 79  06 days. Fever (100%, n = 662), abdominal pain or diarrhea (737%, n = 488), and vomiting (683%, n = 452) were the most common clinical presentation. Serum inflammatory, coagulative, and cardiac markers were considerably abnormal. Mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were necessary in 222% (n = 147) and 44% (n = 29) of patients, respectively. An abnormal echocardiograph was observed in 314 of 581 individuals (540%) with depressed ejection fraction (451%, n = 262 of 581) comprising the most common aberrancy. INTERPRETATION: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome is a new pediatric disease associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is dangerous and potentially lethal. With prompt recognition and medical attention, most children will survive but the long-term outcomes from this condition are presently unknown. FUNDING: Parker B.

RESULTS: Our cohort included 1115 participants (630 NID, 98% MS; 485 reference) as of 30 April 2020. 202 (18%) participants, residing in areas with high COVID-19 case prevalence, met the April 2020 CDC symptom criteria for suspected COVID-19, but only 4% of all participants received testing given testing shortages. Among all participants, those with suspected COVID-19 were younger, more racially diverse, and reported more depression and liver disease. PwNID had the same rate of suspected COVID-19 as the reference group. Early changes in disease management included telemedicine visits in 21% and treatment changes in 9% of PwNID. After adjusting for potential confounders, increasing neurological disability was associated with a greater likelihood of suspected COVID-19 (ORadj = 1.45, 1.17-1.84).

Most data on adherence to these behaviours is collected via self-reporting, which can differ from observed behaviours. We quantified this discrepancy among a university sample and tested the impact of simple intervention on observed behaviour. Study design Cross-sectional questionnaire of behaviour on campus compared to direct observation on one day without, and one day with, additional signage. Methods We circulated an email inviting all staff and students at our university to complete a questionnaire asking how often they wear a mark or practice hand hygiene when entering campus buildings, and how often they practiced social distancing within campus buildings. We observed all entrants to the main building on one campus on a baseline day and on a day after installing a large sign reminding people that these behaviours were mandatory. Results In our survey, 172 out of 252 respondents (68%) reported always cleaning their hands, 225 out of 251 (90%) reported always wearing a face covering, and 124 out of 252 (49%) reported always maintaining social distancing. On the baseline day of observation, 50 out of 311 people (16.1%) cleaned their hands and 256 (82.3%) wore a face covering correctly. Out of 119 people whom we could assess, 9 (7%) maintained social distance from others. The signage was associated with significant improvements for cleaning hands (104 / 375 people: 27.7%), wearing a face covering (374 / 375; 99.8%) and maintaining social distance (79 / 144; 54.8%).

We hypothesized that fewer patients administered this combination would require oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or a combination of both than those who did not. METHODS: This was a cohort observational study of all consecutive hospitalized patients &#8805;50 y of age with COVID-19 in a tertiary academic hospital. Before April 6, 2020, no patients received the (DMB) combination. After this date, patients were administered 1000 IU/d oral vitamin D3, 150 mg/d oral magnesium, and 500 mcg/d oral vitamin B12 upon admission if they did not require oxygen therapy. Primary outcome was deterioration leading to any form of oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or both. RESULTS: Between January 15 and April 15, 2020, we identified 43 consecutive patients &#8805;50 y of age with COVID-19. Seventeen patients received DMB before onset of primary outcome and 26 patients did not. Baseline demographic characteristics between the two groups were significantly different by age. In univariate analysis, age and hypertension had a significant influence on outcome. After adjusting for age or hypertension separately in a multivariate analysis, the intervention group retained protective significance. Fewer treated patients than controls required initiation of oxygen therapy during hospitalization (17.6 vs 61.5%, P = 0.006). DMB exposure was associated with odds ratios of 0.13 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.59) and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.04-0.93) for oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or both on univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A vitamin D / magnesium / vitamin B12 combination in older COVID-19 patients was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of patients with clinical deterioration requiring oxygen support, intensive care support, or both. This study supports further larger randomized controlled trials to ascertain the full benefit of this combination in ameliorating the severity of COVID-19.","output":"Cohort study to evaluate the effect of vitamin D, magnesium, and vitamin B12 in combination on progression to severe outcomes in older patients with coronavirus (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Yeasts, commonly present on the surface of fruits, are of industrial interest for the production of enzymes, flavorings, and bioactive compounds, and have many other scientific uses.

Among them, nearly half of cardiovascular disease patients suffer from severe hypertension complications. Hypertension is thought to cause abnormal platelet activation and increases the risk of thrombosis, but the related mechanism is still vague. OBJECTIVES This study hypothesized that the abnormal hemodynamics of blood under hypertension might affect platelet function and accelerate thrombosis by activating mechanoreceptor Piezo1. METHODS To assess the activation effect of hypertension on mechanoreceptor Piezo1, we injected Piezo1 agonist Yoda1 and antagonist GsMTx-4 through the tail vein, then examined the platelet activation status and thrombosis. RESULTS Our results displayed that antagonist GsMTx-4 effectively inhibited calcium influx caused by hypertension and agonist Yoda1. Anti-thrombotic studies proved that the inhibition of Piezo1 effectively inhibited arterial thrombosis and reduced the infarct size of stroke in hypertensive mice.

These data were analyzed and compared along with daily routines and demographic variables of age, education and income. Our working hypothesis was that enforced quarantine would have a significant impact on daily activities, including waking time, mealtimes, physical activity, and eating habits. Waking time went from 5-6 to 8-9 in the morning and the breakfast and lunch times changed. The physical activity of the entire population decreased while men proved to be more active than women before and during the health emergency. Our findings suggested that eating habits improved overall during the quarantine period; however, we found that a higher percentage of women reported very healthy eating habits compared to men.

The pandemic has required pain clinics to transition in-person visits to telemedicine, postpone procedures and cancel face-to-face educational sessions. There are no data on how fellowship programs have adapted. METHODS: A 17-question survey was developed covering topics including changes in education, clinical care, and psychological stress due to the COVID pandemic. The survey was hosted by Qualtrics Inc. and disseminated by the Association of Pain Program Directors on April 10, 2020 to program directors at ACGME-accredited fellowships. Results are reported descriptively and stratified by COVID infection rate, which was calculated from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data on state infections, and census data. RESULTS: Among 107 surveys distributed, 70 (65%) programs responded. Twenty-nine programs were located in states in the upper tertile for per capita infection rates, 17 in the middle third, and 23 in the lowest tertile. Nearly all programs (93%) reported a decreased workload, with 11 (16%) reporting a dramatic decrease (only urgent or emergent cases). Just over half of programs had either already deployed (14%) or credentialed (39%) fellows to provide non-pain care. Higher state infection rates were significantly associated with reduced clinical demand (Rs = 0.31, 95% CI [0.08, 0.51], P = .011) and redeployment of fellows to non-pain areas (Rs = 0.30, 95% CI [0.07, 0.50], P = .013). Larger program size but not infection rate was associated with increased perceived anxiety level of trainees. CONCLUSIONS: We found a shift to online alternatives for clinical care and education, with correlations between per capita infection rates, and clinical care demands and redeployment, but not with overall trainee anxiety levels.

DESIGN Group concept mapping, a mixed-methods participatory research method, was used to seek the perspectives of key stakeholders: adults with hearing impairment (n = 39), significant others (n = 28), and hearing care professionals (n = 56). All participants completed a short online survey before completing one or more of the following activities: brainstorming, sorting, and rating. Brainstorming required participants to generate ideas in response to the focus prompt, \\"One way I would like to use information and communication technologies to address the hearing and communication needs of adults with hearing loss and their family and friends is to.\\" The sorting task required participants to sort all statements into groups that made sense to them. Finally, the rating task required participants to rate each of the statements according to \\"How helpful would this idea be to you?\\" using a 5-point Likert scale. Hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to the \\"sorting\\" data to develop a cluster map using the Concept Systems software. The \\"rating\\" data were subsequently analyzed at a cluster level and an individual-item level using descriptive statistics. Differences in cluster ratings between stakeholder groups were examined using Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS Overall, 123 statements were generated by participants in response to the focus prompt and were included in subsequent analyses. Based on the \\"sorting\\" data and hierarchical cluster analysis, a seven-cluster map was deemed to be the best representation of the data. Three key themes emerged from the data, including using eHealth to (1) Educate and Involve Others; (2) Support Aural Rehabilitation; and (3) Educate About and Demonstrate the Impacts of Hearing Impairment and Benefits of Hearing Rehabilitation. Overall median rating scores for each cluster ranged from 3.97 (educate and involve significant others) to 3.44 (empower adults with hearing impairment to manage their hearing impairment from home). CONCLUSIONS These research findings demonstrate the broad range of clinical applications of eHealth that have the capacity to support the implementation of patient- and family-centered hearing care, with self-directed educational tools and resources typically being rated as most helpful. Therefore, eHealth appears to be a viable option for enabling a more biopsychosocial approach to hearing healthcare and educating and involving significant others in the hearing rehabilitation process without adding more pressure on clinical time. More research is needed to inform the subsequent development of eHealth interventions, and it is recommended that health behavior change theory be adhered to for such interventions.","output":"How Can eHealth Meet the Hearing and Communication Needs of Adults With Hearing Impairment and their Significant Others?

However, the incidence and impact of possible/probable COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) in severe COVID-19 patients varies between cohorts. We aimed to assess the incidence, risk factors, and clinical outcome of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in a regional cohort of COVID-19 intensive care patients. Methods: We performed a regional, multicentre, retrospective cohort study in the intensive care units (ICUs) in North Brabant, The Netherlands. We included adult patients with rt-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), requiring mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Demographics, clinical course, biomarker value, and treatment outcomes were compared between the groups with possible/probable CAPA from the main study centre and the regional centres, and without signs of CAPA from the main study centre as controls. The primary aim was to assess the regional impact of possible/probable CAPA in COVID-19 ICU patients, measured as all-cause mortality at 30 days after ICU admission. Secondary outcomes were risk factors for developing CAPA, based on underlying host factors and to identify the value of the mycological arguments for the diagnosing of CAPA. Results: Between 1 March and 30 April 2020, we included 123 patients with severe COVID-19: 29 patients (30.9%) in the main ICU with possible/probable CAPA, and 65 (69.1%) with no signs of CAPA; 29 patients in the regional ICUs with signs of CAPA. Patients characteristics and risk factors did not differ for CAPA and non-CAPA patients. Patients with COPD and/or chronic steroid medication developed CAPA more frequently, although this was not statistically significant. CAPA patients were admitted to the ICU earlier, had lower PF-ratios, and more often required renal replacement therapy. All-cause 30-day mortality was significantly higher in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with possible/probable CAPA 39.7% (23/58) compared to patients without evidence for CAPA 16.9% (11/65) (OR 3.2 [95% CI 1.4C7.4] p = 0.005). Conclusion: The high incidence of possible and probable CAPA in critically ill COVID-19 patients is alarming.

A national sample of 10,545 adults in all 31 provinces in mainland China provided data on sociodemographic characteristics, awareness, attitudes towards COVID-19, lifestyle factors, and health outcomes during the quarantine. Regression models tested associations among study variables adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Among the 9,016 total participants (42.6% men and 57.4% women), 585 reported having diagnosed diabetes and 8,431 had no diabetes. Participants with diabetes perceived themselves to be at higher risk and were more worried about being infected with COVID-19 when compared to non-diabetic individuals (p < 0.001). During the COVID-19 pandemic, participants with diabetes were more likely to experience food and drug shortages and to increase their physical activity, compared to their counterparts. Among diabetic respondents, a high proportion of current smokers (74.1%) and drinkers (68.5%) reported increased amounts of smoking and drinking.

Sanitization and reuse of masks can alleviate high mask consumption and production stresses. In the present work, improved sanitization potency of vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP) treatment of resilient bacterial spores while retaining polymeric filter performance was explored. A batch fumigation chamber with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) vapor and ozone (O(3)) is featured, followed by intense pulsed light (IPL) flash treatments. A resilient bacterial indicator, Geobacillus stearothermophilus (G. stearothermophilus), was utilized to compare the efficacy of various H(2)O(2) concentrations in combination with O(3) and IPL. It was found that exposure to 30 minutes of 4.01 L min(?1) 0.03% H(2)O(2) aqueous vapor and 3 g h(?1) O(3) followed by 10 IPL flashes per side completely inactivated G. stearothermophilus. The xenon sourced IPL irradiation was found to synergistically enhance radical production and strengthen the complementary biocidal interaction of H(2)O(2) with O(3). Due to the synergistic effects, H(2)O(2) was able to sanitize at a diluted concentration of 0.03% H(2)O(2). The physical properties, such as surface potential, tensile strength, hydrophobicity, and filtration efficiency of >300 nm saline water aerosol of fibrous polypropylene (PP) sheets, were maintained. In addition, no residue of sanitizers was detected, thus confirming the biosafety and applicability of this method to disposable masks. Performance was benchmarked and compared with commercially available processes.

The review followed a two-step process, including an extensive search for existing literature and a screening of each identified study for the relevance and quality of evidence. RESULTS This review found a growing body of rigorous studies to guide healthcare design, especially with respect to reducing the frequency of hospital-acquired infections. Results are organized according to three general types of outcomes: patient safety, other patient outcomes, and staff outcomes. The findings further support the importance of improving outcomes for a range of design characteristics or interventions, including single-bed rooms rather than multibed rooms, effective ventilation systems, a good acoustic environment, nature distractions and daylight, appropriate lighting, better ergonomic design, acuity-adaptable rooms, and improved floor layouts and work settings.

The incidence of COVID-19 among children under 18 years was 2.1% based on the reported studies, where the mortality rate in the same age group was 0.2%. No death has been reported in children under 9-years old. There are some articles that report children with COVID-19 having symptoms similar to Kawasakis disease. In these cases, heart complications were observed. The best markers for diagnosing the severity of the disease in children are the levels of bilirubin and hepatic enzymes. Large number of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on cell surfaces, effective innate immune system, and high level of blood lymphocyte have been reported to be the potent reasons for lower incidence of severe symptoms of COVID-19 among children. Children can very well be the carriers of this virus. Children with severe COVID-19 clinical symptoms, especially those suffering from pneumonia, must be hospitalized similar to adults, while quarantine is required for those having mild symptoms. Antiviral medication (lopinavir, darunavir, favipiravir, remdesivir, ribavirin, oseltamivir, tocilizumab, and umifenovir), ACE inhibitors, interferon-2b, co-therapy with azithromycin, inhaling iNO, and oxygen therapy can be used for treatment.

ACE2 is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 S1 and mediates viral entry into host cells.

The membranes of human embryonic kidney-239T cells highly expressing ACE2 were applied to prepare NPs using an extrusion method. The nanomaterials, termed ACE2-NPs, contained 265.1 ng mg-1 ACE2 on the surface and acted as baits to trap S1 in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in reduced recruitment of the viral ligand to HK-2 human renal tubular epithelial cells. Aside from affecting receptor recongnition, S1 translocated to the cytoplasm and induced apoptosis by reducing optic atrophy 1 expression and increasing cytochrome c release, which was also inhibited by ACE2-NPs. Further investigations revealed that ACE2-NPs efficiently suppressed SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions entry into host cells and blocked viral infection in vitro and in vivo.

Agricultural landscapes are complex, and the value of resource patches may vary substantially among species. The spatial extent at which landscape features affect populations (i.e., scale of effect) may also differ among species. There is a need for regional-scale conservation planning that considers landscape-scale and species-specific responses of grassland birds to environmental change. We developed a spatially explicit approach to optimizing grassland conservation in the context of species-specific landscapes and prioritization of species recovery and applied it to a conservation program in Kentucky (USA). We used a hierarchical distance-sampling model with an embedded scale of effect predictor to estimate the relationship between landscape structure and abundance of eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), field sparrows (Spizella pusilla), and northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus). We used a novel spatially explicit optimization procedure rooted in multi-attribute utility theory to design alternative conservation strategies (e.g., prioritize only northern bobwhite recovery or assign equal weight to each species' recovery). Eastern meadowlarks and field sparrows were more likely to respond to landscape-scale resource patch adjacencies than landscape-scale patch densities. Northern bobwhite responded to both landscape-scale resource patch adjacencies and densities and responded strongly to increased grassland density. Effects of landscape features on local abundance decreased as distance increased and had negligible influence at 0.8 km for eastern meadowlarks (0.7-1.2 km 95% Bayesian credibility intervals [BCI]), 2.5 km for field sparrows (1.5-5.8 km 95% BCI), and 8.4 km for bobwhite (6.4-26 km 95% BCI). Northern bobwhites were predicted to benefit greatly from future grassland conservation regardless of conservation priorities, but eastern meadowlark and field sparrow were not. Our results suggest similar species can respond differently to broad-scale conservation practices because of species-specific, distance-dependent relationships with landscape structure. Our framework is quantitative, conceptually simple, customizable, and predictive and can be used to optimize conservation in heterogeneous ecosystems while considering landscape-scale processes and explicit prioritization of species recovery.","output":"Optimizing conservation in species-specific agricultural landscapes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to actively suppress, or gate, irrelevant sensory information is required for safe and efficient walking in sensory-rich environments. Both motor attention and motor planning alter somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in healthy adults. This study's aim was to examine the effect of motor attention on processing of irrelevant somatosensory information during plantar flexion motor planning after stroke. Thirteen healthy older adults and 11 individuals with stroke participated. Irrelevant tibial nerve stimulation was delivered while SEPs were recorded over Cz, overlaying the leg portion of the sensorimotor cortex at the vertex of the head. Three conditions were tested in both legs: (1) Rest, (2) Attend To, and (3) Attend Away from the stimulated limb. In conditions 2 and 3, relevant vibration cued voluntary plantar flexion movements of the stimulated (Attend To) or non-stimulated (Attend Away) leg. SEP amplitudes were averaged during motor planning per condition. Individuals with stroke did not show attention-mediated gating of the N40 component associated with irrelevant somatosensory information during motor planning. It may be that dysfunction in pathways connecting to area 3b explains the lack of attention-mediated gating of the N40. Also, attention-mediated gating during motor planning explained significant and unique variance in a measure of community balance and mobility combined with response time. Thus, the ability to gate irrelevant somatosensory information appears important for stepping in both older adults and after stroke.

Rather than cancel their courses instructors worked to deliver content and assess learning via distance learning and online pedagogies. Since this shift occurred mid-semester and unexpectedly, instructors and curriculum designers needed to make the transition quickly and smoothly. The urgency of the situation was not a call for lowering standards or changing learning outcomes. Rather, it was an opportunity to revisit our courses with a focus on the critical learning outcomes. During their course transitions many instructors discovered that creating coursework for an online setting is not a transcriptional process, in which only the medium by which the content delivery differed, but a translational one in which they needed to use an entirely different set of tools. For example, while creating video lecture captures or transcribing the text of the lectures may be the quickest way to make the transition, in the long-term instructors may have used readings from a variety of sources; relatively brief written, audio or video \\"mini-lectures\\"; different textbooks, open educational resources, and other content sources; and importantly, incorporated frequent assessments with rapid feedback.

SARS-CoV-2 transmits from person to person through several routes, mainly via respiratory droplets, which makes it difficult to contain its spread into the community. Here, we provide an overview of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19. AREAS COVERED: Direct person-to-person respiratory transmission has rapidly amplified the spread of coronavirus. In the absence of any clinically proven treatment options, the current clinical management of COVID-19 includes symptom management, infection prevention and control measures, optimized supportive care, and intensive care support in severe or critical illness. Developing an effective vaccine is now a leading research priority. Some vaccines have already been approved by the regulatory authorities for the prevention of COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION: General prevention and protection measures regarding the containment and management of the second or third waves are necessary to minimize the risk of infection. Until now, four vaccines reported variable efficacies of between 62-95%, and two of them (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) received FDA emergency use authorization. Equitable access and effective distribution of these vaccines in all countries will save millions of lives.","output":"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentations, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19: a review of current evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study was to compare retrograde intramedullary femoral nailing with supracondylar locked screw-plate fixation for the treatment of periprosthetic femur fractures following total knee arthroplasty.

A retrospective review of 63 patients who sustained Rorabeck Type II periprosthetic femoral fractures was undertaken. Patients were pooled from 3 academic institutions between 2001 and 2009. Patients eligible for the study were identified from the electronic medical record using an IDX query of International Classification of Diseases 9 and Current Procedural Terminology codes for fixation of femur fracture with intramedullary implant or plate and screws. In the series, 35 patients were treated with intramedullary femoral nailing and 28 with a locked screw-plate. The 2 groups were compared for radiographic union at 6, 12, 24, and 36 weeks. At 36 weeks, radiographic union was significantly greater in the locked screw-plate group. Time to full weight bearing was not significantly different. A greater perioperative transfusion rate was observed in the locking plate group, but it also had an overall lower rate of reoperation, for any reason, compared with the intramedullary femoral nailing group.

This study aimed to evaluate anti-spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers in the health care workers after the third BNT162b2 vaccination. MethodsDynamics of anti-spike IgG titers were assessed two months following the third BNT162b2 vaccination in 52 participants. All participants received the primary series of vaccination with BNT162b2 and received the third dose eight months after the second vaccination. Associations between anti-spike IgG titer, baseline characteristics, and adverse reactions were also evaluated. ResultsThe geometric mean titer of anti-spike IgG one month after the third vaccination was 17400 AU/ml, which increased to approximately 30 times immediately before the third vaccination and approximately twice that one month after the second vaccination. In addition, participants with anti-spike IgG titers less than 10000 AU/ml after the second vaccination tended to have higher increases in ant-spike IgG titers before and after the third vaccination. The decline rate of anti-spike IgG was significantly slower after the third vaccination as 35.7% than that after the second vaccination as 59.1%. The anti-spike IgG titer was significantly negatively associated with age (r = -0.31). Participants who had a headache at the vaccination showed significantly higher anti-spike IgG titer than those without a headache.

Methods: To identify intermediate traits of the COVID-19 risk variant, we performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) with 923 phenotypes in 310,999 European individuals from UK Biobank. For candidate target genes, we examined associations between their expression and the polygenic score (PGS) of 1,263 complex traits in a meta-analysis of 31,684 blood samples. Results: Our PheWAS identified and replicated multiple blood cell traits to be associated with the COVID-19 risk variant, including monocyte count and percentage (p = 1.07e-8, 4.09e-13), eosinophil count and percentage (p = 5.73e-3, 2.20e-3), and neutrophil percentage (p = 3.23e-3). The PGS analysis revealed positive associations between the expression of candidate genes and genetically predicted counts of specific blood cells: CCR3 with eosinophil and basophil (p = 5.73e-21, 5.08e-19); CCR2 with monocytes (p = 2.40e-10); and CCR1 with monocytes and neutrophil (p = 1.78e-6, 7.17e-5).

Hyperpolarised 129Xe MRI provides a way to directly measure airway functional abnormalities; the clinical relevance of 129Xe MRI ventilation defects in ever-hospitalised and never-hospitalised patients who had COVID-19 has not been ascertained. It remains unclear if persistent symptoms beyond the infectious phase are related to small airways disease and ventilation heterogeneity. Hence, we measured 129Xe MRI ventilation defects, pulmonary function and symptoms in ever-hospitalised and never-hospitalised patients who had COVID-19 with persistent symptoms consistent with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). METHODS Consenting participants with a confirmed diagnosis of PACS completed 129Xe MRI, CT, spirometry, multi-breath inert-gas washout, 6-minute walk test, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scale, modified Borg scale and International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Consenting ever-COVID volunteers completed 129Xe MRI and pulmonary function tests only. RESULTS Seventy-six post-COVID and nine never-COVID participants were evaluated. Ventilation defect per cent (VDP) was abnormal and significantly greater in ever-COVID as compared with never-COVID participants (p<0.001) and significantly greater in ever-hospitalised compared with never-hospitalised participants who had COVID-19 (p=0.048), in whom diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon-monoxide (p=0.009) and 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) (p=0.005) were also significantly different. 129Xe MRI VDP was also related to the 6MWD (p=0.02) and post-exertional SpO2 (p=0.002). Participants with abnormal VDP (4.3%) had significantly worse 6MWD (p=0.003) and post-exertional SpO2 (p=0.03).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: 306 volunteers aged 18-65 years participated in this study. All participants were tested during strict quarantine in April 2020. In order to diagnose the personality traits related to ambiguity tolerance, we used Budner's scale of tolerance-intolerance of ambiguity. To determine the features of experiences we used the survey, which included 40 statements and 12 emotional states related to the cognitive, emotional-evaluative, and behavioral components of the person's self-image. RESULTS: Results: The overwhelming majority of volunteers perceive the pandemic as a dangerous, threatening, uncertain situation and make hasty decisions on the base of polar judgments, react with anxiety, attempt to avoid uncertainty, rejection of everything unusual. Their experiences were filled with feelings of powerlessness and deterioration in mood. For the majority of our subjects, the situation of uncertainty is the source of intolerance. Negative consequences appeared in the behavior (loss of time management skills, laziness). There are direct relationships between the factor of shock and anxiety with the sources of intolerance, novelty and complexity, and general intolerance. The cognitive component of the experience was the least pronounced and involved only after an emotional experience. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: It has been established that cognitive rethinking of the self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic is possible after an emotional response and leads to a change in the behavioral stereotypes.","output":"Features of Psychological Experiences in Severe Quarantine during the Covid-19 Pandemic: The Role of Tolerance for Uncertainty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Theodosius Dobzhanskys essay, Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution, reflects on how evolution gives a powerful perspective to biological phenomena, able to integrate disparate pieces of information into coherent narratives.

Understanding how to maximize the effectiveness of these policies while mitigating economic damage is essential. We develop a mathematical model with different levels of population health and economic risk to assess the impact of quarantine measures on deaths, hospitalizations, and economic output. Methods: We combine an extended SEIR model that has multiple levels of health risk and economic vulnerability with disease parameters for the COVID19 pandemic to study the effects of quarantine policies. We examine the dynamics of infectious disease transmission and its economic impact for one year. We populate our model with a baseline of 95.6 % of high-risk people and 85.6 % of low-risk people in quarantine. We use our model to simulate leaving the current quarantine restrictions in place indefinitely. We then assess a policy where quarantine restrictions for lower-risk groups are gradually relaxed. Finally, we simulate relaxing quarantine restrictions more quickly. To compare outbreak outcomes under the same quarantine policies using different disease parameters, we also perform a sensitivity analysis on the contagiousness of infected people, the strictness of social isolation measures, and the amount that public policymakers value the economy in setting quarantine restrictions. Findings: We first consider a baseline scenario with constant quarantine level, finding that in a population of 330,000,000 million, there are 32,023 deaths among those under 60 and 174,682 deaths among those over 60, there is a peak of 189,136 hospitalizations, and the economy relative to the beginning of the quarantine state is 1.4 % smaller. In the scenario where higher-risk people are strictly quarantined, and for others the quarantine is slowly relaxed, there are 63,776 deaths among those under 60, 85,880 deaths among those over 60, a peak of 341,321 hospitalizations, and the economy relative to the beginning of the quarantine state is 6% larger. In the scenario where quarantine is more quickly lifted, there are 25,720 deaths among those under 60, 214,718 deaths among those over 60, a peak of 341,321 hospitalizations, and economic output relative to the beginning of the quarantine state is 4.5 % smaller. Interpretation: Strict restrictions on high-risk patients and a gradual lifting of quarantine for low-risk patients results in a limited number of deaths and lesser economic damage. We recommend this kind of strategy, combined with policies lowering the contagiousness of the disease and making quarantine more tolerable and economically viable for individuals.","output":"Public policy and economic dynamics of COVID-19 spread: a mathematical modeling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Tracheostomy is a life-saving procedure whose outcomes may vary between hospitals based on disparities in their existing expertise. We aimed at establishing the indications, early tracheostomy-related complications and their associated factors in Uganda. Methods: In a prospective cohort study, we consecutively enrolled one-hundred patients, both adults and children 2 hours post-tracheostomy procedure. At baseline, information on patients socio-demographics, tracheostomy indications, pre- and post-procedural characteristics was collected through researcher administered questionnaires and from medical records. Clinical examination was performed at baseline but also at either day 7 or whenever a tracheostomy-related complication was suspected during the 7days follow-up. Comparison of patients baseline characteristics, tracheostomy indications and complications across two hospitals was done using Pearsons chi-square. For predictors of early tracheostomy complications, bivariate and multivariate analysis models were fitted using binomial regression in STATA 13.0 software. Results: : Majority of patients were adults (84%) and males (70%). The commonest tracheostomy indications were;pulmonary toilet (58%) and anticipated prolonged intubation (42%). Overall, 53% (95% CI: 43.0 C 62.7) had early complications with the commonest being tube obstruction (52.6%). Independent predictors of early tracheostomy-related complications were;anticipated having prolonged intubation as an indication (RR=1.8, 95%CI: 1.19 C 2.76), Bjork flap tracheal incision (RR=1.6, 95%CI: 1.09 C 2.43), vertical tracheal incision (RR=1.53, 95%CI: 1.02 C 2.27), and age below 18 years (RR=1.22, 95%CI: 1.00 C 1.47). Conclusion: Within a pre-COVID-19 context, pulmonary toilet is the commonest tracheostomy indication at major hospitals in Uganda. The incidence of early tracheostomy complications is high and majorly related to post-procedure tracheostomy tube management. Having anticipated prolonged intubation as an indication for tracheostomy, a Bjork flap or vertical tracheal incisions and being a child increases the risk of complications.

We present the preliminary PET/CT ([(18)F]F-NaF, [(18)F]F-FDG) results at the six-month follow-up period as are part of an ongoing study, which will last two years FU. We enrolled 73 TAVI patients with the mean age of 82.49  7.11 years. A significant decrease in transvalvular gradient and increase of effective orifice area and left ventricle ejection fraction were observed. At six months, FU valve thrombosis was diagnosed in four patients, while 7.6% of patients refused planned controls due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We noticed significant correlations between valve types, EOA and transaortic valve gradients, as well as [(18)F]F-NaF and [(18)F]F-FDG uptake in PET/CT. PET/CT imaging with the use of [(18)F]F-FDG and [(18)F]F-NaF is intended to be feasible, and it practically allows the standardized uptake value (SUV) to differentiate the area containing the TAVI leaflets from the SUV directly adjacent to the ring calcifications and the calcified native leaflets. This could become the seed for future detection and evaluation capabilities regarding the progression of even early degenerative lesions to the TAVI valve, expressed as local leaflet inflammation and microcalcifications.","output":"The Usefulness of [(18)F]F-Fluorodeoxyglucose and [(18)F]F-Sodium Fluoride Positron Emission Tomography Imaging in the Assessment of Early-Stage Aortic Valve Degeneration after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI)Protocol Description and Preliminary Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected many facets of the practice of medicine including screening colonoscopies. Our study looks to observe if there has been an effect on the quality of colonoscopies, as indicated by quality measures such as cecal intubation rate (CIR), cecal intubation time (CIT), scope withdrawal time (SWT) and adenoma detection rate (ADR) with the adoption of standard COVID-19 precautions. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review to analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on screening colonoscopies. The study utilized data on CIR, CIT, SWT and ADR from outpatient, non-emergent procedures conducted at 3 endoscopy suites of St Lukes University Health Network. All inpatient and emergent procedures were excluded. Data was obtained by performing chart review on EPIC electronic health record. Results: Our study demonstrated that the total number of screening colonoscopies was decreased between 2019 to 2020 (318 in 2019 vs 157 in 2020, p= 0.005). CIT (320+/-105 seconds in 2019 vs 392+/-107 seconds in 2020, p=0.001) and SWT (706+/-232 seconds in 2019 vs 830+/-241 seconds in 2020, p=0.001) were increased while CIR (98.2% in 2019 vs 96.6% in 2020, p=0.04) was decreased between 2019 and 2020 likely due to PPE introduction. ADR was similar between the two groups (38.23 (12.50-66.66) in 2019 vs 38.18(16.66-66.00) in 2020, p=0.8). Conclusion: Our study showed that quality indices for screening colonoscopies like cecal intubation rate, cecal intubation time and scope withdrawal time were negatively impacted during the initial COVID time period compared to pre-COVID time. The study also displayed that though there was a significant decline in both screening and diagnostic colonoscopies during pandemic, adenoma detection rates were comparable.

Anecdotally, it should be noted that in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in many instances ICs are not obtained systematically. To date, no research appears to have been conducted on this matter. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and practice of obtaining IC from patients among health care providers (HCP) in the DRC. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study, with a convenient sampling of 422 participants. Data from the questions were collected on an imported Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for review at INSTAT.TM The authors set IC's accurate knowledge and practice at 80% or higher. The Fisher Exact test was used to compare categorical association results, and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Results showed that giving information in detail to patients on their medical condition was associated with formal training on medical ethics and IC (p: 0.0028; OR: 1.894; CI: 1.246 to 2.881), which was also associated with answering the patient's questions in detail (p: 0.0035; OR: 1.852; CI: 1.236 to 2.774). About 127(30.09 %) of participants scored 80% or higher. Extracurricular training was associated with withholding information from patients, up to 27 times more than other factors (p< 0.0001; OR: 27.042; CI: 13.628 to 53.657). when it comes to get IC, HCP with many years of practice scored better than others, in one of the question the odd ratio was closer to 7 (p< 0.0001; OR: 6.713; CI: 4.352 to 10.356). Only 47(11.14%) of the participants scored 80% or more of the questions about practice of IC. Conclusion: For a variety of reasons, knowledge and practice of IC among HCPs was very low. A common programme for the country as part of formal training might lead to an improvement.

A pandemic at the large-scale like COVID-19 places extraordinary demands on the world's health systems, dramatically devastates vulnerable populations, and critically threatens the global communities in an unprecedented way. While tremendous efforts at the frontline are placed on detecting the virus, providing treatments and developing vaccines, it is also critically important to examine the technologies and systems for tackling disease emergence, arresting its spread and especially the strategy for diseases prevention. The objective of this article is to review enabling technologies and systems with various application scenarios for handling the COVID-19 crisis. The article will focus specifically on 1) wearable devices suitable for monitoring the populations at risk and those in quarantine, both for evaluating the health status of caregivers and management personnel, and for facilitating triage processes for admission to hospitals; 2) unobtrusive sensing systems for detecting the disease and for monitoring patients with relatively mild symptoms whose clinical situation could suddenly worsen in improvised hospitals; and 3) telehealth technologies for the remote monitoring and diagnosis of COVID-19 and related diseases.

Previous studies showed some effects of acupuncture for MUI, but no systematic review has been done to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for MUI in women. Objective: To systematically review the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for women with MUI. Methods: Ten databases (i.e., PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Library, CBM, Scoups, CNKI, VIP and WANFANG DATA) were searched up to July 19th, 2021, using tailored search strategies with keywords not limited to \\"female,\\" \\"mixed urinary incontinence,\\" \\"acupuncture,\\" and \\"randomized controlled trial,\\" etc. RCTs and quasi-RCTs were included if investigating effect of any type of acupuncture for female patients with MUI. Data were extracted from eligible studies, and risks of bias were assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook from seven aspects using the RevMan 5.4 software. Results: A total of three randomized studies with 591 women were included. The risk of bias among the studies varied, with major concerns on blinding of participants and outcome assessor. Liu's study (497) mainly showed that electroacupuncture's effect on reduction of numbers of incontinence, urgency, nocturia episodes, and amount of urine leakage etc. was not inferior to that of PFMT-Solifenacin group at 12, 24, and 36 weeks. Zhan's study (60) showed that electroacupuncture reduced significantly more amount of urine leakage than Tolterodine at 8 weeks, with no data on incontinence episodes frequency.

The non-linear or linear exposureCeffect relationship between PA and AF was examined using the robust error meta-regression method. Results: A total of 16 prospective studies involving 1,449,017 individuals and 39,884 AF cases were included. We observed an inverse non-linear association between PA level and incident AF (I(2) = 0%, p(non?linearity) < 0.001). In the linear model, a 5 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-h/week increase in PA was associated with a decreased risk of AF [risk ratio (RR) = 0.992, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.988C0.996, I(2) = 0%]. In the sex-stratified analysis, we observed an inverse non-linear relationship between PA level and AF risk in females (I(2) = 90%, p(non?linearity) < 0.0001) but not in males (I(2) = 0%, p(non?linearity) = 0.40).

(Ericaceae)] with phlegm-reducing and cough-relieving properties, is widely used in China for treating bronchitis and asthma. OBJECTIVE: To present the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, vasoactive, antitumor, and antimicrobial effects of farrerol and its underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: The literature was reviewed by searching PubMed, Medline, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases between 2011 and May 2021. The following key words were used: farrerol, flavanone, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, vasoactive, antitumor, antimicrobial, and molecular mechanisms. RESULTS: Farrerol showed anti-inflammatory effects mainly mediated via the inhibition of interleukin (IL)-6/8, IL-1, tumour necrosis factor(TNF)-, NF-B, NO, COX-2, JNK1/2, AKT, PI3K, ERK1/2, p38, Keap-1, and TGF-1. Farrerol exhibited antioxidant effects by decreasing JNK, MDA, ROS, NOX4, Bax/Bcl-2, caspase-3, p-p38 MAPK, and GSK-3 levels and enhancing Nrf2, GSH, SOD, GSH-Px, HO-1, NQO1, and p-ERK levels. The vasoactive effects of farrerol were also shown by the reduced -SMA, NAD(P)H, p-ERK, p-Akt, mTOR, Jak2, Stat3, Bcl-2, and p38 levels, but increased OPN, occludin, ZO-1, eNOS, CaM, IP3R, and PLC levels. The antitumor effects of farrerol were evident from the reduced Bcl-2, Slug, Zeb-1, and vimentin levels but increased p27, ERK1/2, p38, caspase-9, Bax, and E-cadherin levels. Farrerol reduced -toxin levels and increased NO production and NF-B activity to impart antibacterial activity.

Despite often being slow growing, they can lead to significant gastrointestinal complications including intestinal failure (IF). The use of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in neoplastic conditions is rising, primarily for palliation and bridging through treatments for cancer, but remains a challenging decision with a paucity of high-grade evidence-based guidance. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with NET on HPN was performed. Data collected included the cause of IF, complications encountered with HPN and changes in nutritional assessments. RESULTS: Eight patients were identified, all with metastatic NET. Median weight improved following HPN commencement and line sepsis was the sole complication. All patients had stabilisation and optimisation of nutritional and hydration status. CONCLUSIONS: HPN is commenced to improve or maintain patients' nutritional status during often lifelong treatment. The principle aim in providing HPN was to improve survival and quality of life. While NETs are cancers, our case series demonstrates the potential of HPN to actively support longer term survival in the subgroup of patients who develop IF.","output":"Home parenteral nutrition in neuroendocrine tumour intestinal failure: improved quality of life and longevity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I have read with great interest the recently published paper by Yigenoglu et al entitled, \\"The outcome of COVID-19 in patients with hematological malignancy\\" This article is protected by copyright All rights reserved","output":"The outcome of COVID-19 in patients with hematological malignancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has thus far caused a total of 81,747 confirmed cases with 3283 deaths in China and more than 370,000 confirmed cases including over 16,000 deaths around the world by March 24, 2020.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluate neighborhood-level deprivation and English language proficiency effect on disproportionate outcomes seen in racial and ethnic minorities diagnosed with COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Health records of 12 Midwest hospitals and 60 clinics in Minnesota between March 4, 2020, and August 19, 2020 PATIENTS: Polymerase chain reaction-positive COVID-19 patients EXPOSURES: Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and primary language MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity, using hospitalization within 45 days of diagnosis as a marker of severity. Logistic and competing-risk regression models assessed the effects of neighborhood-level deprivation (using the ADI) and primary language. Within race, effects of ADI and primary language were measured using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 5577 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 were included; 866 (n = 15.5%) were hospitalized within 45 days of diagnosis. Hospitalized patients were older (60.9 vs. 40.4 years, p < 0.001) and more likely to be male (n = 425 [49.1%] vs. 2049 [43.5%], p = 0.002). Of those requiring hospitalization, 43.9% (n = 381), 19.9% (n = 172), 18.6% (n = 161), and 11.8% (n = 102) were White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic, respectively. Independent of ADI, minority race/ethnicity was associated with COVID-19 severity: Hispanic patients (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.72-5.30), Asians (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.74-3.29), and Blacks (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.15-1.94). ADI was not associated with hospitalization. Non-English-speaking (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.51-2.43) significantly increased odds of hospital admission across and within minority groups. CONCLUSIONS: Minority populations have increased odds of severe COVID-19 independent of neighborhood deprivation, a commonly suspected driver of disparate outcomes. Non-English-speaking accounts for differences across and within minority populations. These results support the ongoing need to determine the mechanisms that contribute to disparities during COVID-19 while also highlighting the underappreciated role primary language plays in COVID-19 severity among minority groups.","output":"Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Hospital Admissions from COVID-19: Determining the Impact of Neighborhood Deprivation and Primary Language"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: People with chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation in rural areas have worse outcomes, including an increased risk of hospitalisation and mortality and encounter many barriers to accessing kidney replacement therapy.

During a unilateral TEP repair, 11-50% of patients have been found to have a hernia on the contralateral side. The extraperitoneal laparoscopic repair on the contralateral side, done at a later date after the previous TEP, is quite difficult. We compared the morbidity parameters in bilateral to unilateral hernia repairs. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis was carried out over a 3-year period in 929 patients in whom TEP was done. The recurrence rate, pain scores at 24 hours and 1 week, hospital stay, seroma formation, and urinary retention rates were noted. RESULTS In 929 patients, 825 underwent bilateral and 104 unilateral hernia repair. Follow-up range was 12-40 months. The mean operating time was more in the bilateral group (31.3 +/- 5.5 minutes), compared to the primary group (23.7 +/- 5.5 minutes) (P = 0.0001). Mean pain scores at 24 hours and 1 week were similar in both groups. Hospital stay was also comparable in both groups (1.07 +/- 0.3 days for bilateral vs. 1.09 +/- 0.3 days for unilateral). Urinary retention rates and seroma formation were similar in both groups. Recurrence and conversion to open were also similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Compared to unilateral inguinal hernia repair, bilateral TEP repair is associated with a similar length of hospital stay, postoperative pain scores at 24 hours and 1 week, seroma formation, urinary retention rates, recurrence, and conversion rates. Therefore, the morbidity parameters in bilateral laparoscopic hernia repair are similar to unilateral repair.","output":"Is prophylactic laparoscopic total extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair on the contralateral side justified in less developed regions?

One well-evidenced model encapsulating this is hospital at home, however limited research has examined staffs' views on its implementation, which may inform service development and increase job satisfaction. The aim within was to explore the staff perspective of implementing a hospital at home model in a Scottish care setting which can inform service provision and ultimately increase job satisfaction. METHODS: The Acute Care @ Home (AC@H) service had a multi-disciplinary team. Referrals were predominantly received from a geriatric hospital ward. Inclusion criteria were older adults with geriatric syndromes and who required care input for a duration between one to seven days. In-depth staff interviews (N = 13) were conducted and analysed thematically to understand barriers and facilitators to implementation. These were supplemented with questionnaires assessing constructs of interest including training, communication and overall satisfaction. RESULTS: Several themes urged from our study: inter-team and intra-team collaboration, service development and operation, and scaling considerations. High job satisfaction was reported (mean score 73%), particularly due to a perceived non-hierarchical team structure and inclusive management style. Staff attributed positive outcomes through better identifying patients' needs at home compared to in hospital. Continuity of care facilitated rapport building. Recruitment challenges restricted the acuity and volume of patients the team were able to care for. CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative methodology could be useful for future implementation of intermediate care resources for the future health and care system building. Patient assessments at home, as opposed to in hospital, in conjunction with care continuity by staff, may mitigate against hospital risks and better facilitate reablement. Where recruitment challenges are present, agile models of care delivery should be considered.","output":"Staff views of a hospital at home model implemented in a Scottish care setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Comments on an article by Valerie F. Reyna et al. (see record 2022-15515-001). Reyna and colleagues often argue that the processing of gist tends to be both fast and unconscious (the hallmarks of cognitive autonomy), whereas the processing of verbatim traces is slower and conscious. Their argument about the speed of processing dovetails with the assumption that gist representations are often simple and that reasoners are assumed to use the simplest gist available to them. Given a reasonable ancillary assumption that the processes that act on gist traces are simpler than those that act on verbatim ones, the primary assumption about the relative speed of gist and verbatim processes seems justified. The assumptions made about processing gist and verbatim traces are closely analogous to the DPT assumption about the relative speed of autonomous and WM-dependent reasoning: Like Type 1 processing, gist-based processing tends to be faster and is thus likely to be completed faster than the slower and more deliberate verbatim processing. There is a potentially fruitful alignment of the assumption made by FTT and DPT.

The study investigators hypothesized that this change would affect the wellness of the students who were attenders prior to the pandemic more so than then non\\\\attenders. This was an observational cohort study in which prospectively collected attendance at non\\\\mandatory sessions during the first year of the MD program was correlated with responses to a wellness survey deployed pre\\\\ and post\\\\ the onset of the pandemic.

TRE possessed considerable amounts of phenolics (282.73 mg tannic acid equivalents/g of extract) and flavonoids (101.43 mg naringin equivalents/g of extract). IC(50) values for reducing power and DPPH radical scavenging activity were 52.51 and 47.83 g, respectively. The H(2)O(2) scavenging capacity of TRE was found to be 57.68 M  g(?1) min(?1). By examining the effects of TRE on SH-SY5Y cells injured by H(2)O(2), we found that after incubation of cells with TRE prior to H(2)O(2) exposure, the H(2)O(2) induced cytotoxicity was significantly reversed and the apoptotic features such as change in cellular morphology, nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation was inhibited. Moreover, TRE was very effective attenuating the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptotic cell death induced by H(2)O(2). TRE extract effectively suppressed the up-regulation of Bax, Caspase-3 and -9, and down-regulation of Bcl-2. Moreover, TRE pretreatment evidently increased the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in SH-SY5Y cells. These findings demonstrate that TRE protects SH-SY5Y cells against H(2)O(2)-induced injury and antioxidant properties may account for its neuroprotective actions and suggest that TRE might potentially serve as an agent for prevention of neurodegenerative disease associated with oxidative stress.","output":"Antioxidant Activity and Protective Effects of Tripterygium regelii Extract on Hydrogen Peroxide-Induced Injury in Human Dopaminergic Cells, SH-SY5Y"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of 31 January 2021, 63.9 million cases and 1.4 million deaths had been reported in Europe and North America, which accounted for 62.5% and 62.4% of the global total, respectively.

We collected the cumulative number of confirmed deaths from COVID-19 by age in 2020 from the LInstitut National dtudes Dmographiques (INED) database and Statistics Canada for 15 European and North American countries. We calculated age-specific death rates and age-standardized death rates (ASDR) for each country over a 1-year period from 6 February 2020 (date of first COVID-19 death in Europe and North America) to 5 February 2021 using established demographic methods. We estimated that COVID-19 was the second leading cause of death behind cancer in England and Wales and France and the third leading cause of death behind cancer and heart disease in nine countries including the US. Countries with higher all-cause mortality prior to the COVID-19 experienced higher COVID-19 mortality than countries with lower all-cause mortality prior to the pandemic. The COVID-19 ASDR varied substantially within country (e.g., a 5-fold difference among the highest and lowest mortality states in Germany). Consistently strong public health measures may have lessened the level of mortality for some European and North American countries. In contrast, many of the largest countries and economies in these regions may continue to experience a high mortality level because of poor implementation and adherence to such measures.

RESULTS: Caregivers from 321 unique families completed the survey, including 175 with children under active surveillance/follow\\\\up care and 146 with children no longer receiving oncology care. Overall, caregivers expressed exceptional resiliency, highlighting commonalities between caring for a child with cancer and adopting COVID\\\\19 prophylactic measures. However, respondents reported delayed/canceled appointments (50%) and delayed/canceled imaging (19%).

The method is broadly divided into the following steps. To obtain the current traffic state of the road network, the traffic state efficiency index formula proposed in this paper is used to derive it, and the MFD of the current state is drawn by using the classification of the design speed and free flow speed of the classified road. Then, based on the collected data from the monitoring stations and the weighting formula of the grade roads, the problem of insufficient measured data is solved. Meanwhile, the prediction performance of NARX, LSTM, and GRU is experimentally compared with traffic prediction, and it is found that NARX NN can predict long-term flow and the prediction performance is slightly better than both LSTM and GRU models. Afterward, the predicted data from the four stations were integrated based on the classified road weighting formula. Finally, according to the traffic state classification interval, the traffic state of the road network for the next day is obtained from the current MFD, the predicted traffic flow, and the corresponding speed. The results indicate that the combination of the NARX NN with the MFD is an effective attempt to predict and describe the long-term traffic state at the macroscopic level.","output":"Prediction of Road Network Traffic State Using the NARX Neural Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 remains a serious health threat to humans and there is an urgent need to develop therapeutics against this deadly virus.

Therefore, there are ongoing research efforts to identify drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) that resulted in hundreds of X-ray crystal structures of ligand-bound M(pro) complexes in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) describing the interactions of different fragment chemotypes within different sites of the M(pro). In this work, we performed rigorous molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of 62 reversible ligandCM(pro) complexes in the PDB to gain mechanistic insights about their interactions at the atomic level. Using a total of over 3 s long MD trajectories, we characterized different pockets in the apo M(pro) structure, and analyzed the dynamic interactions and binding affinity of ligands within those pockets. Our results identified the key residues that stabilize the ligands in the catalytic sites and other pockets of M(pro). Our analyses unraveled the role of a lateral pocket in the catalytic site in M(pro) that is critical for enhancing the ligand binding to the enzyme. We also highlighted the important contribution from HIS163 in the lateral pocket towards ligand binding and affinity against M(pro) through computational mutation analyses. Further, we revealed the effects of explicit water molecules and M(pro) dimerization in the ligand association with the target. Thus, comprehensive molecular-level insights gained from this work can be useful to identify or design potent small molecule inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro).","output":"Molecular dynamics and in silico mutagenesis on the reversible inhibitor-bound SARS-CoV-2 main protease complexes reveal the role of lateral pocket in enhancing the ligand affinity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the year 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis intersected with the development and maturation of several digital technologies including the internet of things (IoT) with next-generation 5G networks, artificial intelligence (AI) that uses deep learning, big data analytics, and blockchain and robotic technology, which has resulted in an unprecedented opportunity for the progress of telemedicine.

METHODS The study included 767 patients with solid and hematologic malignancies treated at the Oncology Institute of Vojvodina, Serbia. During July and August 2021 patients filled in an individual paper questionnaire on anti SARS-COV2 vaccination acceptance, preferences, side effects and information origin. Data on treatment phase, diagnosis and treatment was collected from electronic health records. RESULTS During the first six months of vaccination campaign in Serbia 41% (320/767) of the investigated oncology patients received COVID-19 vaccines. The median age of vaccinated patients was 65 years (28-84). Most of them (75%) were in active treatment of cancer. Half of the unvaccinated patients (52%) wish to get vaccinated after the end of their cancer treatment. Around 10% of the patients definitely refused vaccination. The majority of information on COVID-19 vaccines cancer patients got from their oncologist, television and newspapers. Side effects were reported by 10.93% of the patients after the first dose and 13,31% after the second dose. No serious side effects were reported. CONCLUSION We have confirmed that patients are reluctant of receiving vaccine due to fear of side effects, especially during the active cancer treatment.

The authors have revealed a great potential of these new paints for self-sterilizing of the surfaces in hospitals and public places simply with visible light exposure and this is reported for the first time in this review. A recent example of a communicable disease such as COVID-19 is considered. With all precautions and preventions taken as suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 has remained present for a longer time compared to other diseases. It has affected millions of people worldwide and the significant challenge remains of preventing infections due to SARS-CoV-2. The present review is focused on revealing the cause of this widespread disease and suggests a roadmap to control the spread of disease. It is understood that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus takes place through contact surfaces such as doorknobs, packaging and handrails, which may be responsible for many preventable and nosocomial infections. In addition, due to the potent transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, its ability to survive for longer periods on common touch surfaces is also an important reason for the spread of COVID-19. The existing antimicrobial cleaning technologies used in hospitals are not suitable, viable or economical to keep public places free from such infections. Hence, in this review, an innovative approach of coating surfaces in public places with visible-light photocatalytic nanocomposite paints has been suggested as a roadmap to self-sterilizing against the spread of communicable diseases. The formulations of different nanoparticle engineered photocatalytic paints with their ability to destroy pathogens using visible light, alongwith the field trials are also summarized and reported in this review.

We aimed at assessing first-time experience of telemedicine (TM) in the cardiology outpatient clinic of a tertiary medical center during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: TM was used in the cardiology outpatient clinic from April 7th to May 29th, 2020. All the patients that had applied to TM were included in the study. TM was performed by phone calls. The data written by the cardiologist telecommunicating with the patients were recorded by accessing each patient's electronic file. Assessment of TM in terms of efficacy and patient satisfaction was made in August 2020 by recalling all the patients by phone. Results: A total of 140 patients had TM visit on the appointment day. The population was older (6913.75) with a male predominance (53.5%). Main complaints were chest pain and high blood pressure. Twenty patients had their medical drugs rearranged. Forty-two patients were invited for face-to-face cardiac evaluation. One of them was hospitalized due to heart failure. Almost all (93.6%) were very satisfied and preferred TM instead of face-to-face outpatient clinic service in terms of easy complaint expression and easy understanding of medication rearrangement (53.6%). They stated that TM was efficient in the prevention of unnecessary hospital visits and it should continue after the pandemic as well. Conclusion: TM is a potential alternative for continuing healthcare delivery to most of the cardiac patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: We measured left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in a cross-sectional cohort of participants in the Chronic Kidney Disease Japan Cohort (CKD-JAC) study in order to identify factors that are associated with increased LVMI in patients with stage 3C5 CKD. LVH was defined as LVMI > 125 g/m(2) in male patients and >110 g/m(2) in female patients. RESULTS: We analyzed baseline characteristics in 1185 participants (male 63.7 %, female 36.3 %). Diabetes mellitus was the underlying disease in 41.3 % of patients, and mean age was 61.8  11.1 years. LVH was detected in 21.7 % of patients at baseline. By multivariate logistic analysis, independent risk factors for LVH were past history of cardiovascular disease (odds ratio [OR] 0.574; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.360C0.916; P = 0.020), systolic blood pressure (OR 1.179; 95 % CI 1.021C1.360; P = 0.025), body mass index (OR 1.135; 95 % CI 1.074C1.200; P < 0.001), and serum calcium level (OR 0.589; 95 % CI 0.396C0.876; P = 0.009).

In 1980, a vaccine called Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) was introduced for preventing tuberculosis and lung cancer. Countries that have made the BCG vaccine mandatory have witnessed a lesser COVID-19 fatality rate than the countries that have not made it compulsory. This paper's initial research shows that the countries with a long-term compulsory BCG vaccination system are less affected by COVID-19 than those without a BCG vaccination system. This paper discusses analytical data patterns for medical applications regarding COVID-19 impact on countries with mandatory BCG status on fatality rates. The paper has tackled numer-ous analytical challenges to realize the full potential of heterogeneous data.

We showed that patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have high levels of circulating progranulin and that its depletion in a mouse model by a monoclonal antibody aggravates MS-like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, unexpectedly, progranulin-deficient mice (Grn(?/?)) were resistant to EAE, and this resistance was fully restored by wild-type bone marrow transplantation. FACS analyses revealed a loss of MHC-II-positive antigen-presenting cells in Grn(?/?) mice and a reduction in the number of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells along with a strong increase in the number of scavenger receptor class B (CD36+) phagocytes, suggesting defects in antigen presentation along with a compensatory increase in phagocytosis. Indeed, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from Grn(?/?) mice showed stronger uptake of antigens but failed to elicit antigen-specific T-cell proliferation. An increase in the number of CD36+ phagocytes was associated with increased local inflammation at the site of immunization, stronger stimulation-evoked morphological transformation of bone marrow-derived macrophages to phagocytes, an increase in the phagocytosis of E. coli particles and latex beads and defects in the clearance of the material.

Postoperative pain is an important factor in the development of delirium, and effective pain management can reduce the risk of POD. Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) can effectively relieve postoperative pain and inhibit the perioperative stress and inflammatory response. We investigated whether the combination of TPVB with general anesthesia reduced the occurrence of POD following thoracoscopic lobectomy. METHODS A total of 338 elderly patients, aged 65-80 years, who underwent elective surgery for video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy (VATS) were randomly assigned to either a patient-controlled intravenous analgesia group (PIA) or a patient-controlled paravertebral-block analgesia group (PBA). POD was evaluated using the 3-min diagnostic confusion assessment method (3D-CAM). The postoperative quality of recovery (QoR) was assessed with Chinese version of QoR-40 scale. Pain intensity was measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) score. Tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and neurofilament light (NFL) levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. RESULTS Delirium occurred in 47 (28%) of 168 cases in the PIA group and 28 (16.5%) of 170 cases in the PBA group (RR 1.7, p = 0.03). PBA was also associated with a higher rate of overall recovery quality at day 7 after surgery (27.1% vs. 17.3%, P = 0.013) compared with PIA. The incremental change in surgery-induced TNF- and NFL was greater in the PIA group than PBA group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Thoracic paravertebral block analgesia is associated with lower incidence of postoperative delirium, probably due to its anti-neuroinflammatory effects. Furthermore, as a component of multimodal analgesia, TPVB provides not only superior analgesic but also opioid-sparing effects.

A systematic comparison of the potential antiviral effect of various heparin preparations on live wild type SARS-CoV-2, in vitro, is needed. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Seven different heparin preparations including UFH and low MW heparins (LMWH) of porcine or bovine origin were screened for antiviral activity against live SARS-CoV-2 (Australia/VIC01/2020) using a plaque inhibition assay with Vero E6 cells. Interaction of heparin with spike protein RBD was studied using differential scanning fluorimetry and the inhibition of RBD binding to human ACE2 protein using elisa assays was examined. KEY RESULTS: All the UFH preparations had potent antiviral effects, with IC50 values ranging between 25 and 41 gml-1 , whereas LMWHs were less inhibitory by ~150-fold (IC50 range 3.4-7.8 mgml-1 ). Mechanistically, we observed that heparin binds and destabilizes the RBD protein and furthermore, we show heparin directly inhibits the binding of RBD to the human ACE2 protein receptor. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This comparison of clinically relevant heparins shows that UFH has significantly stronger SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity compared to LMWHs. UFH acts to directly inhibit binding of spike protein to the human ACE2 protein receptor.

In humans, the nuclear pore complex is one of the largest multiprotein assemblies in the cell, with a molecular mass of 110 MDa and consisting of 8 to 64 copies of about 34 different nuclear pore proteins, termed nucleoporins, for a total of 1000 subunits per pore. Trafficking events across the nuclear pore are mediated by nuclear transport receptors and are highly regulated. The nuclear pore complex is also used by several RNA viruses and almost all DNA viruses to access the host cell nucleoplasm for replication. Viruses hijack the nuclear pore complex, and nuclear transport receptors, to access the nucleoplasm where they replicate. In addition, the nuclear pore complex is used by the cell innate immune system, a network of signal transduction pathways that coordinates the first response to foreign invaders, including viruses and other pathogens. Several branches of this response depend on dynamic signaling events that involve the nuclear translocation of downstream signal transducers. Mounting evidence has shown that these signaling cascades, especially those steps that involve nucleocytoplasmic trafficking events, are targeted by viruses so that they can evade the innate immune system.

We examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation and treatment of ischemic stroke in an entire population. Methods: We used linked provincial administrative data and data from the Quality Improvement and Clinical Research Alberta Stroke Program, a registry capturing stroke-related data on the entire population of Alberta(4.3 million), to identify all patients presenting with stroke in the pre-pandemic(1-January-2016 to 27-February-2020, n=19,531) and pandemic(28-February-2020 to 30-August-2020, n=2,255) periods. We examined changes in thrombolysis and endovascular therapy(EVT) rates, workflow, and in-hospital outcomes. Results: Hospitalizations/presentations for ischemic stroke dropped (weekly adjusted-incidence-rate-ratio[aIRR]:0.48, 95%CI:0.46-0.50, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, pre-admission care needs), as did population-level incidence of thrombolysis(aIRR:0.49,0.44-0.56) or EVT(aIRR:0.59,0.49-0.69). However, the proportions of presenting patients receiving acute therapies did not decline (e.g. thrombolysis:11.7% pre-pandemic vs 13.1% during-pandemic, aOR:1.02,0.75-1.38). Onset-to-door times were prolonged; EVT recipients experienced longer door-to-reperfusion times (median door-to-reperfusion:110-minutes, IQR:77-156 pre-pandemic vs 132.5-minutes, 99-179 during-pandemic; adjusted-coefficient:18.7-minutes, 95%CI:1.45-36.0). Hospitalizations were shorter but stroke severity and in-hospital mortality did not differ. Interpretation: The first COVID-19 wave was associated with a halving of presentations and acute therapy utilization for ischemic stroke at a population level, and greater pre-hospital and in-hospital treatment delays. Our data can inform public health messaging and stroke care in current and future waves. Messaging should encourage attendance for emergencies and stroke systems should re-examine code stroke protocols to mitigate inefficiencies.","output":"Changes in ischemic stroke presentations and associated workflow during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: A population study in Alberta, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To determine how self-reported level of exposure to patients with novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) affected the perceived safety, training and well-being of residents and fellows. METHODS: We administered an anonymous, voluntary, web-based survey to a convenience sample of trainees worldwide. The survey was distributed by email and social media posts from April 20th to May 11th, 2020. Respondents were asked to estimate the number of patients with COVID-19 they cared for in March and April 2020 (0, 1-30, 31-60, >60). Survey questions addressed (1) safety and access to personal protective equipment (PPE), (2) training and professional development and (3) well-being and burnout. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 1420 trainees (73% residents, 27% fellows), most commonly from the USA (n=670), China (n=150), Saudi Arabia (n=76) and Taiwan (n=75). Trainees who cared for a greater number of patients with COVID-19 were more likely to report limited access to PPE and COVID-19 testing and more likely to test positive for COVID-19. Compared with trainees who did not take care of patients with COVID-19 , those who took care of 1-30 patients (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.80, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.51), 31-60 patients (AOR 3.30, 95% CI 1.86 to 5.88) and >60 patients (AOR 4.03, 95% CI 2.12 to 7.63) were increasingly more likely to report burnout. Trainees were very concerned about the negative effects on training opportunities and professional development irrespective of the number of patients with COVID-19 they cared for. CONCLUSION: Exposure to patients with COVID-19 is significantly associated with higher burnout rates in physician trainees.","output":"Impact of exposure to patients with COVID-19 on residents and fellows: an international survey of 1420 trainees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory syndrome that resembles pneumonia. The current diagnostic procedure of COVID-19 follows reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based approach which however is less sensitive to identify the virus at the initial stage. Hence, a more robust and alternate diagnosis technique is desirable. Recently, with the release of publicly available datasets of corona positive patients comprising of computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) imaging; scientists, researchers and healthcare experts are contributing for faster and automated diagnosis of COVID-19 by identifying pulmonary infections using deep learning approaches to achieve better cure and treatment.

Following from this context, this article presents the random oversampling and weighted class loss function approach for unbiased fine-tuned learning (transfer learning) in various state-of-the-art deep learning approaches such as baseline ResNet, Inception-v3, Inception ResNet-v2, DenseNet169, and NASNetLarge to perform binary classification (as normal and COVID-19 cases) and also multi-class classification (as COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal case) of posteroanterior CXR images. Accuracy, precision, recall, loss, and area under the curve (AUC) are utilized to evaluate the performance of the models. Considering the experimental results, the performance of each model is scenario dependent; however, NASNetLarge displayed better scores in contrast to other architectures, which is further compared with other recently proposed approaches.

This principle was defined and popularized by the influential connectivity map study in 2006 regarding reversal relationships between disease- and drug-induced gene expression profiles, quantified by a disease-drug connectivity score. Over the past 15 years, several studies have proposed variations in calculating connectivity scores toward improving accuracy and robustness in light of massive growth in reference drug profiles.

At the same time, lung histopathology often reveals fibrin-based occlusion of small vessels in patients who succumb to the disease. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired and potentially life-threatening thrombophilia in which patients develop pathogenic autoantibodies (aPL) targeting phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins. Small case series have recently detected aPL in patients with COVID-19. Here, we measured eight types of aPL (anticardiolipin IgG/IgM/IgA, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I IgG/IgM/IgA, and anti- phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (PS/PT) IgG/IgM) in the sera of 172 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We detected anticardiolipin IgM antibodies in 23%, anti-PS/PT IgG in 24%, and anti-PS/PT IgM in 18%. Any aPL was present in 52% of patients using the manufacturer's threshold and in 30% using a more stringent cutoff (>40 units). Higher levels of aPL were associated with neutrophil hyperactivity (including the release of neutrophil extracellular traps/NETs), higher platelet count, more severe respiratory disease, and lower glomerular filtration rates. Similar to patients with known and longstanding APS, IgG fractions isolated from patients with COVID-19 promoted NET release from control neutrophils. Furthermore, injection of these COVID-19 IgG fractions into mice accelerated venous thrombosis. Taken together, these studies suggest that a significant percentage of patients with COVID-19 become at least transiently positive for aPL and that these aPL are potentially pathogenic.","output":"Prothrombotic antiphospholipid antibodies in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The reduction in infectious disease morbidity and mortality may be attributed to a variety of factors; however, improved sanitation and public health, and the introduction of vaccines and antibiotics are among the most significant.

The prevalence of anaemia in women aged 15C49 years, by pregnancy status, is indicator 2.2.3 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and the aim of halving the anaemia prevalence in women of reproductive age by 2030 is an extension of the 2025 global nutrition targets endorsed by the World Health Assembly (WHA). We aimed to estimate the prevalence of anaemia by severity for children aged 6C59 months, non-pregnant women aged 15C49 years, and pregnant women aged 15C49 years in 197 countries and territories and globally for the period 2000C19. METHODS: For this pooled analysis of population-representative data, we collated 489 data sources on haemoglobin distribution in children and women from 133 countries, including 45 million haemoglobin measurements. Our data sources comprised health examination, nutrition, and household surveys, accessed as anonymised individual records or as summary statistics such as mean haemoglobin and anaemia prevalence. We used a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model to estimate haemoglobin distributions in each population and country-year. This model allowed for coherent estimation of mean haemoglobin and prevalence of anaemia by severity. FINDINGS: Globally, in 2019, 40% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 36C44) of children aged 6C59 months were anaemic, compared to 48% (45C51) in 2000. Globally, the prevalence of anaemia in non-pregnant women aged 15C49 years changed little between 2000 and 2019, from 31% (95% UI 28C34) to 30% (27C33), while in pregnant women aged 15C49 years it decreased from 41% (39C43) to 36% (34C39). In 2019, the prevalence of anaemia in children aged 6C59 months exceeded 70% in 11 countries and exceeded 50% in all women aged 15C49 years in ten countries. Globally in all populations and in most countries and regions, the prevalence of mild anaemia changed little, while moderate and severe anaemia declined in most populations and geographical locations, indicating a shift towards mild anaemia. INTERPRETATION: Globally, regionally, and in nearly all countries, progress on anaemia in women aged 15C49 years is insufficient to meet the WHA global nutrition target to halve anaemia prevalence by 2030, and the prevalence of anaemia in children also remains high. A better understanding of the context-specific causes of anaemia and quality implementation of effective multisectoral actions to address these causes are needed.

This non-specific effect of BCG is partially mediated by innate immune memory due to epigenetic changes in innate and adaptive immune system cells induced by the microbe.

It was intended to explore the experience of doctors using tele-psychiatry for provision of clinical care during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Mental Health Trust covering four cities in West Midlands, UK. METHOD: The study was conducted as an anonymized questionnaire survey. A 10-item questionnaire was designed with items related to the clinical outcomes, challenges and provider satisfaction when using tele-psychiatry. It had mostly yes/no dichotomous responses along with the scope for making additional comments for each question. An online link of the questionnaire was sent via email to doctors of all grades working across the Black Country Healthcare NHS foundation Trust, in the West Midlands. The survey was open between July and October 2020; and monthly reminders were sent. RESULT: The questionnaire was sent out to 159 doctors and 34 responded (response rate of 21.3%). Just over 50% had used both telephone and video consultations, whereas 47.1% responders had used telephone only. More than half (55.8%) reported that the tele-psychiatry affected clinical outcomes; and it was considered positive in around half (52.9%). Most (73.5%) of the responders found that limitations or challenges of using technology impacted on delivery of care remotely. However 64.7% psychiatrists were satisfied with the process overall; and 79.4% reported that they would like to use tele-psychiatry in the future as well. Survey captured many observations from the psychiatrists. Positive comments from the psychiatrists included expedited delivery of care, reduced non-attendance rates, as well as successful multidisciplinary meetings. Challenges in specific sub-specialties such as Child and Adolescent Psychiatry or Older Adult psychiatry were reported where complete assessments were not achieved successfully. The process was felt to be appropriate in general for stable or follow-up patients in comparison to new or acutely unwell patients. There was some worry expressed about missing out non-verbal cues which assist with mental state examination. CONCLUSION: Inspite of a low response rate, the survey provided some understanding about the experience of doctors practicing tele-psychiatry during pandemic. While technological challenges were acknowledged, tele-psychiatry seemed to have been accepted by a majority of doctors who are also willing to continue it in their future clinical practice. There is a need to explore in a larger sample involving both patients and clinicians about the beneficial effects of tele-psychiatry that can be incorporated in the usual psychiatric practice.","output":"Experience of tele-psychiatry during COVID-19 amongst doctors working in a mental health trust: A survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Simulation is a critical component of nursing and medical education used to teach skills and assess student performance.

In Peru, few studies, often focused in a single ESKAPE microorganism, have been performed, but none providing an overall and comprehensive long-time analysis of the antibiotic resistance of ESKAPE microorganisms. In the present study, the evolution of antimicrobial resistance levels of ESKAPE microorganisms isolated during 2009 - 2010 (Period 1) and 2012 - 2014 (Period 2) in a IV-level hospital in Lima was analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ESKAPE microorganisms were isolated from inpatients clinical samples. Bacterial identification, as well as antimicrobial susceptibility levels for up to 29 antimicrobial agents and presence of Extended-Spectrum -Lactamases (only established in K. pneumoniae) were determined using automatic methods. RESULTS: Of 9,918 clinical isolates, 1,917/3,777 (50.8%) [JAN/2009-JUN/2010 (Period 1)] and 4764/6141 (46.4%) [JAN/2012-DEC/2014 (Period 2)] belonged to the ESKAPE group (P <0.0001). ESKAPE were more frequent in the intensive care unit (ICU) (P <0.0001). E. faecium decreased from 5.1% to 4.1% (P <0.5), S. aureus from 10.5% to 7.0% (P <0.05), and P. aeruginosa from 12.9% to 11.6% (P <0.05), while, A. baumannii increased from 5.0% to 6.7% (P <0.05), mainly related to an increase in ICU isolates (8.4% vs. 17.1%; P <0.05). Overall, high levels of antimicrobial resistance were detected, but with few exceptions (e.g. vancomycin in E. faecium), antibiotic resistance levels remained stable or lower in Period 2. Contrarily, A. baumannii showed significantly increased resistance to different cephalosporins, carbapenems and amoxicillin plus sulbactam. CONCLUSION: The introduction of a successful extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii clone in the ICU is suspected.

Although controversy exists regarding the efficacy of tocilizumab treatment, it has been suggested that tocilizumab might show positive results depending on patient severity status. We examined an association between tocilizumab and distinct disease severity stages. Methods and Findings: From March 3 to March 23 2020, 494 consecutively admitted COVID-19 patients received tocilizumab or standard treatment alone. Data were obtained retrospectively. Clinical respiratory severity (CRS) stages were defined by patient oxygenation status and were also associated to scores of WHO clinical progression scale. We categorized patients in three stages, mild/moderate CRS1 (FiSpO2<0.35; WHO score 5), moderate/severe CRS2 (FiO2=0.5/high flow mask; WHO score 6) and severe/critical CRS3 (FiO2<80%/high flow/prone position or mechanical ventilation; score>6). The primary outcome was the composite of death or ICU admission in patients of stages CRS1, CRS2, and CRS3, as well as in total patients. We also addressed mortality alone in total patients. Kaplan-Maier curves, Cox proportional regression and inverse probability weighting marginal structural models were used. We conducted the study from March 3 to April 7 2020 with broad-ranged severity patients; 167 tocilizumab-treated and 327 untreated. CRS1 patients showed no apparent benefit after treatment, while the risk of the primary outcome was greatly reduced in CRS2 treated participants ((HR=0.22; 95% CI (0.16-0.44)). Moreover, tocilizumab treatment was associated with significantly decreased CRS2 patient proportion that reached the outcome compared to non-treated controls (27.8.0% vs. 65.4%; p<0.001). Severe/critical CRS3 patients, also showed benefit after treatment (HR=0.38; 95% CI (0.16-90)), although not as robust as was that of CRS2 treated individuals. Tocilizumab was associated with reduced outcome risk in total patients (HR=0.42; 95% CI (0.26-0.66)) after CRS adjustment, but not if CRS classification was not accounted as confounding factor (HR=1.19; 95% CI (0.84-1.69)). The outcome of mortality alone upon tocilizumab treatment was significant (HR=0.58; 95% CI (0.35-0.96)) after accounting for CRS classification. Conclusions: Tocilizumab treatment is associated with reduced COVID-19 escalation in CRS2 patients, suggesting efficacy in moderate/severe non-ICU-admitted patients.

The instructors and faculty at most institutions have had to adapt, invent, and implement adjustments quickly to adopt an online learning environment. This has been an extraordinarily challenging time for both students and instructors, particularly as many were not aware of the affordances and weaknesses of the online learning environment before it was uptaken. Particularly for chemistry and related disciplines, this change in delivery mode is even more disruptive in courses that have laboratory components due to loss of access to laboratories. As a teaching community, it was our responsibility to respond quickly and effectively to students' learning needs during this unprecedented global crisis. In our course, we provided succinct pre-recorded lecture-videos by topic rather than live-streaming of lectures. The recordings were made available to students a minimum of 24 h before the scheduled lecture time. Students were then provided opportunities to attend live tutorial sessions (held on Zoom and live Q&A feature on Piazza) if they had any questions that they wanted to ask the lecturer directly. We believe that the asynchronous sessions were more equitable than synchronous ones. This meant that students with difficult and challenging home/learning environments (i.e., disruptions at home, work/family schedules, poor internet, limited access to devices, etc.) were minimally disadvantaged.

However, radial access failure is not uncommon, leading to crossover to a different access site. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is used to estimate stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. Our study aimed to assess the CHA2DS2-VASc score in predicting failure of the transradial approach, resulting in crossover to transfemoral access (TFA) for coronary angiography. METHODS We performed a single-center, non-randomized, retrospective study. The study included 1775 patients who underwent coronary angiography with or without subsequent percutaneous intervention between July 2018 and October 2019. The study population was divided into three groups based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score: low (2), intermediate (3-4), and high score (5) groups. The association between the CHA2DS2-VASc score and radial access failure was evaluated and compared between the groups. RESULTS A total of 197 patients (11.1%) had crossover to the femoral artery. A large percentage of patients (19.2%) had radial access failure in the high CHA2DS2-VASc score group (5) compared with 12.5% in the intermediate score group (3-4) and only 6.3% in the low score group (2). The highest crossover rate (42.9%) was observed in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 8. Higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores were also associated with increased fluoroscopy time, contrast administration, and radiation exposure.

We aimed to investigate the effect of control measures and holiday seasons on the incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in Iran. STUDY DESIGN: An observational study. METHODS: The daily data of confirmed new cases and deaths in Iran were taken from the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 database. We calculated weekly data from 19 Feb to 6 Oct 2020. To estimate the impact of control measures and holiday seasons on the incidence rate of new cases and deaths, an autoregressive hidden Markov model (ARHMM) with two hidden states fitted the data. The hidden states of the fitted model can distinguish the peak period from the non-peak period. RESULTS: The control measures with a delay of one-week and two-week had a decreasing effect on the new cases in the peak and non-peak periods, respectively (P=0.005). The holiday season with a two-week delay increased the total number of new cases in the peak periods (P=0.031). The peak period for the occurrence of COVID-19 was estimated at 3 weeks. In the peak period of mortality, the control measures with a three-week delay decreased the COVID-19 mortality (P=0.010). The expected duration of staying in the peak period of mortality was around 6 weeks. CONCLUSION: When an increasing trend was seen in the country, the control measures could decline the incidence and mortality related to COVID-19.

This study investigated angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 expression in the sinonasal mucosa of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, as this could be linked to a susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. METHODS: Ethmoid sinus specimens were obtained from 27 patients with eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis, 18 with non-eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis and 18 controls. The angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 and other inflammatory cytokine and chemokine messenger RNA levels were assessed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 positive cells were examined immunohistologically. RESULTS: The eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis patients showed a significant decrease in angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 messenger RNA expression.

Setting the system parameters by satisfying the proposed condition keeps the overall cost function convex and it can be minimised via the forward-backward (FB) algorithm. The proposed method based on Cauchy regularisation is evaluated by solving two generic signal processing examples, i.e. 1D signal denoising in the frequency domain and two image reconstruction tasks including de-blurring and denoising.

METHODS: CHOLECOVID is an international, multicentre, observational comparative study of patients admitted to hospital with acute cholecystitis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on management were collected for a 2-month study interval coincident with the WHO declaration of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and compared with an equivalent pre-pandemic time interval. Mediation analysis examined the influence of SARS-COV-2 infection on 30-day mortality. RESULTS: This study collected data on 9783 patients with acute cholecystitis admitted to 247 hospitals across the world. The pandemic was associated with reduced availability of surgical workforce and operating facilities globally, a significant shift to worse severity of disease, and increased use of conservative management. There was a reduction (both absolute and proportionate) in the number of patients undergoing cholecystectomy from 3095 patients (56.2 per cent) pre-pandemic to 1998 patients (46.2 per cent) during the pandemic but there was no difference in 30-day all-cause mortality after cholecystectomy comparing the pre-pandemic interval with the pandemic (13 patients (0.4 per cent) pre-pandemic to 13 patients (0.6 per cent) pandemic; P = 0.355).

Here, spoken arithmetical and non-mathematical statements were employed to investigate neural processing of arithmetic, compared to general language processing, in an attention-modulated cocktail party paradigm. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data was recorded from 22 subjects listening to audio mixtures of spoken sentences and arithmetic equations while selectively attending to one of the two speech streams. Short sentences and simple equations were presented diotically at fixed and distinct word/symbol and sentence/equation rates. Critically, this allowed neural responses to acoustics, words, and symbols to be dissociated from responses to sentences and equations. Indeed, the simultaneous neural processing of the acoustics of words and symbols was observed in auditory cortex for both streams. Neural responses to sentences and equations, however, was predominantly to the attended stream, and originated primarily from left temporal, and parietal areas, respectively. Additionally, these neural responses were correlated with behavioral performance in a deviant detection task. Source-localized Temporal Response Functions revealed distinct cortical dynamics of responses to sentences in left temporal areas and equations in bilateral temporal, parietal and motor areas. Finally, the target of attention could be decoded from MEG responses, especially in left superior parietal areas. In short, the neural responses to arithmetic and language are especially well segregated during the cocktail party paradigm, and the correlation with behavior suggests that they may be linked to successful comprehension or calculation. Significance Statement Neural processing of arithmetic relies on dedicated, modality independent cortical networks that are distinct from those underlying language processing. Using a simultaneous cocktail party listening paradigm, we found that these separate networks segregate naturally when listeners selectively attend to one type over the other. Time-locked activity in the left temporal lobe was observed for responses to both spoken sentences and equations, but the latter additionally showed bilateral parietal activity consistent with arithmetic processing. Critically, these responses were modulated by selective attention and correlated with task behavior, consistent with reflecting high-level processing for speech comprehension or correct calculations.

BACKGROUND Long gap esophageal atresia remains a challenge for pediatric surgeons. Over the years, several techniques have been described to deal with the problem of the distance between the proximal and distal esophagus. More recently, a traction technique has been advocated. With the advent of minimal invasive surgery, the thoracoscopic elongation technique has been developed. METHODS Retrospective description of a single-center experience with the thoracoscopic treatment of patients with long gap esophageal atresia over a 7-year period. RESULTS Between 2007 and May 2014, 10 children with long gap esophageal atresia were treated by thoracoscopic elongation technique. In two children, the procedure failed. Eight children successfully underwent thoracoscopic traction with delayed primary anastomosis. Initially, all patients had a gastrostomy. During the course, the technique evolved into delayed primary anastomosis directly after birth without the use of a gastrostomy. CONCLUSION Thoracoscopic elongation technique in long gap esophageal atresia not only is feasible, but can nowadays also be performed directly after birth without the use of a gastrostomy. With this development, we have entered a new era in the management of long gap esophageal atresia.","output":"Thoracoscopic traction technique in long gap esophageal atresia: entering a new era."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The commentaries by Burke and Johnston (this issue), Eid (this issue), Jungh?nel et al.

The correlated first-order syndrome-specific factors model has proven useful in constructing explanatory models of psychopathology. The bifactor S - 1 model is also useful for examining the latent structure of psychopathology, especially in contexts with clear theoretical predictions. Joint use of correlated first-order syndrome-specific model and bifactor S - 1 model provides leverage for explaining psychopathology, and both models can also guide individual clinical assessment.

The mechanism by which conformational changes of this S glycoprotein can be triggered by pH 8.0 has not yet been determined. Here, we show that MHV-A59 S protein is triggered by pH 8.0 at 37C to induce receptor-independent syncytium (RIS) formation on 293T cells, and that the conformational changes in S proteins triggered by pH 8.0 are very similar to those triggered by receptor binding. We systemically mutated each of 15 histidine residues in S protein and found that H209 is essential for pH 8.0-triggered RIS formation, while H179, H441, H643, and H759 also play important roles in this process. Replacement of H209 with Ala had no effect on receptor binding, but in murine 17Cl.1 cells mutant H209A MHV-A59 showed delayed growth kinetics and was readily outcompeted by wild-type virus when mixed together, indicating that the H209A mutation caused a defect in virus fitness. Finally, the H209A mutation significantly increased the thermostability of S protein in its prefusion conformation, which may raise the energy barrier for conformational change of S protein required for membrane fusion and lead to a decrease in virus fitness in cell culture. Thus, MHV-A59 may have evolved to lower the stability of its S protein in order to increase virus fitness.IMPORTANCE Enveloped viruses enter cells through fusion of viral and cellular membranes, and the process is mediated by interactions between viral envelope proteins and their host receptors. In the prefusion conformation, viral envelope proteins are metastable, and activation to the fusion conformation is tightly regulated, since premature activation would lead to loss of viral infectivity. The stability of viral envelope proteins greatly influences their activation and virus fitness. Here, we report that, similar to the A82V mutation in Ebola glycoprotein, in the S glycoprotein of murine coronavirus MHV-A59, the histidine residue at position of 209 significantly affects the thermal stability of the S protein, determines whether S protein can be activated at 37C by either pH 8.0 alone or by receptor binding, and affects viral fitness in cell culture. Thus, the spike glycoprotein of MHV-A59 has evolved to retain histidine at position 209 to optimize virus fitness.","output":"Identification of H209 as Essential for pH 8-Triggered Receptor-Independent Syncytium Formation by S Protein of Mouse Hepatitis Virus A59."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resource scarcity imposes challenging demands on the human cognitive system. Insufficient resources cause the scarcity mindset to affect cognitive performance, while reward enhances cognitive function. Here, we examined how reward and scarcity simultaneously contribute to cognitive performance. Experimental manipulation to induce a polar scarcity mindset and reward conditions within participants under functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recording was implemented to explore the mechanism underlying the scarcity mindset and reward in terms of behavior and neurocognition. Participants showed decreased functional connectivity from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) with a scarcity mindset, a region often implicated in cognitive control. Moreover, under reward conditions, the brain activation of the maximum total Hb bold signal was mainly located in the left hemisphere [channels 1, 3, and 4, left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (L-VLPFC) and channel 6, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC)], and there was also significant brain activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (R-DLPFC) in the right hemisphere (channel 17). Furthermore, these data indicate the underlying neural changes of the scarcity mentality and demonstrate that brain activities may underlie reward processing.

Animals were monitored clinically and for virus shedding. Direct contact animals (n=3) were included. Animals were humanely sacrificed for virological and immune-pathohistological analysis at different time points.Findings: Under these settings, pigs and chickens were not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. All swabs as well as organ samples and contact animals remained negative for viral RNA, and none of the animals seroconverted. Rousettus aegyptiacus fruit bats experienced a transient infection, with virus detectable by RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) in the nasal cavity, associated with rhinitis. Viral RNA was also identified in the trachea, lung and lung associated lymphatic tissue. One of three contact bats became infected. More efficient virus replication but no clinical signs were observed in ferrets with transmission to all direct contact animals. Prominent viral RNA loads of up to 104 viral genome copies/ml were detected in the upper respiratory tract.

This is challenging. as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) infection has been identified as a prothrombotic risk factor, with heparin treatment decreasing mortality. However, both infection and vaccination have been associated with immune\\\\mediated hematologic abnormalities, including thrombocytopenia, further rendering these groups at risk for both hemorrhagic and thrombotic events. OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize the incidence and clinical findings of coagulation factor inhibitors in patients with COVID\\\\19 and vaccine recipients. METHODS: We queried the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a publicly accessible database, for reports of potential bleeding episodes or coagulation disturbances associated with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 vaccination. We performed an additional comprehensive literature review to identify reports of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection or vaccination\\\\associated coagulation factor inhibitors. RESULTS: VAERS data showed 58 cases of coagulation factor inhibitors, suggesting a rate of 1.2 cases per 10 million doses. A total of 775 articles were screened and 15 were suitable for inclusion, with six reports of inhibitors after vaccination and nine reports of inhibitors after infection. Inhibitor specificity for factor VIII was most common. Among reported cases, two patients expired due to hemorrhage, one following infection and one following vaccination. CONCLUSION: The incidence of coagulation factor inhibitors in patients with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 vaccination and infection appears similar to the general population. Nonetheless, given the importance of heparin therapy in treating hospital patients, recognition of inhibitors is important.","output":"Coagulation factor inhibitors in COVID\\\\19: From SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 vaccination to infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study assessed the COVID-19 information seeking strategies of rural dwellers in Delta North, Nigeria This study adopted a survey research design Fifty (50) respondents were randomly selectedfrom each of the rural communities in Delta North usedfor the study, which amounted to 450 respondents used for the study Out of the 450 copies of the questionnaire distributed to the respondents, the researcher was able to retrieve 418 copies of the questionnaire from the rural dwellers, thus there was 92% response rate The method of data analysis adopted was descriptive statistics covering frequency count and percentage The finding of the study revealed that the COVID-19 information needs as indicated by respondents were on general emerging news on COVID-19, COVID-19 prevention, ways of seeking medical help in the pandemic era, government policies on COVID-19, among others It is evident from the finding that the preferred information sources on COVID-19 as indicated by the respondents are family members/ friends, mass media (Television, Radio, Newspapers, etc ), herbal doctors/ traditional healers, healthcare providers/ physicians, town criers, herb hawkers, pharmacist/ chemist, NGOs, books (print/ electronic), among others The respondents indicated they use the COVID-19 information they seek to educate family members/ friends about current news on COVID-19, stop the spread of COVID-19 by observing precautionary measures, abide by government policies on COVID-19, understand how to seek medical help in the pandemic era, educate their kinsmen on preventive measures from the COVID-19 disease, among others The challenges that militate against the accessibility and use of COVID-19 information as indicated by the respondents are too many fake news about COVID-19, too many contradicting information on COVID-19, non-availability of relevant information on COVID-19, communication/ Language barriers, government policies on COVID-19 are not adequately publicized, among others It was recommended from the study that government accredited health agency platforms should publish COVID-19 information in both English and the local dialect of the rural people to ensure the information penetrate more in society It was also recommended that researchers/ scholars and writers should desist from publishing fake and other irrelevant information on COVID-19","output":"Covid-19 Information Seeking Strategies of Rural Dwellers in Delta North, Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This observational retrospective study aimed to investigate the usefulness of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Quick SOFA (qSOFA), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), and quick NEWS in predicting respiratory failure and death among patients with COVID-19 hospitalized outside of intensive care units (ICU) We included 237 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 who were followed-up on for one month or until death Respiratory failure was defined as a PaO2/FiO2 ratio =4 was found to be the best cutoff point for predicting respiratory failure","output":"[The early use of sepsis scores to predict respiratory failure and mortality in non-ICU patients with COVID-19]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Maternal health is part of public health that will show a positive trend if there is a decrease in maternal mortality and an increase in delivery assistance provided by health workers in health service facilities. to know the relationship between pregnancy disorders and access to health services for female workers in the industrial area of ?Sidoarjo. this research was cross-sectional The sample of this study was 159 midwives.

Interrupted time-series analyses of data on 383,934 Nationwide Inpatient Sample hospitalizations (2005-2010 and 2011-2013) were performed, whereby yearly and quarterly cross-sectional data were evaluated and Affordable Care Act implementation was considered the main exposure variable, stratifying by patient and hospital characteristics. Overall, we observed a declining trend in radiation therapy over time, with an upward shift post-Affordable Care Act. A downward shift in radiation therapy post-Affordable Care Act was observed among Northeastern and rural hospitals, whereas an upward shift was noted among specific patient (females, 18-39 or  65 years of age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) 10, non-elective admissions, Medicare, self-pay, no pay or other insurance) and hospital (Midwestern, Western, non-teaching urban) subgroups. Stereotactic radiosurgery utilization among recipients of radiation therapy increased over time among Hispanics, elective admissions, and rural hospitals, whereas post-Affordable Care Act was associated with increased stereotactic radiosurgery among African-Americans and non-elective admissions and decreased stereotactic radiosurgery among elective admissions, and rural hospitals. Whereas hospitalized adults in the United States utilized less radiation therapy over the nine-year period, utilization of radiation therapy, in general, and stereotactic radiosurgery, in particular, were not consistent among distinct subgroups defined by patient and hospital characteristics, with some traditionally underserved populations more likely to receive healthcare services post-Affordable Care Act.

Therefore, we aimed to determine the relationship between the information sources on vaccines and the willingness of people to be vaccinated in Thailand. Methods A sample of 500 respondents was drawn from an Internet research panel, and a questionnaire survey was administered to evaluate respondents willingness to be vaccinated by sex, age group, educational background, occupation, and presence of chronic diseases, as well as their information sources on COVID-19 vaccines. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were employed to assess the relationship between vaccine hesitancy/refusal and other variables. Results Our results demonstrated that 90.2% of the participants were either willing to vaccinate or were already vaccinated. By contrast, 6.0% were hesitant and 3.8% did not want to be vaccinated. Females, people with education less than masters/bachelors degree or high school, day laborers, housewives, and unemployed were significantly related to vaccine hesitation/refusal. Furthermore, they were less likely than the vaccine willingness group to use information resources from the Ministry of Health, public health centers, or medical associations. Conclusions As vaccine hesitancy and refusal ratio were found to be substantially lower than in a previous study for Thailand and other countries, public authorities should poll the public to identify vaccine-hesitant populations and their reasoning and provide appropriate information directly to the general public.","output":"Analysis of Peoples Attitude Toward COVID-19 Vaccine and Its Information Sources in Thailand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate family physicians' job strain during the Covid-19 pandemic and determine the effective factors The study was carried out between 01 May 2020 and 01 June 2020 by applying an online questionnaire to family physicians who worked in primary care in Istanbul and could be reached by telephone application The survey created by us included socio-demographic information and the Job Strain Scale Short Form P value was accepted as 0 05, and SPSS 20 package program was used in statistical analysis 448 Family Physicians participated in the study Anxiety levels of the participants increased after the pandemic (p &lt; 0 001) Job strain score increased significantly during the pandemic process (p &lt; 0 001) The 'Workload' sub-dimension of the job strain score was affected by young age, not having children, thinking that the working hours increased, deterioration of sleep quality and increasing anxiety level It was determined that there was an increase in the \\"Control\\" sub-dimension score of family physicians who thought that they were not provided with adequate protective equipment during the pandemic process and who did not find the use of their own personal protective equipment sufficient 'Social support' sub-dimension mean score decreased during the pandemic period It was determined that it significantly increased in married family physicians compared to single ones In the pandemic process, anxiety, sleep quality deterioration and job strain increased significantly In family physicians, after the pandemic, workload and control sub-dimension changes increased, while social support sub-dimension decreased","output":"Evaluation of Job Strain of Family Physicians in COVID-19 Pandemic Period- An Example from Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antivector immunity has been recognized as a potential caveat of using virus-based vaccines.

The benefit of machine learning, as an essential aspect of artificial intelligence, on past epidemics offers a new line to tackle the novel Coronavirus outbreak. Accurate short-term forecasting of COVID-19 spread plays an essential role in improving the management of the overcrowding problem in hospitals and enables appropriate optimization of the available resources (i.e., materials and staff).This paper presents a comparative study of machine learning methods for COVID-19 transmission forecasting. We investigated the performances of deep learning methods, including the hybrid convolutional neural networks-Long short-term memory (LSTM-CNN), the hybrid gated recurrent unit-convolutional neural networks (GAN-GRU), GAN, CNN, LSTM, and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), as well as baseline machine learning methods, namely logistic regression (LR) and support vector regression (SVR). The employment of hybrid models (i.e., LSTM-CNN and GAN-GRU) is expected to eventually improve the forecasting accuracy of COVID-19 future trends. The performance of the investigated deep learning and machine learning models was tested using confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases time-series data from seven impacted countries: Brazil, France, India, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the US. The results reveal that hybrid deep learning models can efficiently forecast COVID-19 cases. Also, results confirmed the superior performance of deep learning models compared to the two considered baseline machine learning models.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the Small Private Online Course (SPOC) by interns first impressions and satisfaction measures (N=20) on using the SPOC. This study describes the design process of a SPOC from a theoretical and practical perspective and how it has been integrated into a clinical internship in internal medicine. METHODS: The design of the SPOC was based on general theoretical principles that learning should be constructive, contextual, collaborative, and self-regulated, and the self-determination theory to stimulate intrinsic motivation. Interns impressions and level of satisfaction were evaluated with a web-based questionnaire and group interview. RESULTS: Interns thought the web-based learning environment to be a useful and accessible alternative to improve knowledge and skills. Peer learning and web-based collaboration through peer interaction was perceived as less effective, as student feedback was felt inferior to teacher feedback. The interns would prefer more flexibility within the course, which could improve self-regulated learning and autonomy.

Although the traditional risk factors for CHD have been identified, it seems that there are still many CHD cases without these factors. Previous studies have hypothesized that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection was associated with the risk of CHD. OBJECTIVE: The association between H. pylori infection and the risk of CHD was studied using a systematic evaluation and meta-analysis method. METHODS: In order to find relevant studies, four electronic databases were systematically searched until August 2021. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, studies were screened and data were extracted. Under the random-effects or the fixed-effects model, the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were combined. All analyses were conducted using Review Manager software (RevMan 5.4). RESULTS: Among the included studies, 2 studies were analyzed for H. pylori stool antigen test, 2 studies were analyzed for H. pylori histological staining test, 13 studies were analyzed for the anti-CagA test, and 38 studies were analyzed for the anti-H. pylori IgG test. The pooled results revealed that positive anti-H. pylori IgG was significantly associated with an increased risk of CHD (OR, 1.58; 95% CI: 1.34C1.87). Similarly, positive anti-CagA, positive H. pylori stool antigen, and positive H. pylori histological staining were significantly associated with the development of CHD with (OR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.16C1.53), (OR: 3.50, 95% CI: 1.60C7.66), and (OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.12C2.83), respectively.

With ongoing mutations and the emergence of new strains of the virus alongside repeated waves of the pandemic, the full impact of the pandemic is still evolving and remains difficult to predict or evaluate. In paediatric surgery, it has led to significant disruptions in patient care, the extent and consequence of which are not fully documented in Nigeria. Aim: This study aims to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on services, training and research in a busy paediatric surgery unit during the initial 3-month period of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Methods: This study was an ambispective evaluation of the preceding 3 months before lockdown and the initial 3 months of lockdown. Clinic cancellations, elective and emergency surgeries, delays in access, extra cost of care to patients, impact on training and research, and the psychologic impact of the pandemic on staff and guardians were evaluated. Results: During the 3-month lockdown period, an estimated 78 new cases and 637 follow-up cases could not access care. Ninety-seven elective surgeries in 91 patients were postponed. Two (2.2%) patients' symptoms progressed. All emergency patients received care. Out-of-pocket expenditure increased averagely by $124. The pandemic contributed to delays in seeking (13%), reaching (20%) and receiving care (6%). Trainee participation in surgeries was reduced and academic programmes were suspended. Five staff were exposed to the virus and 3 infected. Conclusion: Paediatric surgery has been negatively impacted by COVID-19.

Here, we evaluated the host transcriptional response to infection with murine coronaviruses encoding independent mutations in one of two different viral antagonists, the deubiquitinase (DUB) within nonstructural protein 3 or the endoribonuclease (EndoU) within nonstructural protein 15. We used transcriptomics approaches to compare the scope and kinetics of the host response to the wild-type (WT), DUBmut, and EndoUmut viruses in infected macrophages. We found that the EndoUmut virus activates a focused response that predominantly involves type I interferons and interferon-related genes, whereas the WT and DUBmut viruses more broadly stimulate upregulation of over 2,800 genes, including networks associated with activating the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the proinflammatory response associated with viral pathogenesis. This study highlights the role of viral interferon antagonists in shaping the kinetics and magnitude of the host response during virus infection and demonstrates that inactivating a dominant viral antagonist, the coronavirus endoribonuclease, dramatically alters the host response in macrophages. IMPORTANCE Macrophages are an important cell type during coronavirus infections because they notice the infection and respond by inducing type I interferons, which limits virus replication. In turn, coronaviruses encode proteins that mitigate the cells ability to signal an interferon response. Here, we evaluated the host macrophage response to two independent mutant coronaviruses, one with reduced deubiquitinating activity (DUBmut) and the other containing an inactivated endoribonuclease (EndoUmut). We observed a rapid, robust, and focused response to the EndoUmut virus, which was characterized by enhanced expression of interferon and interferon-related genes. In contrast, wild-type virus and the DUBmut virus elicited a more limited interferon response and ultimately activated over 2,800 genes, including players in the unfolded protein response and proinflammatory pathways associated with progression of significant disease. This study reveals that EndoU activity substantially contributes to the ability of coronaviruses to evade the host innate response and to replicate in macrophages.","output":"Coronavirus Endoribonuclease and Deubiquitinating Interferon Antagonists Differentially Modulate the Host Response during Replication in Macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19, colleges organized online education on a massive scale. To make better use of online education in the post-epidemic era, this paper conducts an online education satisfaction survey with four types of colleges and 129,325 students propose a fuzzy TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) method based on the cloud model to rank the satisfaction of different colleges. Firstly, based on the characteristics of online education during the COVID-19, we build an evaluation indicator system from four dimensions: technology, instructor, learner and environment including, 10 indicators and 94 sub-indicators. Secondly, the cloud model is used to quantitatively describe the natural language and uncertainty in a large amount of assessment information. The cloud model generator is used for sub-indicators and achieves an effective and flexible conversion between linguistic information and quantitative values. The cloud model of indicators are presented by integrating the corresponding sub-indicators. The weights of indicators are determined by the entropy method based on the cloud model and possibility degree matrix, which eliminates the judgment of decision-makers and has great power for handling practical problems with unknown weight information. Finally, a fuzzy TOPSIS method based on the cloud model is proposed to rank the satisfaction of online education of different colleges. The proposed method is compared with other existing methods to shown its merits. The experimental result is consistent with the proportion of students who accept online education in the post-epidemic era. According to the second questionnaire, as the qualitative evaluation of the cloud model of indicators increases, the qualitative evaluation of satisfaction of different types of colleges will also increase.

However, a specific treatment for this viral infection is not currently available. In this study, we discovered that an exchange protein directly activated by cyclic AMP (EPAC) can serve as a potential therapeutic target for RSV. In both lower and upper epithelial cells, treatment with EPAC inhibitor (ESI-09), but not protein kinase A inhibitor (H89), significantly inhibits RSV replication and proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine induction. In addition, RSV-activated transcriptional factors belonging to the NF-B and IRF families are also suppressed by ESI-09. Through isoform-specific gene knockdown, we found that EPAC2, but not EPAC1, plays a dominant role in controlling RSV replication and virus-induced host responses. Experiments using both EPAC2 knockout and EPAC2-specific inhibitor support such roles of EPAC2. Therefore, EPAC2 is a promising therapeutic target to regulate RSV replication and associated inflammation.IMPORTANCE RSV is a serious public health problem, as it is associated with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and asthma exacerbations. Currently no effective treatment or vaccine is available, and many molecular mechanisms regarding RSV-induced lung disease are still significantly unknown.

RESULTS We identified 28,440 patients who underwent pancreatic resection. Patients with tumor size >2 cm were more likely to undergo R1 resections, p < 0.001. Adjuvant therapy improved survival in all patients with median and 5-year survival: adjuvant chemotherapy (21.7 months, 17.45%), chemoradiation (23.3 months, 20.9%) vs no adjuvant therapy (19.5 months, 19.1%), p < 0.001. In the R1 resection cohort survival was also improved with adjuvant therapy with chemoradiation demonstrating the most significant improvement: adjuvant chemotherapy (15.9 months, 6.5%), chemoradiation (18.7 months, 11.2%) vs no adjuvant therapy (12.5 months, 8.7%), p < 0.001.

Decisions about the use of adjuvant endocrine therapy have not been majorly affected, but information on the presence and number of involved lymph nodes can have a significant influence on the use of adjuvant chemotherapy and HER-2 targeted therapies. In addition, lymph node information can also impact decisions around radiation therapy, making multidisciplinary discussions highly relevant when planning therapy. Patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer may be treated with pre-operative endocrine therapy. This strategy was often used in early stage breast cancer during the COVID pandemic due to delays in surgery. Although an effective approach, pre-operative endocrine therapy may impact nodal status at surgery, information which is important when deciding on the use of OncotypeDX testing in premenopausal women. Similarly, in postmenopausal women, the presence and number of lymph nodes involved is a critical factor in determining the appropriateness of OncotypeDx testing. This nodal information may be lost in the setting of pre-operative therapy and would alter decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy. For patients with HER2 positive breast cancer, the presence of nodal disease remains critical for adjuvant decision making. In the situation of small (up to 3 cm) node negative cancers, up front surgery is preferred, because pathologic confirmation of the tumor size and node negative status may make patients eligible for a de-escalated approach of adjuvant paclitaxel and trastuzumab. Patients with more advanced HER2 positive disease are good candidates for preoperative chemotherapy and HER2 targeted therapy. If they have residual disease at surgery, they can be offered trastuzumab emtansine, which was shown in the KATHERINE trial to improve outcomes. In both situations, accurate information about the presence of disease in the axillary lymph nodes determines the most effective treatment approach. Finally, accurate information about nodal status is also relevant to decisions in patients with triple negative breast cancer. Patients who are treated with pre-operative chemotherapy and have residual disease in either the breast or axillary lymph nodes may be offered adjuvant capecitabine, based on the CREATE-X study, which indicated improved survival outcomes in those patients with residual disease who received adjuvant capecitabine. As in HER2 positive breast cancer, the presence of residual disease (including in the lymph nodes) after preoperative therapy will influence the adjuvant therapy recommendation. Thus, when considering de-escalation approaches in axillary management, the impact on systemic therapy decision making must be carefully considered, as these additional adjuvant therapies may improve survival for patients.

This community case study examines recent practice in online music-making in response to COVID-19 restrictions for people with dementia and their supporters, focusing on a UK context. It documents current opportunities for digital music making, and assesses the barriers and facilitators to their delivery and accessibility. Online searches of video streaming sites and social media documented what music activities were available.

Still, alternatives are needed for individuals who are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 and are not protected by vaccination. Monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to be effective as prophylaxis and treatment against COVID-19. However, the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs) challenges the efficacy of antibody therapies. This review describes the neutralization resistance of the clinically-approved monoclonal antibody therapies against the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants. To guide the development of monoclonal antibody therapies and to anticipate on the continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2, we highlight different strategies to broaden the antibody activity by targeting more conserved epitopes and/or simultaneously targeting multiple sites of vulnerability of the virus. This review further describes the contribution of antibody Fc effector functions to optimize the antibody efficacy. In addition, the main route of SARS-CoV-2 antibody administration is currently intravenously and dictates a monthly injection when used as prophylactic. Therefore, we discusses the concept of long-acting antibodies (LAABs) and non-intravenously routes of antibody administration in order to broaden the clinical applicability of antibody therapies.","output":"Optimization of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibody Therapies: Roadmap to Improve Clinical Effectiveness and Implementation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) has launched a consultation on its future use of powers that were granted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"NMC consults on its use of new powers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Uganda, the numbers of new coronavirus disease cases have continued to increase slowly since the first case was confirmed.

The objective of this study was to describe the causes and timing of death in patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We performed a retrospective study in eight ICUs across seven French hospitals. All consecutive adult patients (aged  18 years) admitted to the ICU with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute respiratory failure were included in the analysis. The causes and timing of ICU deaths were reported based on medical records. RESULTS: From March 1, 2020, to April 28, 287 patients were admitted to the ICU for SARS-CoV-2 related acute respiratory failure. Among them, 93 patients died in the ICU (32%). COVID-19-related multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) was the leading cause of death (37%). Secondary infection-related MODS accounted for 26% of ICU deaths, with a majority of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Refractory hypoxemia/pulmonary fibrosis was responsible for death in 19% of the cases. Fatal ischemic events (venous or arterial) occurred in 13% of the cases. The median time from ICU admission to death was 15 days (25thC75th IQR, 7C27 days). COVID-19-related MODS had a median time from ICU admission to death of 14 days (25thC75th IQR: 7C19 days), while only one death had occurred during the first 3 days since ICU admission.

We sought to determine the impact of baseline anemia on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) cessation patterns 2 years after PCI and the subsequent risk of clinical adverse events. METHODS AND RESULTS PARIS (Patterns of Non-Adherence to Dual Anti-Platelet Regimen in Stented Patients) was a prospective multicenter observational registry of PCI-treated patients (n=5018). Anemia was defined as baseline Hb (hemoglobin) <12 g/dL for men and <11 g/dL for women. DAPT cessation modes included physician-recommended discontinuation, temporary interruption (14 days), and disruption due to bleeding or noncompliance. The primary end point was 2-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization. We identified 824 (18%) anemic and 4194 (82%) nonanemic patients. Anemic patients were older and had a higher rate of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and prior PCI. DAPT interruption and disruption were significantly more common in anemic patients throughout 2 years after PCI, whereas physician-recommended discontinuation occurred more often in anemic patients during the first year after PCI and in nonanemic patients during the second year. The 2-year adjusted risks of MACE and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 3 or 5 bleeding events were significantly higher in anemic patients. Compared with uninterrupted DAPT, disruption, but not interruption and physician-recommended discontinuation, was associated with a higher risk of myocardial infarction in nonanemic patients and a higher risk of both myocardial infarction and MACE in anemic patients. There was no significant interaction between anemia and risk of clinical outcomes associated with each DAPT cessation mode. CONCLUSIONS Baseline anemia was associated with a significantly higher adjusted risk of MACE and major bleeding. Physicians more frequently recommend DAPT discontinuation to anemic patients during the first year, and to nonanemic patients during the second year after PCI. DAPT disruption was associated with a higher risk of MACE outcomes.","output":"Influence of Baseline Anemia on Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Cessation and Risk of Adverse Events After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The most frequent cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants is bronchiolitis.

Studying the evolution and transmission patterns in different countries is crucial to enabling implementation of effective strategies for disease control and prevention. In this work, we present the full genome sequence for 17 SARS-CoV-2 isolates corresponding to the earliest sampled cases in Mexico. Global and local phylogenomics, coupled with mutational analysis, consistently revealed that these viral sequences are distributed within 2 known lineages, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineage A/G, containing mostly sequences from North America, and lineage B/S, containing mainly sequences from Europe. Based on the exposure history of the cases and on the phylogenomic analysis, we characterized 14 independent introduction events. Additionally, three cases with no travel history were identified. We found evidence that two of these cases represented local transmission cases occurring in Mexico during mid-March 2020, denoting the earliest events described for the country. Within this local transmission cluster, we also identified an H49Y amino acid change in the Spike protein. This mutation represents a homoplasy occurring independently through time and space and may function as a molecular marker to follow any further spread of these viral variants throughout the country. Our results provide a general picture of the SARS-CoV-2 variants introduced at the beginning of the outbreak in Mexico, setting the foundation for future surveillance efforts.IMPORTANCE Understanding the introduction, spread, and establishment of SARS-CoV-2 within distinct human populations as well as the evolution of the pandemics is crucial to implement effective control strategies.

METHODS: Questions about the perceived impact of COVID-19 were included as part of an evaluation survey of a community-based nutrition program, and assessed cross-sectionally in November-December 2020 among a total of 2960 poor or ultra-poor women. RESULTS: 84C87% of respondents perceived COVID-19 has affected their daily routine in the activities related to diet, work/school, income, social activities and to lesser extent, 78.8% in entertainment activities and 67.9% in health activity. For the current food acquisition and consumption compared to pre-COVID-19 situation, 77.3% reported less grocery shopping, 74.2% decreased activities of eating with someone else, 39.6% reduced consumption of fresh foods, and 23.4% decreased consumption of stable foods. Also, 92.3% of respondents experienced restriction to market access for food acquisition. In light of this, 74.4% of respondents found food assistance to be helpful coping with a negative impact of COVID-19, the highest among other assistances (below 10%).

One of the potential prognostic indicators in patients with COVID-19 is frailty. The degree of frailty could be used to assist both the triage into intensive care, and decisions regarding treatment limitations. Our study sought to determine the interaction of frailty and age in elderly COVID-19 ICU patients. METHODS: A prospective multicentre study of COVID-19 patients  70 years admitted to intensive care in 138 ICUs from 28 countries was conducted. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. Frailty was assessed using the clinical frailty scale. Additionally, comorbidities, management strategies and treatment limitations were recorded. RESULTS: The study included 1346 patients (28% female) with a median age of 75 years (IQR 72C78, range 70C96), 16.3% were older than 80 years, and 21% of the patients were frail. The overall survival at 30 days was 59% (95% CI 56C62), with 66% (63C69) in fit, 53% (47C61) in vulnerable and 41% (35C47) in frail patients (p < 0.001). In frail patients, there was no difference in 30-day survival between different age categories. Frailty was linked to an increased use of treatment limitations and less use of mechanical ventilation. In a model controlling for age, disease severity, sex, treatment limitations and comorbidities, frailty was independently associated with lower survival.

During this week, it seems, \\"everything changed.\\" Not only did the pandemic progress rapidly across the United States, but U.S. residents started to realize that the threat was real: increasing Covid-19 caseloads heightened perceptions of infection risks and excess mortality risks, concerns about the economic implications increased substantially, and behavioral responses became widespread as the pandemic expanded rapidly in the U.S. In early to mid-March 2020, average perceptions about the coronavirus infection risks are broadly consistent with projections about the pandemic, while expectations about dying conditional on infection and expectations about Covid-19-related excess mortality during the next months are possibly too pessimistic. However, some aspects of Covid-19 perceptions are disconcerting from the perspective of implementing and sustaining an effective societal response to the pandemic. For instance, the education gradient in expected infection risks entails the possibility of having different perceptions of the reality of the pandemic between people with and without a college education, potentially resulting in two different levels of behavioral and policy-responses across individuals and regions. Unless addressed by effective health communication that reaches individuals across all social strata, some of the misperceptions about Covid-19 epidemic raise concerns about the ability of the United States to implement and sustain the widespread and harsh policies that are required to curtail the pandemic.

They have high risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: To assess the estimated clinical outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness associated with strategies for COVID-19 management among adults experiencing sheltered homelessness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This decision analytic model used a simulated cohort of 2258 adults residing in homeless shelters in Boston, Massachusetts. Cohort characteristics and costs were adapted from Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program. Disease progression, transmission, and outcomes data were taken from published literature and national databases. Surging, growing, and slowing epidemics (effective reproduction numbers [R(e)], 2.6, 1.3, and 0.9, respectively) were examined. Costs were from a health care sector perspective, and the time horizon was 4 months, from April to August 2020. EXPOSURES: Daily symptom screening with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of individuals with positive symptom screening results, universal PCR testing every 2 weeks, hospital-based COVID-19 care, alternative care sites (ACSs) for mild or moderate COVID-19, and temporary housing were each compared with no intervention. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cumulative infections and hospital-days, costs to the health care sector (US dollars), and cost-effectiveness, as incremental cost per case of COVID-19 prevented. RESULTS: The simulated population of 2258 sheltered homeless adults had a mean (SD) age of 42.6 (9.04) years. Compared with no intervention, daily symptom screening with ACSs for pending tests or confirmed COVID-19 and mild or moderate disease was associated with 37% fewer infections (1954 vs 1239) and 46% lower costs ($6.10 million vs $3.27 million) at an R(e) of 2.6, 75% fewer infections (538 vs 137) and 72% lower costs ($1.46 million vs $0.41 million) at an R(e) of 1.3, and 51% fewer infections (174 vs 85) and 51% lower costs ($0.54 million vs $0.26 million) at an R(e) of 0.9. Adding PCR testing every 2 weeks was associated with a further decrease in infections; incremental cost per case prevented was $1000 at an R(e )of 2.6, $27 000 at an R(e) of 1.3, and $71 000 at an R(e) of 0.9. Temporary housing with PCR every 2 weeks was most effective but substantially more expensive than other options. Compared with no intervention, temporary housing with PCR every 2 weeks was associated with 81% fewer infections (376) and 542% higher costs ($39.12 million) at an R(e) of 2.6, 82% fewer infections (95) and 2568% higher costs ($38.97 million) at an R(e) of 1.3, and 59% fewer infections (71) and 7114% higher costs ($38.94 million) at an R(e) of 0.9. Results were sensitive to cost and sensitivity of PCR and ACS efficacy in preventing transmission.

We use panel regression to understand the drivers of demand during the pandemic and Bayesian inference to simplify the regulation landscape that can help build scenarios for resilient demand planning. We illustrate this resilient demand planning model using a specific example of gas retailing. We find that demand is sensitive to fear of COVID-19: as the number of COVID-19 cases increase over the previous week, the demand for gas decreases -- though this dissipates over time. Further, government regulations restrict access to different services, thereby reducing mobility, which in itself reduces demand.","output":"Consumer Demand Modeling During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Until the etiopathogenic factor(s) of autoimmune and autoinflammatory rheumatic disorders will be identified, their classification into entities will continue.

Although in previous studies, many variables obtained from financial statements - such as financial ratios - have been used as the input to the bankruptcy prediction process, seldom a machine learning method based on computing intelligence has been applied to select the most critical of them. In this research, the data from companies that are were listed in Tehran's Stock Exchange and OTC market during 26 years since 1992 to 2017 has been investigated, with 218 companies selected as the study sample. The ant colony optimization algorithm with k-nearest neighbor has been used to feature the selection and classification of the companies. In this study, the problem of the imbalanced dataset has been solved with the under-sampling technique. The results have shown that variables such as EBIT to total sales, equity ratio, current ratio, cash ratio, and debt ratio are the most effective factors in predicting the health status of companies. The accuracy of final research model is estimated that the bankruptcy prediction ranges between 75.5% to 78.7% for the training and testing sample.","output":"Identification of the Most Critical Factors in Bankruptcy Prediction and Credit Classification of Companies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has imposed a rippling effect on educational institutions globally, substantially impacting nearly 1.6 billion learners in more than 190 countries. Recognizing Taiwan as an atypicality during this crisis for suffering from a relatively moderate mortality/morbidity compared with the rest of the world, the present paper qualitatively explores the pedagogical, technological and social impact of COVID-19 on higher education students in Taiwan. Employing the focus group discussion methodology, we recruited a cohort of 23 students, comprising of 15 local and 8 international students. Findings show diverse pedagogical experiences in students instructional modalities. Trending by either discipline of study, students from Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics disciplines expressed a greater preference for face-to-face instruction compared to their humanities counterparts. Distance learners reported a decrease in study efficacy and a lack of sense of belongingness to their university. All students demonstrated a high sense of perceived safety and reported minimal changes in their socializing norms during the pandemic. In terms of career planning, local students expressed minimal concerns about potential changes in their careers, versus international students who expressed high degrees of uncertainty, fear and pessimism in the same regard.","output":"Qualitative impact assessment of COVID-19 on the pedagogical, technological and social experiences of higher education students in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antigen-specific immunotherapy (ASI) holds great promise for type 1 diabetes (T1D). Preclinical success for this approach has been demonstrated in vivo, however, clinical translation is still pending. Reasons explaining the slow progress to approve ASI are complex and span all stages of research and development, in both academic and industry environments. The basic four hurdles comprise a lack of translatability of pre-clinical research to human trials; an absence of robust prognostic and predictive biomarkers for therapeutic outcome; a need for a clear regulatory path addressing ASI modalities; and the limited acceptance to develop therapies intervening at the pre-symptomatic stages of disease. The core theme to address these challenges is collaborationearly, transparent, and engaged interactions between academic labs, pharmaceutical research and clinical development teams, advocacy groups, and regulatory agencies to drive a fundamental shift in how we think and treat T1D.","output":"Overcoming Obstacles in the Development of Antigen-Specific Immunotherapies for Type 1 Diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised a variety of ethical dilemmas for health care providers. Limited data are available on how a patient's concomitant cancer diagnosis affected ethical concerns raised during the early stages of the pandemic. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all COVID-related ethics consultations registered in a prospectively collected ethics database at a tertiary cancer center between March 14, 2020, and April 28, 2020. Primary and secondary ethical issues, as well as important contextual factors, were identified. RESULTS: Twenty-six clinical ethics consultations were performed on 24 patients with cancer (58.3% male; median age, 65.5 years). The most common primary ethical issues were code status (n = 11), obligation to provide nonbeneficial treatment (n = 3), patient autonomy (n = 3), resource allocation (n = 3), and delivery of care wherein the risk to staff might outweigh the potential benefit to the patient (n = 3). An additional nine consultations raised concerns about staff safety in the context of likely nonbeneficial treatment as a secondary issue. Unique contextual issues identified included concerns about public safety for patients requesting discharge against medical advice (n = 3) and difficulties around decision making, especially with regard to code status because of an inability to reach surrogates (n = 3). CONCLUSION: During the early pandemic, the care of patients with cancer and COVID-19 spurred a number of ethics consultations, which were largely focused on code status. Most cases also raised concerns about staff safety in the context of limited benefit to patients, a highly unusual scenario at our institution that may have been triggered by critical supply shortages.","output":"COVID-19-Related Ethics Consultations at a Cancer Center in New York City: A Content Review of Ethics Consultations During the Early Stages of the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In July 2018, recombinant norovirus GII.Pe-GII.4 Sydney was detected in dogs who had diarrhea in a kennel and in children living on the same premises in Thailand.

Here, we ask who was most likely to do so during the first wave of the pandemic. DESIGN: Quota-sampled cross-sectional and panel data from eight Western democracies (Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States). METHODS: We fielded online public opinion surveys to 26,508 citizens between 19 March and 16 May. The surveys included questions about protective behaviour, perceptions of the pandemic (threat and self-efficacy), as well as broader attitudes towards society (institutional and interpersonal trust). We employ multilevel and fixed-effects regression models to analyse the relationship between these variables. RESULTS: Consistent with prior research on epidemics, perceptions of threat turn out as culturally uniform determinants of both avoidant and preventive forms of protective behaviour. On this basis, authorities could foster compliance by appealing to fear of COVID-19, but there may be normative and practical limits to such a strategy. Instead, we find that another major source of compliance is a sense of self-efficacy. Using individual-level panel data, we find evidence that self-efficacy is amendable to change and exerts an effect on protective behaviour. Furthermore, the effects of fear are small among those who feel efficacious, creating a path to compliance without fear. In contrast, two other major candidates for facilitating compliance from the social sciences, interpersonal trust and institutional trust, have surprisingly little motivational power during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: To address future waves of the pandemic, health authorities should thus focus on facilitating self-efficacy in the public.","output":"Compliance without fear: Individual-level protective behaviour during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To allow a return to a pre-COVID-19 lifestyle, virtually every country has initiated a vaccination program to mitigate severe disease burden and control transmission; over 3.6 billion vaccine doses have been administered as of July 2021. However, it remains to be seen whether herd immunity will be within reach of these programs, especially as more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge. To address this question, we developed a data-driven model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission for Shanghai, China, a population with low prior immunity from natural infection. We found that extending the vaccination program to individuals aged 3C17 years plays a key role to reach herd immunity for the original SARS-CoV-2 lineages. With a vaccine efficacy 74% against infection, vaccine-induced herd immunity would require coverages of 93% or higher. Herd immunity for new variants, such as Alpha or Delta, can only be achieved with more efficacious vaccines and coverages above 80C90%. A continuation of the current pace of vaccination in China would reach 72% coverage by September 2021; although this program would fail to reach herd immunity it would reduce deaths by 95C100% in case of an outbreak. Efforts should be taken to increase populations confidence and willingness to be vaccinated and to guarantee highly efficacious vaccines against more transmissible variants of concern.","output":"Herd immunity induced by COVID-19 vaccination programs to suppress epidemics caused by SARS-CoV-2 wild type and variants in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tularemia is a severe infectious zoonotic disease caused by Francisella tularensis.

In this study, the protective effect of pdpC was evaluated using a monkey lethal model. Two cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) intratracheally challenged with the virulent strain SCHU P9 were euthanized on 7 and 11 days post-challenge after the development of severe clinical signs. The bacterial replication in alveolar macrophages and type II epithelial cells in the lungs would cause severe pneumonia accompanied by necrosis. Conversely, two animals subcutaneously immunized with pdpC survived 3 weeks after SCHU P9 challenge. Though one of the two animals developed mild symptoms of tularemia, bacterial replication was limited in the respiratory organs, which may be due to a high level of humoral and cellular immune responses against F. tularensis. These results suggest that the pdpC mutant would be a safe and promising candidate as a live attenuated tularemia vaccine.","output":"Protective effects of the Francisella tularensis pdpC mutant against its virulent parental strain SCHU P9 in Cynomolgus macaques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Recently, Italy has been heavily hit by COVID-19 pandemic and today it is still one of the most affected countries in the world. The subsequent necessary lockdown decreed by the Italian Government had an outstanding impact on the daily life of the entire population, including that of Italian surgical residents' activity. Our survey aims to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the training programme of Italian surgical residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a 12-item-electronic anonymous questionnaire on SurveyMonkey? web application. The survey was composed of different sections concerning demographic characteristics and impacts of COVID-19 on the concrete participation in clinical, surgical and research activities. Future perspectives of responders after the pandemic were also investigated. RESULTS: Eighty hundred responses were collected, and 756 questionnaires were considered eligible to be included in the study analysis. Almost 35 and 27% of respondents experienced, respectively, complete interruption of surgical and clinical activities. A subgroup analysis, comparing the COVID-19 impact on clinical activities with demographics data, showed a statistically significant difference related to specialties (p = 0.0062) and Italian regions (p < 0.0001). Moreover, 112 residents have been moved to non-surgical units dealing with COVID-19 or, in some case, they voluntarily decided to interrupt their residency programme to support the ongoing emergency. CONCLUSION: Our survey demonstrated that COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the educational programme of Italian surgical residents.

Media accounts of quinine's antiviral effect in vitro, as well as press reports about quinine-based compounds, such as hydroxychloroquine, have sparked renewed public interest in drinking tonic water, which could perhaps result in an increase in allergic phenomena. On the 200th anniversary of the discovery of quinine, our main objective was to analyze hypersensitivity reactions, related to the consumption of beverages containing quinine, described in the literature. Patients and methods: We analyzed case reports indexed on Pubmed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. A quinine causality score was calculated for each of the observations. A quinine assay was performed on several beverages for which the quinine content had not been published. Results: In parallel with related pharmacokinetic studies, these case reports consist of 26 observations. The case reports mainly related to young men, with symptoms of varying severity, mainly dermatological, with fixed drug eruption, generalized rashes, hives; hematological, with thrombocytopenia, hemorrhagic syndrome, thrombotic microangiopathy; more rarely ocular, cardiac or auditory. The level of causality of quinine is certain for three cases, probable for twenty-two, possible for two. The levels of quinine, all conforming to the standards, were lower in the spirits and the cooked wine than those of tonic water. Discussion: Possibly under-diagnosed, the main mechanism of these reactions is immuno-allergic, without any cross-reaction with other quinolines having been shown. In these patients and breastfeeding women of G6PD deficient newborns, any medicines, phytotherapy, homeopathy, or even cosmetics containing quinine, on the basis of a proposed list, should be avoided.","output":"[Tonic water and quinine-a bicentennial booming cocktail]./ Eau tonique et quinine - un cocktail de bicentenaire servi en pleine effervescence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health behavior is influenced by culture and social context. However, there are limited data evaluating the scope of these influences on COVID-19 response. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare handwashing and social distancing practices in different countries and evaluate practice predictors using the health belief model (HBM). METHODS: From April 11 to May 1, 2020, we conducted an online, cross-sectional survey disseminated internationally via social media. Participants were adults aged 18 years or older from four different countries: the United States, Mexico, Hong Kong (China), and Taiwan. Primary outcomes were self-reported handwashing and social distancing practices during COVID-19. Predictors included constructs of the HBM: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, and cues to action. Associations of these constructs with behavioral outcomes were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 71,851 participants, with 3070 from the United States, 3946 from Mexico, 1201 from Hong Kong (China), and 63,634 from Taiwan. Of these countries, respondents from the United States adhered to the most social distancing practices (&#967;23=2169.7, P<.001), while respondents from Taiwan performed the most handwashing (&#967;23=309.8, P<.001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that self-efficacy was a positive predictor for handwashing (odds ratio [OR]United States 1.58, 95% CI 1.21-2.07; ORMexico 1.5, 95% CI 1.21-1.96; ORHong Kong 2.48, 95% CI 1.80-3.44; ORTaiwan 2.30, 95% CI 2.21-2.39) and social distancing practices (ORUnited States 1.77, 95% CI 1.24-2.49; ORMexico 1.77, 95% CI 1.40-2.25; ORHong Kong 3.25, 95% CI 2.32-4.62; ORTaiwan 2.58, 95% CI 2.47-2.68) in all countries. Handwashing was positively associated with perceived susceptibility in Mexico, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, while social distancing was positively associated with perceived severity in the United States, Mexico, and Taiwan. CONCLUSIONS: Social media recruitment strategies can be used to reach a large audience during a pandemic. Self-efficacy was the strongest predictor for handwashing and social distancing.

IBD is considered to be a risk factor for developing osteoporosis; however current literature on this matter is inconsistent. AIM To assess prevalence and development of osteoporosis and low bone mineral density (BMD), and its risk factors, in IBD patients. METHODS Systematic review of population-based studies. Studies were identified by electronic (January 2018) and manual searches (May 2018). Databases searched included EMBASE and PubMed and abstracts from 2014-2018 presented at the United European Gastroenterology Week, the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation congress, and Digestive Disease Week were screened. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they investigated either the prevalence of osteoporosis or osteopenia and/or risk factors for osteoporosis or low BMD in IBD patients. Studies on children under the age of 18 were excluded. Only population-based studies were included. All risk factors for osteoporosis and low BMD investigated in any included article were considered. Study quality and the possibility of bias were analysed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS Twelve studies including 3661 IBD patients and 12789 healthy controls were included. Prevalence of osteoporosis varied between 4%-9% in studies including both CD and UC patients; 2%-9% in studies including UC patients, and 7%-15% in studies including CD patients. Among healthy controls, prevalence of osteoporosis was 3% and 10% in two studies. CD diagnosis, lower body mass index (BMI), and lower body weight were risk factors associated with osteoporosis or low BMD. Findings regarding gender showed inconsistent results. CD patients had an increased risk for osteoporosis or low BMD over time, while UC patients did not. Increased age was associated with decreased BMD, and there was a positive association between weight and BMI and BMD over time. Great heterogeneity was found in the included studies in terms of study methodologies, definitions and the assessment of osteoporosis, and only a small number of population-based studies was available. CONCLUSION This systematic review found a possible increase of prevalence of osteoporosis in CD cohorts when compared to UC and cohorts including both disease types. Lower weight and lower BMI were predictors of osteoporosis or low BMD in IBD patients.

Treatment is complex and evidence for treatment decisions may be absent. Characterising gaps in the research evidence will highlight treatment uncertainties and help prioritise research questions. We systematically identified the evidence gaps for treatment decisions in CF. METHODS We searched for systematic reviews and guidelines on treatment interventions in CF. Two researchers identified eligible reviews with arbitration from a third. Using a structured framework, we extracted and characterised evidence gaps. RESULTS There were 73 reviews and 21 guidelines that met our inclusion criteria. From these, we identified 148 evidence gaps across a range of treatment areas. We found 111 evidence gaps through systematic reviews and a further 37 from guidelines. The reason for an evidence gap could only be reliably characterised for systematic reviews. In most cases, there was more than one explanation-most commonly few or no trials (97/111 evidence gaps). Other important factors leading to evidence gaps were small sample size (49/111), inadequate duration of follow-up (38/111) or intervention (37/111) and factors relating to outcomes (35/111).

However, a recent report of ACE2, the host factor mediating SARS-Cov-2 infection, identifying it as interferon-stimulated raised considerable safety concern. To examine the association between the use and timing of IFN-&#945;2b and clinical outcomes, we analyzed in a retrospective multicenter cohort study of 446 COVID-19 patients in Hubei, China. Regression models estimated that early administration (&#8804;5 days after admission) of IFN-&#945;2b was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in comparison with no admission of IFN-&#945;2b, whereas late administration of IFN-&#945;2b was associated with increased mortality. Among survivors, early IFN-&#945;2b was not associated with hospital discharge or computed tomography (CT) scan improvement, whereas late IFN-&#945;2b was associated with delayed recovery. Additionally, early IFN-&#945;2b and umifenovir alone or together were associated with reduced mortality and accelerated recovery in comparison with treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) alone.

RESULTS: A total of 158 conjunctival swabs were obtained from 49 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. The median duration of illness when the first conjunctival swab was obtained was 10 days (range 2C27 days). Four conjunctival swabs from four different patients (4/49, 8.2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. The Ct values ranged from 32.7 to 37.7 (mean 35.4).

This perception has attracted attention in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) due to their fragile health systems and economies. The objective of this study was to understand how residents in Malawi perceived COVID-19, to determine the factors related to KAP. METHODS: A semi-structured questionnaire was used for the data collection. A field-based survey was conducted among adult residents in Lilongwe, Malawi. Descriptive statistic, linear regression, the Chi-square test, and Pearson's correlation statistics were used for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 580 questionnaires were involved. The mean knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) scores were 10 (SD = 3, range: 3-19), 16 (SD = 4, range: 5-25), and 2 (SD = 1, range: 0-5), respectively. Lack of money and resources (39%) was the biggest challenge for people who practice prevention measures. Among the participants, the radio (70%) and friends/family (56%) were the main sources of information. A higher economic status was associated with better KAP. CONCLUSIONS: A low level of KAP was detected among the population. The people faced challenges regarding a lack of necessary preventive resources and formal information channels.

We collected data for care variables, triage levels, wait times before triage, triage times, and times to first contact with a physician, discharge diagnostic codes, revisits within 72 hours, among other information. We also analyzed demand for timesensitive emergencies. RESULTS: Demand for emergency department care decreased overall by 48.3% (95% CI, 0.48%-0.49%) while the state of emergency was in effect. The decrease was 60.7% (95% CI, 0.60%-0.61%) during phase 0 (lockdown). The decrease was more marked for the lower priority emergencies during lockdown (phase 0), at 60.5% for the lowest (level V) versus 35.1% for the highest priority (level I).

Therefore, androgens, particularly testosterone (T), could be suspected as playing a critical role in driving this excess of risk. However, gonadal function in critically ill men is actually unknown, mainly because serum T concentration is not routinely measured in clinical practice, even more in this clinical context. OBJECTIVE: To overview on possible mechanisms by which serum T levels could affect the progression of COVID\\\\19 in men. METHODS: Authors searched PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Google, and Institutional websites for medical subheading terms and free text words referred to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, COVID\\\\19, testosterone, male hypogonadism, gender immune system, obesity, thrombosis until May 19(th) 2020. RESULTS: T, co\\\\regulating the expression of angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 in host cells, may facilitate SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 internalization. Instead, low serum T levels may predispose to endothelial dysfunction, thrombosis and defective immune response, leading to both impaired viral clearance and systemic inflammation. Obesity, one of the leading causes of severe prognosis in infected patients, is strictly associated with functional hypogonadism, and may consistently strengthen the aforementioned alterations, ultimately predisposing to serious respiratory and systemic consequences. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: T in comparison to estrogen may predispose men to a widespread COVID\\\\19 infection. Low serum levels of T, which should be supposed to characterize the hormonal milieu in seriously ill individuals, may predispose men, especially aged men, to poor prognosis or death. Further studies are needed to confirm these pathophysiological assumptions and to promptly identify adequate therapeutic strategies.","output":"Worse progression of COVID\\\\19 in men: Is Testosterone a key factor?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Canada has been home to a longstanding public health crisis related to opioids, including an extensive mortality and morbidity toll in the face of substantive intervention gaps.

Published systematic reviews include different primary studies, producing varying lists of barriers. To make sense of this diverse body of literature, a comprehensive level of summary and synthesis is necessary. This overview of systematic reviews maps all potential parent-level barriers to childhood vaccination identified in systematic reviews. It synthesises these into a conceptual framework to inform development of a vaccine barriers assessment tool. METHODS: We applied Joanna Briggs methodology, searching the Epistemonikos review database and reference lists of included reviews to June 2020. Systematic reviews of qualitative or quantitative data on parent-level barriers to routine vaccination in preschool-aged children were included. Reviews addressing influenza, reporting non-modifiable determinants or reporting barriers not relevant to parents were excluded. Where possible, we extracted review details, barrier descriptions and the number, setting and design of primary studies. Two authors independently screened search results and inductively coded barrier descriptions. RESULTS: We screened 464 papers, identifying 30 relevant reviews with minimal overlap. Fourteen reviews included qualitative and quantitative primary studies, seven included quantitative and seven included qualitative studies only. Two did not report included study designs. Two-thirds of reviews (n=20; 67%) only included primary studies from high-income countries. We extracted 573 barrier descriptions and inductively coded these into 64 unique barriers in six overarching categories: (1) Access, (2) Clinic or Health System Barriers, (3) Concerns and Beliefs, (4) Health Perceptions and Experiences, (5) Knowledge and Information and (6) Social or Family Influence. CONCLUSIONS: A global overview of systematic reviews of parent-level barriers to childhood vaccine uptake identified 64 barriers to inform development of a new comprehensive survey instrument.

Most existing methods rely on signals from nostrils and require close-up or high-resolution images, while our method only requires the facial region to be captured. Facial region is detected using YOLO v3, an object detection model based on deep learning. The detected facial region is divided into subregions. By calculating the respiratory likelihood of each segmented region using the newly proposed index, called the Respiratory Quality Index, the respiratory region is automatically selected and the RR is estimated.

Most of these recombinant mAbs (23/34) possess RBD binding and virus-neutralizing activities, and recognize ACE2 binding site via the same molecular interface. Our computational analysis, validated by laboratory experiments, revealed that VH3-53 antibodies targeting RBD are commonly present in COVID-19 patients' antibody repertoires, indicating many people have germline-like precursor sequences to rapidly generate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, antigen-specific mAbs can be digitally obtained through antibody repertoire sequencing and computational analysis.","output":"Germline IGHV3-53-encoded RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies are commonly present in the antibody repertoires of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With the rise in human life expectancy, the prevalence of chronic disease has increased significantly. Adopting a healthy lifestyle can decrease the risk of chronic disease. Virtual coaching systems can help older adults adopt a healthy lifestyle. Aim The primary objective of this study was to assess the use, user experience and potential health effects of a conversational agent-based eHealth platform (Council of Coaches) implemented in a real-world setting among older adults. METHODS: An observational cohort study was conducted with older adults aged 55 years or older in the Netherlands. Participants were enrolled for 5C9 weeks during which they had access to Council of Coaches. They completed three questionnaires: pre-test, post-test, and at follow-up. After five weeks, an interview was conducted, and participants chose whether they wanted to use the eHealth intervention for another four weeks during the facultative phase. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 51 older adults (70.6% female) with a mean age of 65.3 years (SD = 7.4). Of these, 94.1% started interacting with Council of Coaches, and most participants interacted once per week. During the facultative phase, 21 participants were still interacting with Council of Coaches. Minimal clinical important differences in quality of life were found among the study population after interacting with Council of Coaches. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that eHealth interventions with virtual coaching can be used among older adults. This may increase quality of life for older adults, and decrease their healthcare needs. Future research into such eHealth interventions should take into account the inclusion of sufficient personalised content and the use of a mixed methods study for assessing the eHealth intervention.","output":"Evaluation of a virtual coaching system eHealth intervention: A mixed methods observational cohort study in the Netherlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report is a case-ascertained study conducted to assess household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Nashville, Tennessee, and Marshfield, Wisconsin from April-September 2020 Index patients were defined as the first household members with COVID-19-compatible symptoms who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result, and who lived with at least one other household member Among all household members, 102 had nasal swabs or saliva specimens in which SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-PCR during the first 7 days of follow-up, for a secondary infection rate of 53% (95% CI = 46-60%) Secondary infection rates based only on nasal swab specimens yielded similar results (47%, 95% CI = 40-54%) Excluding 54 household members who had SARS-CoV-2 detected in specimens taken at enrollment, the secondary infection rate was 35% (95% CI = 28-43%) 40% (41 of 102) of infected household members reported symptoms at the time SARS-CoV-2 was first detected by RT-PCR During 7 days of follow-up, 67% (68 of 102) of infected household members reported symptoms, which began a median of 4 days (IQR = 3-5) after the index patient's illness onset The rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection among household members was 36% (95% CI = 29-43%) and 18% (95% CI = 13-24%), respectively These findings suggest that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within households is high, occurs quickly, and can originate from both children and adults","output":"Transmission of SARS-COV-2 infections in households - Tennessee and Wisconsin, April-September 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During an outbreak of severe pneumonia among new army recruits, an epidemiological investigation combined with repeated nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal cultures from sick and healthy contacts subjects was conducted.

We examined respondents perceptions on how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected FGM/C and CFM in Kenya, Uganda, Senegal, and Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design with a mixed methods approach was used. Data collection on participants perceptions on the effects of COVID-19 on FGM/C and CFM took place between October-December 2020. Household surveys targeting women and men aged 15C49 years in Kenya (n = 312), Uganda (n = 278), Ethiopia (n = 251), and Senegal (n = 208) were conducted. Thirty-eight key informant interviews with programme implementers and policymakers were carried out in Kenya (n = 17), Uganda (n = 9), Ethiopia (n = 8), and Senegal (n = 4). RESULTS: In Kenya, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the increase in both FGM/C and CFM cases. Minimal increase of FGM/C cases was reported in Uganda and a significant increase in CFM cases. In Ethiopia, the COVID-19 pandemic had a limited perceived effect on changes in FGM/C and CFM. In Senegal, there were minimal perceived effects of COVID-19 on the number of FGM/C and CFM cases. The pandemic negatively affected implementation of interventions by the justice and legal system, the health system, and civil societies. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has had varied perceived effects on FGM/C and CFM across the four countries. Generally, the pandemic has negatively affected implementation of interventions by the various sectors that are responsible for preventing and responding to FGM/C and CFM. This calls for innovative approaches in intervening in the various communities to ensure that women and girls at risk of FGM/C and CFM or in need of services are reached during the pandemic.

For the United States to achieve these benchmarks, public health responses must target high-risk populations, such as people who inject drugs (PWID), a group with high rates of HCV incidence and low rates of treatment uptake. Objective To evaluate potential improvements in the HCV care cascade among PWID, focusing on improved testing, treatment uptake, and access to harm reduction. Design, Setting, and Participants This decision analytic model used a differential equation-based dynamic transmission model based on data from New Hampshire, an illustrative state with a large number of PWID and limited HCV treatment infrastructure. Surveillance data through 2020 was used for model parameterization, and the final analysis was conducted in May 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures Model forecasts of chronic HCV cases and advanced-stage HCV outcomes from 2022 to 2045. Results A total of 6 scenarios were tested: (1) the base case, (2) improved harm reduction, (3) improved testing, (4) improved treatment, (5) improved testing and treatment, and (6) improved testing, treatment, and harm reduction. All scenarios with improved testing, treatment uptake, and/or access to harm reduction were associated with decreases in forecasted HCV prevalence and HCV-associated mortality compared with the base case. Improving harm reduction, testing, and treatment individually were forecast to reduce prevalence of HCV in 2045 from 69.7% in the base case to 62.8%, 45.7%, and 35.5%, respectively. Combining treatment and testing improvements was associated with a 2045 prevalence of 0.3%; adding harm reduction improvements was associated with further reductions in prevalence forecasts (to 0.2%), with fewer total treatments (10 960 vs 13 219 from 2022-2045). Conclusions and Relevance In this modeling study, no single intervention was projected to achieve World Health Organization HCV elimination targets. Scenarios with improvements in both testing and treatment were associated with a prevalence of less than 3% by 2030 and achieved elimination targets. Adding improvements in harm reduction was associated with faster reductions in prevalence and fewer treatments.","output":"Modeling Hepatitis C Elimination Among People Who Inject Drugs in New Hampshire."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibody-based interventions against SARS-CoV-2 could limit morbidity, mortality, and possibly disrupt epidemic transmission An anticipated correlate of such countermeasures is the level of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, yet there is no consensus as to which assay should be used for such measurements Using an infectious molecular clone of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that expresses eGFP as a marker of infection, we replaced the glycoprotein gene (G) with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) and developed a high-throughput imaging-based neutralization assay at biosafety level 2 We also developed a focus reduction neutralization test with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 at biosafety level 3 We compared the neutralizing activities of monoclonal and polyclonal antibody preparations, as well as ACE2-Fc soluble decoy protein in both assays and find an exceptionally high degree of concordance The two assays will help define correlates of protection for antibody-based countermeasures including therapeutic antibodies, immune gamma-globulin or plasma preparations, and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 Replication-competent VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 provides a rapid assay for testing inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 mediated entry that can be performed in 7 5 hours under reduced biosafety containment Funding: This study was supported by NIH contracts and grants (75N93019C00062, HHSN272201700060C and R01 AI127828, R37 AI059371 and U01 AI151810) and the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (HR001117S0019) and gifts from Washington University in Saint Louis J B C is supported by a Helen Hay Whitney Foundation postdoctoral fellowship Conflict of Interest: M S D is a consultant for Inbios, Vir Biotechnology, NGM Biopharmaceuticals, and on the Scientific Advisory Board of Moderna D C and H W V are employees of Vir Biotechnology Inc and may hold shares in Vir Biotechnology Inc S P J W and P W R have filed a disclosure with Washington University for the recombinant VSV Ethical Approval: This study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board","output":"Neutralizing Antibody and Soluble ACE2 Inhibition of a Replication-Competent VSV-SARS-CoV-2 and a Clinical Isolate of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently recognized febrile respiratory illness that first appeared in southern China in November 2002, has since spread to several countries, and has resulted in more than 8000 cases and more than 750 deaths.

SETTING: Study setting was the Thailand-Myanmar border regions single largest provider of reproductive health services to displaced mothers. PARTICIPANTS: All women who had a delivery (n=34 240) between 2008 and 2019 at the study clinic were included in the performed retrospective analyses. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Low birth weight was measured as the study outcome to understand the relationship between antenatal care access, family planning service utilisation, demographics and healthy deliveries. RESULTS: First trimester (OR=0.86; 95% CI=0.81 to 0.91) and second trimester (OR=0.86; 95% CI=0.83 to 0.90) antenatal care visits emerged as independent protective factors against low birthweight delivery, as did prior utilisation of family planning services (OR=0.82; 95% CI=0.73 to 0.92).

Propagating along similar networks, e.g., air-transportation, the spreading dynamics of the supply vs. the demand are, however, fundamentally different, with the pathogens driven by contagion dynamics, and the drugs by commodity flow. We show that these different dynamics lead to intrinsically distinct spreading patterns: while viruses spread homogeneously across all destinations, creating a concurrent global demand, commodity flow unavoidably leads to a highly uneven spread, in which selected nodes are rapidly supplied, while the majority remains deprived. Consequently, even under ideal conditions of extreme production and shipping capacities, due to the inherent heterogeneity of network-based commodity flow, efficient mitigation becomes practically unattainable, as homogeneous demand is met by highly heterogeneous supply. Therefore, we propose here a decentralized mitigation strategy, based on local production and dissemination of therapeutics, that, in effect, bypasses the existing distribution networks. Such decentralization is enabled thanks to the recent development of digitizable therapeutics, based on, e.g., short DNA sequences or printable chemical compounds, that can be distributed as digital sequence files and synthesized on location via DNA/3D printing technology. We test our decentralized mitigation under extremely challenging conditions, such as suppressed local production rates or low therapeutic efficacy, and find that thanks to its homogeneous nature, it consistently outperforms the centralized alternative, saving many more lives with significantly less resources.","output":"Digitizable therapeutics for decentralized mitigation of global pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: After the outbreak of COVID-19, many families equip with 75% ethanol to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2, which increases the risk of exposure to ethanol.

However, despite the successes achieved in the study of COVID-19 pathogenesis, many aspects that aggravate the severity of the disease and cause high mortality of patients remain unclear. The main clinical manifestation of the new variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is pneumonia with massive parenchymal lesions of lung tissue, diffuse alveolar damage, thrombotic manifestations, disruption of ventilation-perfusion relationships, etc. However, symptoms in patients hospitalized with COVID pneumonia show a broad diversity: the majority has minimal manifestations, others develop severe respiratory failure complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with rapidly progressing hypoxemia that leads to high mortality. Numerous clinical data publications report that some COVID pneumonia patients without subjective signs of severe respiratory failure (dyspnea, air hunger) have an extremely low saturation level. As a result, there arises a paradoxical condition (called silent hypoxia or even happy hypoxia) contradicting the very basics of physiology, as it essentially represents a severe life-incompatible hypoxemia which lacks respiratory discomfort. All this raises numerous questions among professionals and has already ignited a discussion in scientific publications concerned with the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Respiratory failure is a complex clinical problem, many aspects of which remain controversial.

Cytokine analyses of whole blood revealed increased cytokine expression in the single most severe case. However, most inflammatory gene expression peaked after respiratory function nadir, except expression in the IL1 pathway. Parallel analyses of CD4 and CD8 expression suggested that the pro-inflammatory response may be intertwined with T cell activation that could exacerbate disease or prolong the infection.

METHODS: This is a case-control study looking at the odds of developing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patients treated with OCR versus other disease modifying therapies. From May 13, 2020 through March 1, 2021, patients with a RT-PCR-confirmed infection to SARS-CoV-2 were tested for presence of antibodies and the data was recorded. Outpatients with MS at the Methodist Hospitals Comprehensive MS Center were selected who had a prior infection with COVID-19 as demonstrated by RT-PCR in the electronic health records. Odds ratios were calculated to compare rates of antibody formation with OCR exposure vs other DMT.

A combined strategy incorporating diagnostic scoring systems, such as the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS), and either a quantitative or qualitative microbiological specimen, plus serial measurement of biomarkers, leads to responsible antimicrobial stewardship. The newly proposed ventilator-associated events (VAE) surveillance definition, endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has low sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing VAP and the ability to prevent VAE is uncertain, making it a questionable surrogate for the quality of ICU care. The use of adjunctive aerosolized antibiotic treatment can provide high pulmonary concentrations of the drug and may facilitate shorter durations of therapy for multi-drug-resistant pathogens. A group of preventive strategies grouped as a ventilator bundle can decrease VAP rates, but not to zero, and several recent studies show that there are potential barriers to implementation of these prevention strategies. CONCLUSION: The morbidity and mortality related to VAP remain high and, in the absence of a gold standard test for diagnosis, suspected VAP patients should be started on antibiotics based on recommendations per the 2005 ATS guidelines and knowledge of local antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Using a combination of clinical severity scores, biomarkers, and cultures might help with reducing the duration of therapy and achieving antibiotic de-escalation.","output":"Ventilator-associated pneumonia: present understanding and ongoing debates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectifs Dans le contexte de lpidmie de SARS-CoV-2, les patients prsentant des pathologies relevant de lotoneurologie mdicale ont pu tre dissuads de consulter, sexposant ainsi  un risque de perte de chance.

Social restrictions and distancing shaped in a different way our view of social relationships and behaviours. Like many aspects of daily life, also education has undergone radical changes. Nursing care was strongly affected by the outbreak, not only due to the risks in everyday practice, the heavy workload or the impact on nurses' daily lives outside the healthcare settings, but also because nursing is caring profession and it embeds in its roots the close relationship with the patient, the touch, the patients' body proximity as a way to communicate and to deliver an effective nursing care. All these issues, when brought in nursing education are also a learning opportunity for students and a way to develop their professional identity and to focusing on the nursing role. The COVID-19 outbreak heavily hit the clinical learning environments, as they are healthcare settings. The situation affected students' learning opportunities, since clinical placements were suspended, Universities closed and in-person courses moved into online teaching. While lessons and courses rapidly switched into online teaching, in order to safeguard students' education and faculty's activity, it was not possible to manage the pre-clinical activities, such as simulations and labs, in order to support technical and relational competences. Most of all, it was not possible to arrange the clinical placements due to the uncertainty of the healthcare settings and the social and organizational restrictions to limiting unnecessary accesses to the services, as recommended by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing in 2020.Recently, many authors have explored the issues related to the future of nursing education. In detail, an emerging issue is how it will be possible to educating nurses in a society facing isolation and social distance measures, but at the same time, in a society that needs more and more prepared clinical nurses.","output":"Nursing Education: challenges and perspectives in a COVID-19 age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a massive shift in the focus of healthcare. Such changes could have affected health status and mental health in vulnerable patient groups. We aimed to investigate whether patients with chronic pulmonary and cardiac diseases had experienced high levels of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in healthcare use, health status and psychological distress were investigated among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and congestive heart failure (CHF), using an online nationwide survey. PARTICIPANTS: 680 patients completed the survey. COPD was the most often reported diagnosis 334 (49%), followed by congestive heart failure 219 (32%) and PF 44 (7%). There were 79 (12%) patients with primary diagnosis other than chronic cardiopulmonary disease, who also completed this survey. INTERVENTIONS: Psychological distress was assessed via the DASS-21 score (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale). Moreover, specific worries and anxieties regarding COVID-19 were explored. RESULTS: The frequency of contact with healthcare professionals changed in 52%. Changes in treatment were reported in 52%. Deterioration in health status was self-reported in 39%. Moderate to extremely severe levels of depression, anxiety and stress was observed in 25.8%, 28.5% and 14%, respectively. Over 70% reported specific worries and anxieties, such as about their own health and fear of being alone. Both the deterioration in health status and increased levels of anxiety were significantly (p<0.001, p<0.006) associated with changes in treatment. Exploratory analyses indicated that lack of social support may further increase anxiety. CONCLUSION: Healthcare use changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. It was associated with a decrease in health status, and increased psychological stress among patients with chronic cardiopulmonary disorders. Provision of healthcare should be more sensitive to the mental health needs of these patients during subsequent COVID-19 waves.","output":"Healthcare use during COVID-19 and the effect on psychological distress in patients with chronic cardiopulmonary disorders in the Netherlands: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We apply Return Dispersion Model by calculating CSAD (Cross-sectional standard deviation of return) and State Space Model to identify herding behavior in the period of pandemic (H1N1 and COVID-19) Employing data from TEJ and Data Stream, this paper examines whether the herding behavior is existing in Vietnam and Taiwan stock market, especially during pandemic influenza We compare the differences in herding behavior between frontier and emerging markets by examining different industries across Vietnam and Taiwan stock market approaches The results indicate solid evidence for investor herd configuration in the various industries of Vietnam and Taiwan The herding impact in the industries will be greater than with the aggregate market The different industries respond differently to influenza pandemic panics through uptrend and downtrend demonstrations Up to 12 industries were found to have herding in Vietnam, while Taiwan had only 5 of 17 industries classified Taiwan market, an emerging and herding-level market, has changed due to the impact of changing conditions such as epidemics, but not as strongly as in Vietnam From there, we see that the disease is a factor that, not only creates anxiety from a health perspective, but also causes psychological instability for investors when investing in the market ?

DESIGN: A cross-sectional, nationally representative sample, consisting of three groups: Veteran Israelis, Israeli Arabs and immigrants from the Former Soviet Union. The latter two groups represent underrepresented (minority) populations in Israel. SETTING: Community-dwelling Israelis over the age of 50. PARTICIPANTS: The sample was composed of 1570 participants. MEASUREMENT: To examine the double jeopardy versus the intersectional escape hypothesis, self-perceptions of aging (SPA) and perceived age-based discrimination in the healthcare system were examined as outcome variables. RESULTS: Among Israeli Arabs, being older was related to better SPA, whereas among the immigrants being older was related to worse SPA. As immigrants became older, they were more likely to report ageist experiences. Israeli Arabs reported higher levels of ageist experiences, regardless of their age. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to certain groups that require education about ageism and the aging processes and might require further protection from the experiences of ageism.

In this paper, we show our lab tested solutions in two specific healthcare scenarios. On the one hand, we analyze the case of a medical equipment tracking system for healthcare facilities enabling both real-time location and theft prevention. Worth-noting aspects such as possible EMI interferences, technology selection and management of RFID data from hospital information system are analyzed. Lab testing of system reliability based on passive UHF RFID is provided for this case. On the other hand, we analyze and provide a solution for care and control of patients in a hospital based on passive HF RFID with the result of a fully functional demonstrator.

For many, the condition is temporary and resolves within two to four weeks. However, in a significant minority the symptoms persist. At present, it is not known whether early intervention with any form of treatment (such as medication or olfactory training) can promote recovery and prevent persisting olfactory disturbance. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions that have been used, or proposed, to prevent persisting olfactory dysfunction due to COVID-19 infection. A secondary objective is to keep the evidence up-to-date, using a living systematic review approach. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register; Cochrane ENT Register; CENTRAL; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished studies. The date of the search was 16 December 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials including participants who had symptoms of olfactory disturbance following COVID-19 infection. Individuals who had symptoms for less than four weeks were included in this review. Studies compared any intervention with no treatment or placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were the presence of normal olfactory function, serious adverse effects and change in sense of smell. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of parosmia, change in sense of taste, disease-related quality of life and other adverse effects (including nosebleeds/bloody discharge). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included one study of 100 participants, which compared an intranasal steroid spray to no intervention. Participants in both groups were also advised to undertake olfactory training for the duration of the trial. Data were identified for only two of the prespecified outcomes for this review, and no data were available for the primary outcome of serious adverse effects. Intranasal corticosteroids compared to no intervention (all using olfactory training) Presence of normal olfactory function after three weeks of treatment was self-assessed by the participants, using a visual analogue scale (range 0 to 10, higher scores = better). A score of 10 represented \\"completely normal smell sensation\\". The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of intranasal corticosteroids on self-rated recovery of sense of smell (estimated absolute effect 619 per 1000 compared to 520 per 1000, risk ratio (RR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.68; 1 study; 100 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Change in sense of smell was not reported, but the self-rated score for sense of smell was reported at the endpoint of the study with the same visual analogue scale (after three weeks of treatment). The median scores at endpoint were 10 (interquartile range (IQR) 9 to 10) for the group receiving intranasal corticosteroids, and 10 (IQR 5 to 10) for the group receiving no intervention (1 study; 100 participants; very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is very limited evidence regarding the efficacy of different interventions at preventing persistent olfactory dysfunction following COVID-19 infection. However, we have identified a small number of additional ongoing studies in this area. As this is a living systematic review, the evidence will be updated regularly to incorporate new data from these, and other relevant studies, as they become available. For this (first) version of the living review, we identified a single study of intranasal corticosteroids to include in this review, which provided data for only two of our prespecified outcomes. The evidence was of very low certainty, therefore we were unable to determine whether intranasal corticosteroids may have a beneficial or harmful effect.","output":"Interventions for the prevention of persistent post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Low and Middle-Income Countries are experiencing a fast-paced epidemiological rise in clusters of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, forming an imminent rise in multimorbidity.

Low back pain was the primary cause of disability worldwide out of 156 conditions assessed between 1990 and 2016, according to the Global Burden of Disease Study. Conventional medical approaches have failed to identify effective and long-lasting approaches for the management of chronic pain, and often fail to consider the multiple domains that influence overall health and can contribute to the pain experience. Leading international organizations that focus on pain research have stated the importance of considering these other domains within holistic and multidisciplinary frameworks for treating pain. While the research behind the theoretical link between these domains and chronic pain outcomes has expanded greatly over the last decade, there have been few practical and feasible methods to implement this type of care in normal clinical practice. METHODS The purpose of this manuscript is to describe an implementation protocol that is being used to deliver a complex holistic health intervention at multiple sites within a large government health system, as part of a larger multisite trial for patients with chronic low back pain. The Move to Health program developed by the US Army Medical Command was tailored for specific application to patients with low back pain and begins by providing an empirical link between eight different health domains (that include physical, emotional, social, and psychological constructs) and chronic low back pain. Through a six-step process, a health coach leverages motivational interviewing and information from a personal health inventory to guide the patient through a series of conversations about behavioral lifestyle choices. The patient chooses which domains they want to prioritize, and the health coach helps implement the plan with the use of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-bound) goals and a series of resources for every domain, triaged from self-management to specialist referral. DISCUSSION Complex interventions described in clinical trials are often challenging to implement because they lack sufficient details. Implementation protocols can improve the ability to properly deliver trial interventions into regular clinical practice with increased fidelity. TRIAL REGISTRATION Implementation of this intervention protocol was developed for a clinical trial that was registered a priori (clinicaltrials.gov #NCT04172038).","output":"Move to health-a holistic approach to the management of chronic low back pain: an intervention and implementation protocol developed for a pragmatic clinical trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SESSION TITLE: Medical Students/Residents' COVID-19 SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Report PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been detected in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, blood, feces and ocular fluid(1) To date, there are no reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 isolated in pleural fluid, that is associated with a life-threatening complication, empyema CASE PRESENTATION: He is a 64-year-old male with a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension who presented with a three-day history of progressive shortness of breath and generalized weakness which was preceded by a dry cough for a few weeks He otherwise had no complaints or ill-contacts On presentation, he was noted to be hypoxemic (saturation 93% on 4 liters of oxygen), tachycardic and afebrile Initial exam was significant for mild respiratory distress and bilateral crackles on lung auscultation Labs showed an elevated white blood cell count (11 6 x 10 6 ), troponin, D-dimer, ferritin and C-reactive protein Serum interleukin-6 was elevated at 17 26 pg/mL However, creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, transaminases and quantiferon gold were within normal limits A chest x-ray was done that showed bilateral patchy infiltrates and a follow-up computerized tomography (CT) of the chest showed diffuse ground glass opacity with a large thick-walled septated mass in the left lower thorax He was subsequently admitted for hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia with superimposed bacterial infection complicated by possible empyema Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive Thoracentesis with chest tube placement revealed purulent material with pH of 6 5, that then later also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 Final pleural fluid cultures grew pan sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae Pleural adenosine deaminase was elevated, however acid-fast bacilli cultures were no growth He was treated with empiric antibiotics and the chest tube was removed after adequate drainage of empyema He was discharged on room air to complete a course of oral antibiotics, self-quarantine and to follow-up in the pulmonary clinic after two weeks DISCUSSION: Empyema is defined by the presence of bacteria or pus in the pleural space and is a well-documented sequela of pneumonia with mortality of up to 20%(2) The isolation of SARS-CoV-2 within the pleural fluid with a superimposed bacterial infection highlights the increased risk of self-quarantine and delayed treatment pose to the management of high-risk patients The MuLBSTA score, a 90-day mortality predictor for viral pneumonia, recognizes co-bacterial infection as an additional risk factor for mortality(3) CONCLUSIONS: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in body fluids such as pleural fluid has not yet been reported, nor are the implications known in regard to shedding duration and prognostication Reference #1: Wang W, Xu Y, Gao R, et al Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Different Types of Clinical Specimens JAMA 2020;323(18):1843-1844 doi:10 1001/jama 2020 3786 Reference #2: Morris DE, Cleary DW, Clarke SC Secondary Bacterial Infections Associated with Influenza Pandemics Front Microbiol 2017;8:1041 doi:10 3389/fmicb 2017 01041 Reference #3: Guo L, Wei D, Zhang X, et al Clinical Features Predicting Mortality Risk in Patients With Viral Pneumonia: The MuLBSTA Score Front Microbiol 2019;10 doi:10 3389/fmicb 2019 02752 DISCLOSURES: No relevant relationships by Sahai Donaldson, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Lorenzo Leys, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Vishal Poddar, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Lamiaa Rougui, source=Web Response","output":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Isolation from Pleural Fluid with Covid-19 Pneumonia and Superimposed Empyema"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 19) pandemic, researchers have been trying to investigate several active compounds found in plants that have the potential to inhibit the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). The present study aimed to evaluate bioactive compounds found in plants by using a molecular docking approach to inhibit the Main Protease (Mpro) and Spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. The evaluation was performed on the docking scores calculated using AutoDock Vina as a docking engine. A rule of five (RO5) was calculated to determine whether a compound meets the criteria as an active drug orally in humans. The determination of the docking score was done by selecting the best conformation of the protein-ligand complex that had the highest affinity (most negative Gibbs' free energy of binding / G). As a comparison, nelfinavir (an antiretroviral drug), chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine sulfate (anti-malarial drugs recommended by the FDA as emergency drugs) were used. The results showed that hesperidin, nabiximols, pectolinarin, epigallocatechin gallate, and rhoifolin had better poses than nelfinavir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate as spike glycoprotein inhibitors. Hesperidin, rhoifolin, pectolinarin, and nabiximols had about the same pose as nelfinavir, but were better than chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine sulfate as Mpro inhibitors. These plant compounds have the potential to be developed as specific therapeutic agents against COVID-19.

As of November 2021 there have been three waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Nigeria but there has been only one seroprevalence survey conducted to assess the proportion of a population that have been infected, which was performed in December 2020 after the first wave of infection. To provide an update on seroprevalence in Nigeria, we conducted survey at one urban site (n=400) and one rural site (n=402) in Kaduna State, Nigeria during October and November 2021 following the third wave of infection. Seroprevalence for the urban and rural sites was 42.5% and 53.5% respectively (mean 48.0%). Symptoms associated with seropositivity were identified for each site. The overall seroprevalence among unvaccinated individuals was 45.4%. The data indicates an infection rate in Kaduna State at least 387 times greater than that derived from cases confirmed by PCR. Extrapolating to the whole of Nigeria, it would suggest there has been at least 96.7 million infections (compared to 206,138 confirmed cases at the time of surveillance).

However, the profile of psychiatric symptoms among COVID-19 patients has been understudied. We performed a meta-analysis of studies assessing psychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS patients and survivors by using the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), an instrument covering a wide spectrum of psychiatric symptoms. Studies reporting SCL-90-R subscale scores among patients with and survivors of COVID-19 and SARS were retrieved from major English and Chinese literature databases. Patients' pooled SCL-90-R subscale scores were compared to the Chinese normative SCL-90-R data, and Cohen's d values were calculated to indicate the severity of psychiatric symptoms. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data was used to assess the quality of the included studies. The search yielded 25 Chinese studies with 1675 acute COVID-19 and 964 acute SARS patients, 30 COVID-19 and 552 SARS survivors during very early recovery (up to 1 month since discharge), 291 SARS survivors during early recovery (1-6 months after discharge), and 48 SARS survivors during late recovery (12 months after discharge). None of the included studies were rated as good quality. The ten SCL-90-R-defined psychiatric symptoms, which were of medium-to-severe severity (d = 0.68-3.01), were all exhibited in acute COVID-19 patients, and the severity of these symptoms decreased to mild-to-medium during very early recovery (d = 0.17-0.73). SARS patients presented eight psychiatric symptoms with mild-to-severe severity during the acute stage (d =0.43-1.88), and thereafter, the severity of symptoms decreased over the follow-up period. However, somatization (d = 0.30) and anxiety (d = 0.28) remained at mild levels during late recovery. A wide variety of severe psychiatric symptoms have been reported by acute COVID-19 patients, and these symptoms, despite decreasing in severity, persist in very early recovery. The changing trajectory observed with SARS suggests that psychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 may persist for a long time after discharge, and therefore, periodic monitoring of psychiatric symptoms, psychosocial support, and psychiatric treatment (when necessary) may be necessary for COVID-19 patients from the acute to convalescent stages.","output":"Understanding the psychiatric symptoms of COVID-19: a meta-analysis of studies assessing psychiatric symptoms in Chinese patients with and survivors of COVID-19 and SARS by using the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The effect of post-vaccination adverse events on immunogenicity is unknown.

The aim of the study was to identify and retrospectively review all FK cases diagnosed between August 2012 and December 2020 at a tertiary care hospital in northern Thailand with a specific focus on epidemiologic features, including season, patient sex and age, the spectrum of pathogens, and presence of certain putative virulence factors. Of 1237 patients with corneal ulcers, 294 (23.8%) were confirmed by direct microscopic examination and/or fungal culture. For the positive cases, direct examinations of Calcofluor white (CW) stains and KOH mounts were found in 97.3% (286/294) and 76.5% (225/294), respectively (p < 0.05). Of the cases diagnosed by microscopy and culture, fungi were isolated in 152 (51.7%), with Fusarium spp. being the most frequently identified (n = 69, 45.5%) followed by dematiaceous fungi (n = 45, 29.6%) and Aspergillus spp. (n = 18, 11.8%). The incidence of FK was higher in the rainy season of July to October. The mean age was 54.4  14.4 (SD) years, with a range of 9C88 years. Males (75.8%) were affected significantly more than females (24.2%) (p < 0.05). Of 294 patients, 132 (44.9%) were middle-aged adults (41C60 years) and 107 (36.4%) were older than 60 years. Trauma to the eye by soil or vegetative matter were the most common preceding factors (188/294; 64.0%). We assessed two virulence factors. First, 142 of the 152 culture-positive FK cases were due to molds, indicating that hyphal morphogenesis is extremely important in disease. We also demonstrated that fungal melanization occurs in the molds during the course of FK by applying a melanin-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) that labeled fungal elements in corneal samples of patients, and melanin particles derived from the hyphae were also recovered after treatment of the samples with proteolytic enzymes, denaturant and hot concentrated acid. In summary, we demonstrate that northern Thailand has a high rate of FK that is influenced by season and males engaged in outside activities are at highest risk for disease. Moulds are significantly more commonly responsible for FK, in part due to their capacity to form hyphae and melanins. Future studies will examine models of fungal corneal interactions and assess additional factors of virulence, such as secreted enzymes, to more deeply decipher the pathogenesis of FK.","output":"Fungal Keratitis in Northern Thailand: Spectrum of Agents, Risk Factors and Putative Virulence Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variant 20I/501Y.V1 (VOC-202012/1 or GR/501Y.V1) is concerning given its increased transmissibility.

However, there is limited information on the factors affecting the dynamics of COVID-19, especially in developing countries, including African countries. In this study, we have focused on understanding the association of COVID-19 cases with environmental and socioeconomic factors in Zambia - a sub-Saharan African country. We used Zambia's district-level COVID-19 data, covering 18 March 2020 (i.e., from first reported cases) to 17 July 2020. Geospatial approaches were used to organise, extract and establish the dataset, while a classification tree (CT) technique was employed to analyse the factors associated with the COVID-19 cases. The analyses were conducted in two stages: (1) the binary analysis of occurrences of COVID-19 (i.e., COVID-19 or No COVID-19), and (2) a risk level analysis which grouped the number of cases into four risk levels (high, moderate, low and very low). The results showed that the distribution of COVID-19 cases in Zambia was significantly influenced by the socioeconomic factors compared to environmental factors. More specifically, the binary model showed that distance to the airport, population density and distance to the town centres were the most combination influential factors, while the risk level analysis indicated that areas with high rates of human immunodeficient virus (HIV) infection had relatively high chances of having many COVID-19 cases compared to areas with low HIV rates. The districts that are far from major urban establishments and that experience higher temperatures have lower chances of having COVID-19 cases. This study makes two major contributions towards the understanding of COVID-19 dynamics: (1) the methodology presented here can be effectively applied in other areas to understand the association of environmental and socioeconomic factors with COVID-19 cases, and (2), the findings from this study present the empirical evidence of the relationship between COVID-19 cases and their associated environmental and socioeconomic factors.

Following an outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) in our institution, we sought to systematically analyse characteristics of MDRO outbreaks in times of COVID-19, focussing on contributing factors and specific challenges in controlling these outbreaks. METHODS: We describe results of our own CRAB outbreak investigation and performed a systematic literature review for MDRO (including Candida auris) outbreaks which occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic (between December 2019 and March 2021). Search terms were related to pathogens/resistance mechanisms AND COVID-19. We summarized outbreak characteristics in a narrative synthesis and contrasted contributing factors with implemented control measures. RESULTS: The CRAB outbreak occurred in our intensive care units between September and December 2020 and comprised 10 patients (thereof seven with COVID-19) within two distinct genetic clusters (both ST2 carrying OXA-23). Both clusters presumably originated from COVID-19 patients transferred from the Balkans. Including our outbreak, we identified 17 reports, mostly caused by Candida auris (n = 6) or CRAB (n = 5), with an overall patient mortality of 35% (68/193). All outbreaks involved intensive care settings. Non-adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE) or hand hygiene (n = 11), PPE shortage (n = 8) and high antibiotic use (n = 8) were most commonly reported as contributing factors, followed by environmental contamination (n = 7), prolonged critical illness (n = 7) and lack of trained HCW (n = 7). Implemented measures mainly focussed on PPE/hand hygiene audits (n = 9), environmental cleaning/disinfection (n = 9) and enhanced patient screening (n = 8). Comparing potentially modifiable risk factors and control measures, we found the largest discrepancies in the areas of PPE shortage (risk factor in 8 studies, addressed in 2 studies) and patient overcrowding (risk factor in 5 studies, addressed in 0 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Reported MDRO outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic were most often caused by CRAB (including our outbreak) and C. auris. Inadequate PPE/hand hygiene adherence, PPE shortage, and high antibiotic use were the most commonly reported potentially modifiable factors contributing to the outbreaks.

While this is necessary to combat the worldwide pandemic, it may have trade-offs with respect to publishing research from other disciplines. OBJECTIVES: To assess differences in published research design before and after the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional review of all 322 full-length research studies published between October 1, 2019 and April 30, 2020 in three major medical journals. We compared the number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and studies with a control group before and after January 31, 2020, when Covid-19 began garnering international attention. RESULTS: The number of full-length research studies per issue was not statistically different before and after the Covid-19 pandemic (from 3.7 to 3.5 per issue, p = 0.17). Compared to before January 31, 2020, 0.7 fewer non-Covid-19 studies per issue were published versus after January 31, 2020 (p<0.001), a change that was offset by Covid-19 studies. Among non-Covid-19 studies, 0.9 fewer studies with a control group per issue were published after January 31, 2020, with RCTs contributing to nearly all the decline (p<0.001, p = 0.001, respectively).

These NPs enable the sensitive enrichment of cTnI (<1 ng/mL) with high specificity and reproducibility, while simultaneously depleting highly abundant proteins such as human serum albumin (>1010 more abundant than cTnI). We demonstrate that top-down nanoproteomics can provide high-resolution proteoform-resolved molecular fingerprints of diverse cTnI proteoforms to establish proteoform-pathophysiology relationships. This scalable and reproducible antibody-free strategy can generally enable the proteoform-resolved analysis of low-abundance proteins directly from serum to reveal previously unachievable molecular details.","output":"Nanoproteomics enables proteoform-resolved analysis of low-abundance proteins in human serum."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (FOSCC) may be the best naturally-occurring model of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC can be broadly divided into human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative cancers and HPV-positive cancers where HPV is the causative agent. Previous studies in FOSCC have used both species-specific and species-nonspecific PCR primers that may be insensitive to the detection of PVs and other viruses that may be divergent from known sequences. ViroCap is a targeted capture and next generation sequencing tool that was designed to identify all known vertebrate DNA and RNA viruses. In this study we used a metagenomic approach using ViroCap for DNA viruses in 20 FOSCC, 9 normal feline oral mucosal, and 8 suspected PV positive control samples. We tested the hypothesis that viruses would be enriched in FOSCC compared to normal oral mucosa. The virome of the FOSCC and normal feline oral mucosa consisted of feline foamy virus in 7/20 and 2/9 (35% and 22%), feline torque teno virus in 2/20 and 0/9 (10% and 0%), alphaherpesvirus in 2/10 and 0/9 (10% and 0%), FIV (0% and 22%), Epstein-Barr virus in 1/20 and 0/9 (5% and 0%) and feline papillomavirus in 1/20 and 0/9 samples (5% and 0% respectively). Felis catus papillomavirus-3 was found in 1 of 20 FOSCC samples. A virus was not associated consistently with FOSCC. If PVs have a role in FOSCC it is at most a supplementary or uncommon role. FOSCC appears most closely related to HPV-negative HNSCC.

The research optimised the vaccine distribution policy (VDP) in an explicit form incorporated in an age-stratified SEIR model based on the proposed policy optimisation methodology. The VDP could explain when and how many vaccines to take for each age group. The designed evaluation system consisted of direct policy cost, indirect healthcare cost, and extra financial budget during the pandemic, combined as a weighted sum equalling one to suit flexible scenarios and decision-makers' requirements. A case study with ground truth data in the U.K was implemented, where the optimised VDP could decrease the comprehensive cost and suppress the virus transmission. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated the effect of some critical parameters for optimised VDP. The vaccination priority and policy objectives' weight combination play a significant role in impacting the VDP optimisation.

METHODS This is a systematic review of randomized controlled trials with network meta-analysis (NMA). We searched the following databases until 4 February 2020: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, Web of Science, and four other databases. We included studies with adult people with stroke. We compared any kind of active tDCS (anodal, cathodal, or dual, that is applying anodal and cathodal tDCS concurrently) regarding improvement of our primary outcome of functional communication, versus control, after stroke. PROSPERO ID CRD42019135696. RESULTS We included 25 studies with 471 participants. Our NMA showed that tDCS did not improve our primary outcome, that of functional communication.

In this study, fecal specimens were collected from 10 post-weaned calves, before and after 2 months of fluid therapy, and the samples were used for microbiota analysis. Following recovery, the alpha-diversity profiles (observed operational taxonomic units [OTUs], and Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson indices) changed significantly when compared with those of calves with diarrhea. Beta-diversity analysis exhibited significant differences in gut microbiota compositions between calves with diarrhea and those in the recovered state. The abundances of eight phyla and thirteen genera in feces changed markedly after restoration of BCoV diarrhea. In addition, our correlation study clearly revealed that increased abundances of the genera Caproiciproducens, Pseudoflavonifractor, and Oscillibacter negatively correlated with serum glucose, and phosphorus levels, but positively correlated with serum chloride in calves with diarrhea, whereas increased abundances of the genera Peptostreptococcaceae;Clostridium (Clostridium cluster XI), Intestinibacter, Cellulosilyticum, Ruminococcus, Romboutsia, Paeniclostridium, Clostridiaceae;Clostridium and Turicibacter in recovered calves showed the opposite pattern.

AKI is associated with mortality and morbidity. Interventions focusing on the reduction of AKI are suggested by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline. We hypothesized that these educational interventions would improve outcome in patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). METHODS: This was a pragmatic single-centre prospective observational before-after study design in an ICU in a tertiary referral hospital. All consecutive patients admitted to the ICU irrespective their illness were included. A Save the Kidney (STK) bundle was encouraged via an educational intervention targeting health care providers. The educational STK bundle consisted of optimizing the fluid balance (based on urine output, serum lactate levels and/or central venous oxygen saturation), discontinuation of diuretics, maintaining a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mmHg with the potential use of vasopressors and critical evaluation of the indication and dose of nephrotoxic drugs. The primary outcome was the composite of mortality, renal replacement therapy (RRT), and progression of AKI. Secondary outcomes were the components of the composite outcome the severity of AKI, ICU length of stay and in-hospital mortality. MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome occurred in 451 patients (33%) in the STK group versus 375 patients (29%) in the usual care group, relative risk (RR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03C1.3, p < 0.001. Secondary outcomes were, ICU mortality in 6.8% versus 5.6%, (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.90C1.64, p = 0.068), RRT in 1.6% versus 3.6% (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28C0.76, p = 0.002), and AKI progression in 28% versus 24% (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.04C1.35, p = 0.001).

INTRODUCTION: From December 2019 to the current time, an outbreak of epidemic of COVID-19, characterized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has occurred around the world. It is now clear that SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 receptors, with expression of these receptors correlated with the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality. Polymorphisms in individual patient factors, such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes have been linked with an increase in negative outcomes, although evidence to affirm remains debatable. METHODS: Here, we performed a systematic review, based on guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria, with the aim of assessing whether polymorphisms in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes affect the COVID-19 condition. We extensively searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases, for relevant articles and reports published in English between December 2019 and December 2021.

Ultimately, we identified 10 SNPs and 21 mutations in the ACE2 gene, along with 13 SNPs and 12 variants in the TMPRSS2 gene, which may be associated with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 play vital roles in the onset, development, and prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and have both been strongly associated with vulnerability, intensity, and the clinical result of COVID-19. Overall, these genetic factors may have potential for future development of personalized drugs and vaccines against COVID-19.

METHODS: All patients referred to the emergency departments, RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated. Demographic and clinical data were recorded. Two radiologists (8 and 15 years of experience) reviewed all the X-ray images and evaluated the following findings: interstitial opacities, alveolar opacities (AO), AO associated with consolidation, consolidation and/or pleural effusion. We stratified patients in groups according to the time interval between symptoms onset (cut-off 5 days) and X-ray imaging and according to age (cut-off 60 years old). Computed tomography was performed in case of a discrepancy between clinical symptoms, laboratory and X-ray findings, and/or suspicion of complications. RESULTS: A total of 468 patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Lung lesions primarily manifested as interstitial opacities (71.7%) and AO opacities (60.5%), more frequently bilateral (64.5%) and with a peripheral predominance (62.5%). Patients admitted to the emergency radiology department after 5 days from symptoms onset, more frequently had interstitial and AO opacities, in comparison to those admitted within 5 days, and lung lesions were more frequently bilateral and peripheral. Older patients more frequently presented interstitial and AO opacities in comparison to younger ones. Sixty-eight patients underwent CT that principally showed the presence of ground-glass opacities and consolidations. CONCLUSIONS: The most common X-ray pattern is multifocal and peripheral, associated with interstitial and alveolar opacities. Chest X-ray, compared to CT, can be considered a reliable diagnostic tool, especially in the Emergency setting.","output":"Chest X-ray features of SARS-CoV-2 in the emergency department: a multicenter experience from northern Italian hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Today, the whole world is fighting a public health emergency called COVID-19 caused by a new infectious virus called SARS-CoV2 Any person can catch COVID-19 from an infected person via aerosol droplets when the person coughs, sneezes, or speaks To limit such a transmission, World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended people to wear masks and physically distance themselves by staying at least 1 m (3 feet) away from others As aerosol droplets (by cough or sneeze) land on objects and surfaces around the person such as tables, doorknobs and handrails, and remain active on these surfaces for hours to days, people are advised to use soaps for at least 20 s and alcohol-based sanitizers as well As the public made efforts, clinicians and researchers investigated and found that drugs which were initially used to treat other diseases may work as a treatment option for COVID-19 One of those drugs was Chloroquine and its related derivative called hydroxychloroquine In this review article, we have systematically searched for details of COVID-19 pandemic till May 2020 and assembled few data pertaining to (i) Corona viruses;(ii) SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19 and (iii) How chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine mediates anti-viral effect in both prophylactic and therapeutic setting These data have been acquired mostly from PubMed and websites of WHO and Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) We did a systematic search and found that the properties of chloroquine are very much essential for the COVID-19 scenario We also bring to you some evidence that the anti-lysosomal activity of chloroquine may be increased by botanicals like betulinic acid","output":"Chloroquine: A Potential Drug in the COVID-19 Scenario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wellbeing and Resilience Education engages with the immediate impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the theoretical and applied elements of wellbeing and resilience education.

Fewer than half of adults get a flu shot in the United States in a typical year, and a large minority of Americans say they will not get vaccinated against COVID-19. This resistance to vaccines creates challenges for both public health and the economy. The academic literature needs to consider potential policy solutions that might increase vaccination rates. In this study, we use experimental auctions to estimate how much university students need to be paid in exchange for agreeing to get a flu shot. These were real auctions where winners received compensation to get the flu shot. As found in prior research, the perceived stakes of such auctions incentivize participants to estimate the price at which they would engage in the auctioned behavior C in this instance, receiving a flu shot. We find that 50% require less than $1, and an additional 30% would get vaccinated for a payment of $20 or less. We also use a tobit regression to estimate bids as a function of participants demographic characteristics. If low levels of compensation increase vaccination rates, this has significant public health implications. The government may be able to achieve higher vaccination rates at a relatively low cost, particularly in comparison with the economic harms caused by illness. This study demonstrates that experimental auctions may be useful for estimating how much a larger, more representative sample would need to be paid in exchange for agreeing to receive flu or COVID-19 vaccinations.","output":"Herd immunity at what price?

The multiplexed array incorporates genus, species and strain-specific assays, offering a unique approach for identifying both known and unknown viruses and B. tabaci species. When tested against a large panel of sequence-characterized begomovirus and whitefly samples, the array was shown to be 100% specific to the homologous target. Additionally, the multiplexed array was highly sensitive, efficiently and concurrently determining both virus and whitefly identity from single viruliferous whitefly samples. The detection limit for one assay within the multiplexed array that specifically detects Tomato yellow leaf curl virus-Israel (TYLCV-IL) was quantified as 200fg of TYLCV-IL DNA, directly equivalent to that of TYLCV-specific qPCR.

We developed a new treatment model based on the online-to-offline (O2O) model for the home isolated patients, because in the early stages the medical staff were insufficient to cope with so many patients. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective study, we enrolled 48 confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients who underwent home isolation in Wuhan between January 6 and January 31, 2020. By WeChat and online document editing all patients were treated with medical observation scale. The clinical indications such as Fever, Muscle soreness, Dyspnea and Lack of strength were collected with this system led by medical staff in management, medicine, nursing, rehabilitation and psychology. Findings The mean(SD) age of 48 patients was 39.08(13.88) years, 35(72.9%) were women. Compared with non-hospitalized patients, inpatients were older(8805;70years, 2.4% vs 33.3%, P<0.04). All inpatients had fever, 50% inpatients had coughs and showed infiltration in both lungs at the time of diagnosis. 33.3% inpatients exhibited negative changes in their CT results at initial diagnosis. The body temperature of non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms returned to normal by day 4-5. While dyspnea peaked on day 6 for non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms, it persisted in hospitalized patients and exacerbated over time. The lack of strength and muscle soreness were both back to normal by day 4 for non-hospitalized patients. Interpretation Monitoring the trends of symptoms is more important for identifying severe cases. Excessive laboratory data and physical examination are not necessary for the evaluation of patients with mild symptoms. The system we developed is the first to convert the subjective symptoms of patients into objective scores. This type of O2O, subjective-to-objective strategy may be used in regions with similar highly infectious diseases to minimize the possibility of infection among medical staff.","output":"Evaluation of the clinical characteristics of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 during home care with isolation: A new retrospective analysis based on O2O"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In this study, five SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay panels were evaluated against the accumulated genetic variability of the virus to assess the effect on sensitivity of the individual assays.

To assure high quality of skills, it is important to be able to measure and assess these skills. For that, it is necessary to determine aspects that indicate the difference between performances at various levels of proficiency. Measurement and assessment of skills in MIS are best done in an automatic and objective way. The goal of this study was to investigate a set of nine motion-related metrics for their relevance to assess psychomotor skills in MIS during the performance of a labyrinth task. METHODS Thirty-two surgeons and medical students were divided into three groups according to their level of experience in MIS; experts (>500 MIS procedures), intermediates (31-500 MIS), and novices (no experience in MIS). The participants performed the labyrinth task in the D-box Basic simulator (D-Box Medical, Lier, Norway). The task required bimanual maneuvering and threading a needle through a labyrinth of 10 holes. Nine motion-related metrics were used to assess the MIS skills of each participant. RESULTS Experts (n = 7) and intermediates (n = 14) performed significantly better than the novices (n = 11) in terms of time and parameters measuring the amount of instrument movement. The experts had significantly better bimanual dexterity, which indicated that they made more simultaneous movements of the two instruments compared to the intermediates and novices. The experts also performed the task with a shorter instrument path length with the nondominant hand than the intermediates. CONCLUSIONS The surgeon's performance in MIS can be distinguished from a novice by metrics such as time and path length. An experienced surgeon in MIS can be differentiated from a less experienced one by the higher ability to control the instrument in the nondominant hand and the higher degree of simultaneous (coordinated) movements of the two instruments.","output":"A study of psychomotor skills in minimally invasive surgery: what differentiates expert and nonexpert performance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aims to analyze home confinement impact on individuals with neurocognitive disorders (NCD) through informal caregiver's perspective and examine how it has affected caregiving burden.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of low FODMAPs diet with vs. without gluten on clinical symptoms in IBS patients. METHODS In this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial, forty nine IBS patients were randomly assigned to placebo and/or intervention group. Patients in the intervention group received 5 gr/day of gluten powder with low FODMAP diet, while placebo group received 5 gr of rice flour as placebo, with low FODMAP diet. Quality of life (QoL) and IBS-SSS (symptom severity score) were measured before and after the intervention using a valid QoL questionnaire and a standard visual analog scale, respectively. RESULTS Significant improvements were observed in total scores of IBS-SSS (-32% vs. - 49%), abdominal pain intensity (-45% vs. -52%), and frequency (-26 vs. -46%), abdominal distension (-29% vs. -63%), Interference with community function (-14% vs. -45%) and quality of life (+23 vs. +32%) in both gluten and placebo groups respectively (P < 0.05).

Sociodemographic and clinical data were extracted from medical records and full SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs were analysed. Older age was significantly associated with COVID-19-associated hospital admission and mortality. Overweight/obese or diabetic patients were 3-4 times more likely to be admitted to hospital and intensive care unit (ICU). Sequencing data showed multiple independent viral introductions into the UAE from Europe, Iran and Asia (29 January-18 March), and these early strains seeded significant clustering consistent with almost exclusive community-based transmission between April and June 2020. Majority of sequenced strains (N = 60, 52%) were from the European cluster consistent with the higher infectivity rates associated with the D614G mutation carried by most strains in this cluster. A total of 986 mutations were identified in 115 genomes, 272 were unique (majority were missense, n = 134) and 20/272 mutations were novel.

In this study, we investigated whether the enzyme is involved in the regulation of the STING pathway, which is the main signaling activated in the presence of both self- and pathogen DNA in the cytoplasm, leading to type I IFN (IFN I) production. In this study, we demonstrated that TG2 negatively regulates STING signaling by impairing IRF3 phosphorylation in bone marrow-derived macrophages, isolated from wild-type and TG2 knockout mice. In the absence of TG2, we found an increase in the IFN- production and in the downstream JAK/STAT pathway activation. Interestingly, proteomic analysis revealed that TG2 interacts with TBK1, affecting its interactome composition. Indeed, TG2 ablation facilitates the TBK1-IRF3 interaction, thus indicating that the enzyme plays a negative regulatory effect on IRF3 recruitment in the STING/TBK1 complex. In keeping with these findings, we observed an increase in the IFN production in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from COVID-19-positive dead patients paralleled by a dramatic decrease of the TG2 expression in the lung pneumocytes. Taken together, these results suggest that TG2 plays a negative regulation on the IFN- production associated with the innate immunity response to the cytosolic presence of both self- and pathogen DNA.","output":"Transglutaminase 2 Regulates Innate Immunity by Modulating the STING/TBK1/IRF3 Axis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are many drivers to intensify the manufacturing of vaccines.

Concurrently, there has been great interest in the application of new understandings and technology to the intensification of biopharmaceutical processes in general.

In our semi-analytical model, we identified two distinct tipping points between controlled and uncontrolled spreading: one, at which the behavior-driven reproduction number of the hidden infections becomes too large to be compensated by the available TTI capabilities, and one at which the number of new infections starts to exceed the tracing capacity, causing a self-accelerating spread.

Methods The MANTICO trial is a non-inferiority randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical efficacy of bamlanivimab/etesevimab, casirivimab/imdevimab, and sotrovimab in outpatients aged 50 or older with early COVID-19. As the patient enrolment was interrupted for possible futility after the onset of the Omicron wave, the analysis was performed according to the SARS-CoV-2 VOC. The primary outcome was COVID-19 progression (hospitalisation, need of supplemental oxygen therapy, or death through day 14). Secondary outcomes included the time to symptom resolution, assessed using the product-limit method. Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazard model were used to assess the association with predictors. Log rank test was used to compare survival functions. Results Overall, 319 patients were included. Among 141 patients infected with Delta, no disease progression was recorded and the time to symptom resolution did not differ significantly between treatment groups (Log-rank Chi-square 0.22, p 0.895). Among 170 patients infected with Omicron (80.6% BA.1, 19.4% BA.1.1), two disease progressions were recorded in the bamlanivimab/etesevimab group and the median time to symptom resolution was 5 days shorter in the sotrovimab group compared to bamlanivimab/etesevimab and casirivimab/imdevimab (HR 0.526 and HR 0.451, 95% CI 0.359 - 0.77 and 95% CI 0.303 - 0.669, p 0.001 and 0.0001, respectively). Conclusions These results confirm the in-vitro data of superiority of sotrovimab versus casirivimab/imdevimab and bamlanivimab/etesivamab in reducing the time to recovery in patients infected with Omicron BA.1 and BA.1.1, while no difference was detected in Delta infections.

Published data is lacking regarding the safety and efficacy of pulmonary vessel ligation using ultrasonic shears. We describe a single-surgeon experience employing ultrasonic shears for the ligation of pulmonary vasculature during lobectomy and segmentectomy, primarily in the setting of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) resection. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted for all patients, who underwent anatomic resection, between 2008 and 2014. Charts were divided into 2 groups based on method of ligation (energy based or conventional). Dictated operative reports were reviewed and patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and complications were recorded. RESULTS Ultrasonic shears were used for pulmonary vessel ligation (5 to 6 mm) in 82 of 283 anatomic resections. A total of 118 vessels were ligated with ultrasonic shears. The majority of patients (83%) in the energy-based ligation group underwent VATS resection. There were fewer complications in the energy-based ligation group (26% vs 38%; p = 0.05); however, rates of intraoperative transfusion, prolonged air leak, empyema, and return to the operating room were similar across the 2 groups, and no statistically significant difference was found. There were no postoperative complications directly attributable to ultrasonic vessel ligation. CONCLUSIONS Energy-based ligation of small-diameter pulmonary vessels is a safe and useful adjunct in anatomic VATS resection and a viable alternative to mechanical stapling. Its narrow profile and thin blades make it ideal for ligation of pulmonary vasculature, particularly where the size and necessary clearance of mechanical staplers prohibit safe dissection.","output":"Energy-Based Ligation of Pulmonary Vessels: A Six-Year Experience With Ultrasonic Shears in Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Lobectomy and Segmentectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the literature on infectious disease outbreaks has examined the extent to which communication inequalities during public health emergencies exacerbate negative outcomes among disadvantaged individuals, the implications of ethnic media consumption among minority groups during these crises are underexplored.

We aimed at performing a situation analysis to identify challenges that Mexico's peritoneal dialysis centers (PDCs) have faced before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. From MayCAugust 2021, we conducted a cross-sectional nationwide online survey with the heads of 136 PDCs at the Mexican Institute of Social Security. The survey gathered information about PDCs characteristics and the adaptations and challenges they faced before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The response rate to the survey was 79.5% (136 out of 171 PDCs). We used descriptive statistics to analyze the data. Results. The survey responses suggest wide variations between PDCs regarding their number of patients, healthcare staff availability, and compliance with the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis recommendations. In the pre-pandemic period, PDCs faced staff shortages (71.3%); scarcity of supplies (39.0%); catheter dysfunctions (29.4%); poor patient adherence to peritoneal dialysis (PD) (28.6%); and lack of patient support networks (25.7%). During the pandemic, PDCs faced emergent challenges, such as losing designated PDC areas within hospitals (61.0%), and staff and supply shortages (60.2%, 41.1%, respectively) because of a reallocation of human and physical resources towards the COVID-19 response. The pandemic prompted 86.7% of PDCs to implement preventive public health measures (89%), delay non-urgent consultations and procedures (63.6%), and introduce telemedicine (37.3%). Additionally, fewer patients visited PDCs because of their fear of COVID-19 contagion (36.0%). Conclusions.

Data were collected from 321 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at two affiliate hospitals between Jan 1 and July 31, 2020. Patients were identified as having MetS by meeting three of the five standard criteria on hospital admission. Among 321 patients (median age 67 years), 50.3% were female, and 48% had MetS. MetS patients had a higher prevalence of diabetes (64 vs. 9%), hypertension (64 vs. 30%), hyperlipidemia (57 vs. 22%), CAD (26 vs. 13%) and CKD (32 vs. 16%), P<0.001.

We believe that a rigorous clinical and societal response can only be mounted by using intelligence derived from a variety of data sources to better utilize scarce healthcare resources, provide personalized patient management plans, inform policy, and expedite clinical trials. In this paper, we introduce five of the most important challenges in responding to COVID-19 and show how each of them can be addressed by recent developments in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). We argue that the integration of these techniques into local, national, and international healthcare systems will save lives, and propose specific methods by which implementation can happen swiftly and efficiently.

Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, preventive measures to limit airborne infection have been introduced, with people, especially older adults, advised to stay at home, thus increasing sedentary lifestyle and the risk of chronic diseases. As one of the few possible ways to stay active is home-based training, this review aims to provide evidence on alternative and feasible home-based activity programs as a tool to improve the fitness level in older adults, especially when preventive measures are needed to ensure isolation and limit interpersonal contacts. During quarantine, older adults, especially those with chronic diseases, are recommended to regularly exercise. Combined balance and muscle-strengthening training has proven to be particularly useful in limiting falls and mobility limitations. In addition, the use of virtual reality systems seems to be a potential strategy in remaining physically active, reducing physical inactivity time and significantly increasing the compliance of the older adults with physical activity programs. In conclusion, home-based programs induce improvements in physical functions in general and quality of life in older people with or without co-morbidities, and it can be considered in the future as one of the feasible and economic ways to increase physical well-being.

Significant and sustained efforts have focused on mobilization of personal protective equipment, intensive care beds, and medical equipment, while substantially less attention has focused on preserving the psychological health of the medical workforce tasked with addressing the challenges of the pandemic. And yet, similar to battlefield conditions, health care workers are being confronted with ongoing uncertainty about resources, capacities, and risks; as well as exposure to suffering, death, and threats to their own safety. These conditions are engendering high levels of fear and anxiety in the short term, and place individuals at risk for persistent stress exposure syndromes, subclinical mental health symptoms, and professional burnout in the long term. Given the potentially wide-ranging mental health impact of COVID-19, protecting health care workers from adverse psychological effects of the pandemic is critical. Therefore, we present an overview of the potential psychological stress responses to the COVID-19 crisis in medical providers and describe preemptive resilience-promoting strategies at the organizational and personal level. We then describe a rapidly deployable Psychological Resilience Intervention founded on a peer support model (Battle Buddies) developed by the United States Army. This intervention-the product of a multidisciplinary collaboration between the Departments of Anesthesiology and Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences at the University of Minnesota Medical Center-also incorporates evidence-informed \\"stress inoculation\\" methods developed for managing psychological stress exposure in providers deployed to disasters. Our multilevel, resource-efficient, and scalable approach places 2 key tools directly in the hands of providers: (1) a peer support Battle Buddy; and (2) a designated mental health consultant who can facilitate training in stress inoculation methods, provide additional support, or coordinate referral for external professional consultation. In parallel, we have instituted a voluntary research data-collection component that will enable us to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness while also identifying the most salient resilience factors for future iterations. It is our hope that these elements will provide guidance to other organizations seeking to protect the well-being of their medical workforce during the pandemic. Given the remarkable adaptability of human beings, we believe that, by promoting resilience, our diverse health care workforce can emerge from this monumental challenge with new skills, closer relationships, and greater confidence in the power of community.","output":"Battle Buddies: Rapid Deployment of a Psychological Resilience Intervention for Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 epidemic has had an extreme impact on society. This study aimed to discuss this epidemic in the U.S. and explore the association between COVID-19 daily incidence rate and influencing factors including peoples implementation of states quarantine policy and environmental factors including temperature, humidity and so on. Methods: . Data of 50 states in U.S. were used as the research subjects. A panel data model was established based on the daily incidence rate and influencing factors from 15 March to 30 September, 2020. The period was analyzed both unsegmented and segmented. The k-means clustering method was used to cluster the states, and panel linear regression method was used for correlation analysis. Results: . The characteristics of the daily incidence rate and factors of the three categories were different after clustering. The daily residents at home, proportion of travel people, humidity and incidence rate were negatively correlated, while the daily temperature and incidence rate were positively correlated after unsegmented multivariate analysis. While after segmented analysis, the air pressure and the temperature showed a trend that was negatively correlated with the daily incidence rate respectively in the first and the fifth segment, other indicators showed the analogous results. At the same time, this study also completed the regression analysis after classification of the three groups. Compared with results without classification, there was a decrease of the number of significant independent variables. Conclusions: . The spread of COVID-19 in 50 states in U.S. was related to quarantine measures, temperature and humidity. The progress of the epidemic would be relatively slow if people chose to stay at home. Besides, the increase in temperature (84.2H) could be conducive to the spread of the epidemic, while the increase in relative humidity (40~70%) might inhibit the spread of the virus to a certain degree.","output":"A Panel Regression Analysis for the COVID-19 Epidemic in the United States: From the Quarantine Policy and Environmental Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid 19 and the increasing risk of trade wars are putting established supply chains under pressure One consequence is that new suppliers may have to be found at very short notice Following this, it would be helpful if certifications that international suppliers claim to have, could be checked quickly At this point, blockchain technology could be very helpful On that base the managers at NETZSCH Pumpen & Systeme GmbH have scientifically investigated possible applications for the use of blockchain technology in the areas of supply chain and purchasing ? 2020, G I T O Verlag All rights reserved","output":"Potential of blockchain technology for supply chain and purchasing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During this coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, it became apparent the different approaches lowand middle-income countries have taken to engage in both preventative and responsive measures.

Although the function of circRNAs has been a heavily researched topic, their role in CV-A16 infection is still unclear. In this study, the viral effects of CV-A16 on the cellular circRNA transcriptome were investigated using next-generation sequencing technology. The results showed that a total of 8726, 8611, and 6826 circRNAs were identified at 0, 12, and 24 h postinfection, respectively. Moreover, it was found that 1769 and 1192 circRNAs were differentially expressed in at 12 and 24 h postinfection, respectively. The common differentially expressed circRNAs were used for functional annotation analysis, and it was found that the parent genes of differentially expressed circRNAs might be associated with the viral infection process, especially the Immune system process in GO analysis and the Inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway in KEGG analysis. Subsequently, circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks were constructed, and the hsa_circ_0004447/hsa-miR-942-5p/MMP2, hsa_circ_0078617/hsa-miR-6780b-5p/MMP2 and hsa_circ_0078617/hsa-miR-5196-5p/MMP2 regulatory axes were identified by enrichment analysis as important networks during the progression of CV-A16 infection.

METHODS: A convenience sample of N = 123 participants (age: M = 23.96 years; SD = 5.82; 80% women) received a brief intervention (key behavior change techniques: information about health consequences of hand washing; action planning) and responded to daily diaries and questionnaires up to a 100-day follow-up. Two-level models were used to analyze data of n = 89 participants who provided longitudinal data. RESULTS: Hand washing and self-monitoring increased, whereas intention and self-efficacy decreased over time.

Secondly, older generations have a more positive attitude and are more committed to organic food. Younger generations' attitude toward game meat is more negative whereas older generations attach more importance to it because of its nutritional and medicinal values.

We assessed control by signal dimensions in Conflicting trials, in which the dimensions signaled conflicting outcomes. Unlike our previous experiment, signals remained present during terminal links. During initial links, preference favored the signaled key in Signaled trials, and the key signaled by the dimension exerting stronger control in Conflicting trials, suggesting strong signal control. Initial-link choice also depended on trial outcomes; preference was overall biased towards the smaller-sooner key. Terminal-link responding was primarily controlled by the key peck producing terminal-link entry, although some weak signal control was also evident. Thus, signal control during initial and terminal links was enhanced, and control by key-peck location during terminal links persisted, when signals remained present during terminal links. This suggests that our previous findings were partly related to temporal separation between signals and trial outcomes, and to history effects producing strong control by key-peck location.","output":"Bringing the Past into the Present: Control by Exteroceptive Stimuli and Key-Peck Location in a Concurrent-Chains Procedure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

In this study, bacteriostatic active substance from Camellia oleifera meal, which is a major by-product of the Camellia oil processing industry, were extracted with continuous phase change extraction (CPCE) method and separated by HSCCC. Compared with traditional extraction methods, CPCE possessed higher extraction efficiency. Two main substances were separated and purified (above 90.0%). The structure of them were further identified by UV, LCCESICMSCMS, 1H-NMR, and 13C-NMR as flavonoids F2 kaempferol 3-O-[-d-glucopyranosyl-(1  2)--l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1  6)]--d-glucopyranoside and J2 kaempferol 3-O-[-d-xylopyranosyl-(1  2)--l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1  6)]--d-glucopyranoside for the first time in C.

Here, we verified the validity of a selective recall method, which is easy for users to answer and analyze. PATIENTS AND METHODS Japanese men and women aged 20-44 years (n = 16) and 45-64 years (n = 16) participated over three working days and one non-working day. The day following each of the surveyed days, participants collected their first morning urine for urinalysis and completed a selective recall and descriptive dietary record questionnaire. RESULTS The two methods of determining water intake were positively correlated (r = 0.94, p < 0.0001). Water intake volumes from non-alcoholic beverages (r = 0.94, p < 0.0001), alcoholic beverages (r = 1.00, p < 0.0001), and food (r = 0.72, p < 0.0001), calculated using the two methods, exhibited strong correlation. No correlation was observed between urinalysis parameters and total water intake.

As many viral infections are associated with neuropathy, the aim of the study is to characterize the incidence and severity of neuropathic pain in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A cohort study will be conducted in adult (18 years) patients who were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at Washington University/Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Participants who are deceased, with incomplete test results, or who cannot be contacted will be excluded. Approximately 1320 participants will be recruited in a 1:2 ratio of those with a positive-to-negative SARS-CoV-2 test result. Each participant will be invited to complete a survey to assess their symptoms related to neuropathy, 30 to 90 days after their initial SARS-CoV-2 test. Survey responses, demographics, and clinical data from the electronic health record will be used for analysis. The primary outcome is the incidence of new symptoms of neuropathic pain. The self-reported DN4 and Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory questionnaires (Appendix 1, http://links.lww.com/PR9/A103) will be used for neuropathic pain screening and severity assessment, respectively. Exploratory analyses will be performed to investigate other potential clinical endpoints and trends. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Similar to previous coronavirus infections, an increased incidence of new-onset neuropathic pain after COVID-19 disease is expected, along with an increase in the severity experienced by patients with COVID-19 with pre-existing chronic pain. Comprehensive understanding of how COVID-19 affects the nervous system can provide a better framework for managing pain in this disease.","output":"Cohort study protocol to characterize the incidence and severity of neuropathic pain in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ACE2 is not only an enzyme that counters the effects of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) but is also the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the virus of the Covid-19 pandemic.

However, some studies have shown protection by these drugs in lower tract respiratory infections and ARDS. The actual consensus is to continue the treatment with RAAS inhibitors, abrupt withdrawal, especially in patients with cardiac or renal conditions, being hazardous in terms of cardiovascular outcomes, except in patients hospitalized in intensive care with hemodynamic instability.

Sympathetic control of ventricular function occurs through extrinsic innervation arising from the stellate ganglia and thoracic sympathetic chain. In the healthy heart, sympathetic release of norepinephrine (NE) results in positive modulation of chronotropy, inotropy, and dromotropy, significantly increasing cardiac output. However, in the setting of myocardial infarction or injury, sympathetic activation persists, contributing to heart failure and increasing the risk of arrhythmias, including sudden cardiac death. Methodologies for detection of norepinephrine in cardiac tissue are limited. Present techniques rely on microdialysis for analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED), radioimmunoassay, or other immunoassays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Although significant information about the release and action of norepinephrine has been obtained with these methodologies, they are limited in temporal resolution, require large sample volumes, and provide results with a significant delay after sample collection (hours to weeks). In this study, we report a novel approach for measurement of interstitial cardiac norepinephrine, using minimally invasive, electrode-based, fast-scanning cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) applied in a beating porcine heart. The first multispatial and high temporal resolution, multichannel measurements of NE release in vivo are provided. Our data demonstrate rapid changes in interstitial NE profiles with regional differences in response to coronary ischemia, sympathetic nerve stimulation, and alterations in preload/afterload. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Pharmacological, electrical, or surgical regulation of sympathetic neuronal control can be used to modulate cardiac function and treat arrhythmias. However, present methods for monitoring sympathetic release of norepinephrine in the heart are limited in spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we provide for the first time a methodology and demonstration of practice and rapid measures of individualized regional autonomic neurotransmitter levels in a beating heart.

While it is known that uncontrolled HIV infection is a major risk factor for the development of TB, the effect of underlying LTBI on HIV disease progression is less well characterized, in part because longitudinal data are lacking. We sorted all participants of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) with at least 1 documented MTB test into one of the 3 groups: MTB uninfected, LTBI, or active TB. To detect differences in the HIV set point viral load (SPVL), linear regression was used; the frequency of the most common opportunistic infections (OIs) in the SHCS between MTB uninfected patients, patients with LTBI, and patients with active TB were compared using logistic regression and time-to-event analyses. In adjusted models, we corrected for baseline demographic characteristics, i.e., HIV transmission risk group and gender, geographic region, year of HIV diagnosis, and CD4 nadir. A total of 13,943 SHCS patients had at least 1 MTB test documented, of whom 840 (6.0%) had LTBI and 770 (5.5%) developed active TB. Compared to MTB uninfected patients, LTBI was associated with a 0.24 decreased log HIV SPVL in the adjusted model (p < 0.0001). Patients with LTBI had lower odds of having candida stomatitis (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.68, p = 0.0035) and oral hairy leukoplakia (adjusted OR = 0.67, p = 0.033) when compared to MTB uninfected patients.

The aim of this study was to explore nurses experience of PVV in emergency department, the impact of PVV on quality of care, and supports needed after exposure to such incidents. We conducted semi-structured interviews with a purposive and snowball sample of nurses, and analyzed the content of the interview transcripts.

In this study, we present a molybdenum disulfide (MoS(2)) nanosheet-modified dendrimer droplet microarray (DMA) for rapid and sensitive detection of retroviral nucleic acids of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) simultaneously. The DMA platform was fabricated by omniphobicComniphilic patterning on a surface-grafted dendrimer substrate. Functionalized MoS(2) nanosheets modified with fluorescent dye-labeled oligomer probes were prepatterned on positively charged amino-modified omniphilic spots to form a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensing microarray. With the formation of separated microdroplets of sample on the hydrophobicChydrophilic micropattern, prepatterned oligomer probes specifically hybridized with the target HIV genes and detached from the MoS(2) nanosheet surface due to weakening of the adsorption force, leading to fluorescence signal recovery. As a proof of concept, we used this microarray with a small sample size (<150 nL) for simultaneous detection of HIV-1 and HIV-2 nucleic acids with a limit of detection (LOD) of 50 pM.

Despite their uniformity, these measures may be differentially valuable for different countries. METHODS: We use a compartmental epidemiological model to project the spread of COVID-19 across policy scenarios in high- and low-income countries. We embed estimates of the welfare value of disease avoidance into the epidemiological projections to estimate the return to more stringent lockdown policies. RESULTS: Social distancing measures that 'flatten the curve' of the disease provide immense welfare value in upper-income countries. However, social distancing policies deliver significantly less value in lower-income countries that have younger populations, which are less vulnerable to COVID-19. Equally important, social distancing mandates a trade-off between disease risk and economic activity. Poorer people are less able to make those economic sacrifices. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological and welfare value of social distancing is smaller in lower-income countries and such policies may exact a heavy toll on the poorest and most vulnerable. Workers in the informal sector often lack the resources and social protections that enable them to isolate themselves until the virus passes. By limiting these households' ability to earn a living, social distancing can lead to an increase in hunger, deprivation, and related mortality and morbidity.","output":"The benefits and costs of social distancing in high- and low-income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to explore the supply chain (SC) resilience capabilities of firms, focusing on their ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic disruption.

This paper presents an extension of an existing Bayesian network model for an application in which people can add their own personal risk factors to calculate their probability of exposure to the virus and likely severity if they do catch the illness. The data need not be shared with any central authority. In this way, people can become more aware of their individual risks and adjust their behaviour accordingly, as many countries prepare for a second wave of infections or a prolonged pandemic. This has the advantage not only of preserving privacy but also of containing the virus more effectively by allowing users to act without the time lag of waiting to be informed that a contact has been tested and confirmed COVID-19 positive. Through a nuanced assessment of individual risk, it could also release many people from isolation who are judged highly vulnerable using cruder measures, helping to boost economic activity and decrease social isolation without unduly increasing transmission risk. Although much has been written and reported about single risk factors, little has been done to bring these factors together in a user-friendly way to give an overall risk rating. The causal probabilistic model presented here shows the power of Bayesian networks to represent the interplay of multiple, dependent variables and to predict outcomes. The network, designed for use in the UK, is built using detailed data from government and health authorities and the latest research, and is capable of dynamic updates as new information becomes available.

Testing is crucial for mitigating public health and economic effects. Serology is considered key to population-level surveillance and potentially individual-level risk assessment. However, immunoassay performance has not been compared on large, identical sample sets. We aimed to investigate the performance of four high-throughput commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassays and a novel 384-well ELISA. METHODS: We did a head-to-head assessment of SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA), LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy), Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), SARS-CoV-2 Total assay (Siemens, Munich, Germany), and a novel 384-well ELISA (the Oxford immunoassay). We derived sensitivity and specificity from 976 pre-pandemic blood samples (collected between Sept 4, 2014, and Oct 4, 2016) and 536 blood samples from patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, collected at least 20 days post symptom onset (collected between Feb 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess assay thresholds. FINDINGS: At the manufacturers' thresholds, for the Abbott assay sensitivity was 927% (95% CI 902-948) and specificity was 999% (994-100%); for the DiaSorin assay sensitivity was 950% (928-967) and specificity was 987% (977-993); for the Oxford immunoassay sensitivity was 991% (978-997) and specificity was 990% (981-995); for the Roche assay sensitivity was 972% (954-984) and specificity was 998% (993-100); and for the Siemens assay sensitivity was 981% (966-991) and specificity was 999% (994-100%). All assays achieved a sensitivity of at least 98% with thresholds optimised to achieve a specificity of at least 98% on samples taken 30 days or more post symptom onset. INTERPRETATION: Four commercial, widely available assays and a scalable 384-well ELISA can be used for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing to achieve sensitivity and specificity of at least 98%.

Participants completed a questionnaire on experiences, perceived benefits and limitations of teleconsultation. Descriptive statistics and tests of comparison were conducted.ResultsAround half of the patients (N = 216, 47.3%) who were offered a teleconsultation agreed to it, of which 105 caregivers (48.6%) participated. Caregivers had children with diagnosis including autism spectrum disorder (33.3%), language delay (28.6%), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (12.4%). Most caregivers felt that their concerns were adequately addressed (98.1%), with good technological connectivity (95.2%). Majority had no difficulty preparing for the teleconsultation (61.0%) and 44.8% reported ease of follow-up with plans after. Perceived benefits included safety (47.6%) and reduced need to take time off work (24.8%). Perceived benefits included safety (47.6%) and reduced time off work (24.8%). Caregivers who had video-based teleconsultation (compared to telephone-based) had more difficulties preparing for the teleconsultation (52.3% vs 27.4, p=0.03). These caregivers were also more likely to have difficulties with remembering and following up with plans discussed during the consultation, compared to those who had a telephone-based consultation (52.3% vs 25.0%, p value = 0.02).Twenty-five providers participated. Providers included paediatricians, allied health therapists e.g. psychologists, speech and occupational therapists and social workers. Fifty-two percent of providers were as satisfied with teleconsultation compared to in person consults. Only 28.0% of providers rated technology infrastructure to be good. Most providers (92.0%) felt safer with teleconsultation. The most common difficulty perceived by providers was incompleteness of consultation without assessing the child physically. The two main perceived benefits of teleconsultation by providers included feeling safer as they were able to minimize physical interaction with patients and being able to provide similarly good care with less inconvenience to patients.Overall 63.8% of caregivers and 56.0% of providers would continue teleconsultation services post-pandemic. Amongst providers, paediatricians were more likely to continue teleconsultation services after current restrictions were lifted, compared to non-physician providers (100% vs 38.9%, p=0.008).ConclusionsTelemedicine was generally well received by caregiver and physician providers.

Thirteen post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients who had lost >100 lbs in the first year following surgery and who gave variable histories of gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, were selected for study. Food-stimulated pancreatic enzyme secretion and GI hormone responses were measured during 2 h perfusions of the Roux limb with a standard polymeric liquid formula diet and polyethylene glycol marker, with collections of secretions from the common channel distal to the anastomosis and blood testing. Fat absorption was then measured during a 72 h balance study when a normal diet was given containing ~100 g fat/d. RESULTS Result showed that all patients had some fat malabsorption, but eight had coefficients of fat absorption <80%, indicative of steatorrhea. This was associated with significantly lower feed-stimulated secretion rates of trypsin, amylase, and lipase, and higher plasma peptide-YY concentrations compared with healthy controls. Five steatorrhea patients were subsequently treated with low quantities of pancreatic enzyme supplements for 3 months, and then retested. The supplements were well tolerated, and fat absorption improved in four of five patients accompanied by an increase in lipase secretion, but body weight increased in only three.

Radical excision of these retroperitoneal liposarcomas is often challenging due to their large size and proximity to visceral organs and major vessels. Here we present the 30-year experience of our multidisciplinary sarcoma team in the treatment of these tumors and analysis of factors influencing survival. METHODS Patients with retroperitoneal liposarcomas treated in Helsinki University Hospital from 1987 to 2017 were reviewed. Local recurrence-free survival, metastases-free survival, and disease-specific survival were assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis, and factors influencing survival were evaluated with Cox regression. RESULTS A total of 107 patients were identified. The median follow-up time was 5.4 years (interquartile range: 2.2-8.8 years). Local recurrence developed in 72% and metastases in 15% during follow-up. The 5-year disease-free survival was 31% and disease-specific survival was 66%. The multifactorial analysis revealed histological type and grade as predictors of disease-specific survival (P < .01) while multifocality carried a poor prognosis for local recurrence (P = .02) and higher histological grade for metastases (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS Retroperitoneal liposarcomas rarely metastasize but tend to recur locally. For tumors that have been resected with macroscopically clear margins, histological, type, and grade are significant predictors of survival.","output":"Single centre 30-year experience in treating retroperitoneal liposarcomas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on transplantation is multifactorial. This study reports on its influence on deceased donation for transplantation in the Western Cape. METHODS: The volume of referrals and those who were consented for organ donation in the province in the pre-pandemic period of May 2017 to February 2020 were compared to those of the initial pandemic period (March through December 2020). RESULTS: Prior to the pandemic, there were 201 deceased donor referrals in the Western Cape province - 152 (75.6%) and 49 (24.4%) in public and private sectors, respectively. The mean referral rates ranged between 59-69 referrals per year, translating into a monthly rate of 4.8 (range 2.8-5.8). During the first 10 months of the pandemic, there were 18 referrals - 12 (66.7%) and six (33.3%) in the public and private sectors; a decrease of 63%, with a mean monthly referral rate of 1.8. The overall consent rate prior to the pandemic in the public and private sectors was 36.6% (38% and 27%, respectively) with an increase to 44.4% (37.5% and 62.5%) during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Despite a 10% increase in consent rate for deceased donation during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant decrease in the number of potential donors referred.

Although the majority of infected people experience mild disease, some patients develop a serious disease, especially when other pathologies concur. For this reason, it would be very convenient to find pharmacological and immunological mechanisms that help control SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since the COVID-19 and BCoV viruses are very close phylogenetically, different studies demonstrate the existence of cross-immunity as they retain shared epitopes in their structure. As a possible control measure against COVID-19, we propose the use of cow's milk immune to BCoV. Thus, the antigenic recognition of some highly conserved structures of viral proteins, particularly M and S2, by anti-BCoV antibodies present in milk would cause a total or partial inactivation of SARS-COV-2 (acting as a particular vaccine) and be addressed more easily by GALT's highly specialized antigen-presenting cells, thus helping the specific immune response.","output":"Bovine Coronavirus Immune Milk Against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Frontline workers have shown extraordinary resilience and sustained efforts since the outbreak of COVID-19.

A common policy response to covid-19 outbreaks has been the lockdown or quarantine. Designed to slow the spread of the disease, lockdowns have unintended consequences for the environment. This article examines the impact of Colombias lockdown on forest fires, motivated by satellite data showing a particularly large upsurge of fires at around the time of lockdown implementation. We find that Colombias lockdown is associated with an increase in forest fires compared to three different counterfactuals, constructed to simulate the expected number of fires in the absence of the lockdown. To varying degrees across Colombias regions, the presence of armed groups is correlated with this fire upsurge. Mechanisms through which the lockdown might influence fire rates are discussed, including the mobilisation of armed groups and the reduction in the monitoring capacity of state and conservation organisations during the covid-19 outbreak. Given the fast-developing situation in Colombia, we conclude with some ideas for further research.","output":"The Unintended Impact of Colombias Covid-19 Lockdown on Forest Fires"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current influenza vaccines predominantly induce immunity to the hypervariable viral hemagglutinin (HA) head, requiring frequent vaccine reformulation. Conversely, antigenic sites on the conserved HA stem are subdominant and harbor a supersite which is targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), making it a prime target for universal vaccines. Here, we show that co-immunization of two stem immunogens derived from influenza A group 1 and 2 HAs elicits cross-group protective immunity and neutralizing antibody responses in mice, ferrets, and nonhuman primates (NHPs). Immunized mice were protected from multiple group 1 and 2 viruses, and all animal models showed broad serum neutralizing activity. A bnAb isolated from an immunized NHP broadly neutralized and conferred protection from viruses including H5N1 and H7N9. Genetic and structural analyses revealed a remarkable convergent evolution between macaque and human bnAbs, illustrating the biophysical constraints for acquiring immunoglobulins with cross-group specificity. Co-immunization of stem immunogens elicits not only group-specific protective immunity, but also cross-group bnAb responses, and represents a step towards broadly protective influenza vaccines.","output":"Vaccine-elicitation of cross-group neutralizing protective antibodies to influenza A viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 8th Annual 2020 International Conference on Geo-Spatial Knowledge and Intelligence (GSKI2020) was held on December 18-19th, 2020 at Xian, Shanxi, China (Virtual Conference) Due to the COVID-19 situation and travel restrictions via Zoom event platform Every authors and Committees can be received a Zoom meeting username and password from the organizer who located on Wuhan, China Every person can attend the conference using these information The time spent to deliver the talks by each keynote speaker is 30 minutes, 25 min presentation and 5 min question time The time spent to deliver the talks by each oral speaker is 15 minutes, 10 min presentation and 5 min question time Every authors can discuss with others about their session after the speech It was held very successfully It aims to bring researchers, engineers, and students to the areas of Geo-Spatial Knowledge and Intelligence GSKI2020 features unique mixed topics of smart city, spatial data acquisition, processing and management, modeling and analysis, and recent applications in the context of building healthier ecology and Resource Management The conference will provide a forum for sharing experiences and original research contributions on those topics Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit their contributions to GSKI2020 We received a total of 293 submissions from various parts of the world The International Program Committee worked very hard to have all papers peer-peer reviewed before the review deadline The conference program is extremely rich, profound and featuring high-impact presentations of selected papers and additional late-breaking contributions We sincerely hope that the conference would not only show the participants a broad overview of the latest research results on related fields, but also provide them with a significant platform for academic connection and exchange All the keynote speakers are internationally recognized leading experts in their research fields, who have demonstrated outstanding proficiency and have achieved distinction in their profession The proceedings were published by IOP Conference Series We would like to mention that, due to the limitation of the conference venue capacity, we are not able to include many fine papers in the program Our apology goes to those authors We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all the members of International Program Committee and organizers for their enthusiasm, time, and expertise Our deep thanks also go to many volunteers and staffs for the long hours and hard work they have generously given to GSKI2020 Finally, we would like to thank all the authors, speakers, and participants of this conference for their contributions to GSKI2020 GSKI2020 Committee Committee of GSKI2020 List of Editors, Keynote Speakers, Honorary-Chair, Co-Chair, The Editorial Committee, Internatinal Technical Program Committee are available in the pdf","output":"Preface of GSKI2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objective: to relate nursing diagnoses/outcomes and interventions for critically ill patients affected by COVID-19 and sepsis in the Intensive Care Unit, according to the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP?).

PURPOSE: To review multiple streams of evidence regarding the benefits and harms of ventilation techniques for coronavirus infections, including that causing COVID-19. (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020178187) DATA SOURCES: 21 standard, World Health OrganizationCspecific and COVID-19Cspecific databases, without language restrictions, until 1 May 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Studies of any design and language comparing different oxygenation approaches in patients with coronavirus infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Animal, mechanistic, laboratory, and preclinical evidence was gathered regarding aerosol dispersion of coronavirus. Studies evaluating risk for virus transmission to health care workers from aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Independent and duplicate screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment (GRADE for certainty of evidence and AMSTAR 2 for included systematic reviews). DATA SYNTHESIS: 123 studies were eligible (45 on COVID-19, 70 on SARS, 8 on MERS), but only 5 studies (1 on COVID-19, 3 on SARS, 1 on MERS) adjusted for important confounders. A study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 reported slightly higher mortality with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) than with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), but 2 opposing studies, 1 in patients with MERS and 1 in patients with SARS, suggest a reduction in mortality with NIV (very low-certainty evidence). Two studies in patients with SARS report a reduction in mortality with NIV compared with no mechanical ventilation (low-certainty evidence). Two systematic reviews suggest a large reduction in mortality with NIV compared with conventional oxygen therapy. Other included studies suggest increased odds of transmission from AGPs. LIMITATION: Direct studies in COVID-19 are limited and poorly reported. CONCLUSION: Indirect and low-certainty evidence suggests that use of NIV, similar to IMV, probably reduces mortality but may increase the risk for transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.

As diagnostic options, swabs from the anterior nose, from the nasopharynx, from the oropharynx or the extraction of throat rinse water or saliva are possible. The laboratory methods available are antigen tests that can be read in a few minutes or more lengthy RT-PCR methods in a lab. Swabs are carried out by physicians, medical staff, laypeople and in the self-test, in each case according to prior instructions. Many of these factors therefore have an influence on the informative value and the sensitivity of the entire diagnostic process. The PCR laboratory method is more sensitive than the antigen method; the swabs from the nasopharynx are considered the most valid smear site; correct execution of a test can be achieved even with non-professional individuals with good instructions. Complications with such swabs are reported very rarely, given the assumed number of procedures performed. Short-term nosebleeds after traumatic smears can be assumed without publications about it being found. Broken parts of swabs had to be removed by an ENT doctor. There are only very few reports on injuries to the skullbase with CSF-leaks, including 2 times with anomalies such as meningoceles.

Unfortunately, due to insufficient resources and awareness in underdeveloped countries, proper and timely PD detection is highly challenged. Besides, all PD patients' symptoms are neither the same nor they all become pronounced at the same stage of the illness. Therefore, this work aims to combine more than one symptom (rest tremor and voice degradation) by collecting data remotely using smartphones and detect PD with the help of a cloud-based machine learning system for telemonitoring the PD patients in the developing countries. METHOD: This proposed system receives rest tremor and vowel phonation data acquired by smartphones with built-in accelerometer and voice recorder sensors. The data are primarily collected from diagnosed PD patients and healthy people for building and optimizing machine learning models that exhibit higher performance. After that, data from newly suspected PD patients are collected, and the trained algorithms are evaluated to detect PD. Based on the majority-vote from those algorithms, PD-detected patients are connected with a nearby neurologist for consultation. Upon receiving patients' feedback after being diagnosed by the neurologist, the system may update the model by retraining using the latest data. Also, the system requests the detected patients periodically to upload new data to track their disease progress. RESULT: The highest accuracy in PD detection using offline data was [Formula: see text] from voice data and [Formula: see text] from tremor data when used separately. In both cases, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) gave the highest accuracy over support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes (NB). The application of maximum relevance minimum redundancy (MRMR) feature selection method showed that by selecting different feature sets based on the patient's gender, we could improve the detection accuracy. This study's novelty is the application of ensemble averaging on the combined decisions generated from the analysis of voice and tremor data. The average accuracy of PD detection becomes [Formula: see text] when ensemble averaging was performed on majority-vote from kNN, SVM, and NB. CONCLUSION: The proposed system can detect PD using a cloud-based system for computation, data preserving, and regular monitoring of voice and tremor samples captured by smartphones. Thus, this system can be a solution for healthcare authorities to ensure the older population's accessibility to a better medical diagnosis system in the developing countries, especially in the pandemic situation like COVID-19, when in-person monitoring is minimal.","output":"Telemonitoring Parkinson's disease using machine learning by combining tremor and voice analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has had a devastating effect on towns and cities throughout the world. However, with the gradual easing of lockdown policies in most countries, the majority of non-essential retail businesses are trying their best to bounce back both economically and socially. Nevertheless, the efforts of retail traders are hampered by uncertainty regarding what capacity measures need to be taken, and there is an urgent need to understand how social distancing can be safely followed and implemented in these spaces. This paper draws from retail space allocation, crowd science, operational research and ergonomics/biomechanics to develop a method for identifying the minimum amount of space an individual needs to socially distance in shops, markets, shopping centres and open commercial spaces, when there are other people present. The area required per person is calculated for both static space (where people are seated, standing or queuing, for example) and dynamic space (where people need to walk freely). We propose our method as a step forward in understanding the very practical problem of capacity, which can hopefully allow retail spaces to operate safely, and minimise the risk of virus transmission.","output":"How safe is it to shop?

Of these 4081 met our inclusion criteria and 100 tweets were randomly selected to develop a coding scheme in the initial phase. Random samples of tweets in folds of 100 were then qualitatively analysed in the focused coding phase until saturation was met at 500 tweets analysed. Results: Five key themes emerged: (1) humour or sarcasm, (2) marketing or profiteering, (3) opinion and emotions, (4) personal experience, and (5) support or information. About half of the tweets carried negative sentiments, expressing anger or frustration towards the deficiency of toilet paper and the frantic situation of toilet paper hoarding, which were among the most influential tweets. Discussion: Panic buying of toilet paper was seen during the 2020 pandemic period with a mass amount of related content spread across social media. The spontaneous contagion of fear and panic through social media could fuel psychological reactions in midst of crises. The high level of negative social media posts regarding the toilet paper crisis acts as an emotional trigger of public anxiety and panic.

DESIGN: Subset of data from an ongoing observational cohort study of users of the application collected from October 1, 2018 to April 18, 2020. SETTING: The mobile application is available from public sources; users download and use the application per their own clinical needs on personal mobile devices. PARTICIPANTS: No user data was excluded from the study. EXPOSURE(S): Events with impacts on surgical case volumes, including weekends, holidays, and the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): It was previously noted that application usage was decreased on weekends and during winter holidays. We subsequently hypothesized that more detailed analysis would reveal impacts of country-specific or region-specific holidays on the volume of app use. RESULTS: 4,300,975 data points from 92,878 unique users were analyzed. Physicians and other anesthesia providers comprised 85.8% of the study population. Application use was reduced on holidays and weekends and correlated with fluctuations in surgical volume.

Subjects were allocated to two groups of 45 patients. Three 400-mg capsules of wheat germ extract or placebo were used daily, between the 16th day of the menstrual cycle to the fifth day of the next menstrual cycle for two consecutive months. Pain intensity was measured by a visual analogue scale thrice a day and a four-point verbal rating scale was employed to assess systemic symptoms. RESULTS Pain severity decreased only in the wheat germ extract group (P < 0.001) and there was no statistically significant change in the placebo group. In the wheat germ extract group, the pain severity decreased from 4.701 at baseline to 1.120 at the second cycle. The reduction in total scores of systemic symptoms of dysmenorrhea was statistically significant only in the wheat germ extract group (P < 0.001) and there was not a statistically significant change in the placebo group.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the analytical performances of the immunoturbidimetric Yumizen G DDi 2 assay (HORIBA Medical, Montpellier, France) performed on the Yumizen G800 analyzer and compared it with other available D\\\\dimer assays. METHODS: Within\\\\run and between\\\\run imprecision were evaluated using low\\\\ and high\\\\level quality\\\\control plasma samples. Interference due to hemolysis, icterus, lipemia, rheumatoid factor (RF), or heterophilic antibodies (human antimouse antibodies [HAMAs]) was evaluated by spiking plasma samples with hemolysate, bilirubin, Intralipid, RF, or HAMAs. The measurements obtained with the different D\\\\dimer assays were compared using Passing\\\\Bablok regression analysis and Bland\\\\Altman plot method, using fresh citrated plasma samples collected from 66 consecutive routine patients with a wide range of D\\\\dimer concentrations. RESULTS: Within\\\\ and between\\\\run variation coefficients for the Yumizen G DDi 2 assay ranged from 1.7% to 5.8% and from 2.8% to 5.5%, respectively. Hemolysis and icterus did not have any effect up to 10 g/L hemoglobin and 300 mg/L bilirubin. Lipemia seemed to generate an underestimation of D\\\\dimer concentration when the Intralipid concentration was >5 g/L. RF and HAMAs did not have any effect. The Passing\\\\Bablok and Bland\\\\Altman analyses showed small differences with other available D\\\\dimer assays, which were more pronounced with increasing values.

The aim was to evaluate the routine blood tests for diagnosis of COVID-19, determining the diagnostic accuracy of blood biomarkers to differentiate between patients with and without COVID-19. METHODS: Clinical charts, nursing records, laboratory findings, and chest x-rays from adult patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 (fever, cough and/or dyspnea) at hospital admission were reviewed. Patients were classified into two groups according to RT-PCR COVID-19: positive (COVID-19) or negative (NON-COVID-19). Diagnostic accuracy was determined by analyzing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the cutoff value. In order to reduce the number of false positives, the cutoff value with a specificity of 80% was considered. RESULTS: Two hundred three patients (101 females, 102 males) with ages between 18 and 96 years (mean = 61.3) were studied. Ninety-four were COVID-19 and 109 were NON-COVID-19. Plasma ferritin level was the most accurate biomarker (AUC = 0.847 and 0.804 in women and men, respectively). The following diagnostic criteria for suspected COVID-19 were established with biomarker cutoff values to differentiate between COVID-19 and NON-COVID-19 patients: lymphocytes &#8804; 1.0 x 109/L; eosinophils &#8804; 0.02 x 109/L; ferritin > 125% of upper reference limit (URL); LDH > 125% of URL; hsCRP > 80 mg/L; and D-dimer > 1.2 mg/L. Sensitivity was 66%, 64% 62%, 46%, 43%, and 33% for ferritin, eosinophils, LDH, hsCRP, lymphocytes, and D-dimer, respectively. Of those determined to be COVID-19 patients, 91% met one or more of the diagnostic criteria with these blood biomarkers, and of the NON-COVID-19 patients, 47% did not met any diagnostic criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Blood counts of lymphocytes and eosinophils, and plasma levels of D-dimer, LDH, hsCRP, and ferritin can be used to differentiate patients with and without COVID-19 and as a tool for diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 in adult patients at hospital admission.","output":"Evaluation of Routine Blood Tests for Diagnosis of Suspected Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prior studies indicated that actively using social network sites (SNSs) is positively associated with well-being by enhancing social support and feelings of connectedness. Conversely, passively using SNSs is negatively associated with well-being by fostering upward social comparison and envy. However, the majority of these studies has focused on Facebook. The present research examined the relationships between well-being-satisfaction with life, negative affect, positive affect-and using actively or passively various SNSs-Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok-during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, two mediators were tested: social support and upward social comparison. One thousand four persons completed an online survey during the quarantine measures; the analyses employed structural equation modeling. Results showed that passive usage of Facebook is negatively related to well-being through upward social comparison, whereas active usage of Instagram is positively related to satisfaction with life and negative affect through social support. Furthermore, active usage of Twitter was positively related to satisfaction with life through social support; while passive usage was negatively related to upward social comparison, which, in turn, was associated with more negative affect. Finally, TikTok use was not associated with well-being. Results are discussed in line with SNSs' architectures and users' motivations. Future research is required to go beyond methodological and statistical limitations and allow generalization.

The gravity of losses will not be realized for decades. Physical, personal, economic and social constraints remain in place, generating feelings of stress and anger. Even graver of a situation is a subset of this population \\\\ people who have been diagnosed with dementia and those who are more vulnerable to stress effects on the aging brain \\\\ where mental health ramifications of stress are magnified. Traumatic experiences hold the possibility of reactivating previous losses that have not been fully integrated into the gut\\\\brain axis. At the same time, traumatic events present possibilities in releasing emancipating power when losses are modulated by access to grief\\\\based psychotherapies. With access to psychotherapy remaining severely limited for the most vulnerable among us, the vastness of mental health disparities remains undocumented. METHODS: Critically review psychological intervention studies investigating the biopsychosocial effects of COVID\\\\19 among people with dementia and assess the evidence for incorporation of grief\\\\based psychotherapy and presence of strengths\\\\based language. A systematic review of Web of Science databases was carried out by using keywords dementia and COVID\\\\19, employing Boolean operating word AND, with search results limited to 2020\\\\2021. RESULTS: From a total of 229 initial search results, 156 did not meet study criteria and were omitted.

Secondarily, studies were assigned to one of three categories on viewing COVID\\\\19 as an event that is: limiting or constraining, growth opportunity, or something else. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that the biopsychosocial effects of COVID\\\\19 and dementia present a complex, dynamic and evolving relationship. Prolonged and sustained exposure to stress and trauma develops a deepening cognitive divide, where people transition from mild cognitive impairment to meeting diagnostic criteria of dementia.

This particularly matters now that the COVID-19 epidemic is putting health systems under stress. Brazil is one of the world's most affected countries, and its health system was already experiencing the aftermath of the 2015 recession. METHODS: Between 2018 and 2019 we conducted 46 semi-structured interviews with health practitioners, managers and policy-makers to explore the impact of the 2015 recession on public and private providers in prosperous (S?o Paulo) and impoverished (Maranh?o) states in Brazil. Thematic analysis was employed to identify drivers and consequences of system adaptation and coping strategies. Nvivo software was used to aid data collection and analysis. We followed the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research to provide an account of the findings. RESULTS: We found the concept of 'health sector crisis' to be politically charged among healthcare providers in S?o Paulo and Maranh?o. Contrary to expectations, the public sector was reported to have found ways to compensate for diminishing federal funding, having outsourced services and adopted flexible-if insecure-working arrangements. Following a drop in employment and health plans, private health insurance companies have streamlined their offer, at times at the expenses of coverage. Low-cost walk-in clinics were hit hard by the recession, but were also credited for having moved to cater for higher-income customers in Maranh?o. CONCLUSIONS: The 'plates' of a health system may shift and adjust in unexpected ways in response to recessions, and some of these changes might outlast the crisis. As low-income countries enter post-COVID economic recessions, it will be important to monitor the adjustments taking place in health systems, to ensure that past gains in access to care and job security are not eroded.","output":"How the 'plates' of a health system can shift, change and adjust during economic recessions: A qualitative interview study of public and private health providers in Brazil's S?o Paulo and Maranh?o states"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Spanish Society for Developmental Biology (SEBD) organized its 17th meeting in November 2020 (herein referred to as SEBD2020).

This pandemic intersects with a decades-long decline in microbial diversity and ancestral microbes due to hygiene, antibiotics, and urban living (the hygiene hypothesis). High-risk groups succumbing to COVID-19 include those with preexisting conditions, such as diabetes and obesity, which are also associated with microbiome abnormalities. Current pandemic control measures and practices will have broad, uneven, and potentially long-term effects for the human microbiome across the planet, given the implementation of physical separation, extensive hygiene, travel barriers, and other measures that influence overall microbial loss and inability for reinoculation. Although much remains uncertain or unknown about the virus and its consequences, implementing pandemic control practices could significantly affect the microbiome. In this Perspective, we explore many facets of COVID-19-induced societal changes and their possible effects on the microbiome, and discuss current and future challenges regarding the interplay between this pandemic and the microbiome. Recent recognition of the microbiome's influence on human health makes it critical to consider both how the microbiome, shaped by biosocial processes, affects susceptibility to the coronavirus and, conversely, how COVID-19 disease and prevention measures may affect the microbiome.

In the absence of neither an effective treatment or vaccine and with an incomplete understanding of the epidemiological cycle, predictive mathematical models can help exploring of both COVID-19 transmission and control. In this present study, we consider a new mathematical model on COVID-19 transmission that incorporate lock-down effect and variability in transmission between symptomatic and asymptomatic populations with former being a fast spreader of the disease. Using daily COVID-19 notified cases from three states (Maharashtra, Delhi, and Telangana) and overall India, we assess the effect of current 21 days lock-down in terms of reduction cases and deaths. Lock-down effect is studied with different lock-down success rate. Our result suggest that 21 days lock-down will have no impact in Maharashtra and overall India. Furthermore, the presence of a higher percentage of COVID-19 super-spreaders will further deteriorate the situation in Maharashtra. However, for Tamil Nadu and Delhi there is some ray of hope as our prediction shows that lock-down will reduce a significant number of cases and deaths. in these two locations. Further extension of lock-down may place Delhi and Tamil Nadu in a comfort zone. Comparing estimated parameter samples for the mentioned four locations, we find a correlation between effect of lockdown and percentage of symptomatic infected in a region.

Therefore, we investigated whether vancomycin concentration targets such as the trough level and ratio of the area under the curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) are associated with the treatment outcome in enterococcal bacteremia. METHODS A retrospective cohort analysis enrolled patients with bacteremia caused by vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis who were treated with vancomycin from January 2007 to December 2017 at a tertiary hospital located in Seoul, South Korea. Patients without vancomycin concentrations were excluded from the study. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS A total of 37 patients were enrolled-26 with E. faecium infection and 11 with E. faecalis infection. The 28-day all-cause mortality rate was 21.6 %. In univariate analysis, vancomycin trough level ( 15 g/mL; p = 0.042), age (p = 0.044), and septic shock (p = 0.049) were associated with 28-day mortality but not AUC24/MIC (> 389; p = 0.479).

The maintenance of endogenously regulated tissue-specific copy numbers of heteroplasmic mtDNA may represent a sensitive biomarker of homeostasis of mitochondrial dynamics, metabolic integrity, and immune competence. Myeloid cells, monocytes, macrophages, and antigen-presenting dendritic cells undergo programmed changes in mitochondrial metabolism according to innate and adaptive immunological processes. In the central nervous system (CNS), the polarization of activated microglial cells is dependent on strategically programmed changes in mitochondrial function. Therefore, variations in heteroplasmic mtDNA copy numbers may have functional consequences in metabolically competent mitochondria in innate and adaptive immune processes involving the CNS.

The target of neutralising antibodies is usually located in the Envelope protein on the viral surface, which mediates cell entry. As such, presentation of the Envelope protein on a lentiviral particle represents a convenient alternative to handling of a potentially high containment virus or for those viruses with no established cell culture system. The flexibility, relative safety and, in most cases, ease of production of lentiviral pseudotypes, have led to their use in serological assays for many applications such as the evaluation of candidate vaccines, screening and characterization of anti-viral therapeutics, and sero-surveillance. Above all, the speed of production of the lentiviral pseudotypes, once the envelope sequence is published, makes them important tools in the response to viral outbreaks, as shown during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In this review, we provide an overview of the landscape of the serological applications of pseudotyped lentiviral vectors, with a brief discussion on their production and batch quality analysis. Finally, we evaluate their role as surrogates for the real virus and possible alternatives.","output":"More Than Just Gene Therapy Vectors: Lentiviral Vector Pseudotypes for Serological Investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To focus on the first feelings, attitudes, and planned reactions of psychiatric workers in Hungary to the news of the appearance of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to examine any differences between psychiatrists/psychologists and nurses/other professionals regarding these attitudes. METHODS: Hungarian psychiatric workers (N = 119) including psychiatrists/psychologists (n = 78) and nurses/other professionals (n = 41) participated in the study. To measure attitudes, a questionnaire was designed consisting of 7 questions and filled out within 1-3 days after the declaration of emergency in response to COVID-19 in Hungary on March 11, 2020. RESULTS: Psychiatric workers, especially psychiatrists/psychologists, regarded information gathering from valid sources as important. When examining the first feelings, we found that the psychiatrists/psychologists group tended to feel higher extent of anxiety, while the nurses/other professionals group showed higher extent of hope. When investigating willingness to work in the pandemic situation, a lower percentage of Hungarian psychiatric workers (58%) would choose to continue working compared to previous research. Answers to open-ended questions revealed that denial was the most frequent coping reaction. CONCLUSIONS: These differences could be attributed to the finding that psychiatrists/psychologists, who had faced the reality of the virus situation via the news, tended to have more realistic attitudes toward the virus, while nurses/other professionals, who had avoided valid information, tended to have less realistic attitudes.","output":"First Reactions and Attitudes of Psychiatric Workers in Budapest Psychiatric Care Units Regarding the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previously, inguinal hernia surgery was based exclusively on repairing the abdominal wall defects using the patient's own tissues, which were put in contact with and tensioned to recalibrate the natural orifices. At present, inguinal hernia surgery is based almost solely on mounting an allograft, which has the role of strengthening the weakened groin region that allowed the herniation. This modern method of operation on inguinal hernia can be performed in a classic or laparoscopic manner. The mesh is made of polypropylene, which is a polymer of cyclic hydrocarbons. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness, biocompatibility, as well as the immediate and long-term complications in textile allografts used in open surgery of inguinal hernia repair. Another aim was to demonstrate once again the superiority of low-weight meshes with large pores by decreasing the number of complications caused by the synthetic material used, but also by a decrease in the tension on the tissues to which it was fixed. The present study included 255 cases submitted to inguinal hernia surgery. Only 1.5% required immediate reintervention before discharge to evacuate hematoma. The short duration of hospitalization, the quality-price ratio, the good postoperative results, as well as the rapid socio-professional reintegration, render the use of polypropylene mesh in inguinal hernia surgery very attractive for patients.","output":"The use of polypropylene mesh in inguinal hernia surgery: A retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Peripheral laser iridotomy (PLI) is a commonly performed procedure. While effective, repeat procedures (RPs) may be required for a variety of causes. We report the causes and rate of RP PLI and whether surgical grade is a risk factor. METHODS: Two years of retrospective data from 282 patients who had undergone PLI at a single UK ophthalmology department were retrieved using an electronic medical record system (Medisoft, Leeds, UK). RESULTS: A total of 253 patients underwent analysis with 20 requiring RPs. Our data identified a correlation between experience of the operating surgeon and an increase in RP rate, with statistical significance (p=0.036) observed between consultants and registrars. No other statistically significant risk factors were identified from our study. Prescriber preference for iopidine was observed. From our findings and the current literature, prognostic factors that appear to influence RP rate include surgical grade, patient compliance, Asian ethnicity, and anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: RP rate increases in PLI when a junior surgeon is performing the procedure, and thus cases with established prognostic factors for RPs should have senior input.

METHODS: We conducted a cold chain capacity assessment of a simulated country in the WHO African Region. We combined region-specific data regarding immunization, population, healthcare workforce, and cold storage capacity (upper and lower range and quartile values for national and subnational levels). We used seasonal influenza vaccines as proxies for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We evaluated the increase in vaccine doses to be administered, doses administered per vaccinator, and cold storage volumes for SARSCoV-2 campaigns targeting risk groups compared to routine immunization baselines. FINDINGS: Compared to routine immunization, a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign would increase monthly doses administered when targeting risk groups: 65 years (29.9%), chronic diseases patients (101.5%), and healthcare workers (1.2%). SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would increase doses administered per vaccinator for risk groups: 65 years (32.5%), chronic diseases patients (110.4%), or healthcare workers (1.4%). Routine vaccine volumes already exceed national level storage capacity for at least 75% of African Region countries, but subnational levels would have sufficient storage capacity for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in all but the lower 25% of African Region countries. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would substantially increase doses per vaccinator and cold chain capacity requirements over routine immunization baselines. Pandemic vaccination campaigns would add volume to national level stores already at their limits, but substantial capacity exists at subnational levels for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Immediate attention to strengthening delivery systems is essential to support pandemic vaccine responses in the African Region.

The implementation of safety measures in high-income countries has largely mitigated these risks. However, in many low- and middle- income countries (LMICs), resources to institute safety measures are lacking, increasing the risk of occupational exposures to these hazards. The aim of this scoping review is to map and synthesize the available research on occupational hazards among health care workers in LMICs, identify research gaps and inform policy. Searches for relevant articles were conducted in five electronic databases using a broad range of search terms. The inclusion criteria were: quantitative observational or experimental studies which examined exposure to one or more occupational hazards among health care workers in a LMCI; and the article was published in English in a peer-reviewed journal. A total of 99 studies met the inclusion criteria, and data were extracted from these studies. Large proportions of health care workers in LMICs were exposed to biological hazards (bloodborne pathogens, tuberculosis), psychosocial hazards (workplace violence, burnout, job dissatisfaction), ergonomic hazards (musculoskeletal complaints), and chemical hazards (exposure to latex and antineoplastic drugs). The implementation of risk reduction strategies was suboptimal. The majority of the literature was on biological hazards (48%), and research on other hazards was limited in comparison. Occupational safety needs to become a priority public health issue to protect health care workers in LMICs.

METHODS: Sixty-six patients diagnosed with type III prostatitis with dampness-heat and blood stasis syndrome were randomly divided into the treatment group (GHF) and the control group (tamsulosin) using a random number table, with 33 cases each group. The treatment group received GHF twice a day, and the control group received tamsulosin 0.2 mg once daily before bedtime. Patients in both groups received treatment for 6 weeks and was followed up for 2 weeks. The outcomes included the National Institute of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) score, Chinese Medicine Symptoms Score (CMSS), expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: After treatment, the NIH-CPSI total score and domain scores of pain discomfort, urination and quality of life decreased significantly from the baseline in both groups (P<0.05). The CMSS score decreased in both groups (P<0.05). The WBC count decreased and lecithin body count increased in both groups (P<0.05). GHF showed a more obvious advantage in reducing the pain discomfort and quality of life domain scores of NIH-CPSI, reducing the CMSS score, increasing the improvement rate of the WBC and lecithin body counts, compared with the control group (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in decreasing urination domain score of NIH-CPSI between two groups (P>0.05). In addition, no serious AEs were observed.

However, despite its development in the academic world, in the professional sector, its use is still very limited. The aim of this work was to find out the perception of advertising professionals as regards neuromarketing techniques for identifying its advantages and disadvantages compared to other research techniques, as well as the reasons why the use of neuromarketing is so much lower than expected in the Spanish market. The technique chosen for data gathering was the semi-structured interview, which made it possible to go into more depth with the subjects that came up. The interview, after a pre-selection of 100 professionals who matched the set criteria, was carried out individually, face-to-face, with a sample of 30 people with considerable professional experience in the field of marketing, sales communication, and market research; all of them belonged to leading companies from the sector. Once the information had been categorized into units with common themes, the results obtained were interpreted to explain how neuromarketing techniques are being used in the field of advertising. The results obtained led us to the conclusion that, even though neuromarketing provides more objective data and it is closer to what really happens to consumers when they are exposed to an advertising message, the ignorance of its true possibilities, the inability of suppliers of these techniques to transmit the value they add to research, its complexity, its high cost and time requirements explain why it has had scarce use in advertising research. The results revealed the real reasons for the rejection of neuromarketing techniques which, in turn, will make it possible to introduce both technological and formative solutions, allowing it to be incorporated into future research designs.","output":"The Application of Neuromarketing Techniques in the Spanish Advertising Industry: Weaknesses and Opportunities for Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The significance of emergency decision-making (EmDM) has been experienced recently due to the continuous occurrence of various emergency situations that have caused significant social and monetary misfortunes.

As such, it represents perhaps the greatest challenge facing neuroscience today. Subsumed within this challenge is the study of subjective experience in non-human animals: a particularly difficult endeavor that becomes even more so, as one crosses the great evolutionary divide between vertebrate and invertebrate phyla. Here, we explore the possibility of consciousness in one group of invertebrates: cephalopod molluscs. We believe such a review is timely, particularly considering cephalopods' impressive learning and memory abilities, rich behavioral repertoire, and the relative complexity of their nervous systems and sensory capabilities. Indeed, in some cephalopods, these abilities are so sophisticated that they are comparable to those of some higher vertebrates. Following the criteria and framework outlined for the identification of hallmarks of consciousness in non-mammalian species, here we propose that cephalopods - particularly the octopus - provide a unique test case among invertebrates for examining the properties and conditions that, at the very least, afford a basal faculty of consciousness. These include, among others: (i) discriminatory and anticipatory behaviors indicating a strong link between perception and memory recall; (ii) the presence of neural substrates representing functional analogs of thalamus and cortex; (iii) the neurophysiological dynamics resembling the functional signatures of conscious states in mammals. We highlight the current lack of evidence as well as potentially informative areas that warrant further investigation to support the view expressed here.

METHODS Plasma of 200-400 mL was collected from convalescent patients 2 weeks after being discharged from the hospital. After viral nucleic acid testing and antibody testing, the plasma was infused into 16 severe or critical COVID-19 patients. Time for viral nucleic acid amplification (NAA) test turning negative, total volume of plasma transfusion, average antibody concentration, and total antibody amount were recorded. White blood cell (WBC) counts, lymphocyte (LYM) counts, neutrophil (NEU) counts, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), hypersensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), and lactic acid (Lac) levels were measured and the rate of change was calculated at the baseline (d0) before plasma transfusion, and day 1 (d1), day 3 (d3) after transfusion. RESULTS (1) Patient characteristics: among the 16 patients, 5 cases (31.25%) were severe COVID-19, and 11 cases (68.75%) were critical COVID-19; 62.50% (10/16) of the patients had primary disease; the percentage of invasive ventilation and use of extracorporeal membrane pulmonary oxygenation (ECMO) in critical patients were 90.91% (10/11) and 45.46% (5/11) respectively. (2) Antibody concentration of convalescent plasma and time for NAA test turning negative: the convalescent plasma antibody concentration in this study was ranged from 10.93 kAU/L to 114.7 kAU/L, with an average value of (56.4439.40) kAU/L. NAA test was continuously positive before plasma transfusion in 10 patients, and the time for NAA test turning negative could be counted. Eight patients turned negative from day 2 to day 8 after transfusion. Severe patients showed a shorter time for NAA test turning negative than critical patients after transfusion [2 (2-3) vs. 5 (3-8), P = 0.036]. Two critical patients transfused plasma with lower antibody concentration remained a positive result of NAA test, and died on the 3rd and 6th day respectively. (3) Laboratory results: the change rates of WBC (0.810.28 vs. 1.00) and NEU (0.750.33 vs. 1.00) were significantly decreased at d1 after convalescent plasma treatment (both P < 0.05), and the CRP level decreased to about 63% of that before transfusion (P = 0.017). No adverse events were observed during convalescent plasma transfusion. CONCLUSIONS Viral NAA test of most patients with COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma transfusion turned negative from day 2 to day 8 after transfusion, and the turning time of severe patients was shorter than that of critical patients. Convalescent plasma therapy can reduce the patients' CRP level, and no adverse events were found during the treatment. The antibody concentration in the convalescent plasma may be one of the factors that affect the time for the nucleic acid turning negative after transfusion. Detection and screening convalescent plasma of high-titer antibody and early application to severe and critical patients are expected to improve the efficacy of convalescent plasma.","output":"[Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 patients]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis or other rheumatic diseases treated with corticosteroids, immunomodulators and biologics might face additional risk during COVID-19 epidemic due to their immunocompromised status.

PURPOSE: We describe the implementation of a pharmacist-provided pharmacogenomics (PGx) service in an executive health program (EHP) at an academic medical center. SUMMARY: As interest in genomic testing grows, pharmacists have the opportunity to advance the use of PGx in EHPs, in collaboration with other healthcare professionals. In November 2018, a pharmacist-provided PGx service was established in the EHP at the University of Colorado Hospital. The team members included 3 physicians, a pharmacist trained in PGx, a registered dietitian/exercise physiologist, a nurse, and 2 medical assistants. We conducted 4 preimplementation steps: (1) assessment of the patient population, (2) selection of a PGx test, (3) establishment of a visit structure, and (4) selection of a billing model. The PGx consultations involved two 1-hour visits. The first visit encompassed pretest PGx education, review of the patient's current medications and previous medication intolerances, and DNA sample collection for genotyping. After this visit, the pharmacist developed a therapeutic plan based on the PGx test results, discussed the results and plan with the physician, and created a personalized PGx report. At the second visit, the pharmacist reviewed the PGx test results, personalized the PGx report, and discussed the PGx-guided therapeutic plan with the patient. Overall, the strategy worked well; minor challenges included evaluation of gene-drug pairs with limited PGx evidence, communication of information to non-EHP providers, scheduling issues, and reimbursement. CONCLUSION: The addition of a PGx service within an EHP was feasible and provided pharmacists the opportunity to lead PGx efforts and collaborate with physicians to expand the precision medicine footprint at an academic medical center.","output":"Implementation of a pharmacist-provided pharmacogenomics service in an executive health program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: .

The IBV infection resulted in a wide range of clinical syndromes in the affected chickens, including respiratory, renal, gonads affections as well as generalized infections. Despite the intensive application of various commercial vaccines against the virus, many outbreaks are still reported in chickens worldwide. Several studies reported the circulation of several strains and genotypes of the IBV in eastern Saudi Arabia. The main goal of the current study was to isolate some of the circulating strains of IBV and assess its ability to reproduce the IBV infections in the challenge birds. Another objective was to monitor the immune status of the infected chickens during the course of this study. To achieve these goals, we used some filed IBV isolates retrieved from an outbreak in a broiler chicken farm in eastern Saudi Arabia in 2014. A total of 220-day-old chickens (110 Ross and 110 native Saudi breed chickens), twenty birds per each group, were used in this study. The chickens in some groups received some IBV vaccines on day one of the experiment, and some are boosted on day 19. All birds were challenged on day 28 of the experiment. Our results showed mild IBV signs in the non-vaccinated control group of chickens; however, the vaccinated chickens did not show any signs of IBV infections. Meanwhile, both the vaccinated and the none- vaccinated birds seroconverted to the IBV as shown by the ELISA results.

Se and differentiation affected the expression of selenoproteins in a heterogeneous manner. GPX4 expression was substantially decreased during differentiation, whereas GPX1 was not affected. Moreover, Se increased the expression of selenoproteins H and F, which was further enhanced by differentiation for selenoprotein F and diminished for selenoprotein H. Notably, LPS-induced expression of NF-B target genes was facilitated by Se, as was the release of COX- and LOX-derived lipid mediators and substrates required for lipid mediator biosynthesis. This included TXB(2), TXB(3), 15-HETE, and 12-HEPE, as well as arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

The objective of this study was to examine racial differences in frailty and geriatric assessment impairments in an unselected cohort of older adults with newly diagnosed gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. METHODS This study used data from the Cancer and Aging Resilience Evaluation Registry, a prospective cohort study that enrolled older adults (60 years) with GI malignancies who were presenting for their initial consultation. Participants who had a geriatric assessment completed before chemotherapy initiation and self-reported as either White or Black were included. Frailty was defined with a frailty index based on the deficit accumulation method. The differences in the prevalence and adjusted odds ratios for frailty and geriatric assessment impairments between Black and White participants were examined. RESULTS Of the 710 eligible patients who were seen, 553 consented with sufficient data for analyses. The mean age at enrollment was 70  7.1 years, 58% were male, and 23% were Black. Primary cancer diagnoses included colorectal cancer (32%), pancreatic cancer (27%), and hepatobiliary cancer (18%). Black participants were more likely to be frail (50.0% vs 32.7%; P < .001) and report limitations in activities of daily living (27.3% vs 14.1%; P = .001), instrumental activities of daily living (64.8% vs 47.3%; P = .002), and walking 1 block (62.5% vs 48.2%; P = .004). These associations persisted even after adjustments for age, sex, education, cancer type, cancer stage, and comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS Black participants were frailer and reported more limitations in function in comparison with White participants. These findings may partially explain disparities in cancer outcomes and warrant further examination.","output":"Racial disparities in frailty and geriatric assessment impairments in older adults with cancer in the Deep South: Results from the CARE Registry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GAD-Ab) are sometimes associated with chronic drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Clinically, it may manifest as mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), with GAD-Ab patients difficult to distinguish. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare brain metabolism of patients with mTLE and high serum titers of GAD-Ab (>2000 UI/ml) to those with mTLE and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and confirmed GAD-ab negativity. METHODS: Images from PET studies were normalized to an SPM 12 template. Voxel to voxel comparisons were made using a two-sample one-tailed t-test. RESULTS: In both patients with GAD-Ab and controls (mTLE-HS), hypometabolism in mesial temporal lobe areas was observed. When comparing the two groups, GAD-Ab patients had statistically significant reduced metabolism in both insulae and medial inferior frontal-hypothalamus area (p < 0.001).

MethodsIn this prospective study, disease activity and clinical assessments were recorded from the first dose of vaccine, until day 15 after the second dose in 126 SLE patients. SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were measured against wild-type spike antigen while serum-neutralizing activity was assessed against the SARS-CoV-2 historical strain and variants of concerns (VOCs). Vaccine-specific T-cell responses were quantified by Interferon (IFN)-{gamma} release assay after the second dose. ResultsBNT162b2 was well tolerated and no statistically significant variations of BILAG and SLEDAI scores were observed throughout the study in SLE patients with active and inactive disease at baseline. Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) and Methotrexate (MTX) treatments were associated with drastically reduced BNT162b2 antibody-response ({beta}=-78; p=0.007, {beta}=-122; p<0.001, respectively). Anti-spike antibody response was positively associated with baseline total IgG serum levels, naive B cell frequencies ({beta}=2; p=0.018, {beta}=2.5; p=0.003) and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response (r=0.462; p=0.003).

This study assesses the reach of information shared across social media platforms about congenital clubfoot and analyzes topics most commonly discussed among members in these groups. Methodology Posts and pages across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok were evaluated to identify the top clubfoot-related hashtags and accounts. In addition, content themes were analyzed for posts across all platforms. Results There were 122 clubfoot-focused Facebook groups for parent support, and the five Facebook groups with the highest number of posts during the study period were found to frequently discuss the following topics: successful treatment stories, questions about casting, bracing, relapse, and commercial items compatible with clubfoot treatment. Twitter pages contained information about live webinars, educational resources for parents and providers, and the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on clubfoot treatment.

The function of Nrf2 is regulated by its negative regulator Keap1 by inducing its cytoplasmic degradation. Recent studies have suggested that Nrf2 is also regulated post-transcriptionally via miRNAs. However, to date, how miRNAs regulate Nrf2 in fish skeletal muscles is unknown. In this study, the full-length cDNAs with 2398 bp of the Nrf2 was firstly cloned by SMART RACE amplification tools from Chinese perch. The Nrf2 gene structure and its 3'-UTR region for possible miRNA binding sites, as well as its spatial expression profile were assayed. Then, we employed TargetScan Fish tool MiRNAnome to predict putative sites for five miRNAs including miR-181a-5p, MiR-194a, MiR-216a, miR-459-5p, and miR-724. Using qRT-PCR assay, we found that Nrf2 mRNA levels have negative correlation with all five miRNAs expression in muscle of nutritionally deprived fish, and that ectopic expression of miR-181a-5p alone reduces Nrf2 mRNA levels. Luciferase reporter assay in a heterologous cell system revealed that each of the five miRNAs reduced Nrf2 expression, suggesting a direct regulatory mechanism. Moreover, the miR-181a-5p suppression using specific antagomir led to a significant increase in Nrf2 expression in vivo. At the same time, the expression levels of the antioxidant enzymes CAT, ZnSOD, GPx, GSTA, and GSTA genes increased significantly after injecting miR-181a-5p antagomir. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that miRNAs are involved in the Nrf2 signaling networks in regulation of oxidative stress in fish, at least in Chinese perch muscle.","output":"MiRNAs-Modulation of Nrf2 Signaling Networks in Regulation Oxidative Stress of Chinese Perch Skeletal Muscle After Fasting Treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MERS-CoV first case was reported on 23rd November 2012 in Saudi Arabia, Since, then MERS has remained on World Health Organization (WHO) Blueprint list and declared pandemic This study was conducted on MERS lab confirmed cases reported to Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia and WHO for year 2012C2019 The epidemiology was investigated based on infection rate, death rate, case fatality rate, Gender, Age group, and Medical conditions (Comorbid and Symptomatic) The overall median age of infected male was 58 years and of female was 45 years While average mortality age in male was 60 years and of female was 65 years which is greater than the global average of 50 years The results also report that specially after age of 40 years in both men and women, chances of infection are more while comorbidities increase the infection rate The men are more susceptible to infection than women In case of asymptomatic distribution trend was vice versa with 69 4% women and 30 6% in men Second, most infected age group was reduced by 20 years in case of men with 47 37% infection for age group of 20C39 years This was also observed in age-group of 20C39 years for no comorbid cases (men (50%) & women (79%)) This explains MERS-CoV prevalence in Saudi Arabia, as young and healthy population were infected, and acted as carrier and on coming in contact with vulnerable population (Elderly, chronic and comorbid) transferred the infection Hence, MERS-CoV outbreak kept on happening from time to time over past years This finding might very well explain the exponential spread of Novel CoV-19 globally, as initial control measures required older people to stay indoors while younger generation brought infection from outside Further studies are required for epidemiology analysis based on clusters, travel history and specific disease related mortality","output":"Where we missed?

Since most animal models are not susceptible to SARS CoV-2 infection, pre-clinical studies are often limited to infection-prone animals such as hamsters and non-human primates. In these animal models, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in viral replication and a mild disease disease. Therefore, the protective efficacy of the vaccine in these animals is commonly evaluated by its ability to elicit immunologic responses, diminish viral replication and prevent weight loss. Our lab recently reported the design of a SARS-CoV-2 human Fc-conjugated receptor-binding domain (RBD-hFc) mRNA vaccine delivered via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs).

The purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude of discomfort and level of exertion experienced by health care workers while wearing respiratory protection for periods up to 8 hr when performing their typical occupational duties. This project was a multiple cross-over field trial of 27 health care workers, aged 24C65, performing their typical, hospital-based occupational duties. Each participant served as his/her own control and wore one of seven respirators or a medical mask for 8 hr (or as long as tolerable) with interposed doffing periods every 2 hr. Self-perceived discomfort and exertion were quantified before each doffing: self-perceived level of discomfort using a visual analog scale, and self-perceived level of exertion using a Borg scale. Overall, and as would be expected, discomfort increased over time with continual respirator use over an 8-hr period. Interestingly, exertion increased only marginally over the same time period. The relatively low level of exertion associated with eight respiratory protective devices, including models commonly used in the U.S. health care workplace, is not likely to substantially influence workers tolerability or occupational productivity.

People's adherence to control measures is influenced by their knowledge, attitudes and practices towards the disease. Therefore, in the present study we assessed pharmacy senior students' knowledge, attitudes and practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire was created and it consisted of 12 questions testing their knowledge about COVID-19 clinical characteristics, transmission routes and prevention and control steps. Among senior pharmacy students (n = 238), 70% were females and 63% were living in greater Cairo. Their main source of information included social media (70%), published articles (48%) and television (48%). The overall correct knowledge score was 83%. Most of the students displayed a good COVID-19 knowledge level (72.5% of the students). The students were least informed when trying to answer questions about hyper-coagulation, as a major cause for death in patients with severe COVID-19, and about the timings on the necessity to wear masks. Assessment of students' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 reflected that 87% of them were confident that health care teams and scientists could win the fight against the virus. In addition, 72% of students agreed that COVID-19 will be controlled successfully. The greater the students' knowledge, the more confident they felt that COVID-19 will be controlled successfully (OR 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-4.72). Good behavioral practice towards COVID-19 control was confirmed when 87% of students answered that they didn't go out to any crowded place. Females were 3.6 times (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-3.11) more likely to avoid going out than males. Bad behavioral practice became evident when approximately 50% of students admitted that they did not wear masks when they left their house. Therefore, more efforts should be taken to protect future pharmacists from this pandemic.","output":"Cross-Sectional Study on Awareness and Knowledge of COVID-19 Among Senior pharmacy Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Labor companionship is a human interactive process that provides social support during the childbirth process. Despite it being one component of respectful maternity care (RMC) that is used for quality assurance to achieve the sustainable goal of maternal and neonatal mortality reduction, there is limited evidence about the current status of birth companionship. The study was aimed to assess labor companion and its associated factors at Debremarkos town public health facilities. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study design was conducted. The study was conducted at Debremarkos town from February 1/2021 to March 30/2021. From the 559 sample size, 548 women participated in the study. A systematic random sampling technique was used. A pre-tested interviewer-administered questioner was used, data were entered and analyzed with Epi-data version 4.60 and SPSS version 25.0. Bivariable regression was done and variables with p-value </= 0.20 were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. Variables with p-value </= 0.05 were considered significantly associated with labor companionship. HosmerCLemeshow goodness of fit was checked and all multi-collinearity of variables with variance inflation factors (VIF) up to 10 was tolerated. RESULTS: A total of 548 participants were involved in the study with a 98.03% response rate. The magnitude of labor companionship was found to be 14.6% (11.7C17.5).

Although vaccination programs have been run globally, the new variants of COVID-19 make it difficult to restrict the spread of the virus by vaccination alone. The combination of vaccination with anti-viral drug formulation is an ideal strategy for tackling the current pandemic situation. Drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), such as Remdesivir, have been found to be of little or no benefit. On the other hand, re-purposing of FDA-approved drugs, such as niclosamide (NIC), has offered promise but its applicability is limited due to its poor aqueous solubility and, therefore, low bioavailability. With advanced nano-pharmaceutical approaches, re-purposing this drug in a suitable drug-carrier for a better outcome may be possible. In the current study, an attempt was made to explore the loading of NIC into exfoliated layered double hydroxide nanoparticles (X-LDH NPs); prepared NIC-X-LDH NPs were further modified with eudragit S100 (ES100), an enteric coating polymer, to make the final product, ES100-NIC-X-LDH NPs, to improve absorption by the gastro/intestinal tract (GIT). Furthermore, Tween 60 was added as a coating on ES100-NIC-X-LDH NPs, not just to enhance its in vitro and in vivo stability, but also to enhance its mucoadhesive property, and to obtain, ultimately, better in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters upon oral administration. Release of NIC from Tween 60-ES100-NIC-X-LDH NPs was found to be greater under gastro/intestinal solution within a shorter period of time than the uncoated samples. The in vivo analysis revealed that Tween 60-ES100-NIC-X-LDH NPs were able to maintain a therapeutically relevant NIC plasma concentration in terms of PK parameters compared to the commercially available Yomesan?, proving that the new formulation might prove to be an effective oral drug-delivery system to deal with the SARS-CoV-2 viral infections.

To reduce the risk of COVID-19 in HF patients, telemedicine has been encouraged. METHODS AND RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedical management with mainly over-the-phone appointments became a major strategy of follow-up of our HF clinic patients. Previously, the large majority of patients have been seen in the hospital with direct patient-provider contact. We compared both strategies of follow-up, in pre-pandemic (PPP) and pandemic (PP) periods, regarding total mortality and hospitalizations/emergency department (ED) visits due to HF exacerbation. We prospectively studied a cohort of 196 patients. The mean follow-up time in PPP was 1.4 years. In this period, 20 patients died. In PP (follow-up of 71 days), there was one additional death. Total mortality in the first year of follow-up was 12.0%, matching the mortality predicted by the Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure score. Considering hospitalizations/ED visits due to decompensated HF, there was no statistically significant difference between PPP and PP. Only one patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In the light of an increase in telemedical management of this cohort of HF patients, we were able to maintain a low rate of admissions due to HF decompensation, without an increment in mortality. Regarding these results, we encourage the incremental use of telemedicine in HF patients in the context of this or future pandemics and also in situations in which physical consultation might not be possible due to logistic issues.","output":"Impact of telemedicine on the management of heart failure patients during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We would also like to take this opportunity to thank Prof Dr Ibrahim Dincer and the editorial team of Wiley, all contributing authors, reviewers, and our assistants for their efforts that have made this special issue a true success.

Under this situation, the firm, as a member of the society, should also undertake social responsibilities to jointly respond to the COVID-19. The employee, as a principal part of firm, plays an important role in informatization management which may affects the level of corporate social responsibility. Their ability of informatization management will inevitably affect their access to the information of corporate social responsibility, thus affecting the level of corporate social responsibility. This paper takes A-share listed companies from 2011 to 2018 collected in CSMAR as samples to explore the relations between employees' ability of informatization and corporate social responsibility. This study, as an interdisciplinary research related to computer and management, adopts OLS, IV method and other mathematics methods to build models. Using the employee education level as a proxy for employees' ability of informatization management, this paper finds that firms with a high-quality workforce exhibit higher level of corporate social responsibility, especially in the areas with lower degree of marketization. According to the further analysis using the model of Sobel test, the internal control plays a mediating role between employees' ability of informatization management and corporate social responsibility. This study suggests that employee quality plays an important role in performing corporate social responsibility. This study should be of interest to top managers and regulators who wish to use information technology to improve corporate social responsibility. ?

However, the evolutionary steps that facilitate the de novo generation of a novel protein within an ancestral ORF have remained poorly characterized. Here, we describe the identification of an overprinting gene, expressed from an Alternate frame of the Large T Open reading frame (ALTO) in the early region of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), the causative agent of most Merkel cell carcinomas. ALTO is expressed during, but not required for, replication of the MCPyV genome. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that ALTO is evolutionarily related to the middle T antigen of murine polyomavirus despite almost no sequence similarity. ALTO/MT arose de novo by overprinting of the second exon of T antigen in the common ancestor of a large clade of mammalian polyomaviruses. Taking advantage of the low evolutionary divergence and diverse sampling of polyomaviruses, we propose evolutionary transitions that likely gave birth to this protein. We suggest that two highly constrained regions of the large T antigen ORF provided a start codon and C-terminal hydrophobic motif necessary for cellular localization of ALTO. These two key features, together with stochastic erasure of intervening stop codons, resulted in a unique protein-coding capacity that has been preserved ever since its birth. Our study not only reveals a previously undefined protein encoded by several polyomaviruses including MCPyV, but also provides insight into de novo protein evolution.","output":"Identification of an overprinting gene in Merkel cell polyomavirus provides evolutionary insight into the birth of viral genes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global economy faces a loss of production capacity among the most severe in at least the past half-century as a result of the recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

By using a production function based on the incremental capital-output ratio, we estimate the loss of production capacity for the global economy and for the two main world locomotives, the U.S. and China. To do this, we estimate the production capacity implied in our current recession baseline and the capacity that would have existed in the absence of the pandemic (precrisis scenario).

This impact, specifically looking at the changes in patient visits, admissions and procedure volumes, has not been recorded thus far, in terms of a South Asian LMIC setting. Purpose: We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on emergency room (ER) visits, cardiology admissions, out-patient and in-patient procedures at a LMIC tertiary cardiac centre. Methods: Data on ER visits, specific in-patient and out-patient procedures (echocardiography, exercise stress tests, electrocardiography [ECG]) were collected via hospital electronic records from January to December 2020, and compared with corresponding data for the same months in 2019. The difference or deficits were expressed as a percentage (%). Data for each quarter were compared using paired t-test. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Results: There were significantly reduced numbers of out-patient visits ( -31.2%;p=0.007), ER visits (% -59.5%;p=0.0), in-patient admissions ( -33.1%;p=0.005), total out-patient procedures (% -31.9%;p=0.008) and catheterization volumes (%-29.7%;p=0.001) in 2020, as compared with 2019 (Table 1 & Figure 1). Among out-patient procedures, adult transthoracic echo, ECG and stress tests showed greatest deficits in April 2020. No trans-oesophageal echocardiograms were performed in April to July 2020. The greatest deficits were observed in April 2020, as compared with 2019 (out-patient visits: -92.7%;out-patient procedures: %-94.5%;inpatient admissions: %-85.9%;catheterization procedures: %-85.2%), except for ER visits, where the greatest deficit was seen in June 2020: %-90.7%). Numbers continued to remain extremely low in May 2020, coinciding with the nation-wide lockdown measures. Out-patient visits, procedures and in-patient admissions have gradually increased since July 2020. However, the greatest impact seems to have been on ER visits, continued to remain low, with significantly reduced volumes in both 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2020. The lowest deficits in outpatient visits (-4.9%), ER visits (-31.9%) and out-patient procedures (-0.9%) were seen in December 2020, while for in-patient admissions (-7.9%) and catheterization procedures (-6.5%) this was in October 2020. Conclusion: There was a significant reduction of out-patient and in-patient cardiology services volumes in 2020, with the greatest reduction in April and May, coinciding with a general lockdown. ER visits were the most greatly affected. Trends show a steady increase in out-patient and catheterization procedures, beginning from July, but have not yet reached pre- COVID volumes, even by the end of 2020.

To sustain the response towards the pandemic, many hospitals have adapted to virtual healthcare and telemedicine. Google&#8482; has become the most widely used search engine over the years. Google Trends&#8482; can be used to depict the public interest over a certain topic. The output of the Google Trends&#8482; is displayed as relative search volume (RSV) which is the proportionate search volume regarding a specific topic comparative to the total search volume in a specific time and region. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the daily reported number of new COVID-19 cases and deaths and the corresponding changes in Google Trends&#8482; RSV of telehealth over six months. Methods A retrospective study was conducted from January 21, 2020 to July 21, 2020. About 17 countries that reported the total number of cases greater than 200,000 in the situation report of July 21, 2020 were selected to be a part of this study. The daily reported new cases and deaths globally and of the selected countries were extracted from the World Health Organization (WHO) situation reports. The combination of keywords used for obtaining the RSV data through Google Trends&#8482; was \\"telehealth\\", \\"telemedicine\\", \\"mHealth\\", and \\"eHealth\\". These words were used with the \\"+\\" feature of Google Trends&#8482; with \\"1/21/2020 to 7/21/2020\\" as time range, \\"all categories\\" for the category, and \\"web search\\" for the type of search. The worldwide RSV as well as the RSVs of the selected countries were obtained from the Google Trends&#8482; website. Spearman's correlation coefficient (&#961;) was used to determine the strength of the relationship between new cases or deaths and RSVs related to telehealth. Results A positive fair correlation was established between the global interest in telehealth and the new cases (&#961;=0.307, p-value<0.001) and deaths (&#961;=0.469, p-value<0.001) reported worldwide. The United States of America (USA), India, and Bangladesh were found to have a positive fair correlation between the public interest regarding telehealth and the emerging new COVID-19 cases and deaths. The United Kingdom (UK) and Italy demonstrated a positive poor correlation between the rising new cases or deaths and RSV. Similar statistics were noted for the daily new cases of Chile. For Turkey, a positive fair correlation between new deaths and RSV while a positive poor correlation between new cases and RSV was observed. No significant correlation was observed for the rest of the selected countries. Conclusion This study highlights the steadily rising public interest in telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine can provide the necessary remote consultation and healthcare for patients in the current situation.

METHODS: Case series of the first 24 COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheostomy at our institution, a single-center tertiary care community hospital intensive care/ventilator weaning unit. The patients all had respiratory failure from COVID-19 and required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Outcomes reviewed include mortality, percent discharged, percent liberated from mechanical ventilation, percent decannulated, time from tracheostomy to ventilator liberation and discharge, and number of staff infected with COVID-19 during tracheostomy and management. RESULTS: Of the 24 patients who underwent tracheostomy, 21 (88%) of 24 survived. Twenty (83%) were liberated from mechanical ventilation, and 19 (79%) were discharged. Fourteen (74%) of the discharged had been decannulated. The average ( SD) time from tracheostomy to ventilator liberation was 9  4.3 days and from tracheostomy to discharge 21  9 days. All discharged patients had been liberated from mechanical ventilation. No health care workers became infected with COVID-19 during the procedure or subsequent patient management. CONCLUSION: Patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy had a high likelihood of being liberated from mechanical ventilation and discharged. Tracheostomy and subsequent ventilator weaning management can be performed safely. Tracheostomy allowed for decompression of higher acuity medical units in a safe and effective manner.","output":"Outcomes After Tracheostomy for Patients With Respiratory Failure due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus pandemic has created complex challenges and adverse circumstances This research identifies public sentiment amidst problematic socioeconomic consequences of the lockdown, and explores ensuing four potential public sentiment associated scenarios The severity and brutality of COVID-19 have led to the development of extreme feelings, and emotional and mental healthcare challenges This research focuses on emotional consequences - the presence of extreme fear, confusion and volatile sentiments, mixed along with trust and anticipation It is necessary to gauge dominant public sentiment trends for effective decisions and policies This study analyzes public sentiment using Twitter Data, time-aligned to the COVID-19 reopening debate, to identify dominant sentiment trends associated with the push to reopen the economy Present research uses textual analytics methodologies to analyze public sentiment support for two potential divergent scenarios - an early opening and a delayed opening, and consequences of each Present research concludes on the basis of textual data analytics, including textual data visualization and statistical validation, that tweets data from American Twitter users shows more positive sentiment support, than negative, for reopening the US economy This research develops a novel sentiment polarity based public sentiment scenarios (PSS) framework, which will remain useful for future crises analysis, well beyond COVID-19 With additional validation, this research stream could present valuable time sensitive opportunities for state governments, the federal government, corporations and societal leaders to guide local and regional communities, and the nation into a successful new normal future","output":"Feeling Positive About Reopening?

Objective: To report the neurological manifestations of children with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case-series study, patients younger than 18 years who presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection and neurological symptoms to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (London, UK) between March 1, 2020, and May 8, 2020, were included after infection was confirmed by either a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay by nasopharyngeal swab or a positive test result for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical and paraclinical features were retrieved from electronic patient records. Results: Of the 27 children with COVID-19 pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, 4 patients (14.8%) who were previously healthy had new-onset neurological symptoms. Symptoms included encephalopathy, headaches, brainstem and cerebellar signs, muscle weakness, and reduced reflexes. All 4 patients required intensive care unit admission for the treatment of COVID-19 pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Splenium signal changes were seen in all 4 patients on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. In the 2 patients whose cerebrospinal fluid was tested, samples were acellular, with no evidence of infection on polymerase chain reaction or culture (including negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction results) and negative oligoclonal band test results. In all 3 patients who underwent electroencephalography, a mild excess of slow activity was found. Tests for N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, and aquaporin-4 autoantibodies had negative results in all patients. In all 3 patients who underwent nerve conduction studies and electromyography, mild myopathic and neuropathic changes were seen. Neurological improvement was seen in all patients, with 2 making a complete recovery by the end of the study. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case-series study, children with COVID-19 presented with new neurological symptoms involving both the central and peripheral nervous systems and splenial changes on imaging, in the absence of respiratory symptoms.

The homing ability of MSCs is unique compared with that of non-migrating cells and MSCs are considered promising therapeutic vectors for targeting major cells in many pathophysiological sites. MSCs have many advantages in the treatment of malignant diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a representative autoimmune disease that primarily affects joints, and secreted chemokines in the joints are well recognized by MSCs following their migration to the joints. Furthermore, MSCs can regulate the inflammatory process and repair damaged cells in the joints. However, the functionality and migration ability of MSCs injected in vivo still show insufficient. The targeting ability and migration efficiency of MSCs can be enhanced by genetic engineering or modification, eg, overexpressing chemokine receptors or migration-related genes, thus maximizing their therapeutic effect. However, there are concerns about genetic changes due to the increased probability of oncogenesis resulting from genome integration of the viral vector, and thus, clinical application is limited. Furthermore, it is suspected that administering MSCs can promote tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft and orthotopic models. For this reason, MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations are an alternative strategy that does not involve using MSCs or bioengineered MSCs. MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations consist of MSC membrane-coated nanoparticles, MSC-derived exosomes and artificial ectosomes, and MSC membrane-fused liposomes with natural or genetically engineered MSC membranes. MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations not only retain the targeting ability of MSCs but also have many advantages in terms of targeted drug delivery. Specifically, MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations are capable of encapsulating drugs with various components, including chemotherapeutic agents, nucleic acids, and proteins. Furthermore, there are fewer concerns over safety issues on MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations associated with mutagenesis even when using genetically engineered MSCs, because MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations use only the membrane fraction of MSCs. Genetic engineering is a promising route in clinical settings, where nano-encapsulated technology strategies are combined. In this review, the mechanism underlying MSC homing and the advantages of MSC mimicking nanoencapsulations are discussed. In addition, genetic engineering of MSCs and MSC mimicking nanoencapsulation is described as a promising strategy for the treatment of immune-related diseases.","output":"Stem Cell Mimicking Nanoencapsulation for Targeting Arthritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors of anxiety and depression in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) so as to achieve early intervention and better clinical prognosis METHODS: Seventy-six patients with suspected COVID-19 in fever isolation wards of Second Hospital of Lanzhou University were enrolled From January 31, 2020 to February 22, 2020 Their clinical baseline data were collected The anxiety of patients was assessed by Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and the depression of patients was assessed by Hamilton Depression Scale Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors of anxiety and depression in these patients RESULTS: Female patients are more likely to have anxiety (OR=3 206, 95%CI: 1 073-9 583, P&lt;0 05) and depression (OR=9 111, 95%CI: 2 143-38 729, P&lt;0 01) than male patients;patients with known contact history of epidemic area and personnel in epidemic area are more likely to have depression (OR=3 267, 95%CI: 1 082-9 597, P&lt;0 05) CONCLUSIONS: During the isolation treatment of suspected COVID-19 patients, early psychological intervention should be carried out for the female patients with known contact history of epidemic area and personnel in epidemic area, and drug treatment should be given in advance if necessary","output":"[Clinical analysis of suspected COVID-19 patients with anxiety and depression]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To map COVID\\\\19\\\\specific worries and overall psychosocial health among people with diabetes in the initial phase of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in Denmark, and to explore characteristics of people with diabetes and high levels of worries related to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

To address this problem, the creation of triage committees (TC) was proposed, whose main function is to select the best candidates to receive ALS. The main objective of our study is to describe the clinical characteristics of the patients evaluated by the TC of the Alcorcn Foundation University Hospital (AFUH) during the first wave of SARS CoV-2. Other objectives are to determine if there are differences between the patients considered candidates / not candidates for ALS and to analyze the functioning of the TC. METHODS: Retrospective observational study of all patients assessed by the AFUH TC. RESULTS: There were 19 meetings, in which 181 patients were evaluated, 65.4% male and with a mean age of 70.1 years. 31% had some degree of functional dependence, the Barthel median was 100 and Charlson 4. 58.5% were not considered a candidate for ALS at that time. The patients considered candidates to receive ALS were younger (72 vs 66; p < 0.001), had less comorbidity (Charlson 4 vs 3; p < 0.001) and had a better previous functional situation. A median of 5 physicians participated in each meeting and, after being assessed by the TC, 13.6% received ALS: 29.3% of those considered candidates for ALS and 2% of the non-candidates. CONCLUSIONS: The patients evaluated by the TC had a mean age of 70 years, high comorbidity and almost a third had some degree of functional dependence. More than half were not considered candidates for ALS at that time, these patients being older, with more comorbidity and a worse previous functional situation. TC decisions, based on objective clinical criteria, were almost always respected. Public institutions must get involved in triage procedures, which should and in our opinion must include the creation of TC in health centers.

Scale-up of evidence-based psychosocial interventions is a key challenge. We developed the Thinking Healthy Program (THP), a psychosocial intervention that can be delivered by nonspecialist providers such as community health workers in primary and secondary care settings. Methods: A number of trials have been conducted on the THP, which have established its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in diverse settings. In the original trial based on 903 women, results at 6 months postnatal showed that 77% of intervened mothers (vs 47% of the nonintervened group) recovered from depression (adjusted OR = 0.22;95% CI, 0.14-0.36;p < 0.0001). This effect was sustained at 12 months postnatal. More recently, we pooled data from 2 new trials with a total of 850 women across Pakistan and India. Mothers in the intervention arm had higher odds of remission rates and lower symptom severity at 6 months postnatal compared to control mothers (adjusted OR = 1.35;95% CI, 1.02-1.78) (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] score adjusted mean difference = C0.78;95% CI, C1.47 to C0.09). All trials also showed improvements on a number of secondary outcomes including child outcomes. We synthesize and discuss the global lessons and implications of having shown that THP is effective in diverse settings and that the policy and practice uptake of the program globally has been promising. Results: We find that the THP is relatively inexpensive and culturally transferable;the intervention can be integrated with existing maternal and child health programs;the program is amenable to task-sharing/task-shifting via lay peers, nurses, community health workers, and other frontline workers;there are cascaded models of training and supervision;and the technology is used for training and delivery to provide exciting future avenues for scaled-up implementation. Conclusions: These innovations are relevant to the neglected field of public mental health, especially in the postCCOVID-19 era when rates of anxiety and depression are likely to rise globally.

In response to COVID-19, cities nationwide temporarily housed people experiencing homelessness in unused hotels. One such initiative in New Orleans also enacted a screening, counseling, and linkage-to-care model for HIV and HCV treatment for this temporarily housed population between May and July 2020. METHODS: A non-concurrent cohort study was performed assessing follow up in the treatment of HIV and HCV for this population. Outcome data was collected on seropositive patients' electronic medical record to assess patient progression through the treatment cascade. RESULTS: Of 102 unhoused residents, 25 (24.5%) tested HCV seropositive. Of the HCV positive 21/25 (84%) were connected to the associated clinic for follow up care and 10 (40%) obtained HCV treatment medication. Furthermore, all three patients who tested seropositive for HIV either started or re-initiated anti-viral treatment. The greatest barrier to providing medication for the HCV seropositive patients, once care was initiated, was loss-to-follow-up. CONCLUSION: Targeting homeless persons living in temporary residences for HCV and HIV screening can be effective at promoting access to care for those infected due to this population's high HCV seropositivity especially significant if the patient has a history of intravenous drug use or is over the age of 40.

Application of these siRNAs led to a significant protection of the cells, and virus titers decreased drastically. siRNAs derived from DNA plasmids expressing small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were also effective. The protection was most pronounced with two siRNAs targeting the open reading frame 1 (coding for non-structural proteins), whereas siRNAs targeting sequences for several structural proteins had less or no effect. In addition, it was investigated whether RNAi could be used to treat cells with an already established viral infection. Only application of the siRNAs shortly after viral challenge led to significant survival rates of the cells, whereas transfection at later time points caused much less benefit for the cells.

METHODS Consecutive patients with obstructed defecation symptoms (ODS) associated with rectocele who had the TRREMS procedure were included. Each patient was assessed by echodefecography, manometry, and colonic transit time as well as the Cleveland Clinic constipation score (CCS) before therapy and at follow-up after 6 months. Reduction in the CCS score was calculated as a ratio. Factors correlated with a decrease in the CCS were analyzed in a univariate analysis. RESULTS A total of 81 patients were included. Nineteen patients had postoperative complications that were not severe: 7 (8.6%) had tenesmus, 6 (7.4%) stenosis (4 treated with digital dilatation and 2 with endoscopic stricturectomy), 4 (4.9%) residual mucosal prolapse treated with rubber band ligation, 1 (1.2%) early bleeding, and 1(1.2%) thrombosis. Seventy-nine (97.5%) patients had a significant clinical response with significant reduction of the CCS constipation score from median 13 (range 17-10) to 4 (range, 8-2) (p = 0.0001); only 2 patients (2.5%) had an unsatisfactory response, complaining of straining and vaginal digitation during the evacuatory effort. Patients with anismus previously treated with biofeedback had a lower reduction ratio of the CCS score compared with patients without anismus (61.2  2.8% versus 70.9%  1.5, p = 0.0006). There were no significant differences in the reduction of the CCS according to age, parity, type of delivery, previous hysterectomy, post-menopausal status, rectal mucosal prolapse and/or associated rectal intussusception, grade of rectocele and presence of complications.

Albumin is an important tool in the therapy of cirrhotic ascites. By virtue of its oncotic properties, it reduces the risk of cardiovascular dysfunction after paracentesis. Treatment with albumin also counteracts the development of hepatorenal syndrome and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. More recently, the positive impact of long-term albumin supplementation in liver disease, based on its pleiotropic non-oncotic activities, has been recognized. These include transport of endo- and exogenous substances, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities, and stabilizing effects on the endothelium. Besides the growing recognition that effective albumin therapy requires adjustment of the plasma level to normal physiological values, the search for substances with adjuvant activities is becoming increasingly important. More than 75% of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis do not only present with hypoalbuminemia but also with zinc deficiency. There is a close relationship between albumin and the essential trace element zinc. First and foremost, albumin is the main carrier of zinc in plasma, and is hence critical for systemic distribution of zinc. In this review, we discuss important functions of albumin in the context of metabolic, immunological, oxidative, transport, and distribution processes, alongside crucial functions and effects of zinc and their mutual dependencies. In particular, we focus on the major role of chronic inflammatory processes in pathogenesis and progression of liver cirrhosis and how albumin therapy and zinc supplementation may affect these processes.","output":"Albumin Substitution in Decompensated Liver Cirrhosis: Dont Forget Zinc"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective policies that address both the supply and demand dimensions of access to affordable, healthy foods are required for tackling malnutrition in South East Asia.

We aimed to determine the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the UK nursing and midwifery workforce and identify potential factors associated with signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. METHODS: A United Kingdom national online survey was conducted at three time-points during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic between April and August 2020 (T1 and T2 during initial wave; T3 at three-months following the first wave). All members of the UK registered and unregistered nursing and midwifery workforce were eligible to participate. The survey was promoted via social media and through organisational email and newsletters. The primary outcome was an Impact of Events Scale-Revised score indicative of a post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis (defined using the cut-off score 33). Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to assess the association between explanatory variables and post-traumatic stress disorder. RESULTS: We received 7840 eligible responses (T1- 2040; T2- 3638; T3- 2162). Overall, 91.6% participants were female, 77.2% were adult registered nurses, and 28.7% were redeployed during the pandemic. An Impact of Events Scale-Revised score 33 (probable post-traumatic stress disorder) was observed in 44.6%, 37.1%, and 29.3% participants at T1, T2, and T3 respectively. At all three time-points, both personal and workplace factors were associated with probable post-traumatic stress disorder, although some specific associations changed over the course of the pandemic. Increased age was associated with reduced probable post-traumatic stress disorder at T1 and T2 (e.g. 41-50 years at T1 odds ratio (OR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-0.86), but not at T3. Similarly, redeployment with inadequate/ no training was associated with increased probable post-traumatic stress disorder at T1 and T2, but not at T3 (T1 OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.06-1.77; T3 OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.89-1.55). A lack of confidence in infection prevention and control training was associated with increased probable post-traumatic stress disorder at all three time-points (e.g. T1 OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.11-1.97).

A systematic literature review was performed on 31 empirical research published on the Scopus database for 1993 to 2020. This study also suggests new avenues and insights for future research by analysing the articles into three primary levels according to the scope (environmental, university, and individual), which would help to find the main focus of researchers and draw a clear picture of literature gap. Moreover, this study is the first by far to provide and discuss the key variables (gender, age, accounting ethics course) used by previous studies. The study findings help provide an overarching picture of the accounting ethics education patterns and trends to avoid falling into the same mistakes. In addition, these results draw potential future avenues to bridge the current literature void by presenting fruitful and indispensable directions for future research in the post-pandemic world. It also suggests multidimensional and in-depth insights for reforming the accounting ethics education pedagogy.","output":"Rethinking the accounting ethics education research in the post- COVID-19 context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The encounter with the rampant novel Corona virus infection has led the healthcare system across the world to update and modify its tools to fight this pandemic.

Here, we examined the manifestations of the COVID-19 outbreak on the brain structure in the healthy population, following the initial phase of the pandemic in Israel. We pre-registered our hypothesis that the intense experience of the outbreak potentially induced stress-related brain modifications. Volumetric changes in n = 50 participants who were scanned before and after the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown, were compared with n = 50 control participants who were scanned twice prior to the pandemic. The pandemic provided a rare opportunity to examine brain plasticity in a natural experiment. We found volumetric increases in bilateral amygdalae, putamen, and the anterior temporal cortices. Changes in the amygdalae diminished as time elapsed from lockdown relief, suggesting that the intense experience associated with the pandemic outbreak induced transient volumetric changes in brain regions commonly associated with stress and anxiety.","output":"Brain volumetric changes in the general population following the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) remains a significant issue for global health, economics, and society. In order to balance epidemic control and economic recovery, many countries have successively announced the gradual relaxation of some lockdown restrictions. Hospitals and medical staff constitute the backbone in this war against COVID-19. In response to this serious situation, many hospitals went into emergency and impaired healthcare access to patients with conditions other than COVID-19. Therefore, gradually promoting hospital operations and functions back to the new normal is important, especially when this outbreak has been effectively controlled. In this study, we introduce existing and potential problems that could seriously affect people's health. Additionally, we propose that an especial transition phase between the emergency and regular modes of hospitals can be well adapted to the current situation.","output":"An especial transition phase of hospitals: the adaptation of hospital operations to the development of COVID-19 and policy adjustments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Policies requiring people to stay home during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in dramatic reductions in global carbon dioxide emissions At their lowest point, CO2 emissions dropped by 17% in early April, as China was ramping its economy back up and the US and other countries slowed theirs Researchers expect that these extreme decreases wont last the entire year and estimate that daily CO2 emissions will be down by at least 4% overall for 2020 (Nat Clim Change 2020, DOI: 10 1038/s41558-020-0797-x) The 17% decline is the biggest change in CO2 emissions since World War II, and may turn out to be the most precipitous drop ever observed, says Robert Jackson, an earth system scientist at Stanford University To estimate changes in CO2 emissions, Jackson and a team of researchers led by University of East Anglia climate scientist Corinne Le Qur used data on traffic, flights, steel production, electricity usage, and[truncated]","output":"CO2 emissions drop by 17% during the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present review describes the various roles of cyclodextrins (CDs) in vaccines against viruses and in antiviral therapeutics.

Today, robots could assist healthcare workers when they provide care to elderly patients, who constitute a particularly vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous work on user-centered design of assistive technologies in LTC facilities for seniors has identified positive impacts. The need to deal with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes the benefits of this approach, but also highlights some new challenges for which robots could be interesting solutions to be deployed in LTC facilities. This requires customization of telecommunication and audio/video/data processing to address specific clinical requirements and needs. This paper presents OpenTera, an open source telehealth framework, aiming to facilitate prototyping of such solutions by software and robotic designers. Designed as a microservice-oriented platform, OpenTera is an end-to-end solution that employs a series of independent modules for tasks such as data and session management, telehealth, daily assistive tasks/actions, together with smart devices and environments, all connected through the framework. After explaining the framework, we illustrate how OpenTera can be used to implement robotic solutions for different applications identified in LTC facilities and homes, and we describe how we plan to validate them through field trials.","output":"OpenTera: A microservice architecture solution for rapid prototyping of robotic solutions to COVID-19 challenges in care facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serological tests are an indispensable tool to understand the epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, particularly in areas where molecular diagnostics are limited. Poor assay performance may hinder the utility of these tests, including high rates of false-positivity previously reported in sub-Saharan Africa. From 312 Malian samples collected prior to 2020, we measured antibodies to the commonly tested SARS-CoV-2 antigens and four other betacoronaviruses by ELISA, and assessed functional cross-reactivity in a subset by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay. We then evaluated the performance of an ELISA developed in the US, using two-antigen SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and receptor-binding domain. To optimize test performance, we compared single and two-antigen approaches using existing assay cutoffs and population-specific cutoffs for Malian control samples (positive and negative). Background reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens was common in pre-pandemic samples compared to US controls (43.4% (135/311) for spike protein, 22.8% (71/312) for RBD, and 33.9% (79/233) for nucleocapsid protein). SARS-CoV-2 reactivity correlated weakly with other betacoronavirus reactivity, varied between Malian communities, and increased with age. No pre-pandemic samples demonstrated functional activity. Regardless of the cutoffs applied, specificity improved using a two-antigen approach. Test performance was optimal using a two-antigen assay with population-specific cutoffs derived from ROC curve analysis [Sensitivity: 73.9% (51.6-89.8), Specificity: 99.4% (97.7-99.9)].

Well-established estimates are currently based on IR functions modeled on post-crash variables, such as velocity change sustained by the vehicle (&#916;V); thence, these analyses do not directly suggest how pre-crash conditions can be modified to allow for IR reduction. Nevertheless, &#916;V can be disaggregated into two contributions which enable its apriori calculation, based only on the information available at the impact instant: the Crash Momentum Index (CMI), representing impact eccentricity at collision, and the closing velocity at collision (Vr). By extensively employing the CMI indicator, this work assesses the overall influence of impact eccentricity and closing velocity on the risk for occupants to sustain a serious injury. As CMI synthesizes indications regarding &#916;V, its use can be disjointed from the &#916;V itself for the derivation of high-quality IR models. This feature distinguishes CMI from the other eccentricity indicators available at the state-of-the-art, allowing for the contribution of eccentricity on IR to be completely isolated. Because of this element of originality, special attention is given to the CMI variable throughout the present work. Based on data extracted from the NASS/CDS database, the influence of the CMI and Vr variables on IR is specifically highlighted and analyzed from several perspectives. The feature ranking algorithm ReliefF, whose use is unprecedented in the accident analysis field, is first employed to assess importance of such impact-related variables in determining the injury outcome: if compared to vehicle-related and occupant-related variables (as category and age, respectively), the higher influence of CMI and Vr is initially highlighted. Secondly, the relevance of CMI and Vr is confirmed by fitting different predictive models: the fitted models which include the CMI predictor perform better than models which neglect the CMI, in terms of classical evaluation metrics. As a whole, considering the high predictive power of the proposed CMI-based models, this work provides valuable tools for the apriori assessment of IR.","output":"Injury risk assessment based on pre-crash variables: The role of closing velocity and impact eccentricity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims: Liver transplant (LT) recipients are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2-infection (COVID-19), due to immunosuppression and comorbidities. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on LT recipients compared to general population in the Campania region. Methods: : In this case-control double-centre study, we enrolled all consecutive adult LT recipients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infection. Data were collected at diagnosis of COVID-19 and during follow-up and compared with the regional population. Results: : Thirty LT recipients (3.28%) developed SARS-CoV-2-infection (76.6% male, median age 62.6 years). Sixteen (53.3%) were symptomatic. Common symptoms were fever, cough, fatigue, and anosmia. Twenty-five (83.4%) were outpatients, 5 (16.6%) required hospitalization (6.6% admitted to Intensive Care Unit, 6.6% developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and 6.6% died). Immunosuppressors were in 3 (10%) patients. Incidence rate of COVID-19 was similar between LT patients and general population (3.28% vs 4.37%, p=0.1) with higher rate of symptoms in LT patients (46.67% vs 15.87%, p<0.00). At univariate analysis, hospitalization and case fatality rates were higher in LT patients compared to general population (16.67% vs 4.54%, p=0.001;and 6.67% vs 1.76%, p=0.04, respectively). At multivariable logistic regression analysis, LT patients with COVID-19 were more frequently symptomatic (OR 5.44 [95%CI 2.44-12.17], p<0.00), whereas hospitalization and death for COVID-19 were not significatively associated with LT condition (p=0.72 and p=0.46, respectively) and were comparable with general population. Conclusions: : LT is not a risk factor for acquiring COVID-19.

WHO recommends considering outbreak risk using epidemiological criteria when deciding whether to conduct preventive vaccination campaigns during the pandemic. Methods: We used two to three models per infection to estimate the health impact of 50% reduced routine vaccination coverage in 2020 and delay of campaign vaccination from 2020 to 2021 for measles vaccination in Bangladesh, Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Sudan, for meningococcal A vaccination in Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria, and for yellow fever vaccination in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, and Nigeria. Our counterfactual comparative scenario was sustaining immunisation services at coverage projections made prior to COVID-19 (i.e. without any disruption). Results: Reduced routine vaccination coverage in 2020 without catch-up vaccination may lead to an increase in measles and yellow fever disease burden in the modelled countries. Delaying planned campaigns in Ethiopia and Nigeria by a year may significantly increase the risk of measles outbreaks (both countries did complete their supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs) planned for 2020). For yellow fever vaccination, delay in campaigns leads to a potential disease burden rise of >1 death per 100,000 people per year until the campaigns are implemented. For meningococcal A vaccination, short-term disruptions in 2020 are unlikely to have a significant impact due to the persistence of direct and indirect benefits from past introductory campaigns of the 1- to 29-year-old population, bolstered by inclusion of the vaccine into the routine immunisation schedule accompanied by further catch-up campaigns. Conclusions: The impact of COVID-19-related disruption to vaccination programs varies between infections and countries. Planning and implementation of campaigns should consider country and infection-specific epidemiological factors and local immunity gaps worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic when prioritising vaccines and strategies for catch-up vaccination.

Methods: Up to two issues each of RQES published in 1999, 2009, and 2019 were randomly sampled, and references for articles were verified for accuracy. A total of 1,341 references from 50 articles were verified: 1999 (439 references), 2009 (396 references), and 2019 (506 references). Results: The overall error rate was 40% across the three years (i.e., number of references with at least one error divided by the total number of references and multiplied by 100). Chi-square analyses indicated no significant differences between years for the overall error rate (p > .05): 44% (1999), 38% (2009), and 39% (2019). Chi-square analyses indicated significant differences between years for at least one reference with an error related to author(s) names (p > .05). Chi-square analyses indicated significant differences between years for at least one reference with an error related to the article title. Conclusions: In the author's opinion, an overall error rate of 40% across the three years for RQES is simply too high. Ultimately, it is authors' responsibility to ensure reference accuracy. However, given the unacceptable error rates across fields of study, journals, and publication years, it may be prudent to explore supplemental options to increase reference accuracy in peer-reviewed articles.

The key role in this is played by cis elements of the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) and, in particular, by the internal ribosome entry site (IRES). The function of translational cis elements requires both canonical translation initiation factors (eIFs) and additional IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs). All known ITAFs are cell RNA-binding proteins which play a variety of functions in noninfected cells. Specific features of translational cis elements substantially affect the phenotype and, in particular, tissue tropism and pathogenic properties of picornaviruses. It is clear that, in some cases, the molecular mechanism of this is a change in interactions between viral cis elements and ITAFs. The properties and tissue distribution of ITAFs may determine the biological properties of other viruses that also use the IRES-dependent translation initiation.

The risk of transmission decreases with adequate knowledge of infection prevention methods. However, health care workers reportedly lack a proper attitude and knowledge of different viral outbreaks. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude of health care workers in Saudi Arabia toward COVID-19. Assessment of these parameters may help researchers focus on areas that require improvement. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted among 563 participants recruited from multiple cities in Saudi Arabia. An online questionnaire was shared via social media applications, which contained questions to health care workers about general information regarding COVID-19 and standard practices. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 30.7 (SD 8) years. Approximately 8.3% (47/563) of the health care workers were isolated as suspected cases of COVID-19, and 0.9% (n=5) were found positive. The majority agreed that social distancing, face masks, and hand washing are effective methods for preventing disease transmission. However, only 63.7% (n=359) knew the correct duration of hand washing. Almost 70% (n=394) strictly adhered to hand hygiene practices, but less than half complied with the practice of wearing a face mask. Significant differences in health care workers' attitudes were observed on the basis of their city of residence, their adherence to COVID-19 practices, and their compliance with the use of a face mask. Among the health care workers, 27.2% (n=153) declared that they will isolate themselves at home and take influenza medication if they experience COVID-19 symptoms.

The existing literature on the impact of COVID-19 in the education sector is predominantly descriptive and focused on the difficulties faced by teachers during the process of transferring into online teaching, mainly in the higher education sector. This study adopted a mixed-method design to examine online teaching self-efficacy (TSE) during COVID-19, its associated factors and moderators. A sample of 351 Chinese school teachers retrospectively reported their online TSE at the beginning and end of COVID-19 school lockdown, out of which six were followed up for an in-depth interview. TSE for online instruction did not significantly increase ( = .014, p > 0.05) whereas that for technology application increased significantly ( = .231, p < 0.01). Lack of experience in online teaching, separation of teachers from students, school administrative process and unsatisfactory student academic performance were identified as the major associated factors. A moderation effect of adaptability and teacher burnout on the change in online TSE were examined, of which passion burnout was the only significant moderator toward the change in online TSE.

The secondary goal is to provide a means of operation that does not require permanent fixing to a vessel's deck/structure. Based on thorough market research, there are options available for invasive pylons that require altering the deck/structure of the vessel, or temporary pylons that can be assembled but do not provide any variation in height. By utilising this gap in the market, it is the desire of the project to produce a product that builds on the existing strengths of similar products without their drawbacks, whilst still being a cost-effective solution. This project has focused on design of the pylon through all stages of the development process, from market research and product requirements based on customer needs, to design and product development. By developing and understanding the chosen designs using an analytical hierarchy process, the most appropriate option has been determined. The project then developed said design, initially understanding the loads and stresses acting up the pylon, as well as the material requirements. Using these calculations to generate a refined search via appropriate material selection software, the most appropriate material was identified.

Capabilities for business to track and trace victims of modern slavery will be reduced because of the pandemic. Opportunities exist for gathering data and building internal awareness about the problem of modern slavery in supply chains and to reassess operational risk and investment in modern slavery reduction. With the pause in external reporting opportunity exists to obtain views of external stakeholders.Research limitations/implicationsBecause of the relatively short period of the COVID-19 pandemic to date, numeric data on impacts are largely unavailable.Originality/valueThis is the first paper to consider the challenges and opportunities of COVID-19 on accounting for modern slavery in business.

After validating these measures with comparable measures from ATUS as well as realized work-from-home rates during the pandemic, we employ the measures to study the characteristics of workers in these types of jobs. Our results show that workers in low-work-from-home and high-physical-proximity jobs are more economically vulnerable across various measures constructed from the CPS and PSID: they are less educated, of lower income, have fewer liquid assets relative to income, and are more likely renters. Consistent with the idea that high physical proximity or low work-from-home occupations were more exposed to the Coronavirus shock, we show that the types of workers predicted to be employed in them experienced greater declines in employment during the pandemic. We conclude by comparing the aggregate employment losses in these occupations to their employment losses in the 2008 recession, and ?nd evidence that these occupations were disproportionately exposed to the pandemic shock, and not just comprised of more cyclically sensitive workers.","output":"Which Workers Bear the Burden of Social Distancing?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A pediatric MRI service is a vital component of a successful radiology department.

Summary of Background: Sagittal balance is increasingly recognized as a predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with DK, while the relationship between different sagittal parameters in patients with DK remains unidentified. Methods: A retrospective study with 279 participants was conducted. There were 168 DK patients which were divided into a sagittal balance group (SB:52 cases) and sagittal imbalance (SIB:116 cases). Radiographic measurements included thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK), lumbar lordosis (LL), thoracic kyphosis (TK), pelvic incidence (PI), and pelvic tilt (PT). The correlations were analyzed between different sagittal parameters. Results: There were significant differences between the SB and SIB groups in terms of TLK, LL, PI-LL, PT, SVA, sacral slope (SS), and TK. For patients with DK, the LL was correlated with PT and TK. The linear regression was LL = 22.76-0.28  PT + 0.62  TK. In the SB group, TK was the influencing factor for LL and the linear regression analysis showed that LL = 33.57 + 0.33  TK. While in the SIB group, PT and TK were in synergistic effect with PI-LL, the linear regression analysis showed that LL = 22.76-0.28  PT + 0.62  TK. Conclusion: From the present study, we can see that LL has a significant correlation with PT and TK in patients with DK, while in SB, the LL was only correlated with TK. Therefore, the correction of LL in a different group should be calculated to avoid the incidence of proximal junction kyphosis (PJK).","output":"Correlation Between Different Sagittal Parameters in Patients With Degenerative Kyphosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zoonoses, diseases that can spread under natural conditions between humans and other animals, are become a major public health concern in many countries including Canada. In Canada, investigations of zoonotic disease incidents are often conducted by public health inspectors (PHIs). However, little is known about PHIs' knowledge of transmission of zoonotic pathogens, their perceptions of zoonotic disease importance or their education regarding zoonotic diseases. The objective of this study was therefore to assess the knowledge, perceptions and education of Canadian PHIs regarding zoonotic diseases. Data were collected from December 2008CJanuary 2009 using an internet\\\\based survey distributed to members of the Canadian Institute of Public Health Inspectors national listserv. Responses were received from 229 PHIs in four provinces, with a response rate of approximately 20%. The majority of respondents reported at least 10 years of experience in the public health sector, 80% (181/225) were in frontline positions, and 62% (137/222) were routinely involved in investigations of infectious diseases. Two\\\\thirds believed that the importance of zoonotic diseases with regards to public health would increase in the next 5 years. Whilst most respondents were able to correctly identify animals capable of directly transmitting common zoonotic pathogens, there were gaps in knowledge, particularly with regard to rabies and transmission of gastrointestinal pathogens by companion animals. PHIs tended to feel that their training on zoonotic diseases prior to working as PHIs was deficient in some areas, or left some room for improvement. Their responses also suggested that there is a need for improvement in both the quantity and the quality of continuing education on zoonotic diseases. In particular, less than one\\\\third of PHIs received ongoing continuing education regarding zoonotic diseases, and of those that did, nearly two\\\\thirds rated the quantity and quality as only fair.","output":"A Survey of Canadian Public Health Personnel Regarding Knowledge, Practice and Education of Zoonotic Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Geometrically complex anatomical regions are difficult to represent in 2D images presented to students in lecture slides and reference texts. This problem has been traditionally mitigated by interactions with cadaveric specimens or other 3D anatomical models. However, given a recent trend away from cadaver-based anatomy education and exasperated by remote teaching in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, student access to more interactive means of learning have been limited. In response to these issues, we have created an immersive, web-based tour of the heart using the Mozilla Hubs platform. A 3D model of a human heart displaying all internal features, coronary arteries, and great vessels was developed into a virtual space to serve as a digital classroom. To supplement the morphology of the heart, additional informational panels, structure labels, and pathways through the heart were added. Students choose an avatar and navigate using keyboard commands reminiscent of PC and web-based gaming, and the virtual classroom affords the ability to communicate with others in the space verbally or through text. The scale of the heart relative to an avatar is such that users experience each chamber as a large room where they are able to look up and down, rotate completely, and walk along a horizontal plane within and between each chamber. This resource was deployed as a supplemental, non-mandatory experience first introduced with a faculty member present following the heart and mediastinum lab, though the link to the experience was made available for students to return at any time. Three anonymous surveys were sent to students. The pre-experience survey asked 3 multiple choice questions on heart anatomy (n=24). The second was given following the experience, asking the same 3 multiple choice questions and for feedback on the utility of the experience itself (n=15). Of the 3 questions, the first increased in percent correct from 95.83% to 100%, the second question decreased from 83.33% to 80%, and the final question increased from 79.17% to 100% correct. In the post survey 93.33% of respondents reported they were very or somewhat likely to return to the experience for independent review and 57.15% reported they were very or somewhat likely to return with peers or a faculty member. 93.33% agreed that the experience increased their knowledge of the spatial relationships of the structures within each chamber and 86.67% agreed that the experience increased their knowledge of the structures found in each chamber. The final survey, sent out 4 weeks later at the end of the course, was open to the entire class (n=65). Among the same 3 multiple choice questions, the first was answered correctly by 100% of responders, the second by 98.46%, and the last by 93.85%. The majority (3/5) of incorrect answers were provided by students who did not engage in the Hubs experience at all. Of the students who did utilize the experience, 54.17% agreed it helped them understand the locations of and geometric relationships between internal structures of the heart at the time, 20.83% agreed it helped perform better on the thorax exam, and 25% agreed it helped retain knowledge of the internal structures of the heart.

However, there is a debate in the literature on whether the pig model of HSRs can be used as a safety test for the prediction of severe adverse reactions in humans. Given the importance of using appropriate animal models for toxicity/safety testing, the choice of the right species and model is a critical decision. In order to facilitate the decision process and to expand the relevant information regarding the pig or no pig dilemma, this review examines an ill-fated clinical development program conducted by Baxter Corporation in the United States 24 years ago, when HemeAssist, an  (diaspirin) crosslinked hemoglobin-based O(2) carrier (HBOC) was tested in trauma patients. The study showed increased mortality in the treatment group relative to controls and had to be stopped. This disappointing result had far-reaching consequences and contributed to the setback in blood substitute research ever since. Importantly, the increased mortality of trauma patients was predicted in pig experiments conducted by US Army scientists, yet they were considered irrelevant to humans. Here we draw attention to that the underlying cause of hemoglobin-induced aggravation of hemorrhagic shock and severe HSRs have a common pathomechanism: cardiovascular distress due to vasoconstrictive effects of hemoglobin (Hb) and reactogenic nanomedicines, manifested, among others, in pulmonary hypertension. The main difference is that in the case of Hb this effect is due to NO-binding, while nanomedicines can trigger the release of proinflammatory mediators. Because of the higher sensitivity of cloven-hoof animals to this kind of cardiopulmonary distress compared to rodents, these reactions can be better reproduced in pigs than in murine or rat models. When deciding on the battery of tests and the appropriate models to identify the potential hazard for nanomedicine-induced severe HSR, the pros and cons of the various species must be considered carefully.","output":"The Critical Choice of Animal Models in Nanomedicine Safety Assessment: A Lesson Learned From Hemoglobin-Based Oxygen Carriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA interference (RNAi) as a mechanism to selectively degrade mRNA (mRNA) expression has emerged as a potential novel approach for drug target validation and the study of functional genomics.

METHODS: We abstracted and analyzed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 83 death cases with COVID-19 pneumonia in East Hospital of Wuhan University Renmin Hospital, between January 26, 2020, and February 28, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 83 deaths, none was the medical staff. The mean age was 71.8 years (SD 13.2; range, 34-97 years) and 53(63.9%) were male. The median from onset to admission was 10 days (IQR 7-14: range, 2-43 days), to death was 17 days (IQR 14-21: range, 6-54 days). Most deaths (66[80%]) had underlying comorbid diseases, the most of which was hypertension [47(57%)]. The main initial symptoms of these 83 deaths were shortness of breath(98.8%), fever(94%), and myalgia or fatigue(90.4%). Laboratory analyses showed the lymphocytopenia in 69(83%) deaths, hypoalbuminemia in 77(93%) deaths, the elevation of lactate dehydrogenase in 79(95%) deaths, procalcitonin in 69(83%) deaths and C-reactive protein in 79(95%) deaths.

We isolated SARS-CoV-2 spike proteinCspecific memory B cells by panning from the blood of convalescent subjects after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and sequenced and expressed Ig genes from individual B cells as human mAbs. All of 43 human mAbs generated in this way neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Eighteen of the forty-three human mAbs exhibited half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of 6.7  10(C12) M to 6.7  10(C15) M for spike-pseudotyped virus. Seven of the human mAbs also neutralized (with IC(50) < 6.7  10(C12) M) viruses pseudotyped with mutant spike proteins (including receptor-binding domain mutants and the S1 C-terminal D614G mutant). Neutralization of the Wuhan Hu-1 founder strain and of some variants decreased when coding sequences were reverted to germline, suggesting that potency of neutralization was acquired by somatic hypermutation and selection of B cells. These results indicate that infection with SARS-CoV-2 evokes high-affinity B cell responses, some products of which are broadly neutralizing and others highly strain specific. We also identify variants that would potentially resist immunity evoked by infection with the Wuhan Hu-1 founder strain or by vaccines developed with products of that strain, suggesting evolutionary courses that SARS-CoV-2 could take.","output":"IgV somatic mutation of human antiCSARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies governs neutralization and breadth of reactivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Flavonoids, a class of polyphenols, consumed daily in our diet, are associated with a reduced risk for oxidative stress (OS)-related chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and inflammation.

An evaluation of daily changes of the parasitic load in peripheral blood was also performed. A comprehensive clinical examination and the collection of several samples (blood, lymph node, skin, and conjunctiva) were performed in 140 dogs living in an endemic area. Among these, only the dogs with clinically evident leishmaniasis were enrolled (39/140; 27.9%). Twelve (30.8%) out of 39 showed parasitemia, with a low load (median: 4 Leishmania/ml) despite a high lymph node parasite load (median: 4000 Leishmania/ml) and high IFAT titers ( 1:640). Seven sick dogs were sampled every 4 h for 6 times during a 24-h period, in order to obtain light- and dark-span samples. Only one (14.3%) out of the seven serial sampled dogs showed Leishmania DNA in the peripheral blood in two samples (2/42; 4.8%). Surprisingly, Leishmania DNA was also detected in the peripheral blood of asymptomatic dogs, negative to both serology and PCR performed on samples other than blood (6/101; 5.9%).

Moreover, circulating Leishmania DNA can be found even in healthy dogs. This finding is important in clinical practice because in endemic areas it suggests a transfusion risk and a possible transmission to the vector.","output":"Parasitemia and its daily variation in canine leishmaniasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Standardized entrance exams are used in many health professions as one way to objectively measure knowledge and facilitate comparisons across student groups. The physician assistant (PA) profession has historically not employed a profession-specific entrance exam, and the idea was never seriously explored until the Physician Assistant College Admissions Test was developed recently by a commercial assessment publisher, with field testing in some volunteer programs in 2018 and the exam's first administration in May of 2020. The 2020 Physician Assistant Education Association Presidents Commission chose to investigate the issues raised by a consensus-derived, PA-specific entrance exam to stimulate more informed discussion on the efficacy of such an exam. While it may have the potential to enhance efficiency in PA admissions and reduce variability in admissions requirements, a PA entrance exam would also likely introduce new challenges, including increased costs, impact on the diversity of the applicant pool, and incongruence with an increasingly holistic admissions process. The biggest barrier would likely be the lack of current consensus on the knowledge, skills, and attributes that matriculants need to be successful in the program and in clinical practice. Development of a consensus-derived PA entrance exam would be a complex, expensive, and time-consuming endeavor, requiring considerable attention to technical issues of psychometric quality, process transparency, and legal defensibility. Changes being made to health professions admissions practices due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the dropping of test scores as a requirement by some institutions, may make some of the issues raised in this paper more timely than ever.","output":"Reflections on a Physician Assistant Entrance Exam: Does the Profession Need One?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its origin in China, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has become a pandemic and spread to 209 countries. As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a very rapidly emerging disease, organ-specific studies related to it have been reported. Apart from respiratory findings, some studies have highlighted inflammatory consequences in the heart, kidney, and/or liver as well. Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 seems to be a result of an inflammatory storm in response to the infection. Moreover, direct viral invasion of cardiomyocytes, as well as a myocardial injury due to oxidative stress, may account for acute cardiac injury in COVID-19. Nevertheless, the mechanism of heart injury in COVID-19 is not clear yet. However, multiple studies that highlight the clinical features, laboratory findings, and prognosis of acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19-affected individuals have been published. In this review, we have summarized the findings of all those studies as well as the clinical features and management of cardiac injury discussed by some case reports.","output":"Cardiac Manifestations of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Comprehensive Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We previously reported a new polymer, lactic-co-glycolic acid-polyethylenimine (LGA-PEI), as an improved nanoparticle (NP) delivery for therapeutic nucleic acids (TNAs).

Therefore, we implemented immunoinformatics approach to design an efficient multi-epitopes vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. ResultsThe designed vaccine construct has several immunodominant epitopes from structural proteins of Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane and Envelope. These peptides promote cellular and humoral immunity and Interferon gamma responses. In addition, these epitopes have antigenicity ability and no allergenicity probability. To enhance the vaccine immunogenicity, we used three potent adjuvants; Flagellin, a driven peptide from high mobility group box 1 as HP-91 and human beta defensin 3 protein. The physicochemical and immunological properties of the vaccine structure were evaluated. Tertiary structure of the vaccine protein was predicted and refined by I-Tasser and galaxi refine and validated using Rampage and ERRAT. Results of Ellipro showed 242 residues from vaccine might be conformational B cell epitopes. Docking of vaccine with Toll-Like Receptors 3, 5 and 8 proved an appropriate interaction between the vaccine and receptor proteins. In silico cloning demonstrated that the vaccine can be efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli. ConclusionsThe designed multi epitope vaccine is potentially antigenic in nature and has the ability to induce humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. This vaccine can interact appropriately with the TLR3, 5, and 8.

These channels and their related degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) family are often characterized by their sensitivity to amiloride inhibition. However, amiloride can also cause paradoxical potentiation of ASIC currents under certain conditions. Here we characterized and investigated the determinants of paradoxical potentiation by amiloride on ASIC3 channels. While inhibiting currents induced by acidic pH, amiloride potentiated sustained currents at neutral pH activation. These effects were accompanied by alterations in gating properties including (1) an alkaline shift of pH-dependent activation, (2) inhibition of pH-dependent steady-state desensitization (SSD), (3) prolongation of desensitization kinetics, and (4) speeding of recovery from desensitization. Interestingly, extracellular Ca2+ was required for paradoxical potentiation and it diminishes the amiloride-induced inhibition of SSD. Site-directed mutagenesis within the extracellular non-proton ligand-sensing domain (E79A, E423A) demonstrated that these residues were critical in mediating the amiloride-induced inhibition of SSD. However, disruption of the purported amiloride binding site (G445C) within the channel pore blunted both the inhibition and potentiation of amiloride. Together, our results suggest that the myriad of modulatory and blocking effects of amiloride are the result of a complex competitive interaction between amiloride, Ca2+, and protons at probably more than one site in the channel.","output":"Paradoxical Potentiation of Acid-Sensing Ion Channel 3 (ASIC3) by Amiloride via Multiple Mechanisms and Sites Within the Channel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Wheezing is a common problem in children under five with acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Viruses are known to be responsible for a considerable proportion of ARIs in children. This study was undertaken to know the viral aetiology of wheezing among the children less than five years of age, admitted to a tertiary care hospital in eastern India. METHODS: Seventy five children, under the age of five years admitted with wheezing, were included in the study. Throat and nasal swabs were collected, and real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to screen for influenza 1 and 2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1, 2, 3 and 4, rhinovirus, human meta-pneumovirus, bocavirus (HBoV), Coronavirus, adenovirus, Enterovirus and Parechovirus. RESULTS: The total viral detection rate was 28.57 per cent. Viral RNA markers were detected from children diagnosed to be having pneumonia (3 cases), bronchiolitis (9 cases), episodic wheeze (2 cases) and multitrigger wheeze (6 cases). RSV was the most common virus (35%) followed by PIV1, 2 and 3 (20%), HBoV (10%) and rhinovirus (5%). However, mixed infection was observed in 30 per cent of cases. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The study reported the presence of respiratory viral agents in 28.57 per cent of children with wheezing; RSV and PIV were most common, accounting to 55 per cent of the total cases. Mixed infection was reported in 30 per cent of cases. Seasonal variation in the occurrence of these viruses was also noted.

The aim of our mixed method study was to assess (a) how effective are virtual clinics vs face-to-face clinics in progressing patients' care and (b) what is patient satisfaction with virtual consultation methods. METHODS: Analysis of clinic data from patient databases for both virtual and face-to-face clinics was carried out. A patient satisfaction survey was carried out by 75 of the patients who had attended virtual clinics. RESULTS: There was statistically a significant difference (p value < 0.01) in the proportion of patients prescribed medical therapy, referred for Speech and Language Therapy (SALT) or listed for surgery in the virtual clinic by comparison to the face-to-face clinic. 75 patients completed the questionnaire. 98% of patients were satisfied overall with the virtual method of consultation. 84% believed they would still benefit from face-to-face review. 83% would like the option of a virtual type of clinic in the future. CONCLUSION: Our data clearly demonstrates that face-to-face clinics are superior to virtual clinics, with almost no patients progressed to surgery in virtual consultations. Despite this, virtual methods are still valuable, and many patients have meaningful progression of care. In current circumstances, patients have very high satisfaction with virtual consultations and certain groups have been identified as particularly benefiting.

A secondary objective was to explore changes in PrEP use and the need for PrEP follow-up. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey. The questionnaire was available in Dutch, French and English, between April 10 and 27 (2020), and disseminated via sexual health and lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer or intersex organisations throughout Belgium. Eligibility criteria included being 18 years or older, not being exclusively heterosexual and living or being born in Belgium. RESULTS: The sample included 694 MSM. Physical sex with non-steady partners decreased from 59.1% to 8.9% during the first weeks of the lockdown. Those who had sex with non-steady partners were significantly more likely to be HIV positive, to use PrEP or to have engaged in sexual practices such as group sex, chemsex and sex work before the lockdown, compared with their counterparts. Among those who used PrEP before the lockdown, 47.0% stopped using PrEP, 19.7% used event-driven PrEP and 33.3% used daily PrEP during the lockdown. Almost two-thirds of PrEP users had a PrEP care appointment in the weeks before the lockdown and a minority received follow-up elsewhere or online. Some PrEP users had concerns regarding their follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: MSM in our survey substantially reduced sexual contact with non-steady partners during the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown, suggesting that the risk for HIV and STI transmission in this period was low.

We tested the hypothesis that patients with coronavirus disease 2019-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome are at higher risk of in-hospital mortality due to prolonged coma compared with other patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome matched for disease severity. DESIGN: Propensity-matched cohort study. SETTING: Seven ICUs in an academic hospital network, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA). PATIENTS: All mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019 patients between March and May 2020 were identified and matched with patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome of other etiology. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Using clinical data obtained from a hospital registry, we matched 114 coronavirus disease 2019 patients to 228 noncoronavirus disease 2019-related acute respiratory distress syndrome patients based on baseline disease severity. Coma was identified using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale less than or equal to -3. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were used to assess the percentage of comatose days, sedative medications used, and the association between coronavirus disease 2019 and in-hospital mortality. In-hospital mortality (48.3% vs 31.6%, adjusted odds ratio, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.34-3.44; p = 0.002), the percentage of comatose days (66.0%  31.3% vs 36.0%  36.9%, adjusted difference, 29.35; 95% CI, 21.45-37.24; p < 0.001), and the hypnotic agent dose (51.3% vs 17.1% of maximum hypnotic agent dose given in the cohort; p < 0.001) were higher among patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Brain imaging did not show a higher frequency of structural brain lesions in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (6.1% vs 7.0%; p = 0.76). Hypnotic agent dose was associated with coma (adjusted coefficient, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45-0.78; p < 0.001) and mediated (p = 0.001) coma. Coma was associated with in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 5.84; 95% CI, 3.58-9.58; p < 0.001) and mediated 59% of in-hospital mortality (p < 0.001).

The immunoreactivity to full-length S proteins, C-terminal domain (CTD), and N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1 fragments were determined by an ELISA assay. Clinical properties at admission and discharge were collected simultaneously.

In Poland, the country where pregnancy and childbirth are subject to comparably greater medicalization, those shifts are particularly tangible. This study aimed at capturing how maternal health professionals tackle care over pregnant and birthing women during a pandemic, highlighting possible long-term implications for the expecting and new mothers. Methods: : This is a qualitative study which addresses the themes around the emerging implications of the viral outbreak. Semi-structured expert interviews were conducted with 46 individuals working in either medical or adjacent sectors connected with reproductive medicine. In this analysis, 7 digital experts were excluded as observers rather than field practitioners. Among 38 interviews, 5 have been conducted with OB-GYNs, 13 with midwives, 6 with doulas, 14 broadly-conceived category of maternal support experts. The recorded data were input into thematic grids and meticulously transcribed prior to being subject to an inductive, thematic analysis. Results: : The findings revealed that the context of the heightened medicalization of pregnancy and hospital care during birth in Poland, resulted in strong restrictions and immediate fall back to a clinical care model. The majority claimed that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the implications of the decades of Polish maternal health recommendations contradicting the WHO regulations. Professionals anxieties concern limited access to services assisting women during pregnancies. While those linked to hospitals pointed out physiological risks, other maternal support experts drew attention to the effects of stress and uncertainty on maternal mental health. Conclusions: : Experts face various challenges when providing care to pregnant and birthing women in Poland. They underscore both the information chaos surrounding recommendations and procedures, and see the pandemic as a moment of reflection, mostly being vocal in their critiques of the over-medicalized Polish care model. The interviewed maternal health experts believe that the pandemic will have multifaceted consequences that are being exacerbated by a sudden cessation of extensive degree of medicalization during pregnancy, and a fallback to alienation during intervention-focused hospital deliveries.","output":"Pregnancy and childbirth during the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland: qualitative evidence from expert interviews"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we develop a forecasting model for the spread of COVID-19 infection at a provincial (i.e., EU NUTS-3) level in Italy by using official data from the Italian Ministry of Health integrated with data extracted from daily official press conferences of regional authorities and local newspaper websites.

Culturable airborne bacteria and fungi were impacted on selected media to determine their concentrations and compositions with a Biolog Omnilog GEN III system and Biolog MicroStation. The indoor mean airborne bacterial count concentrations ranged from 35 to 18,463 CFU/m(3), concentrations that are higher than 2,000 CFU/m(3), demonstrating highCvery high contamination levels in all seasons. Fungal contamination was high in winter and summer, with detected concentrations > 2,000 CFU/m(3). Indoor-to-outdoor (I/O) ratios showed that airborne microbial contamination inside building floors originated from indoor air contamination. All the building floors showed bacterial and fungal concentrations ranging from less than 2,000 to more than 2,000 CFU/m(3), indicative of a high to very high air contamination level. Statistical analysis showed no correlation between bacterial and fungal concentrations, demonstrating that they originated from unrelated sources. In the indoor building air, the most prevalent bacterial isolate was Bacillus pseudomycoides/cereus, whereas the most dominant fungal isolate was Aspergillus spp. The low count for indoor air bacterial species suggested no particular health risk for the occupants. In contrast, the high count of indoor air fungal species in the winter samples and the presence of potentially allergenic genera detected may suggest possible health risks for the occupants.

However, there is significant uncertainty about the risks of cause-specific mortality in- and out-of-treatment. OBJECTIVE This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the association between methadone or buprenorphine with cause-specific mortality among opioid-dependent persons. METHODS We searched six online databases to identify relevant cohort studies, calculating all-cause and overdose-specific mortality rates during periods in- and out-of-treatment. We pooled mortality estimates using multivariate random effects meta-analysis of the crude mortality rate per 1000 person-years of follow-up as well as relative risks comparing mortality in-versus-out of treatment. RESULTS 32 cohort studies (representing 150,235 participants, 805,423.6 person-years, and 9112 deaths met eligibility criteria. Crude mortality rates were substantially higher among methadone cohorts than buprenorphine cohorts. Relative risk reduction was substantially higher with methadone relative to buprenorphine when time in-treatment was compared to time out-of-treatment.

The source data were obtained from 21 monitoring stations of Air Quality Control Company and meteorological stations in Tehran. To predict the status of future concentration of SO(2), PM(2.5) and PM(10), a BoxCJenkins ARIMA approach was used to model the monthly time series. Considering the whole period of ten years, a somewhat downward trend was noted for SO(2) air concentration, even though a slight rising trend was observed in 2020 year. Monthly sulfur dioxide concentrations showed the lowest value in June and the highest value in January. Seasonal concentrations were lowest in spring and highest in winter. Then, in the ArcGIS software, the IDW method was used to obtain air pollution zoning maps. As a result, the highest average concentration of SO(2) occurred in the north and southwest of Tehran. In the last step, Relations between the SO(2) concentration and particulate matters and relative humidity and wind speed were calculated statistically using the daily average data. We finally concluded that the combined effect of particulate matters and relative humidity with the increasing role of Sulfur dioxide overcomes the decreasing role of wind speed.

A cross-sectional retrospective survey was conducted from 15 May to 15 July 2021 among healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, midwives, and students at the Medical University of Lodz (nursing, midwifery and medical students) in Poland. Data were obtained from 1080 participants. The aim of the study was to evaluate vaccination coverage against COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Poland, and to analyze their attitude towards the available vaccines, stress before taking, and side effects after administrating them, and motivation towards continuing vaccination in the future (if necessary). The survey also estimated the frequency and quality of adverse post-vaccination reactions after two doses of BioNTech/Pfizer and two doses of AstraZeneca vaccines. The present study revealed that the vaccination ratio after 6 months from the start of vaccination against COVID-19 in Poland among HCWs was very high at 91.2%. However, doctors and medical students were more likely to be vaccinated than nurses and midwives, and nursing and midwifery students (94.8%, 98.3% vs. 78.9% and 86.3%, respectively). The main reasons that HCWs reported receiving a vaccination were to protect the health of themselves and their families, while the main reasons for avoiding a vaccination were fear of side effects, doubts about effectiveness, and an expedited clinical trial process of vaccines. Furthermore, more than two-thirds of those vaccinated reported side effects after receiving at least one dose of the vaccine. Most of the side effects were short-term symptoms with only slight and moderate intensification. The univariate and multivariate logistic regressions showed that the type of vaccine used had a significant impact on the occurrence of adverse post-vaccination effects and the severity and duration of vaccination symptoms. In addition, chronic disease and fear of vaccination also had some influence. Despite this, most participants (more often older than younger participants; p < 0.001) were in favor of compulsory vaccination against COVID-19 for HCWs.","output":"Pre-Vaccination Stress, Post-Vaccination Adverse Reactions, and Attitudes towards Vaccination after Receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine among Health Care Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unexpected challenges of COVID-19 forced our nation to \\"rework\\" normal practices and routines.

Specifically, we calibrate the model parameter values using actual COVID-19 data in Brazil by Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm such that we can study the effects of interventions on a practical case. Sensitivity analysis shows that non-pharmaceutical interventions are more effective than pharmaceutical interventions in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the interventions, namely home isolation, face-mask wearing and media publicity, can effectively reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Based on the new epidemic model, we formulate an optimal control model for studying the control of COVID-19 and then present a cost-effectiveness analysis to unravel the cost and effectiveness of the combination of intervention strategies. The results show that, when taking both the economic cost and the control effectiveness into account, strategy 7 appears to be preferred in inhibiting the COVID-19 outbreak, followed by strategy 5 and strategy 4.

In contrast, there is a remarkable scarcity of studies investigating the cellular basis of immune function and cytokine changes in psychosis. The few flow-cytometry studies have been limited to counting the proportion of the major classes of monocyte and lymphocytes without distinguishing their pro- and anti-inflammatory subsets. Moreover, most of the investigations are cross-sectional and conducted with patients on long-term medication. These features make it difficult to eliminate confounding of illness-related changes by lifestyle factors, disease duration, and long exposure to antipsychotics. This article focuses on regulatory T cells (Tregs), cornerstone immune cells that regulate innate and adaptive immune forces and neuro-immune interactions between astrocytes and microglia. Tregs are also implicated in cardio-metabolic disorders that are common comorbidities of psychosis. We have recently proposed that Tregs are hypofunctional (h-Tregs) in psychosis driven by our clinical findings and other independent research. Our h-Treg-glial imbalance hypothesis offers a new account for the co-occurrence of systemic immune dysregulation and mechanisms of psychosis development. This article extends our recent review, the h-Treg hypothesis, to cover new discoveries on Treg-based therapies from pre-clinical findings and their clinical implications. We provide a detailed characterisation of Treg studies in psychosis, identifying important methodological limitations and perspectives for scientific innovation. The outcomes presented in this article reaffirms our proposed h-Treg state in psychosis and reveals emerging preclinical research suggesting the potential benefit of Treg-enhancing therapies. There is a clear need for longitudinal studies conducted with drug-na?ve or minimally treated patients using more sophisticated techniques of flow-cytometry, CyTOF expression markers, and in vitro co-culture assays to formally test the suppressive capacity of Tregs.

A controversial topic has been the connection between COVID-19 and the Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS). COVID-19, like Sars before it, enters by way of the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues in the body serving as the doorway by which the virus can enter and spread causing inflammatory havoc. Demographic evidence coming out of China and other locations make it clear that the elderly and those suffering cardiovascular complications such as hypertension etc are most at risk. The connection to RAS and the demographic nature of the data coming out has led many to advance hypothesis, recommendations and even therapies based on existing RAS inhibitors and other components of the renin-Angiotensin system.

In addition to the physical health, economic, and social implications, the psychological impacts of this pandemic are increasingly being reported in the scientific literature. Individuals with certain pre-existing comorbidities have been identified as a high-risk group for fatalities of COVID-19 infection. Thus, this study aimed to analyse the association of COVID-19 symptoms and the presence of comorbidities with the mental health of the population during this pandemic. METHOD: A cross-sectional web-based online study was conducted from 13thJune to 31stJuly 2020, and link was circulated using social media platforms. Participants were of age 18 and residents of India were included. HERO's scale was used to assess the mental health status. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to examine associations. RESULTS: Out of 1021 eligible individuals (460-females, 561-males), 15.2% females and 11.2% males reported poor mental health status. The COVID-19 symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, cough, shortness of breath, runny nose, fever, and sore throat were associated with poor mental health among males, while only nausea, vomiting was associated among females. Also, the presence of any one or more comorbidities was associated with poor mental health across gender. CONCLUSION: Poor mental health was reported by both genders across the study population. Comorbidities and COVID-19 symptoms were significantly associated with poor mental health among males than females.

Lockdown is often an unpleasant experience due to a separation from loved ones, loss of freedom, and uncertainty over the disease status. To adjust, individuals and groups have had to adapt their perceptions of the event to the current scenario. This study aims to describe the perceptions of confined people on the changes occurring in their lives in the aftermath of the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: A total of 1,534 individuals (26.6% men; 73.4% women; mean age 41.6) responded to the questionnaire comprising 19 closed and five open-ended questions about the changes they anticipated in their lives in the immediate post-confinement era. Results: Two definite groups appeared in the results: those who lived the confinement pleasantly, and those for which it was painful. They differ according to their confinement conditions and perceived degree of exposure to the virus. There seems to be a link for those who had a pleasant experience to a lower perceived exposure to the virus and less burdensome confinement conditions (young children, surface area, etc.). Lockdown conditions seem to influence the respondents' perceptions: a pleasant experience is associated with a vision of the society's evolution at large, and the care about its economic and professional progress; a painful one is associated more with focusing on the immediate needs of social support and personal well-being.

White Leghorn specific-pathogen-free chickens were immunized with EV71 antigens and a specific isolated immunoglobulin (IgY) was prepared from the chicken egg yolk. IgY was further purified and characterized by SDS-PAGE, ELISA, western blotting and bidirectional immune agar diffusion testing. The antiviral activity and dose-response of the IgY were determined by assessing the cytopathic effect in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells in vitro. It was indicated that the levels of IgY were increased at day 7, peaked at week 7 and were maintained at a higher level for 4 weeks following immunization when compared with the negative control. The results of western blotting and bidirectional immune agar diffusion testing revealed that the IgY had cross-binding properties in EV71 and CVA16 strains through targeting the envelope proteins (VP0, VP1 and VP3) of EV71 and CVA16. Neutralization assay results indicated that the infectivity of EV71 and CVA16 strains in RD cells was cross-blocked by IgY in a dose-dependent manner.

Target binding triggers the MBL pathway of complement activation. MBL can be considered conceptually as an ante-antibody because it has a role in mammals during the lag period that is required to develop an antibody response against infectious agents. Additionally, there are MBL-like homologues in animals that lack adaptive immunity that activate a primitive complement system, and under these circumstances these MBL-like molecules play an analogous role to antibodies in higher animals. These molecules might be considered to be functional antecedents of antibodies. Recent work also indicates that MBL recognizes altered self-antigens, and as such MBL has a role that extends beyond a traditional role in first line host defense as it appears to play a role as a modulator of inflammation.","output":"The mannose-binding lectin: a prototypic pattern recognition molecule"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and the accompanying lockdown measures have had a major impact on societies around the world, leading to sleep problems for a large part of the population. In order to assess the sustainability of sleeping troubles related to the sanitary crisis, it was crucial to measure its prevalence after the end of the Covid-19 confinement. METHODS: As part of an epidemiological survey on Covid and Confinement (COCONEL), we enquired on sleep disorders using two items in 4 repetitive cross-sectional surveys. The first took place during the first week of the French confinement (March 31 to April 2; N = 1005 participants). The second took place in the middle of this period (April 15-17; N = 1005). The two last surveys were held at the end of the confinement (May 7-10; N = 2003) and one month after the end (June 10-12; N = 1736). Using a random constant, the mixed model took into account the longitudinal character of the last two waves (intra-individual correlations for individuals surveyed in waves 3 and 4). RESULTS: The prevalence of sleep problems significantly decreased during the last weeks of the confinement, and this trend was confirmed one month after the end of confinement. One quarter of the population reported that their sleep was better one month after the end of the confinement. Sleep improvement was reported more often by women and people aged less than 65. Such improvement was less frequent among those who were still highly exposed to the pandemic's media coverage after the end of the confinement. CONCLUSION: The possibility of recovering a good sleep largely depends on the type of sleep disorder. The decrease in sleep problems occurred mainly among people with mild sleep problems during the confinement. Further research is needed to assess the long-term effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and its confinement period on sleep quality in the general population.","output":"Would we recover better sleep at the end of Covid-19?

However, the consequences of lockdown on psychotic symptoms have been poorly investigated. METHODS: An online survey was run from April 13 to May 11, 2020; a total of 728 French subjects from the general population were included in the study. We assessed the perceived impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, length of isolation, diagnosis/symptoms/hospitalisation related to the COVID-19 (oneself and family). Paranoid ideations and hallucination-like experiences were assessed via the Paranoia Scale and the Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale, respectively. Self-reported measures of negative affect, loneliness, sleep difficulties, jumping to conclusion bias, repetitive thoughts, among others, were also included. RESULTS: Final regression model for paranoia indicated that socio-demographic variables (age, sex and education), loneliness, cognitive bias, anxiety, experiential avoidance, repetitive thoughts and hallucinations were associated with paranoia (R2 = 0.43). For hallucinations, clinical variables as well as the quality of sleep, behavioural activation, repetitive thoughts, anxiety and paranoia were associated with hallucinations in our sample (R2 = 0.27). Neither length of isolation nor the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with psychotic experiences in the final models.

In restrooms, the observed decay of aerosol concentrations was consistent with well-mixed air exchange. In all other locations, fast decay times were measured, which were found to be independent of aerosol size (typically a few minutes). From this, we conclude that in the main retail areas, including at checkouts, rapid turbulent mixing and advection is the dominant feature in aerosol dynamics. With this, the upper bound of risk for airborne disease transmission to a susceptible is determined by direct exposure to the exhalation cloud of an infectious. For the example of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we find when speaking without a face mask and aerosol sizes up to an exhalation (wet) diameter of 50m, a distance of 1.5me to be unsafe. However, at the smallest distance between an infectious and a susceptible, while wearing typical surgical masks and for all sizes of exhaled aerosol, the upper bound of infection risk is only [~] 5% and decreases further by a factor of 100 ([~] 0.05%) for typical FFP2 masks for a duration of 20 min.

The behavior of these indicators in bariatric patients with weight recidivism is unknown. We aimed to investigate both profiles in bariatric patients with high ratio of weight regain (RWR), comparing them with nonsurgical patients with obesity. METHODS: Forty patients with obesity subjected to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with high RWR composed the bariatric group, and 40 controls matched for BMI, age, and gender were recruited as nonsurgical group. Between-group comparisons were performed for clinical history, physical examination, biochemical, metabolic, and inflammatory profiles. RESULTS: Bariatric group was composed of a group with an excess weight loss of 85.9  16.8%, a RWR of 56.5  19.7%, and a time since surgery of 10.7  4.3 years. We noticed a lower proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia (P  0.05) and lower neck and waist circumferences (P  0.05) in this group.

We sought to assess risk of COVID-19 among front-line health-care workers compared with the general community and the effect of personal protective equipment (PPE) on risk. METHODS: We did a prospective, observational cohort study in the UK and the USA of the general community, including front-line health-care workers, using self-reported data from the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application (app) from March 24 (UK) and March 29 (USA) to April 23, 2020. Participants were voluntary users of the app and at first use provided information on demographic factors (including age, sex, race or ethnic background, height and weight, and occupation) and medical history, and subsequently reported any COVID-19 symptoms. We used Cox proportional hazards modelling to estimate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of our primary outcome, which was a positive COVID-19 test. The COVID Symptom Study app is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04331509. FINDINGS: Among 2 035 395 community individuals and 99 795 front-line health-care workers, we recorded 5545 incident reports of a positive COVID-19 test over 34 435 272 person-days. Compared with the general community, front-line health-care workers were at increased risk for reporting a positive COVID-19 test (adjusted HR 1161, 95% CI 1093C1233). To account for differences in testing frequency between front-line health-care workers and the general community and possible selection bias, an inverse probability-weighted model was used to adjust for the likelihood of receiving a COVID-19 test (adjusted HR 340, 95% CI 337C343). Secondary and post-hoc analyses suggested adequacy of PPE, clinical setting, and ethnic background were also important factors. INTERPRETATION: In the UK and the USA, risk of reporting a positive test for COVID-19 was increased among front-line health-care workers. Health-care systems should ensure adequate availability of PPE and develop additional strategies to protect health-care workers from COVID-19, particularly those from Black, Asian, and minority ethnic backgrounds. Additional follow-up of these observational findings is needed.

AJSAF is a purified active saponin fraction from the stem bark of Albizzia julibrissin. In this study, AJSAF was evaluated for the adjuvant potentials on immune responses to inactivated H9N2 avian influenza virus vaccine (IH9V) in mice and chicken in comparison with commercially oil-adjuvant. RESULTS: AJSAF significantly induced faster and higher H9 subtype avian influenza virus antigen (H9CAg)-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b antibody titers in mice and haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and IgY antibody levels in chicken immunized with IH9V. AJSAF also markedly promoted Con A-, LPS- and H9CAg-stimulated splenocyte proliferation and natural killer cell activity. Furthermore, AJSAF significantly induced the production of both Th1 (IL-2 and IFN-) and Th2 (IL-10) cytokines, and up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines and transcription factors in splenocytes from the IH9V-immunized mice. Although oil-formulated inactivated H9N2 avian influenza vaccine (CH9V) also elicited higher H9CAg-specific IgG and IgG1 in mice and HI antibody titer in chicken, this robust humoral response was later produced. Moreover, serum IgG2a and IgG2b antibody titers in CH9V-immunized mice were significantly lower than those of IH9V alone group. CONCLUSIONS: AJSAF could improve antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, and simultaneously trigger a Th1/Th2 response to IH9V.

Widely used experimental methods to quantify cells labeled with fluorescent markers-such as immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and expression of transgenes via stable lines or transient in utero electroporations-depend upon accurate and consistent quantification of images. Current methods to quantify fluorescently-labeled cells rely on labor-intensive manual counting approaches, such as the Fiji plugin Cell Counter, which requires custom macros to enable higher-throughput analyses. Here, we present RapID Cell Counter, a semi-automated cell-counting tool with an easy-to-implement graphical user interface, that facilitates quick and consistent quantifications of cell density within user-defined boundaries that can be divided into equally-partitioned segments. Compared to the standard manual counting approach, we show that RapID matched accuracy and consistency, and only required a??10% of user time relative to manual counting methods, when quantifying the distribution of fluorescently-labeled neurons in mouse in utero electroporation experiments. Using RapID, we recapitulated previously published work focusing on two genes, Srgap2 and Cul5, important for projection neuron migration in the neocortex and used it to quantify projection neuron displacement in a mouse knockout model of Rbx2 Moreover, RapID is capable of quantifying other cell types in the brain with complex cell morphologies, including astrocytes and dopaminergic neurons.

One of the side effects of this impairment is an abnormality in walking. With the development of sensor technologies and artificial intelligence applications in recent years, the disease severity of patients can be estimated using their gait data. In this way, decision support applications for grading the severity of the disease that the patient suffers in the clinic can be developed. Thus, patients can have treatment methods more suitable for the severity of the disease. The presented research proposes a deep learning-based approach using gait data represented by a Quick Response code to develop an effective and reliable disease severity grading system for neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntingtons disease, and Parkinsons disease. The two-dimensional Quick Response data set was created by converting each one-dimensional gait data of the subjects with a novel representation approach to a Quick Response code. This data set was regressed with the convolutional neural network deep learning method, and a solution was sought for the problem of grading disease severity. Further, to demonstrate the success of the results obtained with the novel approach, native machine learning approaches such as Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbours, and ensemble machine learning methods, such as voting and stacking, were applied on one-dimensional data. Finally, the results obtained on the prediction of disease severity by testing one-dimensional gait data with a convolutional neural network architecture that operates on one-dimensional data were included. The results showed that, in most cases, the two-dimensional convolutional neural network approach performed the best among all methods.","output":"CNN-based severity prediction of neurodegenerative diseases using gait data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Worldwide, diverse racial/ethnic groups have disproportionately higher drowning rates.

Methods: This review is based on the Cochrane review: \\"International travel-related control measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic\\" and followed the same methodology. In brief, we searched for clinical and modelling studies in general health and COVID-19-specific bibliographic databases.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to gather information about the ability of hospitals in Kenya to provide emergency and critical care services and to identify priority actions for use by policymakers and other stakeholders as a roadmap toward strengthening the COVID-19 response in the country. Methods: This was a comprehensive review of the published and grey literature on emergency and critical care services in Kenya published in the last three years through April 2020. Screening of articles was conducted independently by the authors and the final decision for inclusion was made collaboratively. A total of 15 papers and documents were included in the review.Key recommendations.There is an urgent need to strengthen prehospital emergency care in Kenya by establishing a single toll-free ambulance access number and an integrated public Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system to respond to severe and critical COVID-19 patients in the community and other emergency cases. Functional 24-h emergency departments (EDs) need to be established in all the level 4, 5 and 6 hospitals in the country to ensure these patients receive immediate lifesaving emergency care when they arrive at the hospitals. The EDs should be equipped with pulse oximeters and functioning oxygen systems and have the necessary resources and skills to perform endotracheal intubation to manage COVID-19-induced respiratory distress and hypoxia. Additional intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators are also needed to ensure continuity of care for the critically ill patients seen in the ED. Appropriate practical interventions should be instituted to limit the spread of COVID-19 to healthcare personnel and other patients within the healthcare system. Further research with individual facility levels of assessment around infrastructure and service provision is necessary to more narrowly define areas with significant shortfalls in emergency and critical care services as the number of COVID-19 cases in the country increase.","output":"A baseline review of the ability of hospitals in Kenya to provide emergency and critical care services for COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which generalize traditional deep neural networks on graph data, have achieved state-of-the-art performance on several graph analytical tasks.

The aims of this study were (1) to assess the olfactory function in T2D patients and to compare it with a control group of individuals without T2D, and (2) to evaluate the differences in OD within T2D patients according to the presence of diabetic complications. METHODS: A group of 39 T2D patients and a control group of 39 healthy individuals were enrolled. Each subject underwent an evaluation of the olfactory performance using the Sniffing Olfactory Screening Test (SOST) and completed a questionnaire assessing the subjective perception of olfaction. According to the presence of diabetic complications, the group of T2D patients was divided into two subgroups. Non-parametric tests and regression analysis were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: No differences in the subjective perception of olfaction were demonstrated among T2D patients (with and without complications) and controls. A significant difference for the SOST score was demonstrated among the different groups. In particular, OD was more frequent in T2D patients than in controls.

Therefore, using latent growth curve modeling, the current study explored adolescents changes in the frequency of SEIM use before, during, and after a strict lockdown period was established in Belgium. Attention was given to individual differences (i.e., gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, pubertal timing, and sensation seeking). A three-wave panel study over a 15-month period among 522 adolescents was used (M(age) = 15.36, SD = 1.51, 67.1% girls). In general, SEIM use did not significantly increase over a 15-month period in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only gender predicted a change in SEIM use frequencies with girls showing a greater, increasing change of SEIM use than boys. When addressing why adolescents used SEIM during a strict lockdown period, sexual arousal, stress, and boredom regulation motivations emerged as the most prevalent motivations. Loneliness regulation was the least prominent motivation. Individual differences were found regarding the gratifications sought according to adolescents gender, pubertal timing, and sensation seeking. The findings offer a response to sexual scholars worries in terms of adolescents SEIM use during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Adolescents Use of Sexually Explicit Internet Material Over the Course of 2019C2020 in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Three-wave Panel Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article first outlines key arguments that demonstrate how the 'neoliberal model of development's' global unleashing of capital is leading human civilisation to the brink of collapse This 'intellectual pessimism' informs the 'optimistic will' central to the second part of this article which outlines an alternative democratic socialist model of development This alternative is founded on a project of global cooperation to construct a national-trans-national regulatory architecture that can facilitate an ecologically balanced, materially secure, flexible and democratically solidaristic collection of local accumulation regimes that in aggregate would comprise a sustainable, progressive and pandemic-preventing planetary mode of accumulation","output":"Reversing the catastrophe of neoliberal-led global capitalism in the time of coronavirus: Towards a democratic socialist alternative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drawing on Moreno's cognitive-affective theory of learning with media, this research aims to investigate the effectiveness of different multimedia glosses on learners' vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension in a CALL environment A total of 160 university students who learnt English as a foreign language (EFL) in four classes participated in the study and were exposed to one of the four conditions: (a) L2 definition only, (b) L2 definition coupled with audio, (c) L2 definition plus video, and (d) L2 definition with picture Participants were asked to read eight hypermediated reading texts Reading comprehension as well as vocabulary acquisition were measured using a pretest-posttest design The results show first that all these four conditions led to students' vocabulary gains More specifically, participants who had access to L2 definition plus picture and plus videos achieved significantly higher scores than the other two groups, L2 definition coupled with audio and L2 definition only Concerning reading comprehension, all multimedia glossing presentation led to better reading comprehension, but no differences were found among all the glossing groups The questionnaire and interview data indicate that students preferred L2 definition coupled with video and picture glosses, followed by audio and L2 definition only The results reflect that multimedia glossing presentation creates a different effect on students' vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension, respectively They also provide pedagogical implications for learning in times of COVID-19","output":"Multimedia Gloss Presentation: Learners' Preference and the Effects on EFL Vocabulary Learning and Reading Comprehension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of COVID-19 cases caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing, with no approved antiviral intervention.

Little is known regarding its efficacy in eliminating medium-sized cytokines in sepsis. This study aimed to explore the effects of continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD) using the EMiC2 filter on cytokine clearance. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study conducted in critically ill patients with sepsis and acute kidney injury requiring kidney replacement therapy. We measured concentrations of 12 cytokines [Interleukin (IL) IL-1, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-, vascular endothelial growth factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, epidermal growth factor (EGF)] in plasma at baseline (T0) and pre- and post-dialyzer at 1, 6, 24, and 48 h after CVVHD initiation and in the effluent fluid at corresponding time points. Outcomes were the effluent and adsorptive clearance rates, mass balances, and changes in serial serum concentrations. RESULTS: Twelve patients were included in the final analysis. All cytokines except EGF concentrations declined over 48 h (p < 0.001). The effluent clearance rates were variable and ranged from negligible values for IL-2, IFN-, IL-1, IL-1, and EGF, to 19.0 ml/min for TNF-. Negative or minimal adsorption was observed. The effluent and adsorptive clearance rates remained steady over time. The percentage of cytokine removal was low for most cytokines throughout the 48-h period. CONCLUSION: EMiC2-CVVHD achieved modest removal of most cytokines and demonstrated small to no adsorptive capacity despite a decline in plasma cytokine concentrations. This suggests that changes in plasma cytokine concentrations may not be solely influenced by extracorporeal removal.

We identified 1,808,810 genomic regions that showed variations in CG methylation by comparing the methylomes of different tissues or organs from different developmental stages. These DNA elements predominantly lose CG methylation during fetal development, whereas the trend is reversed after birth. During late stages of fetal development, non-CG methylation accumulated within the bodies of key developmental transcription factor genes, coinciding with their transcriptional repression. Integration of genome-wide DNA methylation, histone modification and chromatin accessibility data enabled us to predict 461,141 putative developmental tissue-specific enhancers, the human orthologues of which were enriched for disease-associated genetic variants.

At the beginning of the epidemic, people do not know about the virus, then, after the outbreak of epidemics and alarm, they begin to comply with the restrictions and the spreading of epidemics may decline. Over time, some people get tired/frustrated by the restrictions and stop following them (exhaustion), especially if the number of new cases drops down. After resting for a while, they can follow the restrictions again. But during this pause the second wave can come and become even stronger then the first one. Studies based on SIR models do not predict the observed quick exit from the first wave of epidemics. Social dynamics should be considered. The appearance of the second wave also depends on social factors. Many generalizations of the SIR model have been developed that take into account the weakening of immunity over time, the evolution of the virus, vaccination and other medical and biological details. However, these more sophisticated models do not explain the apparent differences in outbreak profiles between countries with different intrinsic socio-cultural features. In our work, a system of models of the COVID-19 pandemic is proposed, combining the dynamics of social stress with classical epidemic models. Social stress is described by the tools of sociophysics. The combination of a dynamic SIR-type model with the classical triad of stages of the general adaptation syndrome, alarm-resistance-exhaustion, makes it possible to describe with high accuracy the available statistical data for 13 countries. The sets of kinetic constants corresponding to optimal fit of model to data were found. These constants characterize the ability of society to mobilize efforts against epidemics and maintain this concentration over time and can further help in the development of management strategies specific to a particular society.","output":"Social stress drives the multi-wave dynamics of COVID-19 outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late February and early March 2020, Italy became the European epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite increasingly stringent containment measures enforced by the government, the health system faced an enormous pressure, and extraordinary efforts were made in order to increase overall hospital beds availability and especially ICU capacity. Nevertheless, the hardest-hit hospitals in Northern Italy experienced a shortage of ICU beds and resources that led to hard allocating choices. At the beginning of March 2020, the Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) issued recommendations aimed at supporting physicians in prioritizing patients when the number of critically ill patients overwhelm the capacity of ICUs. One motivating concern for the SIAARTI guidance was that, if no balanced and consistent allocation procedures were applied to prioritize patients, there would be a concrete risk for unfair choices, and that the prevalent first come, first served principle would lead to many avoidable deaths. Among the drivers of decision for admission to ICUs, age, comorbidities, and preexisting functional status were included. The recommendations were criticized as ageist and potentially discriminatory against elderly patients. Looking forward to the next steps, the Italian experience can be relevant to other parts of the world that are yet to see a significant surge of COVID-19: the need for transparent triage criteria and commonly shared values give the Italian recommendations even greater legitimacy.","output":"Rationing in a Pandemic: Lessons from Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2020, four vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been developed and three have been approved for immediate use in the United States.

OBJECTIVES: This phase II clinical trial was conducted to study safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of vilobelimab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against C5a, in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, and placebo-controlled study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Eleven multidisciplinary ICUs across Germany. Adult patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and with early onset of infection-associated organ dysfunction. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patients were randomly assigned in a ratio of 2:1 to three subsequent dosing cohorts for IV vilobelimab or placebo receiving either 2  2 mg/kg (0 and 12 hr), 2  4 mg/kg (0 and 24 hr), and 3  4 mg/kg (0, 24, and 72 hr). Co-primary endpoints were pharmacodynamics (assessed by C5a concentrations), pharmacokinetics (assessed by vilobelimab concentrations), and safety of vilobelimab. Preliminary efficacy was evaluated by secondary objectives. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were randomized (16 patients for each vilobelimab dosing cohort and eight patients for each placebo dosing cohort). Vilobelimab application was associated with dosing dependent decrease in C5a compared with baseline (p < 0.001). Duration of C5a decrease increased with more frequent dosing. Membrane attack complex lysis capacity measured by 50% hemolytic complement was not affected. Vilobelimab was well tolerated with similar safety findings in all dose cohorts. No vilobelimab-specific adverse events emerged. For vilobelimab-treated patients, investigators attributed less treatment-emergent adverse events as related compared with placebo.

There were concerns surrounding early reports of increased mortality among patients undergoing emergency or non-urgent surgery. We report the morbidity and mortality in patients who underwent arthroplasty procedures during the UK first stage of the pandemic. METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained for a review of prospectively collected data on consecutive patients who underwent arthroplasty procedures between March and May 2020 at a specialist orthopaedic centre in the UK. Data included diagnoses, comorbidities, BMI, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, length of stay, and complications. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality and secondary outcomes were prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, medical and surgical complications, and readmission within 30 days of discharge. The data collated were compared with series from the preceding three months. RESULTS: There were 167 elective procedures performed in the first three weeks of the study period, prior to the first national lockdown, and 57 emergency procedures thereafter. Three patients (1.3%) were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. There was one death (0.45%) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection after an emergency procedure. None of the patients developed complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection after elective arthroplasty. There was no observed spike in complications during in-hospital stay or in the early postoperative period. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between pre-COVID-19 and peri-COVID-19 groups (p = 0.624).

Interestingly, a close relationship between Rab1404 and simian RVA strain RVA/Simian-tc/USA/RRV/1975/G3P[3] for 8 gene segments was observed. RRV is believed to be a reassortant between bovine-like RVA strain and canine/feline RVA strains. Rab1404 and canine/feline RVAs shared the genes encoding VP1, VP3, VP7, NSP3, and NSP4. Additionally, the genome segments VP6 (I2), NSP1 (N2), and NSP5 (H3) of Rab1404 were closely related to those of bovine RVAs. This is the first report describing the complete genome sequence of an LRV detected in the ROK. These results indicate that Rab1404 could be a result of interspecies transmission, possibly through multiple reassortment events in the strains of various animal species and the subsequent transmission of the virus to a rabbit. Additional studies are required to determine the evolutionary source and to identify possible reservoirs of RVAs in nature.","output":"Genetic characteristics and analysis of a novel rotavirus G3P[22] identified in diarrheic feces of Korean rabbit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To describe the use of debates, and to evaluate student performance and perceptions, when student debates are incorporated as an active learning tool in a required pharmacy healthcare delivery course. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING: Student live debates replaced 15% of a traditional lecture-based course. Twelve healthcare controversies were debated by student teams each year. Student perception of debate utility and opinion on topics, pre- and post-debate, were measured via a voluntary survey. Both peer and instructor's assessments of team performances, as well as individual student performance on the debate-based questions on course exams, contributed to course grade. FINDINGS: The average survey response rates were 76% (2014) and 86% (2015). Fifteen-54% of student respondents changed their opinion on individual debate topics due to the debates. Although exam performance on debate-based questions was no better than on lecture-based questions, respondents who found the debates useful or very useful in mastering course material increased by 19% post versus pre-debate surveys. SUMMARY: Debates are an effective active learning tool for engaging students in controversial subjects. Assessment of student performance should include student and instructor evaluations, and can be incorporated into the course grade.","output":"The use of debates as an active learning tool in a college of pharmacy healthcare delivery course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, universities around the globe frantically and emergently switched to remote teaching.

This study sought to assess how the number of STI reports changed during the pandemic in Japan. METHODS: We used national infectious disease surveillance data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (Tokyo, Japan) for the period between January 2013 and December 2021. We compared reported rates of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, condyloma acuminata and genital herpes, as well as total notifications for HIV/AIDS and syphilis during the pandemic versus previous years in Japan. We used a quasi-Poisson regression to determine whether any given week or month between January 2018 and December 2021 had a significant excess or deficit of STIs. Notification values above or below the 95% upper and lower prediction thresholds were considered as statistically significant. The start of the pandemic was defined as January 2020. RESULTS: Chlamydia generally remained within predicted range during the pandemic period. Reporting of gonorrhoea was significantly higher than expected throughout early-to-mid 2021 but otherwise generally remained within predicted range prior to 2021. Condyloma, herpes and HIV/AIDS reporting were transiently significantly lower than expected throughout the pandemic period, but no significant periods of higher-than-expected reporting were detected. Syphilis showed widespread evidence of significantly lower-than-predicted reporting throughout 2020 but eventually reversed, showing significantly higher-than-predicted reporting in mid-to-late 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with variable changes in the reporting of STIs in Japan. Higher-than-predicted reporting was more likely to be observed in the later phases of the pandemic. These changes may have been attributable to pandemic-related changes in sexual behaviour and decreased STI clinic attendance and testing, but further research on the long-term impact of the pandemic on STIs is necessary.","output":"Recent changes in the reporting of STIs in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pneumonia, an acute respiratory tract infection, is one of the major causes of mortality worldwide. Depending on the site of acquisition, pneumonia can be community acquired pneumonia (CAP) or nosocomial pneumonia (NP). The risk of pneumonia, is partially driven by host genetics. CYP1A1 is a widely studied pulmonary CYP family gene primarily expressed in peripheral airway epithelium. The CYP1A1 genetic variants, included in this study, alter the gene activity and are known to contribute in lung inflammation, which may cause pneumonia pathogenesis. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to establish the possible contribution of CYP1A1 gene, and its three variants (rs2606345, rs1048943 and rs4646903) towards the genetic etiology of pneumonia risk. Using PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed and meta-analysed case-control studies, evaluating risk of pneumonia in patients carrying the risk alleles of CYP1A1 variants. Heterogeneity across the studies was evaluated using I2 statistics. Based on heterogeneity, a random-effect (using maximum likelihood) or fixed-effect (using inverse variance) model was applied to estimate the effect size. Pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated to estimate the overall effect of the risk allele association with pneumonia susceptibility. Egger's regression test and funnel plot were used to assess publication bias. Subgroup analysis was performed based on pneumonia type (CAP and NP), population, as well as age group. A total of ten articles were identified as eligible studies, which included 3049 cases and 2249 healthy controls. The meta-analysis findings revealed CYP1A1 variants, rs2606345 [T vs G; OR = 1.12 (0.75C1.50); p = 0.02; I2 = 84.89%], and rs1048943 [G vs T; OR = 1.19 (0.76C1.61); p = 0.02; I2 = 0.00%] as risk markers whereas rs4646903 showed no statistical significance for susceptibility to pneumonia. On subgroup analysis, both the genetic variants showed significant association with CAP but not with NP. We additionally performed a spatial analysis to identify the key factors possibly explaining the variability across countries in the prevalence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral pneumonia. We observed a significant association between the risk allele of rs2606345 and rs1048943, with a higher COVID-19 prevalence worldwide, providing us important links in understanding the variability in COVID-19 prevalence.","output":"Human genetic factors associated with pneumonia risk, a cue for COVID-19 susceptibility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On the basis of the data from the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System, 1444 infectious bronchitis (IB) cases were diagnosed between 1997 and 2012.

California variant 1737 (CA1737) and California variant 1999 (Cal 99) IBV types were the most prevalent genotypes during the analyzed period. To further understand the increased prevalence of these genotypes, we assessed and compared the variability of the S1 gene hypervariable region of CA1737 and Cal 99 with the variability of IBV strains belonging to the Massachusetts 41 (M41) and Arkansas (Ark) types during serial passages in embryonated chicken eggs. On the basis of the S1 nonsynonymous changes, seven different subpopulations were detected in M41. However, the predominant population of the field strain M41 before passages continued to be predominant throughout the experiment. In contrast, Ark passaging resulted in the detection of 13 different subpopulations, and the field sequence became extinct after the first passage. In IBV Cal 99, eight different subpopulations were detected; one of these became predominant after the second passage. In CA1737, 10 different subpopulations were detected. The field strain major sequence was not detected after the first passage but reappeared after the second passage and remained at low levels throughout the experiment.

In order to improve the quality of care for patients with persistent physical and comorbid mental health conditions, person-centered care approaches addressing psychosocial factors are currently advocated. Central to successful person-centered care is a multidisciplinary collaboration between mental health and musculoskeletal specialists underpinned by a robust therapeutic alliance. Such a collaborative approach might be found in osteopathy, which is typically utilized to treat patients with musculoskeletal disorders but may arguably also benefit mental health outcomes. However, research and practice exploring the reputed effect of osteopathy on patients with mental health problems lack a robust framework. In this hypothesis and theory article, we build upon research from embodied cognition, predictive coding, interoception, and osteopathy to propose an embodied, predictive and interoceptive framework that underpins osteopathic person-centered care for individuals with persistent physical and comorbid mental health problems. Based on the premise that, for example, chronic pain and comorbid depression are underlined by overly precise predictions or imprecise sensory information, we hypothesize that osteopathic treatment may generate strong interoceptive prediction errors that update the generative model underpinning the experience of pain and depression. Thus, physical and mental symptoms may be reduced through active and perceptual inference. We discuss how these theoretical perspectives can inform future research into osteopathy and mental health to reduce the burden of comorbid psychological factors in patients with persistent physical symptoms and support person-centered multidisciplinary care in mental health.","output":"Osteopathy and Mental Health: An Embodied, Predictive, and Interoceptive Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. It is contagious in humans and is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In the current analysis, we searched for SARS-CoV-2 sequences within the human genome. To compare the SARS-CoV-2 genome to the human genome, we used the blast-like alignment tool (BLAT) of the University of California, Santa Cruz Genome Browser. BLAT can align a user sequence of 25 bases or more to the genome. BLAT search results revealed a 117-base pair SARS-CoV-2 sequence in the human genome with 94.6% identity. The sequence was in chromosome 1p within an intronic region of the netrin G1 (NTNG1) gene. The sequence matched a sequence in the SARS-CoV-2 orf1b (open reading frames) gene. The SARS-CoV-2 human sequence lies within non-structural proteins 14 and 15 (NSP14 and NSP15), and is quite close to the viral spike sequence, separated only by NSP16, a 904-base pair sequence. The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the binding of the virus spike protein to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and internalization of the complex by the host cell. It is probably no accident that a sequence from the SARS-CoV-2 orf1b gene is found in the human NTNG1 gene, implicated in schizophrenia, and that haloperidol, used to treat schizophrenia, may also be a treatment for COVID-19. We suggest, therefore, that it is important to investigate other haloperidol analogs. Among them are benperidol, bromperidol, bromperidol decanoate, droperidol, seperidol hydrochloride, and trifluperidol.

Due to the limited detection facilities and medical resources, especially in developing countries, a large number of suspected cases can only receive common clinical diagnosis rather than more effective detections like Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests or CT scans. This motivates us to develop a quick screening method on suspected patients via common clinical diagnosis results. However, the diagnostic items of different patients may vary greatly and there is a huge variation in the dimension of the diagnosis data among different suspected patients, which makes it hard to process these indefinite dimension data via classical classification algorithms. To resolve this problem, we propose an Indefiniteness Elimination Network (IE-Net) to eliminate the influence of the varied dimensions and make predictions about the COVID-19 cases. The IENet is in an encoder-decoder framework fashion and an indefiniteness elimination operation is proposed to transfer the indefinite dimension feature into a fixed dimension feature. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on the public available COVID-19 Clinical Spectrum dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed indefiniteness elimination operation greatly improves the classification performance and the IE-Net achieves 94.80% accuracy and 92.79% recall for distinguishing COVID-19 cases from nonCOVID-19 cases with only common clinical diagnose data. We further compared our methods with 3 classical classification algorithms: random forest, gradient boosting and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Compared with traditional classification methods, the proposed IE-Net can bring at least 9.40% accuracy gains and 12.17% recall gains. To explore the specificity of each clinical test item, we further analyzed the possible relationship between each clinical test item and COVID-19.

Notable potential of the pulmonary route has been witnessed in antifungal delivery due to distinct advantages of direct lung targeting and first-pass evasion. The current research reports biomimetic surface-active lipid-polymer hybrid (LPH) nanoparticles (NPs) of voriconazole, employing lung-specific lipid, i.e., dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and natural biodegradable polymer, i.e., chitosan, to augment its pulmonary deposition and retention, following nebulization. RESULTS: The developed nanosystem exhibited a particle size in the range of 228C255 nm and drug entrapment of 45C54.8%. Nebulized microdroplet characterization of NPs dispersion revealed a mean diameter of  5 m, corroborating its deep lung deposition potential as determined by next-generation impactor studies. Biophysical interaction of LPH NPs with lipid-monolayers indicated their surface-active potential and ease of intercalation into the pulmonary surfactant membrane at the air-lung interface. Cellular viability and uptake studies demonstrated their cytocompatibility and time-and concentration-dependent uptake in lung-epithelial A549 and Calu-3 cells with clathrin-mediated internalization. Transepithelial electrical resistance experiments established their ability to penetrate tight airway Calu-3 monolayers.

There have been some concerns regarding extent of immobilization during single fraction frameless treatment and potential effect on outcomes. As such, we reviewed outcomes in patients with brain metastases treated in a single fraction using either a frame or mask on the Gamma Knife Icon at our institution. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We reviewed the records of 95 patients with a total of 374 metastases treated between May 2019 and January 2021. Thirty-nine patients (41%) were treated using the Leksell frame with the remainder being immobilized with a mask. The median number of metastatic lesions was 2 (1C20). The median prescription dose was 20 Gy (11.5C24 Gy). Odds ratios were generated to identify predictors of mask use. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate survival, local failure, and distant failure rates. Cox regression was used to identify predictors of survival. Propensity matching was used to account for indication bias. RESULTS: Of the 95 patients treated, 88 (93%) had follow-up with a median duration of 5 months (1C18). Frame utilization was more likely with 6 to 10 brain metastases. Median overall survival was not reached and was 70% and 60% at 6 and 12 months for the entire cohort, respectively. There was no significant difference in survival by immobilization method (P = .12). Six patients had local failure in 10 total lesions (3 patients in each group).

The increasing demand for those products can, together with pandemic-related disruptions in the global supply chain, induce major local resource scarcities. During the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed a reflex of our people first in many regions. In this paper, however, we show that a cooperative sharing mechanism can substantially improve the ability to face epidemics. We present a stylized model in which communities share their resources such that each can receive them whenever a local epidemic flares up. Our main finding is that cooperative sharing can prevent local resource exhaustion and reduce the total number of infected cases. Crucially, beneficial effects of sharing are found for a large range of possible community sizes and cooperation combinations, not only for small communities being helped by large communities. Furthermore, we show that the success of sharing resources heavily depends on having a sufficiently long delay between the onsets of epidemics in different communities. These results thus urge for the pairing of a global sharing mechanism with measures to slow down the spread of infections from one community to the other. Our work uses a stylized model to convey an important and clear message to a broad public, advocating that cooperative sharing strategies in international resource crises are the most beneficial strategy for all.

Multiple explanations have been put forth, including unequal quality/access to health care, higher proportion of pre-existing health conditions, multigenerational household composition, and disproportionate representation in telecommute-unfriendly occupations. However, these hypotheses have been rarely tested. OBJECTIVE We examine age-stratified patterns of Hispanic COVID-19 mortality vis--vis patterns of exposure to evaluate the multiple posited hypotheses. METHODS We use a combination of public and restricted data from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention and leverage national and subnational race- and age-stratified COVID-19 mortality and case burdens/advantages to evaluate the workplace vulnerability hypothesis. We also use individual-level information on prior health conditions and mortality from the case data to assess whether observed patterns are consistent with the other hypotheses. RESULTS Our results indicate that the disproportionate burdens for both COVID-19 case and mortality for the Hispanic population are largest among the working-age groups, supporting the hypothesis that workplace exposure plays a critical role in heightening vulnerability to COVID-19 mortality. We find little evidence to support the hypotheses regarding multigenerational household composition, pre-existing health conditions, or unequal quality/access to health care. CONCLUSION Our findings point to the key roles played by age structure and differential exposure in contributing to the disproportionately severe impact of COVID-19 on the Hispanic population.

The rapid spread of critical priority pathogens in Brazil is notably worrying, considering its continental dimension, the diversity of international trade, livestock production, and human travel. We conducted a nationwide genomic investigation under a One Health perspective that included Escherichia coli strains isolated from humans and nonhuman sources, over 45 years (1974C2019). One hundred sixty-seven genomes were analyzed extracting clinically relevant information (i.e., resistome, virulome, mobilome, sequence types [STs], and phylogenomic). The endemic status of extended-spectrum -lactamase (ESBL)-positive strains carrying a wide diversity of bla(CTX-M) variants, and the growing number of colistin-resistant isolates carrying mcr-type genes was associated with the successful expansion of international ST10, ST38, ST115, ST131, ST354, ST410, ST648, ST517, and ST711 clones; phylogenetically related and shared between human and nonhuman hosts, and polluted aquatic environments. Otherwise, carbapenem-resistant ST48, ST90, ST155, ST167, ST224, ST349, ST457, ST648, ST707, ST744, ST774, and ST2509 clones from human host harbored bla(KPC-2) and bla(NDM-1) genes. A broad resistome to other clinically relevant antibiotics, hazardous heavy metals, disinfectants, and pesticides was further predicted. Wide virulome associated with invasion/adherence, exotoxin and siderophore production was related to phylogroup B2. The convergence of wide resistome and virulome has contributed to the persistence and rapid spread of international high-risk clones of critical priority E. coli at the human-animal-environmental interface, which must be considered a One Health challenge for a post-pandemic scenario. IMPORTANCE A One Health approach for antimicrobial resistance must integrate whole-genome sequencing surveillance data of critical priority pathogens from human, animal and environmental sources to track hot spots and routes of transmission and developing effective prevention and control strategies. As part of the Grand Challenges Explorations: New Approaches to Characterize the Global Burden of Antimicrobial Resistance Program, we present genomic data of WHO critical priority carbapenemase-resistant, ESBL-producing, and/or colistin-resistant Escherichia coli strains isolated from humans and nonhuman sources in Brazil, a country with continental proportions and high levels of antimicrobial resistance. The present study provided evidence of epidemiological and clinical interest, highlighting that the convergence of wide virulome and resistome has contributed to the persistence and rapid spread of international high-risk clones of E. coli at the human-animal-environmental interface, which must be considered a One Health threat that requires coordinated actions to reduce its incidence in humans and nonhuman hosts.","output":"WHO Critical Priority Escherichia coli as One Health Challenge for a Post-Pandemic Scenario: Genomic Surveillance and Analysis of Current Trends in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Preventing the first cesarean delivery (CD) is important as CD rates continue to rise. During the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, quality improvement metrics at our hospital identified lower rates of CD. We sought to investigate this change and identify factors that may have contributed to the decrease. STUDY DESIGN We compared nulliparous singleton deliveries at a large academic hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic (April through July 2020 during a statewide \\"stay-at-home\\" order) to those in the same months 1 year prior to the pandemic (April through July 2019). The primary outcome, mode of delivery, was obtained from the electronic medical record system, along with indication for CD. RESULTS The cohort included 1,913 deliveries: 892 in 2019 and 1,021 in 2020. Patient characteristics (age, body mass index, race, ethnicity, and insurance type) did not differ between the groups. Median gestational age at delivery was the same in both groups. The CD rate decreased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with prior (28.9 vs. 33.6%; p = 0.03). There was a significant increase in the rate of labor induction (45.7 vs. 40.6%; p = 0.02), but no difference in the proportion of inductions that were elective (19.5 vs. 20.7%; p = 0.66). The rate of CD in labor was unchanged (15.9 vs. 16.3%; p = 0.82); however, more women attempted a trial of labor (87.0 vs. 82.6%; p = 0.01). Thus, the proportion of CD without a trial of labor decreased (25.1 vs. 33.0%; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION There was a statistically significant decrease in CD during the COVID-19 pandemic at our hospital, driven by a decrease in CD without a trial of labor. The increased rate of attempted trial of labor suggests the presence of patient-level factors that warrant further investigation as potential targets for decreasing CD rates. Additionally, in a diverse and medically complex population, increased rates of labor induction were not associated with increased rates of CD. KEY POINTS  Primary CD rate fell during COVID-19 pandemic..  Decrease was driven by more women attempting labor..  Higher rate of induction without rise in CD rate was found..","output":"Investigating Decreased Rates of Nulliparous Cesarean Deliveries during the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To highlight key anatomical and technical considerations for facial artery identification, and harvest and transposition of the facial artery buccinator (FAB) flap to facilitate its future use in anterior skull base reconstruction.

Medical practitioners of all specialties are being assigned to treat patients of COVID-19. In this article, two authors (T.V. and N.G.) from the Department of Neurosurgery who were deployed in the COVID-19 testing ward between April 25 and May 31, 2020 share their experience. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted including all those who were admitted in this ward. The patients were studied according to their demographic profiles, diagnoses, admitting departments, travel history, and presence/absence of COVID-19-related symptoms. Relevant history regarding occupation, contact with patient with known COVID-19, and comorbid illness was noted. Those who tested positive for COVID-19 were studied further. The data from the institute's official record were updated until August 14, 2020. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 256 admissions in the ward, of whom 148 (92 male, 56 female) were patients and 108 were patients' attendants/relatives. Most patients were admitted under the departments of internal medicine (33, 22.3%) and general surgery (19, 12.8%). Of 148 patients, 46 (31.1%) were admitted as they were planned for a surgery/intervention. Among 148 patients, 29 (19.6%) had history of travel to or were residents of a red zone, 4 (2.7%) had history of contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19, whereas 6 (4.1%) were health care workers. One hundred four patients (70.2%) showed no COVID-19-related symptoms. Thirty-four patients (22.9%) had associated comorbid conditions. Eight patients (5 male, 3 female) with mean age of 37.6 years (range 4-69 years) tested positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The authors share their experience and their institute's protocol in various facets during this war against COVID-19 pandemic.

Design setting and participantsA representative sample of Australian adults (N=1,204) were randomised to one of six conditions within a factorial design: Framing (Positive; Negative; Control) * Vaccine (Familiar (Pfizer); Unfamiliar (Moderna)). InterventionNegative Framing involved presenting the likelihood of experiencing side effects (e.g., heart inflammation is very rare, 1 in every 80,000 will be affected), whereas Positive Framing involved presenting the same information but as the likelihood of not experiencing side effects (e.g., 79,999 in every 80,000 will not be affected). Primary OutcomeBooster vaccine intention measured pre- and post-intervention. ResultsPositive Framing (M=75.7, SE=0.9, 95% CI[73.9, 77.4]) increased vaccine intention relative to Negative Framing (M=70.7, SE=0.9, 95% CI[68.9, 72.4]) overall (F(1, 1192)=4.68, p=.031,{eta} p2=.004).

The aim of this study is to evaluate the psychological impact of the lockdown in Lebanon. A cross-sectional, online survey was conducted during the lockdown period in order to punctually assess depression, anxiety symptoms as well as eating and substance use disorders using self-rating scales (the DASS-21, SCOFF and CAGE-AID respectively), while identifying factors that might affect those outcomes. Overall, 1133 participants completed the questionnaire. The DASS-21 score was positively correlated with the impact of lockdown on participants lifestyle and lockdown duration. A highest effect on DASS-21 score was related to the intensity of other stressful life events that have happened during the last 3 months. Linear regression analysis also showed that age, monthly income, professional status, the SCOFF and CAGE-AID scores, the intensity of the lockdowns impact on lifestyle and having been through other stressful life events unrelated to the lockdown per se, were risk factors affecting significantly the DASS-21 score. Lockdown, as well as other stressful life event that have happened during the last 3 months, were therefore associated with higher depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms.

Cold-adapted, live attenuated influenza vaccine (CAIV) induces local innate immune responses that provide a broad range of antiviral immunity. Herein, we examined whether X-31ca, a donor virus for CAIVs, provides non-specific cross-protection against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The degree of RSV replication was significantly reduced when X-31ca was administered before RSV infection without any RSV-specific antibody responses. The vaccination induced an immediate release of cytokines and infiltration of leukocytes into the respiratory tract, moderating the immune perturbation caused by RSV infection. The potency of protection against RSV challenge was significantly reduced in TLR3(-/-) TLR7(-/-) mice, confirming that the TLR3/7 signaling pathways are necessary for the observed immediate and short-term protection. The results suggest that CAIVs provide short-term, non-specific protection against genetically unrelated respiratory pathogens.

COVID-19 patients may also suffer from serious symptoms including shortness of breathing, chest pressure and pain, as well as loss of daily routine habits, pointing out to a sever reduction in the quality of life. COVID-19 has afftected almost all countries, however, the United States contains the highest number of infection (> 1,595,000 cases) and deaths cases (> 95,000 deaths) in the world until May 21, 2020. Finding an influential treatment strategy against COVID-19 can be facilitated through better understanding of the virus pathogenesis and consequently interrupting the biochemical pathways that the virus may play role in human body as the current reservoir of the virus. RESULTS: In this study, we combined system biology and bioinformatic approaches to define the role of coexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), neprilysin or membrane metallo-endopeptidase (MME), and carbonic anhydrases (CAs) and their association in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. The results revealed that ACE2 as the cellular attachment site of SARS-CoV-2, neprilysin, and CAs have a great contribution together in the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and consequently in pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in the vital organs such as respiratory, renal, and blood circulation systems. Any disorder in neprilysin, ACE2, and CAs can lead to increase of CO(2) concentration in blood and respiratory acidosis, induction of pulmonary edema and heart and renal failures. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the presence of ACE2-Neprilysin-CA complex in most of vital organs and as a receptor of COVID-19, it is expected that most organs are affected by SARS-CoV-2 such as inflammation and fibrosis of lungs, which may conversely affect their vital functions, temporary or permanently, sometimes leading to death. Therefore, ACE2-Neprilysin-CA complex could be the key factor of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and may provide us useful information to find better provocative and therapeutic strategies against COVID-19.","output":"Application of System Biology to Explore the Association of Neprilysin, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), and Carbonic Anhydrase (CA) in Pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has spread to all states in India. Due to limitations in testing coverage, the true extent of the spread may not be fully reflected in the reported cases. In this study, we obtain time-varying estimates of the fraction of COVID-19 infections reported in the different states. METHODS: Following a methodology developed in prior work, we use a delay-adjusted case fatality ratio to estimate the true fraction of cases reported in different states. We also develop a delay adjusted test positivity estimation method and study the relationship between the estimated test positivity rate for each state and the estimated fraction of cases reported. SETTING: We apply this method of analysis to all Indian states reporting at least 100 deaths as of 10 October 2020. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that delay-adjusted case fatality ratios observed in different states range from 0.47% to 3.55%. The estimated fraction of cases reported in different states ranges from 39% to 100% for an assumed baseline case fatality ratio of 1.38%, from 18.6% to 100% for an assumed baseline case fatality ratio of 0.66%, and from 2.8% to 19.7% for an assumed baseline case fatality ratio of 0.1%.

The aim was to assess the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among people in ongoing OAT, to explore whether the antibody positive group differed from the antibody negative group, and to compare the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among OAT patients with the prevalence in the regional general population. METHODS: The nationwide Corona Immunitas study assessed the participants' Sars-CoV-2 antibody status, social characteristics and behavioural data after the first wave of the corona pandemic in Switzerland, between the end of June and beginning of September 2020. We analysed the subsample of OAT patients (n = 122) and the subsample from the general population of the canton of Zurich (n = 472). RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the general population (mean age  standard deviation 44.7  11.7 years; 50.9% female) was 3.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-4.8%) vs 9.8% (5.1-17.2%) in the OAT population age 44.3  9.4 years; 30.3% female), corresponding to a prevalence ratio of 2.9 (95% CI 1.37-5.94; p = 0.004).

For crowns cementation, the 3D printed provisional material showed the thicker cementation film, different than all other materials (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Different provisional materials present different film thicknesses. The 3D printed provisional material showed the highest veneer and crown film thicknesses. Veneers film thicknesses were smaller than crowns for all provisional materials. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The 3D printed provisional material studied can be satisfactorily used, presenting appropriate adaptation with the tooth preparation, however, it shows the highest cement film thickness for both veneers and crowns cementations when compared with other provisional materials. A better internal fit, or smaller cement film thickness is obtained by CAD/CAM materials, acrylic and bisacrylic resins. Veneer cementation showed a smaller cement film thickness compared with crown cementation for all provisional materials.","output":"Microcomputed tomography evaluation of cement film thickness of veneers and crowns made with conventional and 3D printed provisional materials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous and extremely common disease with symptoms that vary with the age of the patient, typically characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic oligo-anovulation, and/or several metabolic disorders. The syndrome includes various phenotypes, and the pathogenesis is multifactorial, often involving insulin resistance. This feature is closely related to ovarian dysfunction, inflammation, hyperandrogenism, and metabolic disorders, which characterize and complicate the syndrome. Therapy currently considers both lifestyle improvements and medications, and must be tailored on a case-by-case basis. To date, the published studies have not arrived at a definition of the most suitable therapy for each individual case and many of the drugs used are still off-label. In this review, we discuss some controversial diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of PCOS, such as the role of insulin resistance, inflammation, and hyperandrogenism.

However, increased global demand has led to a shortage of commercial SARS-CoV-2 sequencing kits, and not every country has the technological capability or the funds for high-throughput sequencing platforms. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate a rapid, cost-efficient genome sequencing protocol that uses supplies, equipment, and methodologic expertise available in standard molecular or diagnostic laboratories to identify circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Methods: Sets of primers flanking the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene were designed using SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences retrieved from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) Database and synthesized in-house. Primer specificity and final sequences were verified using online prediction analyses with BLAST. The primers were validated using 282 nasopharyngeal samples collected from patients assessed as positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the diagnostic laboratory of the hospital using a Rotor-Gene PCR cycler with an Altona Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 kit. The patient samples were subjected to RNA extraction followed by cDNA synthesis, conventional polymerase chain reaction, and Sanger sequencing. Protocol specificity was confirmed by comparing these results with SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing of the same samples. Results: Sanger sequencing using the newly designed primers and next-generation whole genome sequencing of 282 patient samples indicated identical variants of concern results: 123 samples contained the alpha variant (B.1.1.7); 78, beta (B.1.351), 0, gamma (P.1), and 13, delta (B.1.617.2). Moreover, the remaining samples were non-VOC that belonged to none of these variants and had 99.97% identity with the reference genome. Only four samples had poor sequence quality by Sanger sequencing owing to a low viral count (Ct value >38). Therefore, mutation calls were >98% accurate. Conclusions: Sanger sequencing method using in-house primers is an alternative approach that can be used in facilities with existing equipment to mitigate limitations in high throughput supplies required to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. This protocol is easily adaptable for detection of emerging variants.","output":"In-House, Rapid, and Low-Cost SARS-CoV-2 Spike Gene Sequencing Protocol to Identify Variants of Concern Using Sanger Sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) found locus 3p21 31 associated with severe COVID-19 CCR5 resides at the same locus and, given its known biological role in other infection diseases, we investigated if common noncoding and rare coding variants, affecting CCR5, can predispose to severe COVID-19 We combined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that met the suggestive significance level (P  1  10?5) at the 3p21 31 locus in public GWAS datasets (6406 COVID-19 hospitalized patients and 902,088 controls) with gene expression data from 208 lung tissues, Hi-C, and Chip-seq data Through whole exome sequencing (WES), we explored rare coding variants in 147 severe COVID-19 patients We identified three SNPs (rs9845542, rs12639314, and rs35951367) associated with severe COVID-19 whose risk alleles correlated with low CCR5 expression in lung tissues The rs35951367 resided in a CTFC binding site that interacts with CCR5 gene in lung tissues and was confirmed to be associated with severe COVID-19 in two independent datasets We also identified a rare coding variant (rs34418657) associated with the risk of developing severe COVID-19 Our results suggest a biological role of CCR5 in the progression of COVID-19 as common and rare genetic variants can increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19 by affecting the functions of CCR5","output":"Regulatory Noncoding and Predicted Pathogenic Coding Variants of CCR5 Predispose to Severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread within the human population.

This paper uses a global model with a sample of 41 countries to study the interdependencies between COVID-19 health shocks, populations' risk perceptions about the disease, and their social distancing responses; it also provides some early evidence about potential economic effects. Social networks are a central component in understanding the international transmission. We exploit a dataset on existing social connections across country borders, made available by Facebook, and show that social networks help explain not only the spread of the disease, but also cross-country spillovers in risk perceptions and in social behavior. Social distancing responses across countries are measured based on aggregated mobility tracking indicators, obtained from Google Mobility Reports. We estimate a Global VAR (GVAR) model, which allows for endogeneity of each health, social, and economic, domestic variable, and for a dependence of domestic variables on country-specific foreign aggregates, which depend in turn on the matrix of social connections. Our empirical results highlight the importance of cross-country interdependencies and social networks. Risk perceptions and social responses are affected by experiences abroad, with Italy and the U.S. playing large roles in our sample. The social distancing responses to domestic health shocks are heterogeneous across countries, but they share some similarities: they adjust only gradually and with delay, hence displaying adaptive behavior. Early indicators are suggestive of unemployment consequences that vary widely across countries, depending on their labor market characteristics. Unemployment is particularly responsive to health shocks in the U.S. and Spain, while the fluctuations are attenuated almost everywhere else.","output":"COVID-19 Outbreak, Social Response, and Early Economic Effects: A Global VAR Analysis of Cross-Country Interdependencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a case of choriocarcinoma that did not regress after chemotherapy treatment.

The purpose of this survey was to estimate the magnitude of community-based spread of the infection, associated immunity, and the future prospects and proximity to a 'herd community'. METHODS: The study was undertaken as a cluster randomized, cross-sectional countrywide survey. This largest community-based seroprevalence data of SARS-CoV-2 were collected between 15th and 31st July, 2020 from seven randomly selected cities belonging to the three most populous provinces of Pakistan. The FDA approved kit of ROCHE was used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS: Serum samples of 15,390 participants were tested for SARS CoV-2 antibodies with an overall seroprevalence of 42.4%. The seroprevalence ranged from 31.1% to 48.1% in different cities with the highest in Punjab province (44.5%).

We determined the proportion of patients unable to resume oral nutrition after 8 days and the amount of nutrition delivered in each of the 8 days. RESULTS In all, 111 patients underwent elective esophagectomy for carcinoma, and 103 had a jejunostomy tube placed. The mean age was 67  10.8 years. The median time to oral intake was 7 (interquartile range 7-11) days. Seventy-four (67%) patients resumed oral intake within 8 days.

This causes venous and arterial blood flow obstruction with progressive bowel ischemia, necrosis, and perforation if left untreated. In pediatric surgical practice volvulus of the sigmoid colon remains a rare occurrence and only a few isolated case reports and case series have been reported. The author presents herein a case of SV in a 19-year-old male. CASE REPORT: A 19-year-old male was presented to the emergency service of our hospital complaining of abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, and vomiting for 4 days. Radiologic imaging showed the features of the sigmoid volvulus. Endoscopic detorsion was applied and the patient underwent elective surgery for anterior sigmoid resection to prevent the recurrence. DISCUSSION: Sigmoid volvulus, first described by von Rokitansky in 1836 and remains a major cause of colonic intestinal obstruction in adults, which results from twisting of the sigmoid colon on its mesentery. The median age in children at presentation is 7 years, ranging from 4 h to 18 years. CONCLUSION: Sigmoid volvulus is an uncommon cause of bowel obstruction in teenagers and should be included in the differential diagnosis of young patients present with abdominal pain and absolute constipation. Early diagnosis and timely definitive treatment can prevent complications. Endoscopic detorsion is the initial treatment of choice in the absence of complications. However, elective surgery with sigmoid resection and primary anastomosis is mandatory to prevent a recurrence.","output":"Sigmoid volvulus in a teenager, successfully managed with endoscopic detorsion: An unusual case report and review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to understand the intricate patterns of interplay connected to the formation and maintenance of depressive symptomatology, repeated measures investigations focusing on within-person relationships between psychopathological mechanisms and depressive components are required.

Daily responses were modeled using multi-level dynamic network analysis to investigate temporal associations across days, in addition to contemporaneous relationships between depressive components within a daily window. Among the investigated psychopathological mechanisms, helplessness predicted the strongest across-day influence on depressive symptoms, while emotion regulation difficulties displayed more proximal interactions with symptomatology. Helplessness was further involved in the amplification of other theorized psychopathological mechanisms including rumination, the latter of which to a greater extent was susceptible toward being influenced rather than temporally influencing other components involved in depressive states. Distinctive symptoms of depression behaved differently, with depressed mood and anhedonia most prone to being impacted, while lethargy and worthlessness were more strongly associated with outgoing activity in the network. These results have implications for the impediment of detrimental depressive symptomatology during the present pandemic and beyond the pandemic period.","output":"Within and across-day patterns of interplay between depressive symptoms and related psychopathological processes: A dynamic network approach during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As potential strategies to control the spread of COVID-19, governments all across the globe have implemented interventions such as lockdowns and confinement. While these strategies have helped to control the spread, there have also been evidence of widespread increase in Domestic Violence (DV) which is often under-reported.

Two different models, in increasing level of complexity have been employed to simulate the effect of the lockdown strategy in the spread of COVID-19 and DV. One of the models simulates the spread of DV under three different lockdown scenarios: one long period, two and three shorter intervals that comprise the same interval of time since onset of the Pandemic. Another model studies the interaction between COVID-19 and DV during confinement in relation to the length of the lockdowns. Our findings indicate multiple lockdowns are safer for DV but not necessarily for controlling spread of COVID-19.

Many cybersecurity academic and training programmes exist to prepare students and professionals for these jobs.

Cybersecurity jobs typically require some technical knowledge, an ability to place security problems in a larger context, and an ability to communicate this information effectively and convincingly. The problem with treating technical and non-technical subjects as silos rather than recognizing the two are tightly related and need to be taught together. This paper shows how seven common cybersecurity frameworks and ten masters courses from the UK and US cover both technical and non-technical content. It examines the balance of technical courses, non-technical courses, and courses that mix both technical and non-technical material.

Due to person-to-person transmission of this infection, majority of countries of world introduced lockdown to ensure people stay at home. A complex bidirectional interaction exists between tinnitus and emotional distress, as they can exacerbate one another. Also, COVID-19 infection can cause damage to outer hair cells. The aim of this study is to find out relationship between COVID-19 and initiation or exacerbation of tinnitus. METHODS: The present retrospective study, after approval by Institutional Ethics Committee, was conducted in Department of ENT, GMC Jammu, from June 2020 to March 2021 on 90 patients with primary complaint of tinnitus. All 90 patients were asked to complete the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory. Also, all patients were asked COVID-19-related questions (history of contracting virus/history of grief/anxiety/depression/stress/nervousness/financial status/ physical exercise/sleep routine/ social interactions). RESULTS: Out of 90 patients, 72 patients (80%) had chronic longstanding tinnitus and 18 patients (20%) experienced tinnitus during pandemic. Out of 72 patients who gave history of longstanding tinnitus, 41 patients (56.9%) reported tinnitus to be stable during COVID-19 pandemic, 26 patients (36.1%) reported it to become more bothersome and 5 patients (6.9%) reported that tinnitus was improved. Out of 90 patients, 21 patients (23.3%) were diagnosed as COVID-19 positive. Of these 21 patients experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, 16 patients (76.2%) gave history of exacerbation of tinnitus, 4 patients (19%) gave history of tinnitus remaining stable and 1 patient (4.7%) said that tinnitus was improved. Out of 90 patients, history of negative psychological impact due to COVID-19 restrictions was seen in 65 patients (72.2%). CONCLUSION: With our study, we concluded that ENT specialists should be fully aware that not only pre-existing tinnitus may be exaggerated due to COVID-19 infection, but also, there can be development of new-onset tinnitus due to COVID-19 infection and the negative psychological impact due to COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 and tinnitusa tertiary care Centre experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the last few months represents a serious threat as a world health emergency concern.

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical societies quickly published guidelines recommending avoiding laparoscopy or to consider open surgery because of the fear of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through surgical smoke or aerosol. This narrative review of the literature aimed to determine whether there are any differences in the creation of surgical smoke/aerosol between laparoscopy and laparotomy and if laparoscopy may be safer than laparotomy. METHODS: A literature search was performed using the Pubmed, Embase and Google scholar search engines, as well as manual search of the major journals with specific COVID-19 sections for ahead-of-print publications. RESULTS: Of 1098 identified articles, we critically appraised 50. Surgical smoke created by electrosurgical and ultrasonic devices has the same composition both in laparoscopy and laparotomy. SARS-CoV-2 has never been found in surgical smoke and there is currently no data to support its virulence if ever it could be transmitted through surgical smoke/aerosol. CONCLUSION: If laparoscopy is performed in a closed cavity enabling containment of surgical smoke/aerosol, and proper evacuation of smoke with simple measures is respected, and as long as laparoscopy is not contraindicated, we believe that this surgical approach may be safer for the operating team while the patient has the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.

In this study, we have demonstrated that under nonreducing conditions the N protein forms disulfide-linked homodimers. However, inclusion of an alkylating agent (N-ethylmaleimide [NEM]) prevented disulfide bond formation, suggesting that these intermolecular disulfide linkages were formed as a result of spurious oxidation during cell lysis. In contrast, N protein homodimers isolated from extracellular virions were shown to have formed NEM-resistant intermolecular disulfide linkages, the function of which is probably to impart stability to the virion. Pulse-chase analysis revealed that N protein homodimers become specifically disulfide linked within the virus-infected cell, albeit at the later stages of infection, conceivably when the virus particle buds into the oxidizing environment of the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, NEM-resistant disulfide linkages were shown to occur only during productive PRRSV infection, since expression of recombinant N protein did not result in the formation of NEM-resistant disulfide-linked homodimers. Mutational analysis indicated that of the three conserved cysteine residues in the N protein, only the cysteine at position 23 was involved in the formation of disulfide linkages. The N protein dimer was shown to be stable both in the presence and absence of intermolecular disulfide linkages, indicating that noncovalent interactions also play a role in dimerization. Non-disulfide-mediated N protein interactions were subsequently demonstrated both in vitro by the glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay and in vivo by the mammalian two-hybrid assay. Using a series of N protein deletion mutants fused to GST, amino acids 30 to 37 were shown to be essential for N-N interactions. Furthermore, since RNase A treatment markedly decreased N protein-binding affinity, it appears that at least in vitro, RNA may be involved in bridging N-N interactions. In cross-linking experiments, the N protein was shown to assemble into higher-order structures, including dimers, trimers, tetramers, and pentamers. Together, these findings demonstrate that the N protein possesses self-associative properties, and these likely provide the basis for PRRSV nucleocapsid assembly.","output":"Homo-oligomerization of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus nucleocapsid protein and the role of disulfide linkages."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease of 2019), the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents an ongoing global health challenge and the deadliest epidemic coronavirus outbreak to date.

The cutting-edge on big data-enabled social media analytics for transportation-related studies is limited. This paper brings a range of technologies together to detect road traffic-related events using big data and distributed machine learning. The most specific contribution of this research is an automatic labelling method for machine learning-based traffic-related event detection from Twitter data in the Arabic language. The proposed method has been implemented in a software tool called Iktishaf+ (an Arabic word meaning discovery) that is able to detect traffic events automatically from tweets in the Arabic language using distributed machine learning over Apache Spark. The tool is built using nine components and a range of technologies including Apache Spark, Parquet, and MongoDB. Iktishaf+ uses a light stemmer for the Arabic language developed by us.

Platelets are essential cells that regulate hemostasis, thrombus formation and inflammation; however, the mechanism underlying the interaction between platelets and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains unclear. RESULTS: The present study performed RNA sequencing on the RNA isolated from platelets obtained from 10 COVID-19 patients and eight healthy donors, and discovered that SARS-CoV-2 not only significantly altered the coding and non-coding transcriptional landscape, but also altered the function of the platelets, promoted thrombus formation and affected energy metabolism of platelets. Integrative network biology analysis identified four key subnetworks and 16 risk regulators underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection, involved in coronavirus disease-COVID-19, platelet activation and immune response pathways. Furthermore, four risk genes (upstream binding transcription factor, RNA polymerase II, I and III subunit L, Y-box binding protein 1 and yippee like 2) were found to be associated with COVID-19 severity. Finally, a significant alteration in the von Willebrand factor/glycoprotein Ib-IX-V axis was revealed to be strongly associated with platelet aggregation and immunothrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptional landscape and the identification of critical subnetworks and risk genes of platelets provided novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of immunothrombosis in COVID-19 progression, which may pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for preventing COVID-19-associated thrombosis and improving the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients.

METHODS Porcine carotid, renal, iliac, and femoral arteries were sealed using a bipolar electrosurgical device in vivo. Following removal, arterial diameter was measured and vessels' seals tested for arterial burst pressure (ABPr). Samples were then analyzed histologically and biochemically for collagen and elastin content. RESULTS Arteries with the highest collagen-elastin ratio (C/E) (renal) consistently demonstrated significantly higher burst pressures than those arteries with lower C/E ratios (iliac and femoral) independent of artery diameter.

This reversible posttranslational modification, which targets thousands of proteins, is catalyzed by 23 members of the DHHC family of integral membrane enzymes. DHHC enzymes use fatty acyl-CoA as the ubiquitous fatty acyl donor and become autoacylated at a catalytic cysteine; this intermediate subsequently transfers the fatty acyl group to a cysteine in the target protein. Protein S-acylation intersects with almost all areas of human physiology, and several DHHC enzymes are considered as possible therapeutic targets against diseases such as cancer. These efforts would greatly benefit from a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for this crucial enzymatic reaction. Here, we combine X-ray crystallography with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the structure of the precatalytic complex of human DHHC20 in complex with palmitoyl CoA. The resulting structure reveals that the fatty acyl chain inserts into a hydrophobic pocket within the transmembrane spanning region of the protein, whereas the CoA headgroup is recognized by the cytosolic domain through polar and ionic interactions. Biochemical experiments corroborate the predictions from our structural model. We show, using both computational and experimental analyses, that palmitoyl CoA acts as a bivalent ligand where the interaction of the DHHC enzyme with both the fatty acyl chain and the CoA headgroup is important for catalytic chemistry to proceed. This bivalency explains how, in the presence of high concentrations of free CoA under physiological conditions, DHHC enzymes can efficiently use palmitoyl CoA as a substrate for autoacylation.","output":"Bivalent recognition of fatty acyl-CoA by a human integral membrane palmitoyltransferase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus 2019 (COVID 19) was first detected in December 2019 in China.

However, there are children who have significant respiratory disease, and some may develop a hyperinflammatory response similar to that seen in adults with COVID-19 and in children with Kawasaki disease (KD), which has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Objective: The purpose of this report was to examine the current evidence that supports the etiopathogenesis of COVID-19 in children and the relationship of COVID-19 with KD and MIS-C as a basis for a better understanding of the clinical course, diagnosis, and management of these clinically perplexing conditions. Results: The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is carried out in two distinct but overlapping phases of COVID-19: the first triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) itself and the second by the host immune response. Children with KD have fewer of the previously described COVID-19-associated KD features with less prominent acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock than children with MIS-C. Conclusion: COVID-19 in adults usually includes severe respiratory symptoms and pathology, with a high mortality.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery in Denmark from a third-party payer perspective in the mid- (ten years) and long-term (lifetime). METHODS A state-transition Markov model was developed in which patients may experience surgery, post-surgery complications, diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiovascular diseases or die. Transition probabilities, costs and utilities were informed by the literature. Three types of surgery were included: gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy and adjustable gastric banding. The impact of different surgical methods on BMI level was informed by the Danish Obesity Surgery Registry (Dansk Fedmekirurgiregister). RESULTS In the ten-year base-case analysis, bariatric surgery led to a cost increment of 19,332 DKK and generated an additional 1.1 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). In the course of a lifetime, surgery leads to savings of 36,403 DKK, an additional 0.7 life years and 2.9 QALYs. Bariatric surgery was cost-effective at ten years with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 17,818 DKK per QALY and was dominant over conservative management in the course of a lifetime. Up to three years of delay in the provision of surgery resulted in a reduction of life years, a lower QALY gain and a minor decrease in healthcare costs.

Estimates indicate that AD may rank third as a cause of death for older people, after heart disease and cancer. Identification of individuals at risk for developing AD is imperative for testing therapeutic interventions. The objective of the study was to determine could diagnostics of AD from EMR data alone (without relying on diagnostic imaging) be significantly improved by applying clinical domain knowledge in data preprocessing and positive dataset selection rather than setting na?ve filters. METHODS: : Data were extracted from the repository of heterogeneous ambulatory EMR data, collected from primary care medical offices all over the U.S. Medical domain knowledge was applied to build a positive dataset from data relevant to AD. Selected Clinically Relevant Positive (SCRP) datasets were used as inputs to a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) deep learning model to predict will the patient develop AD. RESULTS: : Risk scores prediction of AD using the drugs domain information in an SCRP AD dataset of 2,324 patients achieved high out-of-sample score - 0.98-0.99 Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) when using 90% of SCRP dataset for training. AUPRC dropped to 0.89 when training the model using less than 1,500 cases from the SCRP dataset. The model was still significantly better than when using na?ve dataset selection. CONCLUSION: : The LSTM RNN method that used data relevant to AD performed significantly better when learning from the SCRP dataset than when datasets were selected na?vely. The integration of qualitative medical knowledge for dataset selection and deep learning technology provided a mechanism for significant improvement of AD prediction. Accurate and early prediction of AD is significant in the identification of patients for clinical trials, which can possibly result in the discovery of new drugs for treatments of AD.

Data from national government and the last published national audit of ICU resources indicate gross shortages. While the Critical Care Society of Southern Africa (CCSSA) guidelines provide a comprehensive guideline for triage in the face of overwhelmed ICU resources, such decisions present massive ethical and moral dilemmas for triage teams. It is therefore important for the health system to provide clinicians and critical care facilities with as much support and resources as possible in the face of impending pandemic demand. Following a discussion of the ethical considerations and potential challenges in applying the CCSSA guidelines, the authors propose a framework for regional triage committees adapted to the South African context. DISCUSSION: Beyond the national CCSSA guidelines, the clinician has many additional ethical and clinical considerations. No single ethical approach to decision-making is sufficient, instead one which considers multiple contextual factors is necessary. Scores such as the Clinical Frailty Score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment are of limited use in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, the clinician is fully justified in withdrawing ICU care based on medical futility decisions and to reallocate this resource to a patient with a better prognosis. However, these decisions bear heavy emotional and moral burden compounded by the volume of clinical work and a fear of litigation. CONCLUSION: We propose the formation of Provincial multi-disciplinary Critical Care Triage Committees to alleviate the emotional, moral and legal burden on individual ICU teams and co-ordinate inter-facility collaboration using an adapted framework. The committee would provide an impartial, broader and ethically-sound viewpoint which has time to consider broader contextual factors such as adjusting rationing criteria according to different levels of pandemic demand and the latest clinical evidence. Their functioning will be strengthened by direct feedback to national level and accountability to a national monitoring committee.

Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of packaging type and aging time on the meat quality characteristics (instrumental color, WBSF, cooking loss, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) of longissimus lumborum steaks. The results showed that vacuum packaging and aging were the most effective in decreasing the WBSF values of buffalo meat. ABSTRACT: The present study determined the effect of the packaging type and aging time on the meat quality of water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) bulls. A total of n = 36 longissimus lumborum (LL) muscles from n = 18 buffalo bulls were obtained. Half LL muscles were packed in modified atmosphere packaging (Hi-O(2) MAP), vacuum packaging (VP), and oxygen-permeable packaging (OP) on day 1, while the other half were aged for 7 days. Meat instrumental color, cooking loss, WarnerCBratzler shear force (WBSF), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) of the LL steaks were analyzed, both on unaged and aged buffalo meat. Color CIE L* and C* values on all display days and a* on the first 4 days of the simulated retail display under Hi-O(2) MAP packaging were significantly higher than those of the VP and OP. WBSF and TBARS values were also higher under Hi-O(2) MAP as compared to the other packaging. Steaks under OP exhibited lower cooking loss but higher TVB-N values than the MAP and VP. The 7-day-aged buffalo meat indicated higher instrumental color (L*, a* and C*), cooking loss, and lower WBSF values than fresh meat. This study concluded that Hi-O(2) MAP improved the color; however, it negatively influenced the buffalo meats WBSF and TBAR values.

Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the primary greenhouse gases (GHGs) mainly responsible for the global warming and climate change. These GHGs have drawn lot of attention due to their significant role in the global warming potential. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested to stop global warming at 1.5oC above preindustrial levels as warming beyond this level might lead to heat extremes, alter insect and plant phenology (Phenological shifts) and more occurrence of vector borne diseases.

Building on these experiences, this article offers insights and strategies for implementing remote monitoring programs at scale and improving the sustainability of these efforts. As virtual care becomes a patient expectation, the authors hope hospitals recognize the promise that remote monitoring holds in reenvisioning health care delivery.","output":"The Promise of Remote Patient Monitoring: Lessons Learned During the COVID-19 Surge in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Growth of feline infectious peritonitis virus in a continuous feline cell line is described and evidence for the macrophage-like character of these cells is presented. Under one-step growth conditions, cytopathic changes and giant cell formation were observed 12 h after infection; more than 99% of the virus remained cell-associated 15 h after infection. Viral proteins at the surface of infected cells were detected by immunofluorescence. The exposed antigens were localized on four proteins with molecular weights of 225.5K, 175K, 138K and 25K using radioiodination followed by immunoprecipitation. Another viral polypeptide of 44K (the nucleocapsid protein) was only labelled when the cell membranes had been disrupted. Expression of viral antigens on the cell surface may be a significant factor in the immune pathogenesis of feline infectious peritonitis.","output":"Expression of feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus antigens on the surface of feline macrophage-like cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emetine is a FDA-approved drug for the treatment of amebiasis. Previously we demonstrated the antiviral efficacy of emetine against some RNA and DNA viruses. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro antiviral efficacy of emetine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and found it to be a low nanomolar (nM) inhibitor. Interestingly, emetine exhibited protective efficacy against lethal challenge with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; a chicken coronavirus) in the embryonated chicken egg infection model. Emetine treatment led to a decrease in viral RNA and protein synthesis without affecting other steps of viral life cycle such as attachment, entry and budding. In a chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assay, emetine was shown to disrupt the binding of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA with eIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E, a cellular cap-binding protein required for initiation of protein translation). Further, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies suggested that emetine may bind to the cap-binding pocket of eIF4E, in a similar conformation as m7-GTP binds. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 was shown to exploit ERK/MNK1/eIF4E signalling pathway for its effective replication in the target cells. Collectively our results suggest that further detailed evaluation of emetine as a potential treatment for COVID-19 may be warranted.","output":"Emetine suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication by inhibiting interaction of viral mRNA with eIF4E"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 virus outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020. Although the Chinese central government implemented significant measures to control the epidemic from January 20 within China, the crisis had already escalated dramatically.Between December 1, 2019, and January 20, 2020, a total of 51 days passed before the Chinese central government took full control. Several major factors combined to cause what had been in retrospect a clear break in the governmental information chain between December 1 and January 20. The management of this epidemic also illustrated key organizational limitations of the current Chinese health system, in particular provincial-level senior officials' lack of knowledge and awareness of potential public health risks and insufficient emergency medical material storage and logistics arrangements.We review the specific disease control actions that the Chinese central government took between January 20 and January 27, the major reasons why the governmental information chain had broken before January 20, and key structural health system limitations highlighted as the epidemic expanded.","output":"Policy Lessons From Early Reactions to the COVID-19 Virus in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Combined central and peripheral demyelination (CCPD) is not encountered frequently in the clinical practice, and it requires a high level of suspicion for diagnosis. We describe a case of a young man who was diagnosed with radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) after presenting initially with symptoms suggestive of central nervous system (CNS) insult in the form of double vision, slurred speech, left-sided numbness, and unsteadiness. However, on the next day of admission, his neurological examination was remarkable for ataxia, areflexia, and ophthalmoplegia, the typical triad of Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS). After confirming both diagnoses, the final diagnosis of CCPD was made. The challenges one may face to diagnose and treat CCPD urge sharing of similar cases to open the door for further extensive and thorough investigations and to encourage further studies and analysis of available data to come up with consolidated management guidelines for rare disorders.","output":"A New Report of Combined Central and Peripheral Demyelination: A Case Report"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(O,[["render",V]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"consultation/2.md","filePath":"consultation/2.md"}'),R={name:"consultation/2.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
