The aim of the study was to determine risk factors for ocular complication, especially those related to nursing care. The study was conducted in the ICU of a university hospital. Methods for estimating and analyzing medical records were used. The patients evaluation sheet covering 12 categories of risk factors for eye complications was worked out. The study group included 76 patients (34 patients with injuries and 42 without injuries). The ShapiroCWilk test, the Spearmans rank correlation test, the MannCWhitney U test and the Friedmans ANOVA test were used. The level of significance was set at  = 0.05. The most important risk factors for eye complications in the study group were: lagophthalmos (p < 0.001), sedation (p < 0.01), use of some cardiological drugs and antibiotics (p < 0.01), mechanical ventilation (p < 0.05), use of an open suctioning system (p < 0.01), presence of injuries (p < 0.01) including craniofacial trauma (p < 0.001), high level of care intensity (p < 0.01), failure to follow eye care protocol (p < 0.001), length of hospitalization at the ICU (p < 0.001), and the frequency of ophthalmological consultations (p < 0.001).

Materials: and Methods Between 12 January 2020 to 20 February 2020, the records of 124 consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed and divided into survivor (83/124) and non-survivor (41/124) groups. Chest CT findings were qualitatively compared on admission and serial chest CT scans were semi-quantitively evaluated between two groups using curve estimations. Results: Elder age (median: 69 vs. 43y, p<0.001), higher male ratio (31/41 vs. 32/83, p<0.001), and more comorbidities were observed in non-survivor group. On admission, significantly more bilateral (97.6% vs. 73.5%, p=0.005) and diffuse lesions (39.0% vs. 8.4%, p<0.001) with higher total CT score (median: 10 vs. 4) were observed in non-survivor group compared with survivor group. Besides, crazy-paving pattern was more predominant in non- survivor group than survivor group (39.0% vs. 12.0%, p=0.004). From the prediction of curve estimation, in survivor group total CT score increased in the first 20 days reaching the peak of 6 points and then gradual decreased for more than other 40 days (R2=0.545, p<0.001). In non- survivor group, total CT score rapidly increased over 10 points in the first 10 days and gradually increased afterwards until ARDS occurred with following death events (R2=0.711, p<0.001).

Lockdowns and schools reopening coincided with increased variance indicative of conditions with local impact and country scale heterogeneity. University reopening and December holidays reduced variance indicative of country scale homogenisation which reached a minimum in mid-January 2021. Homogeneous propagation was associated with better correspondence with normally distributed residuals while heterogeneous propagation was more consistent with skewed models. Skewness varied from strongly negative to strongly positive revealing an unappreciated feature of community propagation. Hot spots and super-spreading events are well understood descriptors of regional disease dynamics that would be expected to be associated with positively skewed distributions. Positively skewed behaviour was observed; however, negative skewness indicative of cold-spots and super-isolation dominated for approximately 8 months during the period of study. In contrast, death metrics showed near constant behaviour in scaling, variance, and skewness metrics over the full period with rural regions preferentially affected, an observation consistent with regional age demographics in England and Wales.

The goal of this study was to better depict the short-term risk of stroke and its associated factors among SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized patients. METHODS: This multicentre, multinational observational study includes hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients from North and South America (United States, Canada, and Brazil), Europe (Greece, Italy, Finland, and Turkey), Asia (Lebanon, Iran, and India), and Oceania (New Zealand). The outcome was the risk of subsequent stroke. Centres were included by non-probability sampling. The counts and clinical characteristics including laboratory findings and imaging of the patients with and without a subsequent stroke were recorded according to a predefined protocol. Quality, risk of bias, and heterogeneity assessments were conducted according to ROBINS-E and Cochrane Q-test. The risk of subsequent stroke was estimated through meta-analyses with random effect models. Bivariate logistic regression was used to determine the parameters with predictive outcome value. The study was reported according to the STROBE, MOOSE, and EQUATOR guidelines. FINDINGS: We received data from 26,175 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients from 99 tertiary centres in 65 regions of 11 countries until May 1st, 2020. A total of 17,799 patients were included in meta-analyses. Among them, 156(0.9%) patients had a stroke-123(79%) ischaemic stroke, 27(17%) intracerebral/subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 6(4%) cerebral sinus thrombosis. Subsequent stroke risks calculated with meta-analyses, under low to moderate heterogeneity, were 0.5% among all centres in all countries, and 0.7% among countries with higher health expenditures. The need for mechanical ventilation (OR: 1.9, 95% CI:1.1-3.5, p = 0.03) and the presence of ischaemic heart disease (OR: 2.5, 95% CI:1.4-4.7, p = 0.006) were predictive of stroke. INTERPRETATION: The results of this multi-national study on hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection indicated an overall stroke risk of 0.5%(pooled risk: 0.9%). The need for mechanical ventilation and the history of ischaemic heart disease are the independent predictors of stroke among SARS-CoV-2 patients.

This paper sheds light on the effectiveness of such a strategy in two European countries (Spain and Italy) by analysing data from June to December 2020, collected via a large-scale online citizen survey with 95,251 and 43,393 answers in Spain and Italy, respectively. Our analysis describes several weaknesses in each of the three pillars of the TTI strategy: Test, Trace, and Isolate. We find that 40% of respondents had to wait more than 48 hours to obtain coronavirus tests results, while literature has shown that a delay of more than one day might make tracing all cases inefficient. We also identify limitations in the manual contact tracing capabilities in both countries, as only 29% of respondents in close contact with a confirmed infected individual reported having been contact traced. Moreover, our analysis shows that more than 45% of respondents report being unable to self-isolate if needed. We also analyse the mitigation strategies deployed to contain the second wave of coronavirus. We find that these interventions were particularly effective in Italy, where close contacts were reduced by more than 20% in the general population. Finally, we analyse the participants perceptions about the coronavirus risk associated with different daily activities. We observe that they are often gender- and age-dependent, and not aligned with the actual risk identified by the literature. This finding emphasises the importance of deploying public-health communication campaigns to debunk misconceptions about SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our work illustrates the value of online citizen surveys to quickly and efficiently collect large-scale population data to support and evaluate policy decisions to combat the spread of infectious diseases, such as coronavirus.","output":"The impact of control and mitigation strategies during the second wave of coronavirus infections in Spain and Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sociopolitical events impact population health; parents' perspective of such events crosses demographics, geography, and generations.

To evaluate their virucidal efficacy, these products must be tested with appropriate model viruses with different physico-chemical properties under conditions representing practical application in hospitals. The aim of this study was to evaluate a quantitative carrier assay. Furthermore, different putative model viruses like adenovirus type 5 (AdV-5) and different animal parvoviruses were evaluated with respect to their tenacity and practicability in laboratory handling. To evaluate the robustness of the method, some of the viruses were tested in parallel in different laboratories in a multi-center study. Different biocides, which are common active ingredients of surface disinfectants, were used in the test. After drying on stainless steel discs as the carrier, model viruses were exposed to different concentrations of three alcohols, peracetic acid (PAA) or glutaraldehyde (GDA), with a fixed exposure time of 5 minutes. Residual virus was determined after treatment by endpoint titration. All parvoviruses exhibited a similar stability with respect to GDA, while AdV-5 was more susceptible. For PAA, the porcine parvovirus was more sensitive than the other parvoviruses, and again, AdV-5 presented a higher susceptibility than the parvoviruses. All parvoviruses were resistant to alcohols, while AdV-5 was only stable when treated with 2-propanol. The analysis of the results of the multi-center study showed a high reproducibility of this test system. In conclusion, two viruses with different physico-chemical properties can be recommended as appropriate model viruses for the evaluation of the virucidal efficacy of surface disinfectants: AdV-5, which has a high clinical impact, and murine parvovirus (MVM) with the highest practicability among the parvoviruses tested.","output":"Evaluation of a Virucidal Quantitative Carrier Test for Surface Disinfectants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the most prevalent type of psychiatric disorder among children after an earthquake.

It is enhanced during nutrient starvation to increase the rate of amino acid turnover. Diverse roles for autophagy have been reported for viral infections, including the assembly of viral replication complexes on autophagic membranes and protection of host cells from cell death. Here, we show that autophagosomes accumulate in Semliki Forest virus (SFV)-infected cells. Despite this, disruption of autophagy had no effect on the viral replication rate or formation of viral replication complexes. Also, viral proteins rarely colocalized with autophagosome markers, suggesting that SFV did not utilize autophagic membranes for its replication. Further, we found that SFV infection, unlike nutrient starvation, did not inactivate the constitutive negative regulator of autophagosome formation, mammalian target of rapamycin, suggesting that SFV-dependent accumulation of autophagosomes was not a result of enhanced autophagosome formation. In starved cells, addition of NH(4)Cl, an inhibitor of lysosomal acidification, caused a dramatic accumulation of starvation-induced autophagosomes, while in SFV-infected cells, NH(4)Cl did not further increase levels of autophagosomes. These results suggest that accumulation of autophagosomes in SFV-infected cells is due to an inhibition of autophagosome degradation rather than enhanced rates of autophagosome formation. Finally, we show that the accumulation of autophagosomes in SFV-infected cells is dependent on the expression of the viral glycoprotein spike complex.","output":"Accumulation of autophagosomes in Semliki Forest virus-infected cells is dependent on expression of the viral glycoproteins."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic has shed light on the detrimental impact of neoliberal policies on public health and well-being and as a result, there have been calls for increases in public spending to rectify the lack of public health services.

Others reported a constant need to be present online, which heightened anxiety and worsened MSK symptoms. CONCLUSION: Lockdown showed that flexible working arrangements, which consider the positive and negative aspects of commuting, posture, movement, and work environment matter for work participation, and can have wider benefits in terms of health and well-being for those with long-term MSK conditions. Incorporating these into new models of work will help make the workplace more equitable and inclusive for people with long-term MSK conditions.","output":"Enabling work participation for people with musculoskeletal conditions: lessons from work changes imposed by COVID-19: a mixed-method study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in Chinese residents psychological state and its influencing factors after the Wuhan shutdown on January 23, 2020. METHODS: Two surveys were conducted on February 1-5 and February 20-24, separately, using an online self-administrated questionnaire among 3145 and 3814 participants, respectively. Subjective indicators of daily-life changes include level of attention, risk of infection, impact of daily life, self-perceived health status, and mental health help-seeking. Individual scores on changes in anxiety, depression, and stress were generated by 6-item, 4-item, and 3-item questions. A multivariate regression model was fitted in each survey, separately and combined. RESULTS: A total of 6959 residents participated in the study, with 32.78% male and 67.22% female, people living in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province accounted for 25.22% and 18.85%, respectively. One week after the Wuhan shutdown, their anxiety, depression, and stress had all increased. Compared with the first survey, the changes in the scores of anxiety, depression, and stress in the second survey were decreased ( = ?1.220, ?0.798, and ?0.623, all P < 0.001). The level of attention, risk of infection, and self-perceived health status tended to be positively associated with the changes in the scores of anxiety, depression, and stress.

Due to the unique life cycle of this parasite, many hosts are asymptomatic. If a host becomes immunosuppressed, a hyperinfection syndrome caused by proliferation of these nematodes can ensue (1). CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old Nicaraguan male was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea. A nasopharyngeal swab confirmed SARS-COV2 infection. He was admitted to the medical floor but was transferred to the intensive care unit due to worsening hypoxia. He was subsequently intubated and treated with intravenous dexamethasone and full dose anticoagulation. His course was complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome ultimately necessitating tracheostomy, multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli pneumonia, prolonged shock requiring continuous vasopressor support and stress dose steroids, diarrhea, and persistent fevers despite broad antimicrobial coverage. His peripheral eosinophil count was noted to be elevated. This in combination with his Nicaraguan origin prompted a stool ova and parasite examination to evaluate for helminthic infection. Microscopic evaluation revealed rhabditiform larvae consistent with Strongyloides stercoralis. Review of a bronchoalveolar lavage gram stain demonstrated a larvae-like structure suspicious for Strongyloides stercoralis as well. He was diagnosed with disseminated strongyloidiasis and treated with ivermectin. His fevers and vasopressor requirements subsequently resolved. DISCUSSION: High dose glucocorticoid therapy has a known immunosuppressive effect on a host's response to infectious agents. In this case, the use of steroids for COVID-19 and shock resulted in strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome. The presence of an Escherichia coli pneumonia was, in retrospect, an important clue to the patient's presentation. Bacterial pneumonia from enteric organisms has been found to be a common co-infection in patients with pulmonary strongyloidiasis (2). Bacteria are transmitted from the intestine, where the larvae start their life cycle. They move into the bloodstream via penetration of the intestinal mucosa by the larvae. The larvae then carry the bacteria into the lungs by burrowing into the alveoli (2). Strongyloides is estimated to infect millions of people worldwide and thus there appears to be an increased risk for associated hyperinfection in the setting of steroid utilization for COVID-19 infections (3). It is important for clinicians to be aware of this risk and to delineate strategies for appropriate testing and initiation of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Disseminated strongyloidiasis can be detrimental in patients with COVID-19. In the setting of a global pandemic during which one of the mainstays of treatment is high dose glucocorticoids, it is important to be cognizant of dormant infections like Strongyloides that may become unmasked during treatment.

Preliminary evidence has shown that the COVID-19 pandemic had a detrimental impact on undergraduate student mental health and well-being; however, existing data are predominantly limited to cross-sectional survey-based studies. Owing to the evolving nature of the pandemic, longer-term prospective surveillance efforts are needed to better anticipate risk and protective factors during a pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The overarching aim of this study is to use a mobile (primarily smartphone-based) surveillance system to identify risk and protective factors for undergraduate students mental health. Factors will be identified from weekly self-report data (eg, affect and living accommodation) and device sensor data (eg, physical activity and device usage) to prospectively predict self-reported mental health and service utilization. METHODS: Undergraduate students at Western University (London, Ontario, Canada), will be recruited via email to complete an internet-based baseline questionnaire with the option to participate in the study on a weekly basis, using the Student Pandemic Experience (SPE) mobile app for Android/iOS. The app collects sensor samples (eg, GPS coordinates and steps) and self-reported weekly mental health and wellness surveys. Student participants can opt in to link their mobile data with campus-based administrative data capturing health service utilization. Risk and protective factors that predict mental health outcomes are expected to be estimated from (1) cross-sectional associations among students characteristics (eg, demographics) and key psychosocial factors (eg, affect, stress, and social connection), and behaviors (eg, physical activity and device usage) and (2) longitudinal associations between psychosocial and behavioral factors and campus-based health service utilization. RESULTS: Data collection began November 9, 2020, and will be ongoing through to at least October 31, 2021. Retention from the baseline survey (N=427) to app sign-up was 74% (315/427), with 175-215 (55%-68%) app participants actively responding to weekly surveys. From November 9, 2020, to August 8, 2021, a total of 4851 responses to the app surveys and 25,985 sensor samples (consisting of up to 68 individual data items each; eg, GPS coordinates and steps) were collected from the 315 participants who signed up for the app. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this real-world longitudinal cohort study of undergraduate students mental health based on questionnaires and mobile sensor metrics is expected to show psychosocial and behavioral patterns associated with both positive and negative mental healthCrelated states during pandemic conditions at a relatively large, public, and residential Canadian university campus. The results can be used to support decision-makers and students during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and similar future events.

RESULTS: We confirmed that complement activation is systemically increased in COVID-19 patients and is associated with a worse disease outcome. We showed that plasma levels of C1q and circulating immune complexes (CIC) were markedly increased in severe COVID-19 patients and correlated with higher IgG titers, greater complement activation and higher disease severity score. Additional analyses showed that the classical pathway was the main arm responsible for augmented complement activation in severe patients. In addition, we demonstrated that a rapid IgG response to SARS-CoV-2 and an anamnestic IgG response to the nucleoprotein of the CCC were strongly correlated with CIC levels, complement activation, and disease severity.

METHODS: Relevant studies published between January 2000 and December 2020 were identified by systematic online search on PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus databases without language restriction. Pooled prevalence was estimated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity of studies were assessed using Cochrane Q test and I(2) test, while publication bias was evaluated using Eggers test. RESULTS: Of the 1,645 articles identified through our searches, 46 cross-sectional studies matched our inclusion criteria, reported data from 29,968 school children of Africa. The pooled prevalence of intestinal protozoan parasites amongst African school children was 25.8% (95% CI: 21.2%-30.3%) with E. histolytica/ dispar (13.3%; 95% CI: 10.9%-15.9%) and Giardia spp. (12%; 95% CI: 9.8%-14.3%) were the most predominant pathogenic parasites amongst the study participants.

In addition to documenting information on interventions used with clients, it is best practice for therapists to use reliable and validated outcome measures to inform their interventions. OBJECTIVE: Through this scoping review, we aim to identify (1) which outcomes are being used remotely to assess balance, mobility, and gait in patients with neurological conditions, and (2) what psychometric data (validity, reliability, etc.) for remotely administered outcomes are available. METHODS: Three main concepts will be included in our search: (1) neurological conditions; (2) administration by telerehabilitation; and (3) outcome measures for balance, mobility, and gait. Studies reporting remote assessment of neurological conditions published since 1990 will be included. The database search will be completed in MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and Cochrane. Gray literature including dissertations, conference papers, and protocol papers will also be sourced. Two reviewers will independently screen each title and abstract using pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Manuscripts that appear to meet the criteria will be subject to further review, and full-text extraction using a pre-piloted extraction sheet if all criteria are met. The data will be categorized by assessment types describing impairments (such as balance, strength, and mobility) or activity limitations or participation restriction (such as functional mobility, ambulatory functions, and activities of daily living). RESULTS: This scoping review will document outcome measures currently used in the remote assessment of neurological conditions. To date, 235 titles and abstracts were screened.

Furthermore, a new, minimally invasive strategy termed 'liquid biopsy' (LB) has revolutionized the field by allowing comprehensive cancer genomic profiling through the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released into the bloodstream. However, its detection requires extremely sensitive and efficient technologies. A powerful molecular tool based on the principle of 'divide and conquer' has emerged to solve this problem. Thus, digital PCR (dPCR) allows absolute and accurate quantification of target molecules. AREAS COVERED : In this review we will discuss the fundamentals of dPCR and the most common approaches used for partition of samples and quantification. The advantages and limitations of dPCR will be mentioned in the context of the field of LB in oncology. EXPERT OPINION In our opinion, dPCR has proven to be one of the most sensitive methods available for LB analysis, even though some aspects such as its capacity of multiplexing and protocol standardization still require further improvements. Furthermore, the increasing sensitivities and lower costs of next generation sequencing (NGS) methods position dPCR as a confirmatory and complementary technique for NGS results which will likely prove very useful for treatment monitoring and assessing minimal residual disease.","output":"dPCR application in liquid biopsies: divide and conquer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite advances in spatial transcriptomics, the molecular profiling of dynamic behaviors of cells in their native environment remains a major challenge.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in a hypertensive population and assess whether there is a link between blood pressure control and SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective observational study that evaluated the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in a chronic hypertensive population (n=1,637) from a specialized consultation of Hypertension and Cardiovascular Risk of Internal Medicine in a tertiary hospital in Madrid (Spain). RESULTS: A total of 147 COVID-19 patients (9%) were found, with a median age of 59 (14) years, where 77 (52.4%) patients were male. Forty patients required hospitalization (27.2%), 15 patients had severe COVID-19 (10.2%), and 6 patients died (4.1%).

Elective surgical procedures were put on hold to prevent the spread of the virus, reduce exposure risk of staff, and potentially repurpose ORs for critical care areas. Interventional radiology (IR) suites were largely kept open for all procedures (emergent or elective) with changes focused on workflow, PPE, and room sanitation between procedures. Previous single-hospital study showed a large reduction in IR procedure volume over a span of 4-weeks. Here, we explore the effect of COVID-19 on procedure volume in a multi-hospital analysis over the course of months. Materials and Methods: Case load in 3 URMC-affiliated hospitals during a 4-months period before and after the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed. Procedure types and context (inpatient, outpatient, or emergency) were recorded for all procedures. CT-guided procedures, angiograms, and venograms were grouped together. Procedure volume was calculated as a percentage of all procedures, and differences per month were compared between pre-COVID and COVID months using two-tailed t-test with significance set at P&lt; 0.05. Results: A total of 7159 procedures were performed over the eight-month period (November 2019CJune 2020). There was a significant reduction in procedures per month after the onset of the COVID pandemic from 1005 to 838 (P = 0.023). When analyzing volume of individual procedures, there was a significant reduction in volume of common procedures, such as Mediport discontinuations (P = 0.035) and ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsies (P = 0.027). There was an increase in volume of procedures shared with other specialties, such as angiograms (P = 0.045) and paracenteses (P = 0.005). More complex procedures, such as TIPS or tumor ablations did not reflect a significant change in volume. There was a significant decrease in volume of emergency room procedures (P = 0.011) and a significant increase in volume of inpatient procedures (P = 0.016);changes in outpatient procedures were not significant. Conclusions: Across 3 hospitals in the URMC network, there was an overall reduction in monthly procedure volume after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As expected, common elective procedures experienced a decrease in volume during the COVID-19 months. However, IR continues to demonstrate its value during the COVID-19 pandemic as a minimally invasive specialty, seeing an overall increases in inpatient volume and procedures commonly shared with other specialties.","output":"Abstract No. 167 Interventional radiology procedure volume changes during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Chronic nonbacterial prostatitis (CNP) has remained one of the most prevalent urological diseases, particularly in older men. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) has been identified as a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin that exhibits broad protective effects. However, the role of DHA in inhibiting CNP inflammation and prostatic epithelial cell proliferation remains largely unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CNP animal model was induced by carrageenan in C57BL/6 mouse. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot were used to examine inflammatory cytokines and proliferation genes expression. Immunofluorescence and immunochemistry staining were used to detect and E2F7 expression. Human prostatic epithelial cells (HPECs) and RWPE-1 was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic CNP model in vitro. Cell proliferation was determined using MTS assay. RESULTS: DHA significantly alleviated the rough epithelium and inhibited multilamellar cell formation in the prostatic gland cavity and prostatic index induced by carrageenan. In addition, DHA decreased the expression of TNF- and IL-6 inflammatory factors in prostatitis tissues and in LPS-induced epithelial cells. Upregulation of transcription factor E2F7, which expression was inhibited by DHA, was found in CNP tissues, human BPH tissues and LPS-induced epithelial cells inflammatory response. Mechanically, we found that depletion of E2F7 by shRNA inhibited epithelial cell proliferation and LPS-induced inflammation while DHA further enhance these effects. Furthermore, HIF1 was transcriptional regulated by E2F7 and involved in E2F7-inhibited CNP and cellular inflammatory response. Interestingly, we found that inhibition of HIF1 blocks E2F7-induced cell inflammatory response but does not obstruct E2F7-promoted cell growth. CONCLUSION: The results revealed that DHA inhibits the CNP and inflammation by blocking the E2F7/HIF1 pathway. Our findings provide new evidence for the mechanism of DHA and its key role in CNP, which may provide an alternative solution for the prevention and treatment of CNP.","output":"Dihydroartemisinin ameliorates chronic nonbacterial prostatitis and epithelial cellular inflammation by blocking the E2F7/HIF1 pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background N-95 masks are in high demand during this COVID-19 pandemic but wearing an N-95 mask is a real challenge to the health workers during their duty hours.

We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the influence of CYP2C19 genotype and PPI class, PPI dose, treatment duration and clarithromycin dose on the cure rate of PPI-containing Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. Methods: Randomized control trials (RCTs) investigating cure rates using a PPI-amoxicillin-clarithromycin regimen among different CYP2C19 genotypes through May 2021 were included. Results: A total of 25 studies (5,318 patients) were included. The overall eradication rate in the intention-to-treat analysis was 79.0% (3,689/4,669, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 77.8-80.2%), and that in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers (EMs), intermediate metabolizer (IMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) was 77.7% (1,137/1,464, 95% CI: 75.3-79.6%), 81.2% (1,498/1,844, 95% CI: 79.3-83.0%) and 86.8% (644/742, 95% CI: 83.9-88.9%), respectively. Meta-analysis showed that the relaTakashitive risk of failed eradication in CYP2C19 EMs compared with IMs and PMs was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.06-1.39, P = 0.006) and 1.57 (95% CI: 1.27-1.94, P < 0.001), respectively, in the fixed-effects model.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect sex-related hormones and testicular function in recovering patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients were separately classified according to the duration of viral shedding (long-term positive vs normal-term group, with the former cases having a duration > 50 days) and disease severity (moderate vs severe group). Differences in sex-related hormone levels were compared between groups and linear regression analysis was used to compare the associations of testosterone (T) and estradiol with various clinical and laboratory factors. RESULTS: A total of 39 COVID-19-infected patients were included in this study. The mean T level was in the normal reference range while the mean estradiol level was above the normal limit. There were no significant differences between the long-term positive and normal-term groups in T (P = .964), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; P = .694), luteinizing hormone (LH; P = .171), prolactin (PRL; P = .836), or T/LH (P = .512). However, estradiol was higher in the normal-term group than the long-term positive group (P < .001). Moreover, there were also no significant differences between the moderate and severe groups in sex-related hormones, duration of viral shedding, or serum biochemical or inflammation indicators. Additionally, regression analyses showed that there were no associations between the T level and the clinical and laboratory factors, while estradiol was negatively associated with the duration of viral shedding. CONCLUSION: In males infected with SARS-CoV-2, most sex-related hormones (T, FSH and LH levels) remain within the normal reference ranges after recovery from COVID-19, and no significant associations were observed between T level and disease duration or severity. At present, there is insufficient evidence to show that SARS-CoV-2 causes hypogonadism and sterility, but the potential risk should not be ignored.","output":"Effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male sex-related hormones in recovering patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The clinical presentation of COVID-19 is extremely heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic to severely ill patients.

Saint George Hospital University Medical Center (SGHUMC) facing the port was subject to severe damage and was non-functional for around a month after the explosion. A considerable number of patients, and staff members present in the hospital at the time of the explosion were injured and subject to physical and psychological trauma, including patients who were undergoing their hemodialysis shift at the time of the blast. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, suicidality, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in this vulnerable population of end-stage renal disease patients. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in March and April 2021 among patients aged 18 years and older, undergoing hemodialysis on a chronic basis at the outpatient unit of SGHUMC. The Arabic version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to screen for anxiety and depressive disorders, while the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) was used to screen for PTSD. Suicidality was assessed by direct questions about passive death wishes, suicidal thoughts, plans and attempts. Other measures included age, sex, marital status, education, socioeconomic status, smoking, alcohol and substance use, malnutrition risk assessment, comorbid medical diseases, past psychiatric history, history of severe COVID-19 infection and assessment of the exposure to the Beirut blast. Results: 42 patients (mean age 66.1;SD: 11.2 years) were included in the assessment of whom 45.2% were female. 69% were married, 31% had a high school level of education or above while 16.6% had earned a university degree. 59.5% were smokers and 40.5% were alcohol users while 2.4% reported alcohol misuse. In addition, 2.4% reported active drug use. 66.7% belonged to a middle socioeconomic status (SES) and 9.5% to a high SES. Around 7% were hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. Two thirds suffered from moderate to severe malnutrition according to the GLIM criteria. Around 40% had cardiovascular disease and one fourth had thyroid problems. Only 12% had previously consulted a mental health professional. Anxiety and depression screening rates were found to be significantly high, reaching 54.8% and 57.1% using cut-offs of 6 and 7 respectively on the HADS. 9.5% of the patients reported being in the hospital at the time of the blast and 7.1% reported being injured. In addition, 23.8% had a close family member either injured or deceased because of the blast. 33.3% of our population screened positively for PTSD using a cut-off of 23 on the PCL-5. 26.2% had passive death wishes and 7.1% had suicide plans, however no one had attempted it. Conclusions: In an urban dialysis unit, affected by a major blast and the COVID-19 pandemic, depression, anxiety, and PTSD were found to be highly prevalent (figure 1), urging the need for a prompt psychiatric evaluation in similar settings and early intervention strategies aiming at improving the physical and mental well-being in this vulnerable population.

Online lecturing has the disadvantage of disengaging students, which leads to poor learning. Instructors can increase student engagement by incorporating active learning techniques into classroom discussions and interactions. Team Based Learning (TBL) has been shown to benefit students in a variety of settings. Ahead of COVID 19, TBL was used in classrooms and occasionally in blended learning environments combining online and classroom instruction. This study aims to introduce an innovative strategy for increasing student engagement through use of online TBL. We designed a TBL strategy using the Blackboard lockdown browser, breakout rooms, and Microsoft forms. The TBL framework of orientation, readiness assurance, and implementation exercises was maintained. METHODOLOGY Students were introduced to course material and held accountable for pre-class instruction through the TBL Readiness Assurance tests. For the deployment of the iRAT, we used the lockdown browser in conjunction with the blackboard Respondus camera. The question type used was multiple-choice without reporting the correct answers to the students. After submitting the iRAT, students were permitted to enter the blackboard session, where they were divided into groups for the tRAT, which took place in the breakout rooms that had been assigned in advance. The students' groups in their rooms were given a link to a Microsoft Form that was structured to look like the IF-AT cards used by TBL, and they were instructed to use it. In order to construct the tRAT, point allocation and branching were used, and each question was entered three times into Forms and assigned a score of 4, 2, or 1 point. An automatic comment was triggered by selecting the correct response, praising the group for their effort, and awarding the required number of points. If the correct answer was not provided in the first three trials, the correct answer is provided before moving on to the next question in the series. When it was determined that all of the groups had submitted their tRAT answers, the breakout rooms were closed, and all of the students were moved to the main room with the blackboard where the session came to a close with a discussion of the answers with the instructor, who immediately provided feedback. Students' perceptions (N=203) were also evaluated using quantitative and qualitative tools, including a self-administered questionnaire and a focus group discussion. RESULTS Based on the data gathered during the readiness assurance process and the attendance of the students, it appears that the students were highly engaged in the online TBL process. The most significant themes identified by participants included increased commitment and preparedness, appropriately challenging questions, a deeper level of learning in the breakout rooms, and the ease with which technology could be used. Furthermore, students stated that participating in the online TBL enhanced their self-confidence in order to face the examinations, offered an opportunity for a weaker student to cover learning objectives, and stimulated further motivation in them to attend these sessions. CONCLUSION Online TBL is a valuable learning strategy that can be implemented to increase student engagement in online learning, provided the applications are used effectively.","output":"Applying Creative Tools that Facilitate Online Team-Based Learning."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pharmacogenomics is a key area of precision medicine which is already being implemented in some health systems and may help guide clinicians towards effective therapies for individual patients.

Early recognition and treatment of MAS are very important, but sometimes it is difficult to distinguish MAS from a severe form of KD. DATA SOURCES: A PubMed search was performed in Clinical Queries using the key terms \\"macrophage activation syndrome or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)\\" and \\"Kawasaki disease\\". RESULTS: KD patients with MAS show high intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resistance and coronary complications. Mortality is also as high as MAS in other diseases. Persistent fever greater than 10 days is highly associated with development of MAS in KD. Splenomegaly is observed in more than two-thirds of KD patients with MAS. Thrombocytopenia is often the earliest laboratory finding of MAS. Hyperferritinemia is highly specific and sensitive for detecting MAS in KD; so, ferritin levels should be checked if there are unexplained clinical exacerbations in KD patients. Given the under-recognition of MAS in KD, it is prudent to consider resistant KD as occult/subclinical MAS. Many KD patients with MAS have good outcomes on immune modulators. However, if KD patients fulfill the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria, they may undergo longer and more intensive treatment than needed. CONCLUSIONS: The possible existence of MAS should be taken into account when a KD patient shows persistent fever, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, or IVIG resistance. The under-diagnosis of MAS in patients with KD is an important issue to be addressed. Therapeutically, however, there is a possibility of over-treatment of MAS in patients with KD.","output":"Macrophage activation syndrome in children with Kawasaki disease: diagnostic and therapeutic approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The impact of biometric covariates on risk for adverse outcomes of COVID-19 disease was assessed by numerous observational studies on unstratified cohorts, which show great heterogeneity. However, multilevel evaluations to find possible complex, e.g. non-monotonic multi-variate patterns reflecting mutual interference of parameters are missing. We used a more detailed, computational analysis to investigate the influence of biometric differences on mortality and disease evolution among severely ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We analyzed a group of COVID-19 patients requiring Intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. For further analysis, the study group was segmented into six subgroups according to Body mass index (BMI) and age. To link the BMI/age derived subgroups with risk factors, we performed an enrichment analysis of diagnostic parameters and comorbidities. To suppress spurious patterns, multiple segmentations were analyzed and integrated into a consensus score for each analysis step. RESULTS: We analyzed 81 COVID-19 patients, of whom 67 required mechanical ventilation (MV). Mean mortality was 35.8%. We found a complex, non-monotonic interaction between age, BMI and mortality. A subcohort of patients with younger age and intermediate BMI exhibited a strongly reduced mortality risk (p < 0.001), while differences in all other groups were not significant. Univariate impacts of BMI or age on mortality were missing. Comparing MV with non-MV patients, we found an enrichment of baseline CRP, PCT and D-Dimers within the MV group, but not when comparing survivors vs. non-survivors within the MV patient group. CONCLUSIONS: The aim of this study was to get a more detailed insight into the influence of biometric covariates on the outcome of COVID-19 patients with high degree of severity. We found that survival in MV is affected by complex interactions of covariates differing to the reported covariates, which are hidden in generic, non-stratified studies on risk factors. Hence, our study suggests that a detailed, multivariate pattern analysis on larger patient cohorts reflecting the specific disease stages might reveal more specific patterns of risk factors supporting individually adapted treatment strategies.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether the ENgaging in Advance Care Planning Talks (ENACT) group visits intervention improves ACP documentation and readiness in older adults. METHODS This randomized clinical trial was conducted among geriatric primary care patients from the University of Colorado Hospital Seniors Clinic, Aurora, CO, from August 2017 to November 2019. Participants randomized to ENACT group visits (n = 55) participated in two 2-hour sessions with discussions of ACP topics and use of ACP tools (i.e., Conversation Starter Kit, Medical Durable Power of Attorney form, and PREPARE videos). Participants randomized to the control arm (n = 55) received the Conversation Starter Kit and a Medical Durable Power of Attorney form by mail. The primary outcomes included presence of ACP documents or medical decision-maker documentation in the electronic health record (EHR) at 6 months, and a secondary outcome was ACP readiness (validated four-item ACP Engagement Survey) at 6 months. RESULTS Participants were a mean of 77 years old, 60% female, and 79% white. At 6 months, 71% of ENACT participants had an advance directive in the EHR (26% higher) compared with 45% of control arm participants (P < .001). Similarly, 93% of ENACT participants had decision-maker documentation in the EHR (29% higher) compared with 73% in the control arm (P < .001). ENACT participants trended toward higher readiness to engage in ACP compared with control (4.56 vs 4.13; P = .16) at 6 months.

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (S-protein), which consists of trimeric polypeptide chains with glycosylated residues on the surface, triggers the virus entry into a host cell. Extensive structural and functional studies on this protein have rapidly advanced our understanding of the S-protein structure at atomic resolutions, although most of these structural studies overlook the effect of glycans attached to the S-protein on the conformational stability and functional motions between the inactive down and active up forms. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of both down and up forms of a fully glycosylated S-protein in solution as well as targeted molecular dynamics simulations between them to elucidate key interdomain interactions for stabilizing each form and inducing the large-scale conformational transitions. The residue-level interaction analysis of the simulation trajectories detects distinct amino acid residues and N-glycans as determinants on conformational stability of each form. During the conformational transitions between them, interdomain interactions mediated by glycosylated residues are switched to play key roles on the stabilization of another form. Electrostatic interactions, as well as hydrogen bonds between the three receptor binding domains, work as driving forces to initiate the conformational transitions toward the active form. This study sheds light on the mechanisms underlying conformational stability and functional motions of the S-protein, which are relevant for vaccine and antiviral drug developments.","output":"Elucidation of interactions regulating conformational stability and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Gynura divaricata (L.)

MATERIALS AND METHODS A four-step strategy was developed to explore undiscovered DPP-IV inhibitors within GD. First, the components were preliminarily characterized using UHPLC-HRMS combined with a library search. Second, preliminarily characterized compounds were searched for potential bioactivity. Third, a mixture of these preliminarily characterized compounds was isolated and thoroughly characterized based on fragmentation patterns associated with molecular networking. Fourth, the activities of these compounds were verified using DPP-IV inhibitory assay and molecular docking. RESULTS Diprotin A, a tripeptide inhibitor against DPP-IV, was identified. Thereafter, a mixture of twenty-five diprotin A analogs was isolated and characterized, which exhibited IC50 of 0.40 mg/mL for DPP-IV. Molecular docking results also confirmed the interactions between the tripeptide analogs and DPP-IV mainly via H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions.

The variable expression levels of Akt isoforms with opposite effects on tumor growth and metastasis, however, make it difficult to select the inhibitors to be used for specific breast tumor subtypes. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrated here that Vav1, ectopically expressed in invasive breast tumors derived cells, downmodulates Akt acting at expression and/or activation levels depending on tumor subtype. The decreased p-Akt1 (Ser473) levels are a common effect of Vav1 upmodulation, suggesting that, in breast tumor-derived cells and independently of their phenotype, Vav1 interferes with signaling pathways ended to specifically recruit Akt1. Only in ER-negative cell lines, the silencing of Vav1 induced the expression but not the activation of Akt2. A retrospective analysis of early invasive breast tumors allowed to establish the prognostic significance of the p-Akt/Vav1 relationship. In particular, low Vav1 levels negatively influence the follow-up of patients with low p-Akt in their primary tumors and subjected to adjuvant chemotherapy. As the use of specific or pan Akt inhibitors may not be sufficient or may even be detrimental, increasing the levels of Vav1 could be a new approach to improve breast cancer outcomes.

DICE also performs a neural architecture search to optimize cluster membership and hyper-parameters for model likelihood and classification accuracy. The performance of DICE was evaluated using two datasets with different outcome ratios extracted from real-world electronic health records of patients who were treated for coronavirus disease 2019 and heart failure. Outcomes are defined as in-hospital mortality (15.9%) and discharge home (36.8%), respectively. Results show that DICE has superior performance as measured by the difference in outcome distribution across clusters, Silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index for clustering, and Area under the ROC Curve for outcome classification compared to baseline approaches.","output":"DICE: Deep Significance Clustering for Outcome-Driven Stratification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hematology patients are more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19 than patients with other cancers.

Although many clinical reports support these observations, there has been limited experimental work to determine the underlying mechanisms and cellular processes induced by exposure to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 structural proteins. Importantly, these structural proteins are conserved amongst all current known SARS\\\\CoVs. Our objective was to investigate the effects of the Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N), and Membrane\\\\Envelope (M) SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 structural proteins on inflammation, thrombosis, and diabetic disease markers of human aortic adventitial fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. We hypothesized that short\\\\term exposure to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 structural proteins would result in increased expression of inflammatory, thrombotic, and diabetic proteins in both cell types, which would support a mechanism for altered vascular disease progression. To test this, the cells were incubated independently with the three SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 proteins for one hour, after which we analyzed the expression of gC1qR, ICAM\\\\1, tissue factor, RAGE, GLUT\\\\4, thrombomodulin, PECAM\\\\1, and Connexin\\\\43 (in their respective cell types), using an ELISA approach.

Interestingly, the extent of the expression of these markers was sometimes significantly different for each of the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 structural proteins. This suggests that each of the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 proteins interacts with these cells through different mechanisms, however, more work will need to be undertaken to determine the mechanisms by which these proteins interact with cells. Thus, these results indicate that the cellular response of vascular cells towards SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 structural proteins promotes inflammatory, thrombotic, and vascular dysfunction.

There is a wide consensus that this pandemic has negative psychosocial consequences as well as unforeseeable provision of mental health care services and just not on physical health alone. The aim of this research study is to determine the prevalence of psychological distress and to identify the sociodemographic variables with the main attributable factors associated with the psychological distress among healthcare workers and suggestions on how to reduce the impact on the mental health of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in different regions of the world. METHOD: We performed a cross-sectional study from September-November 2020. We used a self-administered survey tool which was distributed electronically to healthcare workers across the globe. The data were stored on an online database with password protected devices where survey responses were restricted to investigators exclusively. Data collected were: 1) Socio-demographic data (age, gender, marital status, ethnicity, religion, role in the healthcare, region of practice); 2) Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI) questionnaire which contains 22 standardized items. This is a subjective assessment to score the degree of psychological well-being by focusing on 6 domains: depression; anxiety; positive-well-being; self-control; vitality and general health; 3) Subjective assessment from respondents of the main attributable factors causing psychological distress and suggested methods to help reduce the impact on mental health on health care workers. RESULT: Majority out of the 217 respondents were from a younger age group; females and married/domestic partnership, mainly from Western Pacific Region, South East Asian and the African Region. More than half the respondents were moderate-severely psychologically distressed and the three main attributable factors causing psychological distress were: fear of family/friends contracting COVID-19 followed by lack of PPE and discomfort caused by wearing PPE for long hours. Respondents suggested that the distress would be reduced if: more resources were provided in hospital; protocols and guidelines were implemented and counselling facilities with recreational activities were available to frontline workers. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of healthcare workers and more support or strategies need to come in place to protect frontline workers at the time of crises.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of healthcare workers in different regions of the world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Therefore, we established a tele-ICU consultation service model to address these concerns and leverage critical care capacity in these remote settings.

However, the underlying mechanisms in the intestinal microbiome and plasma metabolome in calves with DHD remain unclear. In order to investigate the pathogenesis of DHD in calves, multi-omics techniques including the 16S rDNA gene sequencing and metabolomics were used to analyze gut microbial compositions and plasma metabolic changes in calves. The results indicated that DHD had a significant effect on the intestinal microbial compositions in calves, which was confirmed by changes in microbial population and distribution. A total of 14 genera were changed, including Escherichia-Shigella, Bacteroides, and Fournierella, in calves with DHD (P < 0.05). Functional analysis based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations indicated that 11 metabolic functions (level 2) were significantly enriched in DHD cases. The untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that 440 metabolites including bilineurin, phosphatidylcholine, and glutamate were significantly different between two groups (VIP > 1 and P < 0.05), and they were related to 67 signal pathways. Eight signal pathways including alpha-linolenic acid, linoleic acid, and glycerophospholipid metabolism were significantly enriched (P < 0.05), which may be potential biomarkers of plasma in calves with DHD. Further, 107 pairs of intestinal microbiota-plasma metabolite correlations were determined, e.g., Escherichia-Shigella was significantly associated with changes of sulfamethazine, butyrylcarnitine, and 14 other metabolites, which reflected that metabolic activity was influenced by the microbiome. These microbiota-metabolite pairs might have a relationship with DHD in calves. In conclusion, the findings revealed that DHD had effect on intestinal microbial compositions and plasma metabolome in calves, and the altered metabolic pathways and microorganisms might serve as diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for DHD in calves.","output":"Integrated 16S rDNA Gene Sequencing and Untargeted Metabolomics Analyses to Investigate the Gut Microbial Composition and Plasma Metabolic Phenotype in Calves With Dampness-Heat Diarrhea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the current pandemic, various policies were carried out as well as changes and enforcement of health protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19 that occurred in every sector.

The SARS-CoV viral genome encodes several proteins which have no homology to proteins in any other coronaviruses, and a number of these proteins have been implicated in viral cytopathies. One such protein is 3a, which is also known as X1, ORF3 and U274. 3a expression is detected in both SARS-CoV infected cultured cells and patients. Among the different functions identified, 3a is a capable of inducing apoptosis. We previously showed that caspase pathways are involved in 3a-induced apoptosis. In this study, we attempted to find out protein domains on 3a that are essential for its pro-apoptotic function. Protein sequence analysis reveals that 3a possesses three major protein signatures, the cysteine-rich, Yxx? and diacidic domains. We showed that 3a proteins carrying respective mutations in these protein domains exhibit reduced pro-apoptotic activities, indicating the importance of these domains on 3a's pro-apoptotic function. It was previously reported that 3a possesses potassium ion channel activity. We further demonstrated that the blockade of 3a's potassium channel activity abolished caspase-dependent apoptosis. This report provides the first evidence that ion channel activity of 3a is required for its pro-apoptotic function. As ion channel activity has been reported to regulate apoptosis in different pathologic conditions, finding ways to modulate the ion channel activity may offer a new direction toward the inhibition of apoptosis triggered by SARS-CoV.","output":"The ion channel activity of the SARS-coronavirus 3a protein is linked to its pro-apoptotic function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is showing a wide spectrum of ocular manifestations.

METHODS: Confirmed COVID\\\\19 patients from hospitals in 10 cities of Jiangsu province, China were retrospectively included between January 18, 2020, and February 26, 2020. Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI) was used to defined NAFLD. RESULTS: A total of 280 COVID\\\\19 patients were enrolled. Eighty\\\\six (30.7%) of 280 COVID\\\\19 patients were diagnosed as NAFLD by HSI. 100 (35.7%) patients presented abnormal liver function on admission. The median ALT levels (34.5 U/L vs. 23.0 U/L, P<0.001) and the proportion of elevated ALT (>40 U/L) (40.7% vs. 10.8%, P<0.001) were significantly higher in patients with NAFLD than in patients without NAFLD on admission. The proportion of elevated ALT in patients with NAFLD was also significantly higher than patients without NAFLD (65.1% vs. 38.7%, P<0.001) during hospitalization. Multivariate analysis showed that age over 50 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.077, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.183\\\\3.648, P=0.011), and concurrent NAFLD (OR 2.956, 95% CI 1.526\\\\5.726, P=0.001) were independent risk factors of ALT elevation in COVID\\\\19 patients, while the atomized inhalation of interferon \\\\2b (OR 0.402, 95%CI 0.236\\\\0.683, P=0.001) was associated with the reduced risk of ALT elevation during hospitalization.

Age acquired XCI-skew describes the preferential inactivation of one X chromosome across a tissue, which is particularly prevalent in blood tissues of ageing females and yet its clinical consequences are unknown. Methods We assayed XCI in 1,575 females from the TwinsUK population cohort and employed prospective, cross-sectional, and intra-twin designs to characterise the relationship of XCI-skew with molecular, cellular, and organismal measures of ageing, and cardiovascular disease risk and cancer diagnosis. Results We demonstrate that XCI-skew is independent of traditional markers of biological ageing and is associated with a haematopoietic bias towards the myeloid lineage. Using an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score, which captures traditional risk factors, XCI-skew is associated with an increased cardiovascular disease risk both cross-sectionally and within XCI-skew discordant twin pairs.

Whether the recent increase of breakthrough infections was caused by waning immunity to the primary vaccination or by emergence of new variants that are more highly transmissible is also unknown. Methods: We extracted data on vaccination histories and clinical outcomes (Covid19, hospitalization, death) for the period from December 13, 2020 through September 8, 2021 by linking data from the North Carolina COVID19 Surveillance System and COVID19 Vaccine Management System covering ~10.6 million residents statewide. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen) vaccines in reducing the incidence of Covid19 over successive post-vaccination time periods, producing separate estimates for individuals vaccinated during different calendar periods. In addition, we used Cox regression with time-dependent vaccination status and time-varying hazard ratios to estimate the effectiveness of the three vaccines in reducing the hazard rates or current risks of Covid19, hospitalization, and death, as a function of time elapsed since the first dose. Results: For the Pfizer two-dose regimen, vaccine effectiveness in reducing the current risk of Covid-19 ramps to a peak level of 94.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.5 to 95.2) at 2 months (post the first dose) and drops to 70.1% (95% CI, 68.9 to 71.2) after 7 months; effectiveness in reducing the current risk of hospitalization ramps to a peak level of 96.4% (95% CI, 94.7 to 97.5) at 2 months and remains at 87.7% (95% CI, 84.3 to 90.4) at 7 months; effectiveness in reducing the current risk of death ramps to 95.9% (95% CI, 92.9 to 97.6) at 2 months and is maintained at 88.4% (95% CI, 83.0 to 92.1) at 7 months. For the Moderna two-dose regimen, vaccine effectiveness in reducing the current risk of Covid-19 ramps to a peak level of 96.0% (95% CI, 95.6 to 96.4) at 2 months and drops to 81.9% (95% CI, 81.0 to 82.7) after 7 months; effectiveness in reducing the current risk of hospitalization ramps to a peak level of 97.5% (95% CI, 96.3 to 98.3) at 2 months and remains at 92.3% (95% CI, 89.7 to 94.3) at 7 months; effectiveness in reducing the current risk of death ramps to 96.0% (95% CI, 91.9 to 98.0) at 3 months and remains at 93.7% (95% CI, 90.2 to 95.9) at 7 months. For the Janssen one-dose regimen, effectiveness in reducing the current risk of Covid-19 ramps to a peak level of 79.0% (95% CI, 77.1 to 80.7) at 1 month and drops to 64.3% (95% CI, 62.3 to 66.1) after 5 months; effectiveness in reducing the current risk of hospitalization ramps to a peak level of 89.8% (95% CI, 78.8 to 95.1) at 2 months and stays above 80% through 5 months; effectiveness in reducing the current risk of death ramps to 89.4% (95% CI, 52.3 to 97.6) at 3 months and stays above 80% through 5 months. For all three vaccines, the ramping and waning patterns are similar for individuals who were vaccinated at different dates, and across various demographic subgroups (age, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic region, county-level vaccination rate). Conclusions: The two mRNA vaccines are remarkably effective and durable in reducing the risks of hospitalization and death. The Janssen vaccine also offers a high level of protection against hospitalization and death. The Moderna vaccine is significantly more durable than the Pfizer vaccine in reducing the risk of Covid19. Waning vaccine effectiveness is caused primarily by declining immunity rather than emergence of new variants. It would be worthwhile to investigate the effectiveness of the Janssen vaccine as a two-dose regimen, with the second dose given approximately 1 month after the first dose.","output":"Effectiveness of Covid-19 Vaccines in the United States Over 9 Months: Surveillance Data from the State of North Carolina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen La mayora de la bibliografa mundial sobre la pandemia Covid-19 se ha focalizado en los pases del continente asitico, europeo o americano.

A recent trend has been the development of confinement centres (CCs) which are private non-healthcare establishments run by staff not trained in health care. Concerns about hygiene in CCs arose after infections were reported. We describe the practice of hand hygiene observed in CCs, the availability of resources for hygiene and to determine the prevalence of health related problems in CCs. Methods This is a cohort study of ethnic Chinese mothers intending to breastfeed their healthy infants. They were recruited post-delivery along with a comparison group who planned to spend their confinement period at home, then all were telephone interviewed after their 1-month confinement period about their experience. To avoid any alteration in behaviour, mothers were not told at recruitment that they had to observe hygiene practices. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the effect of place of confinement on rates of infant health problems. Results Of 187 mothers, 88 (47%) went to 27 different CCs while 99 (53%) stayed at home. Response rates for the 1-month interviews were 88% (CC) versus 97% (home). Mothers in CC group stayed in one to four-bedded rooms and 92% of them had their baby sleeping separately in a common nursery described to have up to 17 babies at a time; 74% of them spent less than six hours a day with their babies; 43% noticed that CC staff had inadequate hand hygiene practices; 66% reported no hand-basins in their rooms; 30% reported no soap at hand-basins; 28% reported inexperienced or inadequate staff and 4% reported baby item sharing. Of mothers staying at home, 35% employed a TPC to care for her baby; 32% did not room-in with their babies, but only 11% spent less than 6 hours a day with their babies. 18% of mothers who employed TPCs reported that their TPC had unsatisfactory hand hygiene practices. Health problems that were probably related to infection (HPRI) like fever and cough were similar between the groups: 14% (CC) versus 14% (home) (p=0.86). Multiple logistic regression did not show that CCs were a factor for HPRI: aOR 1.28 (95% CI 0.36 to 4.49). Three mothers reported events that could indicate transmission of infection in CCs. Conclusion We found unsatisfactory hygiene practices in CCs as reported by mothers who spent their confinement period there. Although we were not able to establish any direct evidence of infection transmission but based on reports given by the mothers in this study, it is likely to be happening. Therefore, future studies, including intervention studies, are urgently needed to establish an appropriate hygiene standard in CCs as well as the best method to implement this standard. Empowering CC staff with hygiene knowledge so that they can be involved and contribute to the development of the development of these standards would be important.","output":"Mothers' hygiene experiences in confinement centres: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of coronavirus (known as COVID-19), the virus causing the current pandemic.

Methods A descriptive study was carried out using an administrative database of the military hospital, we used a validated algorithm that classifies patients as having SLE in administrative databases. Infection was defined as an event with main diagnosis using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) coding algorithm or by searching the antibiotics prescription database, additionally, we abstracted some variables related to SLE status in the group of patients in whom infections were documented during the infection event. Results 237 SLE patients were identified. The mean age was 41.9 years (CI 29.0C54.3), 80% were female, 97.7% used conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Of these 237 patients, 22 (9.4%) met the operative definition of infection, in this group the mean age was 44.3 years (SD 16.4). All the 22 patients received conventional DMARDs and none of them had concomitant biologic therapy. In this group of patients, the most common type of infection was bacterial (72.7%), followed by viral (9.1%) including a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion Hospital administrative databases can be a useful source of information for monitoring outcomes that generate significant morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE, in the group of patients in whom infections were documented, bacterial infections were the most frequent. The most documented clinical findings were leukopenia, systemic steroid therapy, and concomitant disease activity.

With some exceptions, these indicators are calculated at the country level and are mainly focused on tracking economic factors, disregarding local urban phenomena. To address this, we present the Urban Dynamic Indicator (UDI), a novel composite indicator designed to measure a city's daily urban dynamic. The UDI is applied to Porto municipality, in Portugal, and it corresponds to a latent factor obtained through a factor analysis over seasonal adjusted daily data regarding traffic intensity, public transportation usage, internet usage in public buses, NO(2) emissions and noise level. The UDI's values show that, by the end of 2020, despite the approach of economic activity to its pre-pandemic values, as suggested by the Portuguese Daily Economic Indicator (DEI), Porto urban dynamic did not recover completely. The UDI enriches the information available for Porto city planners and policymakers to respond to crisis situations and to gauge the application of local policies that contribute to urban sustainable planning. Furthermore, the methodology defined in this work can be followed for the development of daily urban dynamic indicators elsewhere.","output":"The Daily Urban Dynamic Indicator: Gauging the urban dynamic in Porto during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"My essay focuses on Charles Rosenberg's provocative and enduring ideal type of epidemic drama in three acts, which he assembled from a vast knowledge of disease history that stretched from the end of the seventeenth century to his then-present pandemic, HIV/AIDS of the 1980s Reaching back to the Plague of Athens, my essay elaborates on Rosenberg's dramaturgy by questioning whether blame, division, and collective violence were so universal or even the dominant \\"acts\\" of epidemics not only before the nineteenth century but to the present Instead, with certain pandemics such as yellow fever in the Deep South or the Great Influenza of 1918C20, unity, mass volunteerism, and self-abnegation played leading roles Finally, not all epidemics ended \\"with a whimper\\" as attested by the long early modern history of plague These often concluded literally with a bang: lavish planning of festivals of thanksgiving, choreographed with processions, innumerable banners, commissions of paintings, ex-voto churches, trumpets, tambourines, artillery fire, and fireworks","output":"The Dramaturgy of Epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The case fatality rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is estimated to be between 4.3% and 11.0%. Currently there is no effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Thus, early recognition of patients at high risk is important. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study of 110 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. We compared the effectiveness of three scoring systems: the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), and National Early Warning Score (NEWS) systems, for predicting the prognosis of COVID-19. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used for these assessments, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to identify the cumulative risk for 28-day mortality according to the NEWS stratification. RESULTS: For predicting 28-day mortality, NEWS was superior to qSOFA (AUROC, 0.867 vs. 0.779, P < 0.001), while there was no significant difference between NEWS and SIRS (AUROC, 0.867 vs. 0.639, P = 0.100). For predicting critical outcomes, NEWS was superior to both SIRS (AUROC, 0.918 vs. 0.744, P = 0.032) and qSOFA (AUROC, 0.918 vs. 0.760, P = 0.012). Survival time was significantly shorter for patients with NEWS &#8805; 7 than for patients with NEWS < 7.

Thus, expression of the transgene is only promoted when the minus-strand RNA has been synthesized by the functional replication machinery present in infected cells. Reporter assay and strand-specific reverse transcription-PCR showed selective transgene expression in Huh-7 cells harboring an autonomously replicating HCV subgenome but remaining silent in uninfected cells. Furthermore, using the cytosine deaminase suicide gene as a transgene coupled with recombinant adenovirus delivery, we demonstrated that cytosine deaminase was specifically expressed in replicon cells, resulting in marked chemosensitization of replicon cells to the cytotoxic effects of flucytosine.

Methods: In 2019, haemoglobin results of women requiring elective caesarean section were audited during pregnancy and after surgery. Subsequently, changes were made to the Anaemia in Pregnancy Guideline: treatment flow charts were simplified and the Ferinject dose was maximised to 1000 mg. Re-audit took place in 2020. Results: Data were collected for 100 women in 2019, and 135 women in 2020. In both years anaemia prevalence at booking was low (2.2% and 0.7%, respectively). In 2019, 8 women missed booking blood tests compared to only 3 in 2020: an improvement despite the challenges of Covid-19. All anaemic patients were prescribed oral iron. In both years anaemia prevalence increased at 28 weeks. In 2019 all women were again prescribed oral iron, but only 77.8% were followed up. 3 women remained anaemic despite oral iron therapy, but only 2 were offered Ferinject 500 mg. In 2020 only 2.2% missed followed up. Ferinject 1000 mg was administered to 3 women who did not respond to oral iron, or developed anaemia later in pregnancy. In both years one third of anaemic women developed anaemia in the third trimester despite having appropriate haemoglobin levels at 28 weeks (33% in 2019 and 34% in 2020).

We recently conducted a retrospective study to assess the feasibility and safety of the procedure. METHODS The study involved 182 patients (159 men, 23 women) who underwent S-TAPP herniorrhaphy between June 2010 and February 2015 for 202 groin hernias (162 unilateral hernias, 20 bilateral hernias). We examined patient characteristics, hernia type and presentation, operation time, conversion to another repair procedure, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative pain, morbidities, and postoperative hospital stay. We further evaluated operation time and morbidity by comparison between cases of simple unilateral hernia and cases of complicated unilateral hernia, which was defined as (1) a recurrent hernia, (2) hernia following radical prostatectomy, or (3) an incarcerated omental or bowel hernia. RESULTS Five types of hernia were treated: indirect inguinal, direct inguinal, femoral, combined inguinal, and other (a urinary bladder hernia). Operation time was 92.5  29.1 min for the unilateral hernias and 135.7  24.5 min for the bilateral hernias. No major bleeding occurred. Postoperative pain was short-lived and easily managed. Overall morbidity was 8.2% (15/182 patients), and only one postoperative complication (recurrence) required surgical intervention (repeat S-TAPP). Average postoperative stay was 6.7  2.6 days. Two patients experienced numbness in the outer thigh, but this resolved naturally. One superficial surgical site infection developed and was easily treated. Operation times were greater for the complicated vs. simple hernias, but the time differed significantly (p = 0.02) only between radical prostatectomy-associated hernia and simple hernia. No complicated hernia required conversion to traditional laparoscopic repair, but in simple unilateral hernia group one conversion to traditional laparoscopic repair was required for difficulties encountered in the dissection of the large indirect inguinal hernia sac. The incidence of seroma was higher, though not statistically, in the complicated (n = 3) vs. simple hernia group. CONCLUSIONS S-TAPP repair of groin hernia was shown to be a feasible, safe procedure. The advantages are well understood, and further studies are warranted to confirm the long-term benefits suggested by our study.","output":"Single-incision laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal mesh hernioplasty: results in 182 Japanese patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health crisis we are facing is challenging seniors resources and capacities for adaptation and resilience.

This is particularly the case for individuals reporting high trait anxious personality. The present study examined the role of anxiety in both attention and memory-related interactions with threat. We employed a hybrid working memory/visual search task, with participants preselected for low and high anxious personality traits. They selected and memorized an emotional face (angry or happy) appearing together with a neutral face in encode displays. Following a delay period, they matched the identity of the memorized face to a probe display item. Event-related markers of attentional selection (N2pc components) and memory maintenance during the delay period (i.e., CDA) were measured. Selection biases toward angry faces were observed within both encode and probe displays, evidenced by earlier and larger N2pcs. A similar threat-related bias was also found during working memory maintenance, with larger CDA components when angry faces were stored. High anxious individuals showed large selection biases for angry faces at encoding. For low anxious individuals, this bias was smaller but still significant. In contrast, only high anxious individuals showed larger CDA components for angry faces. These results suggest that threat biases in attentional selection are modulated by trait anxiety, and that threat biases within working memory may only be present for high anxious individuals.

The present paper reports an in-depth analysis of the reasons why the regions of the Po valley, Northern Italy, still have difficulties to comply with EU air quality standards, in particular for PM10 and NO2, in spite of strong emission reductions carried out through careful Air Quality Plans put in practice during the last 2 decades. The analysis includes a consistent comparison of emission inventories for different European regions in Italy, Germany and Poland, the measured air quality trends and PM source apportionment in these areas, and, most of all, a thorough investigation of meteorological parameters influencing atmospheric pollutant dispersion and transport. The study reports that in the colder seasons, wind speed, PBL height and atmospheric pressure occurring in the Po basin are three to five times less efficient in diluting and dispersing pollutant if compared to regions north of the Alps. Due to the extremely disadvantageous orographic and climatic configuration of the Po Valley, only radical emission reductions could bring air quality into EU limit values with a questionable cost-benefit ratio of due policies. Provided that air quality standards (particularly for PM10 and PM2.5) aim at protecting people from adverse health effects arising from air pollution, it is however necessary to also consider the toxicity of atmospheric particulate in addition to PM10/PM2.5 mass concentration as a limit value. Based on existing toxicological studies and reports, a discussion is reported about PM toxicity factor depending on toxicity scores for source-specific aerosols and PM composition determined by Source Apportionment. Provided that PM components profiles are strongly different across Europe, the obtained PM toxicity factors range from 0.3 (for areas where the main PM contribution is referable to sea salts or inorganic matter) to 3.5 (where Elemental and Organic Carbon prevail), suggesting that, even at the same mass concentration, the effects of PM10/2.5 on human health are significantly variable and limit values should take into account differential toxicity. Modern PM Source Apportionment techniques, along with reliable toxicity and epidemiological analyses, represent the right tools to overcome the shortcomings of the current regulation standard and build a new consistent health metric for ambient PM in the future, helping policy makers impose effective air quality measures to protect people health.","output":"Improving air quality and health in Northern Italy: limits and perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A long-standing model holds that stochastic aberrations of transcriptional regulation play a key role in the process of ageing.

RESULTS The majority of the products evaluated perform well in contaminated fields, where the risk of wound-healing difficulties is high. Clinical outcomes, which included infection, reherniation, and bulge formation, were variable, and the majority of the studies had a mean follow-up of less than 24 months. CONCLUSIONS Although bioprosthetic matrix has a multitude of indications within the growing field of abdominal wall reconstruction, the functionality, regenerative capacity, and long-term fate of these products have yet to be fully established. Furthermore, the clinical performance, indications, and contraindications for each type of matrix need to be fully evaluated in long-term outcome studies.","output":"Bioprosthetic tissue matrices in complex abdominal wall reconstruction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have reported a correlation between coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and asthma. However, data on whether asthma constitutes a risk factor for COVID-19 and the prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 cases still remains scant. Here, we interrogated and analyzed the association between COVID-19 and asthma. METHODS: In this study, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for studies published between January 1, to August 28, 2020. We included studies that reported the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 and its prevalence in asthma patients. We excluded reviews, animal trails, single case reports, small case series and studies evaluating other coronavirus-related illnesses. Raw data from the studies were pooled into a meta-analysis. RESULTS: We analyzed findings from 18 studies, including asthma patients with COVID-19. The pooled prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 cases was 0.08 (95% CI, 0.06-0.11), with an overall I(2) of 99.07%, p < 0.005 .

First, the median filtering is used to suppress the solitary point noise with preserving the edges of the image without causing the significant blurring. Then, the Canny operator is employed to accurately locate the edges. Next, the circle Hough transform (CHT) is used for performing the iris segmentation. Finally, various classifiers are used to perform the classification. The computer numerical simulation results show that our proposed method can achieve the high classification accuracies. This implies that there is a significant difference on the iris before performing the eye massage therapy and after performing the eye massage therapy.

Considering this we conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial for efficacy and safety evaluation of subcutaneous IFN-alpha2b and IFN-gamma administration in patients positive to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We enrolled 19-82 years-old inpatients at the Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana, Cuba. They were hospitalized after confirmed diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either, subcutaneous treatment with a co-lyophilized combination of 3.0 MIU IFN-alpha2b and 0.5 MIU IFN-gamma (HeberFERON, CIGB, Havana, Cuba), twice a week for two weeks, or thrice a week intramuscular injection of 3.0 MIU IFN-alpha2b (Heberon Alpha R, CIGB, Havana, Cuba). Additionally, all patients received lopinavir-ritonavir 200/50 mg every 12 h and chloroquine 250 mg every 12 h (standard of care). The primary endpoints were the time to negativization of viral RNA and the time to progression to severe COVID-19, from the start of treatment. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Clinical Investigation from the Hospital and the Center for the State Control of Medicines, Equipment and Medical Devices in Cuba. Informed consent was obtained from each participant. Results: A total of 79 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, including symptomatic or asymptomatic conditions, fulfilled the inclusion criteria and underwent randomization. Thirty-three subjects were assigned to the HeberFERON group, and 33 to the Heberon Alpha R group. Sixty-three patients were analyzed for viral negativization, of them 78.6% in the HeberFERON group negativized the virus after 4 days of treatment versus 40.6% of patients in the Heberon Alpha R groups (p=0.004). Time to reach the negativization of the SARS-CoV-2 measured by RT-PCR in real time was of 3.0 and 5.0 days for the HeberFERON and Heberon Alpha R groups, respectively. A significant improvement in the reduction of time for negativization was attributable to HeberFERON (p=0.0027, Log-rank test) with a Hazard Ratio of 3.2 and 95% CI of 1.529 to 6.948, as compared to Heberon Alpha R treated group. Worsening of respiratory symptoms was detected in two (6.6%) and one (3.3%) patients in HeberFERON and IFN-alpha2b groups, respectively. None of the subjects transit to severe COVID-19 during the study or the epidemiological follow-up for 21 more days. RT-PCR on day 14 after the start of the treatment was negative to SARS-CoV-2 in 100% and 91% of patients of the combination of IFNs and IFN-alpha2b, respectively. Negativization for HeberFERON treated patients was related to a significant increase in lymphocytes counts and an also significant reduction in CRP as early as 7 days after commencing the therapeutic schedule. All the patients in both cohorts recover by day 14 and were in asymptomatic condition and laboratory parameters return to normal values by day 14 after treatment initiation. Adverse events were identified in 31.5% of patients, 28.5% in the control group, and 34.4% in the HeberFERON group, and the most frequent were headaches (17.4%). Conclusions: In a cohort of 63 hospitalized patients between 19 to 82 years-old with positive SARS-CoV-2, HeberFERON significantly negativized the virus on day 4 of treatment when comparing with IFN-alpha2b. Heberon Alpha R also showed efficacy for the treatment of the viral infection. Both treatments were safe and positively impact on the resolution of the symptoms.

The virus is notoriously fickle and may attack citizens in say two adjacent countries but not the third. More rarely a global pandemic virus emerges causing millions of deaths worldwide. The SARS outbreak has illuminated weaknesses in planning for sudden outbreaks of disease in a modern society and in particular how panic can grip and cause intense economic disruption. Many communities in the world are neither prepared for a global pandemic nor a very acute epidemic of influenza. The neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are a new class of antiviral drug targeting a viral influenza enzyme, the neuraminidase, which acts both to facilitate virus infection of cells by clearing a passage through otherwise protective respiratory fluids and also by helping release of the virus by cutting the chemical umbilical cord which links up the virus to the infected cell. Extensive laboratory studies of the two molecules zanamivir and oseltamivir have shown that they block all influenza A and B viruses yet tested and would, in theory, even inhibit the 1918 pandemic virus. Both drugs can be used prophylactically to prevent spread of infection in families and communities where 80C90% protection has been documented. The therapeutic effects are also strong in adults and children abbreviating infection, reducing quantities of excreted virus and reducing antibiotic prescriptions. The drugs have to be taken within 48 h of the onset of symptoms. Drug resistance is not a problem at present because although such mutants occur the mutants are compromised and are less virulent than their drug-sensitive parents and they spread less easily. The two drugs could be stockpiled to prepare for an influenza pandemic but, importantly, clinical and scientific experience need to be gained by using these inhibitors in the yearly conflagrations of epidemic influenza, which unchecked do great harm to our communities.","output":"A new millennium conundrum: how to use a powerful class of influenza anti-neuraminidase drugs (NAIs) in the community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This manuscript explores the question of the seasonality of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by reviewing 4 lines of evidence related to viral viability, transmission, ecological patterns, and observed epidemiology of coronavirus disease 2019 in the Southern Hemispheres' summer and early fall.","output":"Will Coronavirus Disease 2019 Become Seasonal?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-saving procedure for critically ill neonates suffering from a potentially reversible disease, causing severe cardiac and/or respiratory failure and refractory to maximal conventional management.

Studies from the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003 highlighted the relationship between SARS-CoV and ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptors in pancreatic islet cells. We describe a pediatric patient who developed Diabetes Mellitus after exposure to the Sars-CoV-2 virus. Case Report: A previously healthy 13-year-old female of Mexican descent was found to be hyperglycemic at her annual visit. The patient endorsed polyuria and polydipsia for 3 weeks, and weight loss for 3months. 3 months prior to presentation, her mother became ill and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR analysis. The patient had no SARS-CoV-2 associated symptoms. Her exam was notable for a BMI was in the 78%ile for age with no acanthosis nigricans. She had no family history of diabetes or autoimmune disease. Initial blood glucose was 729 mg/dL, with bicarbonate of 20.6 mEq/L, pH 7.45, and anion gap of 14 mEq/L. Large ketones were present in the urine. Her concomitant C-peptide level of 1.0 ng/ml was low in the setting of hyperglycemia. Her HbA1c was 14.3%. Diabetes-related autoantibodies, celiac, and thyroid antibodies were negative. Her Sars-CoV-2 antibody titer was positive with a negative PCR. The patient was treated with a basal-bolus regimen of subcutaneous insulin at a maximal total daily dose of 0.7 u/kg/day. 5 weeks later, her insulin requirement and HbA1C were both lower; at 0.5 u/kg/day and 9.3% respectively. Discussion: This patients symptoms of hyperglycemia started shortly after her exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. She had no features consistent with Type 2 DM. She similarly had no serological evidence of DM related autoimmunity, thus being different from reports of new-onset Type 1 DM with confirmed autoimmunity presenting during the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic. Although Type 1B DM without evidence of humoral islet autoimmunity and monogenic DM could not be fully excluded, we postulate that the patient developed SARS-CoV-2 associated DM given her time course and documented exposure to SARS CCoV-2 with the presence of SARS-CoV antibodies.

However, emerging evidence indicates that a small but growing number of COVID-19 patients also manifest neurological symptoms, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may infect the nervous system under some circumstances. SARS-CoV-2 primarily enters the body through the epithelial lining of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, but under certain conditions this pleiotropic virus may also infect peripheral nerves and gain entry into the central nervous system (CNS). The brain is shielded by various anatomical and physiological barriers, most notably the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which functions to prevent harmful substances, including pathogens and pro-inflammatory mediators, from entering the brain. The BBB is composed of highly specialized endothelial cells, pericytes, mast cells and astrocytes that form the neurovascular unit, which regulates BBB permeability and maintains the integrity of the CNS. In this review, potential routes of viral entry and the possible mechanisms utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to penetrate the CNS, either by disrupting the BBB or infecting the peripheral nerves and using the neuronal network to initiate neuroinflammation, are briefly discussed. Furthermore, the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the brain and in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases known to be associated with other human coronaviruses are considered.

Methods Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with data collection forms from electronic medical records and history given by 21 Covid-19 infected patients admitted in S.M.S., Jaipur. Patients were tested for Covid-19 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of 2019-nCoVRNA. Results and Discussion During the course of this study 21 Covid-19 positive patients were admitted in S.M.S Hospital, Jaipur. Male patients constituted 66.66% of total patients and majority of the patients (80.90%) were below 60 years of age. Most of the patients (71.40%) were either foreigners or had a history of foreign travel suggesting that these cases were not community acquired except for 4 cases from textile producing district Bhilwara (known as Manchester of India), an epicenter of North India. Approximately 33.33% patients were completely asymptomatic and of those who were symptomatic cough was the most common symptom (85.71%) followed by fever (78.57%), myalgia (64.28%), headache (28.57%) and dyspnea (28.57%). Three patients (14.28 %) had underlying co morbidity in the form of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease or coronary artery disease. 11 patients (52.38%) had lymphopenia in their hemogram during the course of admission. 3 patients (14.28%) had leucocytosis and 4 patients (19.04%) presented with thrombocytopenia. All 4 patients in the severe category had raised FDP, D-Dimer levels and they needed oxygen support. These patients had deranged liver functions and had elevated pro-calcitonin levels, serum ferritin levels and LDH levels. 1 out of the these 4 cases went into ARDS during the course of treatment. 10 patients yielded negative results for Covid-19. The mean duration from admission to getting 1st Covid-19 sample negative was 8.3 days. 18 patients (85.71%) are still under treatment. Conclusion Clinical investigations in initial Covid-19 patients in the Indian subcontinent reveal lymphopenia as predominant finding in hemogram. Patients with older age and associated comorbid conditions (COPD and diabetes) seem to have greater risk for lung injury thereby requiring oxygen support during the course of disease and these patients also had greater derangement in their biochemical profile.","output":"Clinical Profile of Covid-19 Infected Patients Admitted in a Tertiary Care Hospital in North India."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is receiving worldwide attention, due to the severity of the disease (COVID-19) that resulted in more than a million global deaths so far The urgent need for vaccines and antiviral drugs is mobilizing the scientific community to develop strategies for studying the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication kinetics, pathogenesis, host-virus interaction, and infection inhibition In this work, we review the strategies of tissue engineering in the fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) models used in virology studies, which presented many advantages over conventional cell cultures, such as complex cytoarchitecture and a more physiological microenvironment Scaffold-free (spheroids and organoids) and scaffold-based (3D scaffolding and 3D bioprinting) approach allow the biofabrication of more realistic models relevant to the pandemic, to be used as in vitro platforms for the development of new vaccines and therapies against COVID-19","output":"3D Culture Models to Study SARS-CoV-2 Infectivity and Antiviral Candidates: From Spheroids to Bioprinting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Evaluation the moral courage, moral sensitivity and safe nursing care in nurses caring of infected patients by the COVID-19.

Here, we report a nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine that expresses the more conserved viral nucleoprotein (mRNA-N). We show that mRNA-N alone was able to induce a modest but significant control of SARS-CoV-2 in mice and hamsters. Critically, by combining mRNA-N with the clinically approved S-expressing mRNA vaccine (mRNA-S-2P), we found that combinatorial mRNA vaccination (mRNA-S+N) led to markedly enhanced protection against the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant compared to mRNA-S. In a hamster model, we demonstrated that while mRNA-S alone elicited significant control of the delta strain in the lungs (45-fold reduction in viral loads compared to un-vaccinated control), its effectiveness in the upper respiratory tract was weak, whereas combinatorial mRNA-S+N vaccination induced markedly more robust control of the delta variant infection in the lungs (450-fold reduction) as well as in the upper respiratory tract (20-fold reduction). Immune analyses indicated that induction of N-specific immunity as well as augmented S-specific T-cell response and neutralizing antibody activity were collectively associated the enhanced protection against SARS-CoV-2 delta strain by combinatorial mRNA vaccination. These findings suggest that the combined effects of protection in the lungs and upper respiratory tract could both reduce the risk of severe disease as well as of infection and transmission.","output":"Combinatorial mRNA vaccination enhances protection against SARS-CoV-2 delta variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on comprehensible non-parametric methods, estimates of crucial parameters that characterise the COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on the German epidemic are presented. Where appropriate, the estimates for Germany are compared with the results for seven other countries (FR, IT, US, UK, ES, CH, BR) to get an idea of the breadth of applicability and a relational understanding. Thereby, only prevalence data of daily reported new counts of diagnosed cases and fatalities provided by the Johns Hopkins University are used. Drawing on uncertain a priori knowledge is avoided. Specifically, we present estimates resulting from delay-time correlations for the duration from diagnosis to death being 13 days for Germany and Switzerland. The delay-time correlation applied to time series from other countries exhibit less pronounced peaks suggesting high variabilities for the corresponding time-to-death durations. With respect to the German data, the two time series of new cases and fatalities exhibit a strong coherence within the frequency range of interest, which backs our findings. Furthermore, based on the knowledge of this time lag between diagnoses and deaths, properly delayed asymptotic as well as instantaneous fatality-case ratios are calculated having superiority compared to the commonly published case-fatality rate. The temporal median of the instantaneous fatality-case ratio with proper delay of 13-days between cases and deaths for Germany turns out to be 0.02. Time courses of asymptotic fatality-case ratios are presented for other countries which substantially differ during the first half of the pandemic, however, converge to a narrow range with standard deviation 0.57% and mean 2.4%. Additionally, the time courses of instantaneous fatality-case ratios with optimal delay for the 8 exemplarily chosen countries are calculated and compared by means of the temporal medians. Similarly to the asymptotic fatality-case ratios, the differences are much smaller than expected from mass media reports. The basic reproduction number, R0, for Germany is estimated to be between 2.4 and 3.4. The uncertainty stems from uncertain knowledge of the generation time. A delay autocorrelation shows resonances at about 4 days and 7 days, where the latter resonance is at least partially attributable to the sampling process with weekly periodicity. The calculation of the basic reproduction number is based on an evaluation of cumulative numbers of cases yielding time-dependent doubling times as an intermediate step. This allows to infer to the reproduction number during the early phase of onset of the epidemic. In a second approach, the instantaneous reproduction number is derived from the incident (counts of new) cases and allows, in contrast to the first version, to infer to the temporal behaviour of the reproduction number during the later epidemic course. The time course of the reproduction number is compared to an alternative control measure given by the per capita growth, which largely confirms the conclusions drawn from the reproduction number. To conclude, by avoiding complicated parametric models we provide insights into basic features of the COVID-19 epidemic in an utmost transparent and comprehensible way. The perhaps most striking insight is that the fatality-case ratios do not differ between countries as much as previously suspected.","output":"Exploring COVID-19 Daily Records of Diagnosed Cases and Fatalities Based on Simple Non-parametric Methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first wave of Covid-19 pandemic had a geographically heterogeneous impact even within the most severely hit regions. Exploiting a triple-differences methodology, we find that in Italy Covid-19 hit relatively harder in peripheral areas: the excess mortality in peripheral areas was almost double that of central ones in March 2020 (1.2 additional deaths every 1000 inhabitants). We leverage a rich dataset on Italian municipalities to explore mechanisms behind this gradient. We first show that socio-demographic and economic features at municipal level are highly collinear, making it hard to identify single-variable causal relationships. Using Principal Components Analysis we model excess mortality and show that areas with higher excess mortality have lower income, lower education, larger households, lower trade and higher industrial employments, and older population. Our findings highlight a strong centre-periphery gradient in the harshness of Covid-19, which we believe is also highly relevant from a policy-making standpoint.","output":"Did Covid-19 hit harder in peripheral areas?

METHODS We created a gender-neutral, 2-page comic to augment text-only ED concussion discharge instructions. A sample of patients evaluated at a sports neurology clinic and their parents/guardians participated. Patients and their parents were randomized to view either the comic only or both the comic and publicly available comic-based video. Patients and parents completed preintervention and postintervention surveys to assess likeability and concussion knowledge including concussion definition, symptoms, return-to-ED criteria, and resuming normal activity. Data were analyzed using descriptive and comparative statistics. RESULTS A total of 57 patients (47.4% female; mean age, 15 years) and 37 guardians were enrolled. Most (73%) concussions were sports related, with the majority having sought care within 24 hours in an ED (80%). Over half (51%) had experienced 2 or more prior concussions. Overall, 31 adolescents and 20 guardians viewed both comic and video, whereas 26 adolescents and 17 guardians viewed the comic only. Both comic and video were favorably reviewed, but a higher proportion of respondents rated the video more positively than the comic for likability (P < 0.01), comprehensibility (P < 0.05), and increasing understanding (P < 0.05). Patients' knowledge of some concussion symptoms emphasized in the comic increased after reading (emotional changes, P = 0.02; vomiting, P = 0.04).

Given the continued high incidence of COVID-19, and the likelihood that new variants and other infectious agents may cause future outbreaks, we sought to understand the relationship of nursing home quality ratings and measures of COVID-19 outbreak severity and persistence. DESIGN: We analyzed nursing home facility-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths, county-level COVID-19 rates, and nursing home data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), including ratings from the CMS Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System. We used regression analysis to examine the association between star ratings and cumulative COVID-19 incidence and mortality as well as persistent high resident incidence. SETTING: All nursing homes in the CMS COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset reporting data that passed quality assurance checks for at least 20 weeks and that were included in the January 2021 Nursing Home Care Compare update. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of the included nursing homes. MEASUREMENTS: Cumulative resident COVID-19 incidence and mortality through January 10, 2021; number of weeks with weekly resident incidence of COVID-19 in the top decile nationally. RESULTS: As of January 10, 2021, nearly all nursing homes (93.6%) had reported at least one case of COVID-19 among their residents, more than three-quarters (76.9%) had reported at least one resident death, and most (83.5%) had experienced at least 1 week in the top decile of weekly incidence. In analyses adjusted for facility and county-level characteristics, we found generally consistent relationships between higher nursing home quality ratings and lower COVID-19 incidence and mortality, as well as with fewer high-incidence weeks. CONCLUSION: Nursing home quality ratings are associated with COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and persistence.

This study aimed to describe the clinical spectrum and outcome of C. auris infection in patients admitted to a general hospital in Qatar. METHODS: We conducted this descriptive observational study in a general hospital in Qatar. We have involved all patients with C. auris infection and colonization admitted to a general hospital from December 2018 to August 2019. RESULTS: We identified 13 patients with confirmed C.auris infection/colonization, of which five cases represented an actual C. auris infection, while the remaining eight cases were considered as colonization. The mean age of the patients with infection was 76.6  8.4 years, while the mean age of the patients with colonization was 66.4  24.7 years. Among the individuals clinically infected with C. auris, two had urinary tract infections, one had candidemia, one acquired soft tissue infection, and one had a lower respiratory tract infection. All strains of C. auris were susceptible to echinocandins, flucytosine, and posaconazole while resistance to fluconazole and amphotericin B. Of the patients with C. auris infection who received systemic antifungal therapy, three (60%) died during antifungal therapy.

By increasing the patient's breathing rate to induce fast shallow-breathing (FSB) with the aid of a metronome, our hypothesis was that the motion magnitude of the target would be minimized with no physical contact and compression. Materials/Methods Ten SBRT patients who were treated under FSB were selected for this study: 4 lung and 6 liver cases. Our proposed method is called shallow kinetics induced by metronome (SKIM). We have used a metronome by setting the beats-per-minute (BPM) in the range of 50C60 to induce the SB. This corresponded to a patient breathing rate of 25C30 (breathing) cycles-per-minute. Two 4DCT scans, free-breathing (FB) and SKIM, were acquired and exported to commercially available software. Subsequently, the motion magnitude of the target in a superior-to-inferior direction was measured in each data set and compared. Results The respiratory motion was greatly reduced when using SKIM. The mean  standard deviation (SD) values of motion magnitude of the target in FB and SKIM across patients were 1.65  0.93 cm and 0.76  0.20 cm, respectively. Among these cases, the mean BPM setting of the metronome was 55.2. Conclusion Compared with FB, the SKIM technique could significantly reduce the respiratory motion magnitude of thoracic and abdominal targets. Our proposed method can be an excellent practical alternative to the conventional compression methods due to its flexibility and ease of implementation, especially during a global pandemic when minimal physical contact is crucial for the safety of both patients and care providers.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of Veritor System (Beckton Dickinson) and Biosensor (Roche Diagnostics) rapid antigen tests, with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing as reference standard. The viral load cut-off above which 95% of people with a positive RT-PCR test result were virus culture positive was used as a proxy of infectiousness. RESULTS: Of 2678 participants tested with Veritor, 233 (8.7%) had a RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection of whom 149 were also detected by the rapid antigen test (sensitivity 63.9%, 95% confidence interval 57.4% to 70.1%).

In this analysis, a secondary objective of the study, the score in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) at V1 (baseline) and V4 (6 months  1 month) were compared. RESULTS: Fifty patients were included between May/2019 and February/2020 (age 68.5  9.12 years; 58% women; 6.4  5.1 years from diagnosis). At 6 months, 44 patients completed the follow-up (88%). The PSQI total score was reduced by 19.8% (from 10.43  4.02 at V1 to 8.36  4.41 at V4; p = 0.001). By domains, improvement was observed in subjective sleep quality (PSQI-C1; ? 23.9%; p = 0.009), sleep latency (PSQI-C2; ? 25%; p = 0.025), sleep duration (PSQI-C3; ? 40%; p = 0.001), and habitual sleep efficiency (PSQI-C4; ? 25.9%; p = 0.023). A significant reduction (? 24.7%) in the ESS total score from V1 to V4 was observed as well (from 9.20  5.64 to 6.93  5.11; p = 0.012).

Corticosteroids could attenuate this inappropriate response, although there are still some concerns regarding its use, timing, and dose. METHODS: This is a nationwide, prospective, multicenter, observational, cohort study in critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 admitted into Intensive Care Units (ICU) in Spain from 12th March to 29th June 2020. Using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting, we compared relevant outcomes between patients treated with early corticosteroids (before or within the first 48 h of ICU admission) with those who did not receive early corticosteroids (delayed group) or any corticosteroids at all (never group). Primary endpoint was ICU mortality. Secondary endpoints included 7-day mortality, ventilator-free days, and complications. RESULTS: A total of 691 patients out of 882 (78.3%) received corticosteroid during their hospital stay. Patients treated with early-corticosteroids (n = 485) had lower ICU mortality (30.3% vs. never 36.6% and delayed 44.2%) and lower 7-day mortality (7.2% vs. never 15.2%) compared to non-early treated patients. They also had higher number of ventilator-free days, less length of ICU stay, and less secondary infections than delayed treated patients. There were no differences in medical complications between groups. Of note, early use of moderate-to-high doses was associated with better outcomes than low dose regimens.

In this review, we have surveyed the most used methodologies for diagnosis of COVID-19, which can be basically categorized into genetic-material detection and immunoassays. Detection of genetic material with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and similar techniques has been achieved with high accuracy, but these methods are expensive and require time-consuming protocols which are not widely available, especially in less developed countries. Immunoassays for detecting a few antibodies, on the other hand, have been used for rapid, less expensive tests, but their accuracy in diagnosing infected individuals has been limited. We have therefore discussed the strengths and limitations of all of these methodologies, particularly in light of the required combination of tests owing to the long incubation periods. We identified the bottlenecks that prevented mass testing in many countries, and proposed strategies for further action, which are mostly associated with materials science and chemistry.

In contrast to GPV, the complete genomic sequence data of MDPV isolates are still limited and their phylogenetic relationships largely remain unknown. In this study, the entire genome of a pathogenic MDPV strain ZW, which was isolated from a deceased Muscovy duckling in 2006 in China, was cloned, sequenced, and compared with that of other classical MDPV and GPV strains. RESULTS: The genome of strain ZW comprises of 5071 nucleotides; this genome was shorter than that of the pathogenic MDPV strain YY (5075 nt). All the four deleted nucleotides produced in strain ZW are located at the base-pairing positions in the palindromic stem of inverted terminal repeats (ITR) without influencing the formation of a hairpin structure. Recombination analysis revealed that strain ZW originated from genetic recombination between the classical MDPV and GPV strain. The YY strain of MDPV acts as the major parent, whereas the virulent strains YZ99C6 and B and the vaccine strain SYG61v of GPV act as the minor parents in varying degrees. Two recombination sites were detected in strain ZW, with the small recombination site surrounding the P9 promoter, and the large recombination site situated in the middle of the VP3 gene. The SYG61V strain is a vaccine strain used for preventing goose parvoviral disease. This strain was found to be solely involved in the recombination event detected in the P9 promoter region. Phylogenetic analyses between strain ZW and other classical strains of MDPV and GPV were performed. The results supported the in silico recombination analysis conclusion. CONCLUSIONS: MDPV Strain ZW is a novel recombinant parvovirus, and the bulk of its genome originates from the classical MDPV strain. Two virulent strains and a vaccine strain of GPV were involved in the recombination process in varying degrees.","output":"Molecular characterization of a novel Muscovy duck parvovirus isolate: evidence of recombination between classical MDPV and goose parvovirus strains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 vaccination is proven useful for primary prevention against COVID-19.

Most of existing methods can be summarized as anomaly object detection-based and reconstruction error-based techniques. However, due to the bottleneck of defining encompasses of real-world high-diversity outliers and inaccessible inference process, individually, most of them have not derived groundbreaking progress. To deal with those imperfectness, and motivated by memory-based decision-making and visual attention mechanism as a filter to select environmental information in human vision perceptual system, in this paper, we propose a Multi-scale Attention Memory with hash addressing Autoencoder network (MAMA Net) for anomaly detection. First, to overcome a battery of problems result from the restricted stationary receptive field of convolution operator, we coin the multi-scale global spatial attention block which can be straightforwardly plugged into any networks as sampling, upsampling and downsampling function. On account of its efficient features representation ability, networks can achieve competitive results with only several level blocks. Second, it's observed that traditional autoencoder can only learn an ambiguous model that also reconstructs anomalies \\"well\\" due to lack of constraints in training and inference process. To mitigate this challenge, we design a hash addressing memory module that proves abnormalities to produce higher reconstruction error for classification. In addition, we couple the mean square error (MSE) with Wasserstein loss to improve the encoding data distribution.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the influence of three nursing unit spatial layouts on critical care nurses satisfaction and walking behavior at a university hospital. METHODS: The research used a comparative design by administering a standardized questionnaire, recording walking steps and distances using pedometers, and tracking nurses walking behavior. Thirty-six critical care nurses working on the morning shift consented to participate in the research. RESULTS: The study results showed a relationship between the spatial layout of intensive care units (ICUs) and nurses' satisfaction and walking behavior. Questionnaire results indicated statistically significant variations in nurses' satisfaction with the location of the nursing station, the arrangement of patients' rooms, the availability of family space, and the unit's auditory privacy. Nurses in ICU1 were more satisfied with the nursing station's placement and the availability of family space inside patient rooms, while nurses in ICU2 were more satisfied with the patient bed arrangement and the unit's aural privacy than nurses in other units. The pedometer readings and movement maps revealed significant differences in nurses' walking patterns across the three ICUs. The steps, distances, and movement diagrams demonstrated that ICU1 with private rooms outperformed the other units owing to the nurse station's placement and accessibility to patients and support rooms.

The secondary endpoint was to assess the incidence of hospitalization and mortality due to COVID-19. All patients were older than 65 years of age. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 332 outpatients case files between 9th of March and 30th of April 2020. The median age was 75 years (range: 65C101) and 53% were male. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than half of the outpatients received modified patient care, defined as postponement or cancellation of surgery, irradiation scheme adapted, systemic treatment or the use of telemedicine.

This randomised controlled trial evaluated the outcomes of preperitoneal closed-system suction drainage in laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) hernioplasty for inguinal hernia. METHODS Ninety patients aged 18-80 years who presented to our hospital between May 2016 and February 2017 with primary unilateral inguinal hernia were randomised into the preperitoneal drain and no-drain groups. The primary outcome was seroma size on postoperative day 6. Secondary outcomes included clinical seroma formation and seroma size on day 1, day 6, 1 and 7 months postoperatively, length of postoperative stay, pain score, and recurrence. RESULTS There was no significant difference in age, sex, co-morbidities, hernia side, mean hernia size, operating time, fixation adjuncts, or postoperative stay. The overall incidence of clinical seroma formation was 25.6% on postoperative day 1, 60.3% on postoperative day 6, 13.2% 1 month and 0% 7 months postoperatively. The mean drain output was 57.9 ml. The drain group had significantly fewer patients with seroma on day 1 (6 vs 14, p = 0.022) and day 6 (17 vs 30, p = 0.000), and a smaller mean seroma size on days 1 and 6 (p = 0.000). Subgroup analysis showed that sac ligation versus reduction, peritoneal perforation, and fixation adjuncts had no significant effects on seroma formation or size. There is a trend of lower early post-operation VAS score and more urinary retention in drain group was observed but not reaching statistical significance. No differences in postoperative pain score or complications were observed at 1 and 7 months' post operation. CONCLUSIONS Preperitoneal drainage for 23 h after laparoscopic TEP hernioplasty for inguinal hernia can effectively decrease seroma formation in the early postoperative period, and potentially improving postoperative pain. The benefit is short-term and no significant difference was demonstrated after 1-month post operations. This tradition technique applied to novel operative repair of inguinal hernia is safe and feasible with no significant morbidity demonstrated. Preperitoneal drainage after TEP can be considered as an option to improve patient satisfactions and recovery in selected patient group for maximal benefit, especially for those with prolonged operation which may associate with higher chance of seroma formation.","output":"Preperitoneal closed-system suction drainage after totally extraperitoneal hernioplasty in the prevention of early seroma formation: a prospective double-blind randomised controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a global health crisis affecting millions of people worldwide.

In addition to the lung, gastrointestinal tract and kidney, ACE2 is also extensively expressed in endocrine tissues, including the pituitary and adrenal glands. Although glucocorticoids could play a central role as immunosuppressants during the cytokine storm, they can have both stimulating and inhibitory effects on immune response, depending on the timing of their administration and their circulating levels. Patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI) or Cushings syndrome (CS) are therefore vulnerable groups in relation to COVID-19. Additionally, patients with adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) could also be more vulnerable to COVID-19 due to the immunosuppressive state caused by the cancer itself, by secreted glucocorticoids, and by anticancer treatments.

Further, it is analysed using the data from various states in India along with the respective climatic conditions. It is found that under some indoor scenarios, the coronaviruses present in the respiratory droplets become active due to size reduction that occurs both in sessile and airborne droplet nuclei causing an increase in the spread.

The inclusion criteria were cases of consultation in the emergency department for gastrointestinal diseases that required hospitalization, from January to April, from 2015 to 2020. The pediatric population (under age 12) was excluded. RESULTS A total of 2,457 cases of cases was included. The number of emergency hospitalizations for gastrointestinal cases decreased during the first four months of 2020: 108, 112, 82, and 77, respectively. Comparing April of 2020 with previous years, there was a lower than expected number of cases during the social distancing period (P=0.002). CONCLUSION This study reports a pronounced decrease in consultations for severe gastrointestinal emergencies during the pandemic. Governments and society should be aware that health crises do not halt the natural occurrence of noninfectious diseases; otherwise, an increase in mortality from these morbidities may arise.","output":"Gastrointestinal emergency care during the COVID-19 pandemic: rapid communication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 provided a unique opportunity to examine leadership communication strategies during an extended crisis The authors used political discourse analysis to review the crisis communication of President Donald Trump and seven U S governors using the US Center for Disease Control crisis communication framework The findings demonstrated that U S governors typically used effective communication strategies during their press briefings President Trump often did not use effective crisis communication The governors' crisis communication styles were consistent with the CDC's guidelines The governors ' communication styles demonstrate that they are \\"in the arena, \\" while President Trump has attempted to remove himself from the arena","output":"Leadership Crisis Communication During the Pandemic of 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explores the emotional impact of contextually-relevant source texts (STs) and their influence on student translators' behavior During the first weeks of the Spanish COVID-19 lockdown, an experimental study was carried out in which 69 Spanish translation students were instructed to translate two English STs with different evaluative attitudes (i e optimistic vs pessimistic) toward the COVID-19 crisis The study explored whether the different optimistic vs pessimistic framing of the crisis would influence the students' use of translation strategies (h1), their levels of anxiety (h2) and their levels of affect (h3) after both reading and translating the STs Results revealed statistically significant differences between the two translation strategies analyzed (i e emphasis and attenuation), with more emphasizing strategies than attenuating ones, regardless of the group Moreover, a significant effect of the interaction between text and group was also reported, which indicated an overall stronger inclination to alter -either mitigating or emphasizing- evaluative language in the pessimistic text A significant increase in participants' levels of anxiety and negative affect was also found after the pessimistic framing as compared to the optimistic one Data also pointed to differences between reading and translating in terms of the participant's anxiety levels, with statistically significant higher anxiety scores after reading than translating (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Translating in times of crisis: A study about the emotional effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the translation of evaluative language"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The controversy of tobacco harm reduction in the United States persists despite evidence that an important audience of tobacco prevention and control, i.e., the people who use or are likely to use nicotine and tobacco products, are engaging in practices that may be considered harm reduction. Despite this, a significant proportion of the US tobacco control and prevention field continues to be guided by a precept that there is no safe tobacco, therefore failing to acknowledge practices that may be used to reduce the harms associated with consuming combustible forms of nicotine and tobacco. In this commentary, we argue that ignoring the potential benefits of harm reduction strategies may unintentionally lead to an erosion of trust in tobacco control among some members of the public. Trust in tobacco control as an institution is crucial for the success of tobacco control efforts. To ensure trust, we must return to our basic principles of doing no harm, developing programs that are responsive to peoples experiences, and providing resources in assisting people to reduce the harms that may be associated with practices, such as smoking, which adversely affect health.

Patients who had a travel history to or a residence history in Wuhan or in the surrounding areas in Hubei Province within 14 days before the illness onset were assigned to the imported group (n=70), and the others were assigned to the local group (n=59). The differences in epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, laboratory and imaging results, and prognosis were compared between the 2 groups. The early diagnosed cases were mainly imported cases, and the later diagnosed ones were mainly local cases. The most common first symptom was fever; moderate fever was commonly seen in imported cases whereas low fever was commonly seen in local cases. Lymphocyte counts in the imported group were lower than those in the local group. The imported group showed more advanced and severe abnormalities in the CT scan whereas the local group showed milder pulmonary abnormalities. The proportion of severe and critically severe patients in the imported group was higher than that in the local group.

This work aims to identify high-risk patients who have a high probability of changing from mild to critical COVID-19 (only account for 5% of cases). Methods: Using traditional convolutional neural networks for classification may not be suitable to identify this 5% of high-risk patients from an entire dataset due to the highly imbalanced label distribution. To address this problem, we propose a Mix Contrast (MixCo) model, which matches original features with mixed features for contrastive learning. Three modules are proposed for training MixCo: 1) a cumulative learning strategy for synthesizing the mixed feature; 2) a commutative feature combination module for learning the commutative law of feature concatenation; 3) a united pairwise loss assigning adaptive weights for sample pairs with different class anchors based on their current optimization status. Results: We collect a multi-center computed tomography dataset including 918 confirmed COVID-19 patients from four hospitals and evaluate the proposed method on both the COVID-19 mild-to-critical prediction and COVID-19 diagnosis tasks. For mild-to-critical prediction, the experimental results show a recall of 0.80 and a specificity of 0.815.

The aims of the study were to improve the process of care by provider education of neuromuscular blocking agent titration and monitoring and to determine the impact of clinical endpoint based neuromuscular blocking agent titration protocol. DESIGN: We conducted a proof-of-concept historically controlled study of protocol-based intervention standardizing paralytic monitoring and titration using clinical variables. Education of the protocol was provided to ICU staff via bedside teaching and workshops. The primary outcomes were the time to reach goal paralysis and cumulative neuromuscular blocking agent dose. Secondary outcomes included maintenance of deeper sedation (Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale C5) prior to neuromuscular blocking agent initiation, total time on mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and mortality. SETTING: Medical ICU at a quaternary academic hospital between March 2019 and June 2020. PATIENTS: Adult severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (Pao(2)/Fio(2) <150) patients requiring neuromuscular blocking agent for greater than or equal to 12 hours. Eighty-two patients fulfilled inclusion criteria, 46 in the control group and 36 in the intervention group. INTERVENTIONS: Education and implementation of standardized protocol. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the time to reach goal paralysis in the intervention group was shorter (8.55  9.4 vs 2.63  5.9 hr; p < 0.0001) on significantly lower dose of cisatracurium (total dose 1,897.96  1,241.0 vs 562.72  546.7 mg; p < 0.0001 and the rate 5.84  2.66 vs 1.99  0.95 g/kg/min; p < 0.0001). Deeper sedation was achieved at the time of initiation of neuromuscular blocking agent in the intervention arm (mean Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale C3.3  1.9 vs C4.3  1.7; p = 0.015). There was no significant difference in total time on mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, and mortality between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of comprehensive education, standardization of sedation prior to neuromuscular blocking agent initiation, integration of clinical variables in determining paralysis achievement, and proper use of peripheral nerve stimulation served as optimal strategies for the titration and monitoring of neuromuscular blocking agent in acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Returning to \\"normal life\\" now poses risks, and the use of appropriate protective measures has become necessary to continue daily life and protect public health. The main protective measures to prevent transmission of COVID-19 are masks, soaps and disinfectants. Because coronavirus is a \\"lipid-enveloped virus\\", it is very sensitive to lipid-dissolving chemicals and can therefore be effectively removed by washing hands sufficiently with soap and water. However, using an alcohol-based disinfectant is a more viable option for outdoor use. Alcohol-based disinfectants are inexpensive, immediately effective, easy to use and better tolerated by the skin compared to other disinfectants. WHO recommends disinfectants containing 75% isopropanol or 80% ethanol as highly effective in inactivating the SARS-CoV-2-virus. The current review discusses the role of alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS) in preventing the spread of viruses, their side effects on human health, and suggests the use of alcohol-based sanitizers as potentially effective in combating the current epidemic.

Objectives: This study aimed to determine the influence of time pressure on the emotional exhaustion of front-line healthcare workers, and explore the effects of social sharing and cognitive reappraisal on this. Methods: : This cross-sectional study was conducted in March 2020. A total of 232 questionnaires were completed by front-line healthcare workers in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Hierarchical linear regression and conditional process analysis were performed to explore the relationships among time pressure, social sharing, cognitive reappraisal, and emotional exhaustion. Results: : Time pressure was positively associated with social sharing and emotional exhaustion. Social sharing presented a dark side in terms of the impact on emotional exhaustion. Cognitive reappraisal negatively moderated the relationship between time pressure and social sharing, and it further indirectly influenced the relationship between time pressure and emotional exhaustion through social sharing. Conclusions: : Our findings shed light on how time pressure influences the emotional exhaustion of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 period. Although social sharing is commonly regarded as a positive behavior, we identified a dark side in terms of its impact. We also identified that improving cognitive reappraisal may present a positive strategy toward alleviating emotional exhaustion.","output":"Emotional exhaustion in front-line healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic -- the effects of time pressure, social sharing and cognitive reappraisal: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most COVID-19 cases are treated as outpatients, while the majority of studies on COVID-19 focus on inpatients.

To provide alternative and safe access to health care, the Federal government relaxed telehealth regulations, which effectively removed some of the largest regulatory barriers that had limited the adoption of telehealth in the U.S. In this commentary, we draw on the example of the Marshfield Clinic Health System (MCHS), a large rural health care system in Wisconsin and provide an early assessment of how it adjusted its telehealth services during the early months of COVID-19.

Patients with liver transplant need special care starting from preoperative preparation, surgical intervention ending with postoperative care.

Currently, the world is suffering a pandemic caused by a new strain of the coronavirus family called COVID-19. Certain infection control precautions are needed to protect immunocompromised and vulnerable patients, including liver transplant candidates and recipients from acquiring COVID-19 infection.

METHODS: We did a prospective, single-centre, longitudinal cohort study at the Sheba Medical Centre (Tel-Hashomer, Israel). Eligible participants were health-care workers at the centre who had a negative anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay before receiving the first dose of the intramuscular vaccine, and at least one serological antibody test after the first dose of the vaccine. Health-care workers with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test before vaccination, a positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology test before vaccination, or infection with COVID-19 after vaccination were excluded from the study. Participants were followed up weekly for 5 weeks after the first vaccine dose; a second dose was given at week 3. Serum samples were obtained at baseline and at each weekly follow-up, and antibodies were tested at 1C2 weeks after the first vaccine dose, at week 3 with the administration of the second vaccine dose, and at weeks 4C5 (ie, 1C2 weeks after the second vaccine dose). Participants with comorbidities were approached to participate in an enriched comorbidities subgroup, and at least two neutralising assays were done during the 5 weeks of follow-up in those individuals. IgG assays were done for the entire study population, whereas IgM, IgA, and neutralising antibody assays were done only in the enriched comorbidities subgroup. Concentrations of IgG greater than 062 sample-to-cutoff (s/co) ratio and of IgA greater than 11 s/co, and titres of neutralising antibodies greater than 10 were considered positive. Scatter plot and correlation analyses, logistic and linear regression analyses, and linear mixed models were used to investigate the longitudinal antibody responses. FINDINGS: Between Dec 19, 2020, and Jan 30, 2021, we obtained 4026 serum samples from 2607 eligible, vaccinated participants. 342 individuals were included in the enriched comorbidities subgroup. The first vaccine dose elicited positive IgG and neutralising antibody responses at week 3 in 707 (880%) of 803 individuals, and 264 (710%) of 372 individuals, respectively, which were rapidly increased at week 4 (ie, 1 week after the second vaccine dose) in 1011 (984%) of 1027 and 357 (965%) of 370 individuals, respectively. Over 4 weeks of follow-up after vaccination, a high correlation (r=092) was detected between IgG against the receptor-binding domain and neutralising antibody titres. First-dose induced IgG response was significantly lower in individuals aged 66 years and older (ratio of means 025, 95% CI 019C031) and immunosuppressed individuals (021, 014C031) compared with individuals aged 1800C4599 years and individuals with no immunosuppression, respectively. This disparity was partly abrogated following the second dose. Overall, endpoint regression analysis showed that lower antibody concentrations were consistently associated with male sex (ratio of means 084, 95% CI 080C089), older age (ie, 66 years; 064, 058C071), immunosuppression (044, 033C058), and other specific comorbidities: diabetes (088, 079C098), hypertension (090, 082C098), heart disease (086, 075C100), and autoimmune diseases (082, 073C092). INTERPRETATION: BNT162b2 vaccine induces a robust and rapid antibody response. The significant correlation between receptor-binding domain IgG antibodies and neutralisation titres suggests that IgG antibodies might serve as a correlate of neutralisation. The second vaccine dose is particularly important for older and immunosuppressed individuals, highlighting the need for timely second vaccinations and potentially a revaluation of the long gap between doses in some countries. Antibody responses were reduced in susceptible populations and therefore they might be more prone to breakthrough infections.

METHODS A systematic search was conducted in four databases from inception until April 30, 2021 as well as search of citation of included articles. Studies that reported patients' and/or their caregivers' attitude towards deprescribing quantitatively were included. All studies were independently screened, reviewed, and data extracted in duplicates. Patients and caregivers willingness to deprescribe their regular medication was pooled using random effects meta-analysis of proportions. RESULTS Twenty-nine unique studies involving 11,049 participants were included. All studies focused on the attitude of the patients towards deprescribing, and 7 studies included caregivers' perspective. Overall, 87.6% (95% CI: 83.3 to 91.4%) patients were willing to deprescribe their medication, based upon the doctors' suggestions.

Patients' or caregivers' willingness to deprescribe were not influenced by study location, study population, or the number of medications they took. DISCUSSION Most patients and their caregivers were willing to deprescribe their medications, whenever possible and thus should be offered a trial of deprescribing. Nevertheless, as these tools have a poor predictive ability, patients and their caregivers should be engaged during the deprescribing process to ensure that the values and opinions are heard, which would ultimately improve patient safety.

Emerging evidence suggests that -1 antitrypsin (A1AT), a circulating protein with protective effects on the lung and other vital organs, plays a critical role in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and may be a promising therapeutic option for patients with COVID-19. A1AT deficiency (AATD) is characterized by dysfunctional or insufficient levels of A1AT. Recently, we have proposed that AATD patients are a vulnerable population for COVID-19. Patients with AATD may derive limited benefit from the current COVID-19 vaccines and continue to rely on conventional medical therapy and behavioral adaptations to mitigate the risk of infection. Unfortunately, this population has not been included in the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and studies have yet to characterize the safety, immunogenicity, and ultimately, the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines for AATD patients. Re-evaluation of the COVID-19 vaccine safety and immunogenicity will further promote informed decision-making for vaccination in AATD individuals and contribute to reduce morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection.","output":"Leave no one behind: inclusion of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency patients in COVID-19 vaccine trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to analyze the factors that push small businesses to survive during the COVID-19 pandemic and the factors that influence it.

Methods have been developed using both the liquid and the solid fraction of wastewater, with some studies reporting higher concentrations in solids. To investigate this relationship further, we collaborated with six other laboratories to conduct a study across five publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) where both primary solids and raw wastewater influent samples were collected and quantified for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Solids and influent samples were processed by participating laboratories using their respective methods and retrospectively paired based on date of collection. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations by mass (gene copies per gram) were higher in solids than in influent by approximately three orders of magnitude. Concentrations in matched solids and influent were positively and significantly correlated at all five POTWs. RNA concentrations in both solids and influent were correlated to COVID-19 incidence rates in the sewershed and thus representative of disease burden; the solids methods appeared to produce a comparable relationship between SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration measurements and incidence rates across all POTWs. Solids and influent methods showed comparable sensitivity, N gene detection frequency, and calculated empirical incidence rate lower limits.

Of importance are aviation emissions of carbon dioxide (CO(2)), nitrogen oxides (NO(x)), water vapor, soot and sulfate aerosols, and increased cloudiness due to contrail formation. Aviation grew strongly over the past decades (1960C2018) in terms of activity, with revenue passenger kilometers increasing from 109 to 8269 billion km yr(?1), and in terms of climate change impacts, with CO(2) emissions increasing by a factor of 6.8C1034 Tg CO(2) yr(?1). Over the period 2013C2018, the growth rates in both terms show a marked increase. Here, we present a new comprehensive and quantitative approach for evaluating aviation climate forcing terms. Both radiative forcing (RF) and effective radiative forcing (ERF) terms and their sums are calculated for the years 2000C2018. Contrail cirrus, consisting of linear contrails and the cirrus cloudiness arising from them, yields the largest positive net (warming) ERF term followed by CO(2) and NO(x) emissions. The formation and emission of sulfate aerosol yields a negative (cooling) term. The mean contrail cirrus ERF/RF ratio of 0.42 indicates that contrail cirrus is less effective in surface warming than other terms. For 2018 the net aviation ERF is +100.9 mW (mW) m(?2) (5C95% likelihood range of (55, 145)) with major contributions from contrail cirrus (57.4 mW m(?2)), CO(2) (34.3 mW m(?2)), and NO(x) (17.5 mW m(?2)). Non-CO(2) terms sum to yield a net positive (warming) ERF that accounts for more than half (66%) of the aviation net ERF in 2018. Using normalization to aviation fuel use, the contribution of global aviation in 2011 was calculated to be 3.5 (4.0, 3.4) % of the net anthropogenic ERF of 2290 (1130, 3330) mW m(?2). Uncertainty distributions (5%, 95%) show that non-CO(2) forcing terms contribute about 8 times more than CO(2) to the uncertainty in the aviation net ERF in 2018. The best estimates of the ERFs from aviation aerosol-cloud interactions for soot and sulfate remain undetermined. CO(2)-warming-equivalent emissions based on global warming potentials (GWP* method) indicate that aviation emissions are currently warming the climate at approximately three times the rate of that associated with aviation CO(2) emissions alone. CO(2) and NO(x) aviation emissions and cloud effects remain a continued focus of anthropogenic climate change research and policy discussions.","output":"The contribution of global aviation to

RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence points to a complex relationship between psychiatric and substance use disorders and COVID-19. A range of risk factors associated with psychiatric and substance use disorders increases the risk of exposure to, and complications arising from, the COVID-19 virus. COVID-19 infection has been indicated as having acute and potential long-term impacts on both psychiatric and substance use disorders. Social disruption associated with restrictions imposed to curb transmission has also been identified as a risk factor for new onset of disorders and recurrence and exacerbation of existing conditions. SUMMARY: Early recognition and intervention are key to preventing chronic disability associated with psychiatric disorders, substance use disorders, and their co-occurrence. It is critical that those most in need of services do not fall through the cracks of our healthcare systems.

Case Summary: A 72-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities underwent surgical replacement of the aortic valve with a mechanical prosthetic valve after recurrent IE. After 10 years, IE recurred and the mechanical valve was surgically replaced with a bioprosthetic valve. Ten years later, severe heart failure developed due to severe paravalvular leak (PVL) caused by an aortic annulus abscess complicated by a paravalvular pseudoaneurysm fistula (PPF). The patient was deemed at prohibitive surgical risk and a catheter-based PVL closure procedure was planned. However, the interventional procedure was delayed several months due to the Covid-19 pandemic with progressive heart failure worsening. Despite an acute satisfactory result of the PPF transcatheter closure and a significant clinical improvement, the patient died 10 months later due to multiorgan failure. It is likely that this was due, at least in part, to the long treatment delay caused by the unprecedented strain on the healthcare system. Discussion: In patients at high surgical risk, early diagnosis and prompt interventional treatment of severe PVL are crucial for improving expectancy and quality of life.

During research survey, 350 valid responses were received from Pakistani citizens and examined to understand citizen's behavior towards the adoption of telemedicine applications. The research model was empirically tested with the latest statistical approach namely variance-based structural equation modeling (VB-SEM).Findings>The results of the structural equation modeling have revealed that altogether performance expectancy, social influence, effort expectancy, facilitating condition, habit, hedonic motivation, price values, information quality, system quality and service quality explained 77.9% variance in determining user behavior towards adoption of telemedicine application. The predictive relevance of the research model was found substantial in measuring user behavior to adopt telemedicine applications. The research framework is further extended with moderating role of perceived severity between the relationship of user intention and actual usage behavior.

Further, the buffering role of perceived social support against the detrimental impacts of such stressors was examined. An online cross-sectional study was conducted between September-October 2020. A sample of 345 Syrian refugees in Turkey completed the questions about demographic characteristics, resource loss and perceived discrimination during the pandemic, perceived social support, and depressive and anxiety symptoms. A high level of depressive and anxiety symptoms was reported in our sample. Resource loss and perceived discrimination during the pandemic significantly and positively predicted depressive and anxiety symptoms. Perceived social support acted as a buffer against the detrimental effect of resource loss on mental health.

Enhanced understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis is critical for the development of therapeutics. To reveal insight into viral replication, cell tropism, and host-viral interactions of SARS-CoV-2 we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of experimentally infected human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in air-liquid interface cultures over a time-course. This revealed novel polyadenylated viral transcripts and highlighted ciliated cells as the major target of infection, which we confirmed by electron microscopy. Over the course of infection, cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 expands to other epithelial cell types including basal and club cells. Infection induces cell intrinsic expression of type I and type III IFNs and IL6 but not IL1. This results in expression of interferon stimulated genes in both infected and bystander cells. Here, we have conducted an in-depth analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HBECs and provide a detailed characterization of genes, cell types, and cell state changes associated with the infection.","output":"Single-cell longitudinal analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human bronchial epithelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for acute intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion is often complicated by difficult revascularization and non-involved territory embolization possibly related with larger clot-burden. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of proximal aspiration thrombectomy (PAT) using a balloon-tipped guide catheter for clot-burden reduction in such cases with period-to-period analysis (period 1 : standard MT without PAT; period 2 : PAT first, then standard MT for the remaining occlusion). METHODS Eighty-six patients who underwent MT for acute intracranial ICA occlusion were included in this analysis from the prospectively maintained stroke registry (33 patients in period 1 and 53 in period 2). In period 2, 'responder' was defined as a case where some amount of clot was retrieved by PAT and the following angiography showed partial or full recanalization. RESULTS Fifteen of fifty-three patients in period 2 (28.3%) were 'responders' to PAT. There was a significantly higher incidence of atrial fibrillation in the 'responder' subgroup. Period 2 showed a significantly shorter puncture-to-reperfusion time (94.5 minutes vs. 56.0 minutes; p=0.002), a significantly higher Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction of 2b-3 reperfusion (45.5% vs. 73.6%; p=0.009), but only a trend for better 3-month favorable outcome (mRS 0-2; 36.4% vs. 54.7%; p=0.097). There was no increase in the incidence of procedure-related complications or intracranial hemorrhage in period 2. CONCLUSION A strategy of PAT before standard MT may result in shorter puncture-to-reperfusion time and better angiographic outcome than a strategy of standard MT for acute intracranial ICA occlusion.","output":"Efficacy of Proximal Aspiration Thrombectomy for Using Balloon-Tipped Guide Catheter in Acute Intracranial Internal Carotid Artery Occlusion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article empirically examines the effect of big data analytics (BDA) on healthcare supply chain (HSC) innovation, supply chain responsiveness, and supply chain resilience under the moderating effect of innovation leadership in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsThis retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed MHR ED utilization before and during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large urban pediatric tertiary care hospital in Montreal, Canada. All ED visits for children (5-11 years) and adolescents (12-17 years) between April 1, 2016 and November 30, 2021 were included. The main outcome was the monthly count of MHR ED visits. Pre-pandemic and pandemic periods were compared using an interrupted time series design. The effect of seasonality (in months), age (in years), sex (male or female), and SES (low, average, high) were compared using a generalized additive model. ResultsThere were a total of 437,147 ED visits (204,215 unique patients) during the five-year study period of which 9,748 (5.8%) were MHR visits (7,686 unique patients). We observed an increase of 69% (95% CI, +53% to +85%; p = .001) in the mean monthly count of MHR ED visits during the pandemic period, which remained significant after adjusting for seasonality (44% increase, 95% CI, +38% to +51%; p = .001). The chance of presenting for a MHR ED visit increased non-linearly with age. There were increased odds of presenting for a MHR ED visit among girls between the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.29-1.56).

The known structures and amount of the uncertainties can also help the state authorities to improve the policies based on the recognized source of the uncertainties.

The results confirm that the infected and death sub-models mostly have random uncertainties (due undetected casualties) whereas the suspicious sub-model has uncertainties correlated with the internal dynamics (governmental policy of increasing the number of the daily tests) for Turkey. However, since the developed MIMO model parameters are learned from the data (daily reported casualties), it can be easily adapted for other countries.

Innate and intrinsic immunity form the front-line natural antiviral defense. They involve both tissue-resident and circulating cells, which can produce anti-viral molecules shortly after viral infection. Prototypes of these factors are type I interferons (IFN), antiviral cytokines with a long record of clinical use. During the last two years, there has been an impressive progress in understanding the mechanisms of both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the cellular and soluble antiviral responses occurring early after viral exposure. However, this information was not sufficiently translated into therapeutic approaches. Insufficient type I IFN activity probably accounts for disease progression in many patients. This results from both the multiple interfering mechanisms developed by SARS-CoV-2 to decrease type I IFN response and various pre-existing human deficits of type I IFN activity, inherited or auto-immune. Emerging data suggest that IFN-I-mediated boosting of patients immunity, achieved directly through the exogenous administration of IFN- early post viral infection, or indirectly following inoculation of heterologous vaccines (e.g. Bacillus Calmette Guerin), might play a role against SARS-CoV-2. We review how recent insights on the viral and human determinants of critical COVID-19 pneumonia can foster clinical studies of IFN therapy. We also discuss how early therapeutic use of IFN- and prophylactic campaigns with live attenuated vaccines might prevent a first wave of new pandemic viruses.","output":"EXPLOITING NATURAL ANTIVIRAL IMMUNITY FOR THE CONTROL OF PANDEMICS: LESSONS FROM COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019 a new viral infectious disease caused by severe acute syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) broke out causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019), emerging in China (1-3).

Although this argument suggests positive effects of good national governance on vaccination coverage, to the best of our knowledge, there is no such evidence. The goal of this study was to examine the association between the national governance index and vaccination coverage, particularly among developing countries.MethodsUsing cross-country data, an ordinary least squares regression was conducted to examine the association between the national governance index and two outcome variables on vaccinationthe number of days until the administration of the first dose in the country since December 2019 and the number of doses per 100 citizens as of the end of July 2021. The results were compared between the model including all countries and the model including only non-OECD countries. We also examined the influence of governance on the selection of vaccine manufacturers.ResultsA one standard deviation increase in the national governance index was associated with 9.1 days (95%CI: -15.76, -2.43) earlier administration of vaccines in the country, and a 12.1 dose increase (95%CI: 4.76, 19.34) per 100 citizens.

Patients were divided sequentially into groups comprising the first 75 patients, the next 75, and the final 107 patients. Age, body mass index, gestational parity, indications for laparoscopic hysterectomy, previous pelvic surgery, operating time, haemoglobin decline, complications, need for transfusion, and length of hospital stay were evaluated. RESULTS The mean operating time for total laparoscopic hysterectomy reduced significantly from 76.2 min to 68.9 min (p = 0.001) between the first and second 75-patient groups. Linear regression analysis showed a plateau was reached on the learning curve after 71-80 cases. The rate of all complications started at 8% in the first group of 75 patients, reduced to 6.7% in the next group, and decreased further in the final group to 4.7%. The decline was not statistically significant (p = 0.6). The difference in the need for transfusion was statistically significant between the first 75 patients and the second group of 75 (p = 0.04).

BACKGROUND The end of a human life is often characterised by a physical decline, often implying that a high amount of care is needed. Non-malignant diseases can develop unpredictably; therefore, it is difficult to detect the onset of the EoL phase. DESIGN Data were collected in a cross-sectional multicentre study, using the Austrian Nursing Quality Measurement 2.0. METHODS Descriptive and multivariate statistical methods were used. Care dependency was measured with the Care Dependency Scale (CDS). The study follows the STROBE guideline. RESULTS Ten per cent (n = 389) of the sample (N = 3589) were allocated to \\"a pathway for management of patients at the end of life.\\" The patients and residents in the EoL phase are significantly older and more often diagnosed with dementia, and circulatory system and musculoskeletal system diseases.

Reports of poor outcomes after CPR further dampened the spirits of CPR providers. Hence we surveyed CPR practices for COVID-19 patients across hospitals in India by health care providers. Material and Methods: An online survey using Google Forms was initiated to collect data on performance of CPR in diagnosed cases of COVID-19 after in-hospital cardiac arrest. The survey's web-link was publicized using social media, and participation sought of all personnel involved in CPR delivery in COVID-19 patients. The responses received were analyzed. The main outcome measured were determination of the percentage of COVID-19 patients discharged home who were administered CPR. Results: There were 248 responses from different parts of India. At the time of cardiac arrest, 194 victims had diffuse lung infiltrates, 22 had mild lung disease, while 32 had no documented lung lesion. Twenty-five victims had evidence of pulmonary embolism, 39 had cardiac involvement, and 3 had brain involvement. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in 59.27% of cases but ROSC sustained in only 22.59%. 7.25% of patients, who received CPR, could be discharged home.

Major limitations in arresting or reversing AAAs lie in naturally poor and aberrant regeneration and repair of elastic matrix structures in the aorta wall. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have emerged as a promising regenerative tool and their therapeutic effects are also known to be effected through their paracrine secretions. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) present in these secretions have emerged as critical cellular component in facilitating many therapeutic benefits of MSCs. EV treatment is thus potentially appealing as a stem cell-inspired cell-free approach to avoid possible phenotypic plasticity of MSCs in vivo. In this study, we investigated the thus far unknown effects of BM-MSC derived EVs on vascular elastic matrix repair in the context of AAA treatment. EVs isolated from BM-MSC source were characterized and their pro-regenerative and their anti-proteolytic effects were evaluated on our established in vitro experimental conditions derived from AAA rat model. Our studies revealed the efficacy of BM-MSC derived EVs in attenuating the proteolytic activity and also in imparting elastic matrix regenerative benefits under aneurysmal environment. Interestingly, compared to cell culture conditioned media (CCM), EVs demonstrated superior regenerative and anti-proteolytic benefits in a proteolytic injury culture model of AAA. From these studies, it appears that EVs derived from BM-MSCs could be beneficial in undertaking a reparative effort in AAA induced degeneration of vascular tissue. Statement of Significance Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are localized, rupture-prone expansions of the aorta which result from loss of wall flexibility due to enzymatic breakdown of elastic fibers. There are no established alternatives to surgery, which possess high risk for the mostly elderly patients. Our previous studies have established the elastic regenerative and reparative effect of cell culture secretions derived from adult stem cell source. In this study, we propose to isolate extracellular vesicles (exosomes) from these secretions and evaluate their regenerative benefits in AAA smooth muscle cell culture model. This simple and innovative treatment approach has the potential to arrest or reverse AAA growth to rupture, not possible so far.","output":"Stem Cell Derived Extracellular Vesicles for Vascular Elastic Matrix Regenerative Repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Post-procedure limb compression, hitherto routine following open varicose vein surgery, has been extended to endovenous procedures. However, no robust evidence exists to support this practice. Most of the previous studies have focused on the ideal duration of compression. This study evaluates the clinical and patient reported outcomes with and without post-procedure leg compression following radiofrequency ablation (RFA). METHODS: This single centre, prospective, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial recruited adult patients, into two groups (A: RFA with compression stocking for two weeks, B: RFA alone). The primary outcome was ultrasound determined target vein obliteration at 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included a Quality of Life (QoL) score [Aberdeen Varicose Vein Severity Score (AVSS) and Revised Venous Clinical Severity Score (RVCSS)], patient satisfaction, pain score, and complications. RESULTS: In total, 100 consecutive patients were recruited (A: 51; B: 49) classified as clinical class C2-C6 of the Clinical-Etiological-Anatomical-Pathophysiological (CEAP) classification. At 12 weeks the occlusion rate of the target vein was similar in both groups at 98% (n = 47) and 98% (n = 45), respectively (p = 1.0). There was no statistically significant difference in mean AVSS 6 vs. 5.0 (mean difference -1, 95% CI -2 - 3, p = .57) and mean RVCSS 3 vs. 4 (mean difference 1, 95% CI -1 - 2, p = .46) scores at 12 weeks. Comparable patient satisfaction scores were observed (p = .72) and pain score 2.0 vs. 2.0 (p = .92) were achieved in both groups. Two patients in each group developed deep vein thrombosis at two weeks follow up (p = 1.0 for above the knee and p = 1.0 for below the knee). CONCLUSION: The clinical and patient reported outcomes following RFA without compression are no worse than with compression. This trial supports the conclusion that the widely practised use of compression after RFA adds no clinical benefit for the patients. However, a much larger study, preferably a multicentre trial, may be required to confirm this conclusion.","output":"Editor's Choice - Role of Compression After Radiofrequency Ablation of Varicose Veins: A Randomised Controlled Triala"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Tenofovir-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) has become first-line in all major HIV treatment guidelines. Compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) has a favorable renal and bone safety profile, but concerns about metabolic complications remain. OBJECTIVE To assess weight changes, the development of overweight/obesity, and changes in lipid levels 18 months after replacing TDF with TAF. DESIGN Cohort study. SETTING 5 university hospitals, affiliated hospitals, and private physicians in Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS 4375 adults living with HIV who received TDF-containing ART for 6 months or longer. MEASUREMENTS Changes in weight and lipid levels were assessed using mixed-effect models. Differences in proportions of newly overweight/obese participants were calculated using 2-proportions Z tests. RESULTS 4375 individuals were included, with follow-up between 1 January 2016 and 31 July 2019. Median age was 50 years (interquartile range, 43 to 56 years), 25.9% were female, and 51.7% had a normal body mass index (BMI); 3484 (79.6%) switched to TAF and 891 (20.4%) continued TDF. After 18 months, switching to TAF was associated with an adjusted mean weight increase of 1.7 kg (95% CI, 1.5 to 2.0 kg), compared with 0.7 kg (CI, 0.4 to 1.0 kg) with the continued use of TDF (between-group difference, 1.1 kg [CI, 0.7 to 1.4 kg]). Among individuals with a normal BMI, 13.8% who switched to TAF became overweight/obese, compared with 8.4% of those continuing TDF (difference, 5.4 percentage points [CI, 2.1 to 8.8 percentage points]). Switching to TAF led to increases in adjusted mean total cholesterol (0.25 mmol/L [9.5 mg/dL]), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.05 mmol/L [1.9 mg/dL]), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.12 mmol/L [4.7 mg/dL]), and triglyceride (0.18 mmol/L [16.1 mg/dL]) levels after 18 months. LIMITATION Short follow-up, small subgroup analyses, and potential residual confounding. CONCLUSION Replacing TDF with TAF is associated with adverse metabolic changes, including weight increase, development of obesity, and worsening serum lipid levels.

Distinctively, successive devolved governments in Wales have emphasised public planning and provision. Wales also has primary legislation addressing sustainability and future generations, safe nurse staffing and rights of access to mental health services. However, in a context in which gaps always exist between national policy, local services and face-to-face care, evidence points to the existence of tension between Welsh policy aspirations and realities. Mental health nurses in Wales have produced a framework for action, which describes practice exemplars and looks forward to a secure future for the profession.

DESIGN: Diagnostic accuracy study. SETTING: Laboratory analyses were performed in the United Kingdom at Imperial College, London and university facilities in London. Research clinics for finger prick sampling were run in two affiliated NHS trusts. PARTICIPANTS: Sensitivity analyses were performed on sera stored from 320 previous participants in the React 2 programme with confirmed previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Specificity analyses were performed on 1000 prepandemic serum samples. 100 new participants with confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection attended study clinics for finger prick testing. INTERVENTIONS: Laboratory sensitivity and specificity analyses were performed for seven LFIAs on a minimum of 200 serum samples from participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 500 prepandemic serum samples, respectively. Three LFIAs were found to have a laboratory sensitivity superior to the finger prick sensitivity of the LFIA currently used in React 2 seroprevalence studies (84%). These LFIAs were then further evaluated through finger prick testing on participants with confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection: two LFIAs (Surescreen, Panbio) were evaluated in clinics in June-July 2020 and the third LFIA (AbC-19) in September 2020. A spike protein enzyme linked immunoassay and hybrid double antigen binding assay were used as laboratory reference standards. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The accuracy of LFIAs in detecting immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 compared with two reference standards. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of seven new LFIAs that were analysed using sera varied from 69% to 100%, and from 98.6% to 100%, respectively (compared with the two reference standards). Sensitivity on finger prick testing was 77% (95% confidence interval 61.4% to 88.2%) for Panbio, 86% (72.7% to 94.8%) for Surescreen, and 69% (53.8% to 81.3%) for AbC-19 compared with the reference standards. Sensitivity for sera from matched clinical samples performed on AbC-19 was significantly higher with serum than finger prick at 92% (80.0% to 97.7%, P=0.01). Antibody titres varied considerably among cohorts. The numbers of positive samples identified by finger prick in the lowest antibody titre quarter varied among LFIAs. CONCLUSIONS: One new LFIA was identified with clinical performance suitable for potential inclusion in seroprevalence studies. However, none of the LFIAs tested had clearly superior performance to the LFIA currently used in React 2 seroprevalence surveys, and none showed sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be considered for routine clinical use.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow assays for possible use in national covid-19 seroprevalence surveys (React 2): diagnostic accuracy study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 epidemic is one of the major health problems worldwide due to its inconceivable spreading power and potential damage.

Many of the recommended prevention measures, such as social distancing and self-isolation, are not feasible for a population living in shelters characterised by physical proximity and a high population density. The objective of the study was to describe SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence in homeless shelters in Brussels (Belgium), and to identify risk factors and infection control practices associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates. METHODS: A total of 1994 adults were tested by quantitative PCR tests in 52 shelters in Brussels (Belgium) between April and June, 2020, in collaboration with Doctors of the World. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence is here described site by site, and we identify risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates. We also investigate associations between seropositivity and reported symptoms. RESULTS: We found an overall prevalence of 4.6% for the period, and a cluster of high rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (20-30% in two shelters). Among homeless people, being under 40 years of age (OR (CI95%) 2.3 (1.2-4.4), p = 0.02), having access to urgent medical care (AMU) (OR(CI95%): 2.4 (1.4-4.4)], p = 0.02), and sharing a room with someone who tested positive (OR(CI95%): 5.3 (2.9-9.9), p<0.0001) were factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates. 93% of those who tested positive were asymptomatic.

The aim of this study was to perform a review to describe neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19 and possible neuro-invasive mechanisms of Sars-CoV-2. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science and COVID-dedicated databases were searched for the combination of COVID-19 terminology and neurology terminology up to 10 May 2020. Social media channels were followed up between 15 March and 10 May 2020 for postings with the same scope. Neurological manifestations were extracted from the identified papers and combined to provide a useful summary for the neurologist in clinical practice. RESULTS: Neurological manifestations potentially related to COVID-19 have been reported in large studies, case series and case reports and include acute cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness, cranial nerve manifestations and autoimmune disorders such as the Guillain-Barr syndrome often present in patients with more severe COVID-19. Cranial nerve symptoms such as olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are highly prevalent in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 even without associated nasal symptoms and often present in an early stage of the disease. CONCLUSION: Physicians should be aware of the neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19, especially when rapid clinical deterioration occurs.

METHODS This was a prospective cohort study. Patients with a sufficient TCD window undergoing CEA from February 2009 to June 2011 were included. All patients were continuously monitored with NIRS and EEG. An intraluminal shunt was placed, selectively determined by predefined EEG changes in alpha, beta, theta, or delta activity. Relative changes in regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) in the frontal lobe and mean blood flow velocity (Vmean) 30 seconds before carotid cross-clamping versus 2 minutes after carotid cross-clamping were related to shunt placement. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the optimal thresholds. Diagnostic values were reported as positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV). RESULTS Of a cohort of 151 patients, 17(11%) showed EEG changes requiring shunt placement. The rSO2 and Vmean decreased more in the shunt group than in the non-shunt group (mean  standard error of the mean) 21  4% versus 7  5% and 76  6% versus 12  3%, respectively (p < .005), Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a threshold of 16% decrease in rSO2 (PPV 76% and NPV 99%) and 48% decrease in Vmean (PPV 53% and NPV 99%) as the optimal cut-off value to detect cerebral ischemia during CEA under general anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS Compared with EEG, we found moderate PPV but high NPV for NIRS and TCD to detect cerebral ischemia during CEA under general anesthesia, meaning that both techniques independently may be suitable to exclude patients for unnecessary shunt use and to direct the use of selective shunting.

All features present during viral pneumonia were found, such as B-lines, white lung syndrome, pleural thickening, and the formation of pleural consolidations. Sonographic findings correlate well with current LUS scores for COVID19. The scores of 1, 2, and 3 were dominantly present at 1-4-, 4-8-, and 8-12-ml/kg saline instillation, respectively. The noninfective animal model can be used for further investigation of the LUS features and can serve in education, by helping with the appropriate handling of LUS in clinical practice during management of viral pneumonia.","output":"In Vivo Assessment of Lung Ultrasound Features Mimicking Viral Pneumonia Using a Large Animal Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a unique opportunity to examine the relationships between hospitalists, neurosurgeons, and patients.

A total of 33 severe confirmed cases (20 male patients and 13 female patients) were enrolled in the present study between January 31, 2020 and March 10, 2020. Chest imaging findings and clinical data were collected and analyzed. The median age was 65 years (age range, 25?90 years). As of April 7, 2020, 24 patients were discharged, and 9 patients died. With regards to the clinical manifestations, 28 patients had fever, 17 patients had a cough and 15 patients had shortness of breath. Of these, 29 patients had underlying health conditions. Ground glass opacities, consolidation and interlobular septal thickening were the most common and typical chest computerized tomography (CT) scan abnormalities. A total of 6/33 (18.2%) patients had 1 affected lobe, 6/33 (18.2%) patients had 2 affected lobes, 5/33 (15.2%) patients had 3 affected lobes, 9/33 (27.3%) patients had 4 affected lobes and 7/33 (21.2%) patients had 5 affected lobes in the initial chest CT scan.

We aimed to assess the association of NIV versus MV with mortality and morbidity during respiratory intervention among hypoxemic patients admitted with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective multi-center cohort study across 5 hospitals during March-April 2020. Outcomes included mortality, severe COVID-19-related symptoms, time to discharge, and final oxygen saturation (SpO2) at the conclusion of the respiratory intervention. Multivariable regression of outcomes was conducted in all hypoxemic participants, 4 subgroups, and propensity-matched analysis. RESULTS: Of 2381 participants with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, 688 were included in the study who were hypoxemic upon initiation of respiratory intervention. During the study period, 299 participants died (43%), 163 were admitted to the ICU (24%), and 121 experienced severe COVID-19-related symptoms (18%). Participants on MV had increased mortality than those on NIV (128/154 [83%] versus 171/534 [32%], OR = 30, 95% CI 16-60) with a mean survival of 6 versus 15 days, respectively. The MV group experienced more severe COVID-19-related symptoms [55/154 (36%) versus 66/534 (12%), OR = 4.3, 95% CI 2.7-6.8], longer time to discharge (mean 17 versus 7.1 days), and lower final SpO2 (92 versus 94%). Across all subgroups and propensity-matched analysis, MV was associated with a greater OR of death than NIV. CONCLUSIONS: NIV was associated with lower respiratory intervention mortality and morbidity than MV. However, findings may be liable to unmeasured confounding and further study from randomized controlled trials is needed to definitively determine the role of NIV in hypoxemic patients with COVID-19.","output":"Non-invasive ventilation versus mechanical ventilation in hypoxemic patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally In Indonesia, when the pandemic destroys the health system and global economy, social capital arrives as an alternative to sustain community resilience This research aims to 1) describe a social capital within the community and how it is being campaigned and strengthened within the community by the actors in the community itself amidts their effort to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic;and 2) to describe communitys response towards the social capital campaign The study was conducted using qualitative methods Observation was conducted towards various activism by Persit KCK XXXIX Pati;a womens organizations, in particular their activities in social campaign against COVID-19 pandemic The results of this research suggest that social capital can be an alternative for community survival when economis capital destroyed Solidarity and mutual assistance among community members without considering the financial benefits is crucial in a crisis situation of the COVID-19 pandemic Persit Kartika Chandra Kirana Branch XXXIX Pati through its various voluntary and non-profit activities has shown itself as one of the driving forces for the growth and revitalization of social capital within the community, especially through the networks that they structurally or non-structurally owned","output":"Peran Organisasi Perempuan Dalam Penguatan Social Capital Melawan Pandemi COVID-19 (Studi Pada Gerakan Kampanye Sosial Persit Kartika Chandra Kirana Xxxix Kabupaten Pati Jawa Tengah)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent disorder with a growing incidence worldwide that closely mirrors the global obesity epidemic.

Although the ZnO wurtzite structure is conformed for all samples, some secondary lines with little intensity are formed. But the number of these lines is higher for series I than for series II. The (c/a) value and U-parameter are almost constant for all samples, while ZnCO bond length L is slightly increased. The porosity and crystallite size are decreased by Fe, and also for (Fe + Cu) samples, and their values for series I are lower than for series II. The residual stress is tensile for most samples. Interestingly, the Youngs, rigid and bulk modulus, Poissons ratio and Debye temperature, obtained from FTIR analysis, are increased by Fe addition with a further increase for Fe + Ni) samples for both series. A ductile nature is obtained for pure, Fe and (Fe + Cu) samples; whereas a brittle nature is approved for (Fe + Ni) samples. On the other hand, the energy gap (E(g)), residual lattice dielectric constant ((L)) and carrier density N are increased by Fe addition, followed by a further increase for (Fe + Cu) samples, while the vice is versa for the inter-atomic distance R. For example, E(g) was increased from 3.153 eV for pure ZnO to 3.974 eV for (Fe + Cu) samples (i.e., 0.821 eV more), while it was decreased to 2.851 eV for (Fe + Ni) samples (i.e., 0.302 eV less). A direct behavior is obtained between E(g) and both elastic modulus (Y, ), lattice and micro strains ((L), (m)), dislocation density (), residual stress () and carrier density N, whereas a reverse behavior is obtained between E(g) and both crystallite size (D), porosity (PS) and inter-atomic distance (R). These results are explained in terms of the generated blocked states of the conduction band as indicated by the Burstein Moss effect. These novel findings reveal that the co-doping has intense ZnO and moderate metal oxide modes in the ZnO matrix structure, which makes ZnO co-doped with (Fe + Cu) more suitable for gas sensors and optoelectronic devices. In contrast, ZnO co-doped with (Fe + Ni) samples is strongly recommended for altering plastic deformation.

Episodes considered include the 1998 Saudi Arabia - Venezuela war, the 2014-2016 conflict and the 2020 Saudi Arabia - Russia war in a time of unprecedented crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The persistence of volatility in oil prices during times of specific oil-price wars is captured through generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model while the leverage effect is tested using the threshold generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (T-GARCH) model. Moreover, a vector autoregressive (VAR) model is employed to consider the relationship between oil price shocks and stock returns of oil and gas corporations. Our findings reveal a significant evidence for volatility persistence and leverage effects in oil price during the three oil-price wars. These findings are consistent for WTI as well as Brent crude oil specifications. Though the persistence of volatility is similar to that of the previous two oil-price wars, the 2020 Saudi Arabia - Russia oil-price war has higher volatility spikes than the previous two wars. Besides, oil price shocks have a significant and positive effect on the returns of oil and gas companies. These findings provide investors information on how volatility in global oil prices is also sensitive to irregular events such as price wars between oil producers.

To reduce energy demand, China has implemented an energy cap policy and pledged to limit total energy consumption to around 5000 million tons of standard coal equivalent by 2020 in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020). The prospect of achieving this target relies on the understanding of China's energy growth pattern. To this end, we investigate the transformation of the growth pattern in China's energy consumption from 2005 to 2015. We combine environmental input-output approach and structural decomposition analysis to study the factors that influence the changes in China's energy consumption. Results show that energy consumption growth shifted from export-driven before the Financial Crisis (2005-2007) to investment-driven during the Financial Crisis (2007-2010) and to consumption-driven both in the Economic Recovery (2010-2012) and in the New Normal (2012-2015). Consumption volume was the major promoting factor of the growth in energy consumption, but it became less important over time. In contrast, energy intensity was the primary factor offsetting energy consumption growth, with varying contribution over the period 2005-2015.

Small retrospective/prospective series have suggested robotics offers further reduction in postoperative pain and pain medication use compared to standard LSC. Our objective was to compare postoperative pain in patients undergoing robotically assisted (RBT) versus standard LSC for newly diagnosed endometrial cancer. METHODS All preoperative endometrial cancer cases scheduled for RBT and LSC from May 1, 2007 to June 9, 2010 were identified. For this analysis, we only included cases not requiring conversion to laparotomy. All patients were offered intravenous (IV) patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) postoperatively. Intraoperative equivalent fentanyl doses (IEFDs) and pain scores in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) were assessed. RESULTS IV PCA was used in 206 RBTs (86 %) and 208 LSCs (88 %). Median IEFD was 425 g for LSCs and 500 g for RBTs (P = 0.03). Median pain scores on PACU arrival were similar in both groups. Median highest pain score was 5 for LSCs and 4 for RBTs (P = 0.007). Linear regression demonstrated that the IEFD was not correlated with the highest pain score (R = 0.09; P = 0.07). Fentanyl was used postoperatively in 196 of 206 RBTs (95 %) and 187 of 208 LSCs (90 %). The total fentanyl doses were 242.5 (range 0-2705) g and 380 (range 0-2625) g, respectively (P < 0.001). The median hourly fentanyl doses were 16.7 (range 0-122.5) g and 23.5 (range 0-132.4) g, respectively (P = 0.005). Simultaneous multiple regression analysis further demonstrated RBT was independently associated with a lower total fentanyl dose compared to LSC (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS RBT is independently associated with significantly lower postoperative pain and pain medication requirements compared to LSC. The amount of intraoperative fentanyl analgesia does not appear to correlate with postoperative pain.Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States, with an estimated 47,130 new cases in 2012.1 An estimated 287,100 women were diagnosed with endometrial cancer worldwide in 2008.2 Surgery is the primary treatment of choice for the majority of these women.3 The standard surgical approach has been total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and staging via laparotomy. Multiple retrospective series have shown that a less invasive surgical approach via laparoscopy (LSC) is feasible and safe, and also associated with improved perioperative outcomes compared to laparotomy in these patients.4 The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) published results of the largest randomized trial (LAP2) comparing LSC to laparotomy in patients with newly diagnosed endometrial carcinoma in 2009.5,6 This landmark study essentially changed the accepted standard surgical approach in this group. Postoperative complications, median blood loss, and median length of stay (LOS), despite increased operative time, were significantly lower in LSC patients despite 25 % requiring conversion to laparotomy.5 The first 802 eligible patients randomized in LAP2 also participated in a quality-of-life (QOL) study. Within 6 weeks of surgery, patients assigned to LSC reported significantly better QOL on all scales other than fear of recurrence.6 Overall, during this 6-week postoperative period, patients assigned to LSC had superior QOL, fewer physical symptoms, less pain and pain-related interference with functioning, better physical functioning and emotional state, earlier resumption of normal activities, earlier return to work, and better body image compared to those assigned to laparotomy.6 Recurrence-free and overall survivals were the same in both groups.7 Multiple published retrospective series have shown possible benefits, such as reduced postoperative pain, using the robotic (RBT) platform compared to LSC or laparotomy in patients with endometrial cancer.8-11 In a randomized trial, LSC was found to be associated with less postoperative pain compared to vaginal approaches in patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign gynecologic disease.12 A small retrospective series reported further reductions in postoperative pain in patients who had undergone an RBT hysterectomy compared to a standard total LSC hysterectomy for benign indications.13 A recent cost analysis suggested that patients experienced less pain and required less pain medication use after RBT procedures compared to LSC for endometrial cancer.14 Based on these reports, we sought to analyze postoperative pain and the use of pain medication in patients undergoing RBT compared to standard transperitoneal LSC procedures for newly diagnosed endometrial cancer during a concurrent time period. Of note, current RBT surgery is not truly robotic in that it is not autonomous. A more appropriate term is computer-assisted surgery, but to satisfy current convention, we refer to it as robotic surgery in this manuscript.","output":"Postoperative pain medication requirements in patients undergoing computer-assisted (Robotic) and standard laparoscopic procedures for newly diagnosed endometrial cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Misinformation often has an ongoing effect on peoples memory and inferential reasoning even after clear corrections are provided; this is known as the continued influence effect. In pursuit of more effective corrections, one factor that has not yet been investigated systematically is the narrative versus non-narrative format of the correction. Some scholars have suggested that a narrative format facilitates comprehension and retention of complex information and may serve to overcome resistance to worldview-dissonant corrections. It is, therefore, a possibility that misinformation corrections are more effective if they are presented in a narrative format versus a non-narrative format. The present study tests this possibility. We designed corrections that are either narrative or non-narrative, while minimizing differences in informativeness. We compared narrative and non-narrative corrections in three preregistered experiments (total N = 2279). Experiment 1 targeted misinformation contained in fictional event reports; Experiment 2 used false claims commonly encountered in the real world; Experiment 3 used real-world false claims that are controversial, in order to test the notion that a narrative format may facilitate corrective updating primarily when it serves to reduce resistance to correction. In all experiments, we also manipulated test delay (immediate vs. 2 days), as any potential benefit of the narrative format may only arise in the short term (if the story format aids primarily with initial comprehension and updating of the relevant mental model) or after a delay (if the story format aids primarily with later correction retrieval). In all three experiments, it was found that narrative corrections are no more effective than non-narrative corrections. Therefore, while stories and anecdotes can be powerful, there is no fundamental benefit of using a narrative format when debunking misinformation.","output":"You dont have to tell a story!

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is an important second messenger acting via two intracellular signaling molecules: protein kinase A (PKA) and the guanidine nucleotide exchange factor, Epac. We sought to investigate effects of increased cAMP level on the disruption of model airway epithelial barrier caused by RSV infection and the molecular mechanisms underlying cAMP actions. Human bronchial epithelial cells were infected with RSV-A2 and treated with either cAMP releasing agent, forskolin, or cAMP analogs. Structure and functions of the Apical Junctional Complex (AJC) were evaluated by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance and permeability to FITC-dextran, and determining localization of AJC proteins by confocal microscopy. Increased intracellular cAMP level significantly attenuated RSV-induced disassembly of AJC. These barrier-protective effects of cAMP were due to the activation of PKA signaling and did not involve Epac activity. Increased cAMP level reduced RSV-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, including apical accumulation of an essential actin-binding protein, cortactin, and inhibited expression of the RSV F protein. These barrier-protective and antiviral-function of cAMP signaling were evident even when cAMP level was increased after the onset of RSV infection. Taken together, our study demonstrates that cAMP/PKA signaling attenuated RSV-induced disruption of structure and functions of the model airway epithelial barrier by mechanisms involving the stabilization of epithelial junctions and inhibition of viral biogenesis. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms involved in RSV-induced epithelial dysfunction and viral pathogenesis will help to develop novel anti-viral therapeutic approaches.","output":"cAMP-dependent activation of protein kinase A attenuates respiratory syncytial virus-induced human airway epithelial barrier disruption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is estimated to impact millions of people each year.

Here we report for the first time that NC is a potential therapeutic agent for mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) occurring in the head and neck because it suppresses X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) in human MEC in vitro and in vivo. The antitumor effects of NC were evaluated by trypan blue exclusion assay, western blotting, live/dead assay, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, human apoptosis antibody array, immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemistry, small interfering RNA assay, transient transfection of XIAP overexpression vector, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and histopathological examination of organs. NC inhibited cell viability and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in vitro. A human apoptosis antibody array assay showed that XIAP is suppressed by NC treatment. XIAP was overexpressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tissues that arose from the head and neck, and high XIAP expression was correlated with poor prognosis in OSCC patients. XIAP depletion significantly increased apoptosis, and ectopic XIAP overexpression attenuated the apoptosis induced by NC treatment. NC suppressed tumor growth in vivo at a dosage of 5 mg/kg/day. The number of TUNEL-positive cells increased and the protein expression of XIAP was consistently downregulated in NC-treated tumor tissues. In addition, NC caused no histopathological changes in the liver or kidney. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of action underlying the anticancer effects of NC and demonstrate that NC is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of human MEC of the head and neck. KEY MESSAGES: ? Nitidine chloride induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in MEC of the head and neck. ? High XIAP expression correlates with poor prognosis of OSCC patients. ? Nitidine chloride suppresses tumor growth in vivo without any systemic toxicities. ? Targeting XIAP is a novel chemotherapeutic strategy for MEC of the head and neck.","output":"Targeting X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein in mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the head and neck: A novel therapeutic strategy using nitidine chloride."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the nutritional habits of premenopausal women using the Food Consumption Frequency Questionnaire (FCFQ) and to evaluate the relationship between anthropometric measurements, lipid parameters, and the presence of anemia with the findings obtained. Methods: This study was carried out in the internal medicine outpatient clinics of the Health Sciences University Bursa Yksek Ihtisas Training Research Hospital (located in Yildirim districts) and Grsu State Hospital (located in Grsu districts) of Bursa province between 1 June-31 August 2019. We used clustered sampling in patient selection. One hundred seventy-one premenopausal participants aged between 18 and 55 who were known to be healthy and who came for routine control to the internal medicine outpatient clinics were included in the study. The FCFQ was used to determine how often the participants consumed different food groups in the last 1 month.

Identifying the risk-factors associated with infection and outcomes in cancer patients is necessary to develop healthcare recommendations. Methods: We analyzed electronic health records of the US National Veterans Administration healthcare system and assessed the prevalence of Covid-19 infection in cancer patients. We evaluated the proportion of cancer patients tested for Covid-19 and their confirmed positivity, with clinical characteristics, and outcome, and stratified by demographics, comorbidities, cancer treatment and cancer type. Results: Of 22914 cancer patients tested for Covid-19, 1794 (7.8%) were positive. The prevalence of Covid-19 was similar across all ages. Higher prevalence was observed in African-American (AA) (15%) compared to white (5.5%; P<.001), in Hispanic vs non-Hispanic population and in patients with hematologic malignancy compared to those with solid tumors (10.9% vs 7.7%; P<.001). Conversely, prevalence was lower in current smoker patients, patients with other co-morbidities and having recently received cancer therapy (<6 months). The Covid-19 attributable mortality was 10.9%. Highest mortality rates were observed in older patients, those with renal dysfunction, higher Charlson co-morbidity score and with certain cancer types. Recent (<6 months) or past treatment did not influence mortality. Importantly, AA patients had 3.5-fold higher Covid-19 attributable hospitalization, however had similar mortality rate as white patients.

Even though visual stimulation on the retina is fundamentally 2D, we seem to perceive the world around us in vivid 3D effortlessly. This reconstructed 3D space is allocentric and faithfully represents the external 3D world. How can we recreate stable 3D visual space so promptly and reliably? To solve this mystery, we have developed new concepts MePMoS (Memory-Prediction-Motion-Sensing) and NHT (Neural Holography Tomography). These models state that visual signal processing must be primarily top-down, starting from memory and prediction. Our brains predict and construct the expected 3D space holographically using traveling alpha brainwaves. Thus, 3D space is represented by the three time signals in three directions. To test this hypothesis, we designed reaction time (RT) experiments to observe predicted space-to-time conversion, especially as a function of distance. We placed LED strips on a horizontal plane to cover distances from close up to 2.5 m or 5 m, either using a 1D or a 2D lattice. Participants were instructed to promptly report observed LED patterns at various distances. As expected, stimulation at the fixation cue location always gave the fastest RT. Additional RT delays were proportional to the distance from the cue. Furthermore, both covert attention (without eye movements) and overt attention (with eye movements) created the same RT delays, and both binocular and monocular views resulted in the same RTs. These findings strongly support our predictions, in which the observed RT-depth dependence is indicative of the spatiotemporal conversion required for constructing allocentric 3D space. After all, we perceive and measure 3D space by time as Einstein postulated a century ago.","output":"Visual Perception of 3D Space and Shape in Time - Part II: 3D Space Perception with Holographic Depth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Data on the association of inappropriate gestational weight gain (GWG) and adverse outcomes in twin pregnancies are limited and inconsistent. OBJECTIVES To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the association between GWG and adverse outcomes in twin pregnancies.

SELECTION CRITERIA Interventional and observational studies evaluating the association between GWG and adverse outcomes in twin pregnancies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers. Summary odds ratios (OR) were calculated using a random-effects model in a subset of studies that analyzed GWG as a categorical variable in relation to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations. The primary outcome was preterm birth. MAIN RESULTS From 277 citations, 19 studies involving 36,023 women with twin pregnancies were included in qualitative analysis, of which 14 were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, 56.8% of women experienced inappropriate GWG: 35.4% (95%-CI 30.0-41.0%) gained weight below and 21.4% (95%-CI 14.2-29.5%) gained weight above IOM recommendations. Compared with GWG within IOM guidelines, GWG below IOM guidelines was associated with preterm birth before 32 weeks (OR 3.38 [95%-CI 2.05-5.58]), and a reduction in the risk of preeclampsia (OR 0.68 [95%-CI 0.48-0.97]). GWG above IOM guidelines was associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia that was consistent across all BMI categories.

METHOD: In Study 1, we investigated UP in the general population (N = 1,184) at the start of the pandemic asking about overall vulnerability to infection with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 and UP regarding infection and outcome of severe illness. Further, OCS status (OCS+/?) was assessed at the start of the pandemic and 3 months later. In Study 2, we investigated UP in individuals with OCD (N = 268) regarding the likelihood of getting infected, recovering, or dying from an infection with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 at the start of the pandemic and re\\\\assessed OCS 3 months later. RESULTS: In Study 1, UP was higher in the OCS+ compared to the OCS? group, and estimates of a higher overall vulnerability for an infection predicted a decrease in OCS over time.

However, critical parameters, such as the most effective administration routes, remain unclear. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of topical and systemic transplantation MSCs on diabetic ischemic wound healing and explored the underlying mechanisms. METHOD: A diabetic ischemic wound model was created on the dorsal foot of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rat. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) were administered via two routes: topical injection and intravenous (IV) infusion. Wound healing outcomes and blood glucose level were assessed dynamically. Meanwhile, blood flow recovery was evaluated in ischemic gastrocnemius muscles. The homing and transdifferentiation of mKate2-labeled BM-MSCs were assessed by fluorescence imaging and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. RESULT: Both topical and systemic treatments had a positive effect on the diabetic ischemic wound showing a significant reduction in wound area at day 14. Histological results showed an increase in the length of epithelial edges, collagen content, microvessel density in the wound bed, and a higher expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

However, these models have not been tested in predicting clinical outcome of ketamine treatment. We assessed the relationship between patients' classification with different TRD staging models and subsequent nonresponse to acute intravenous ketamine treatment. METHODS A sample of 120 patients with TRD who received acute ketamine treatment from October 2018 to November 2020 were included. Intravenous ketamine was administered twice weekly for 3 weeks as acute treatment. Generalized linear models were fitted to examine if staging classification at baseline could predict percent change in the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR16) scale. Potential confounders such as age, sex, and primary diagnosis were included in the models. Other generalized linear models were also fitted with the Bonferroni correction to investigate if other clinical variables of potential relevance could predict percent change in the QIDS-SR16. RESULTS No TRD staging model proved accurate in predicting depressive improvement after acute ketamine treatment. Clinical variables such as age (F = 6.68, P = 0.01) and history of neuromodulation therapy (F = 5.12, P = 0.03) were negatively associated with subsequent percent improvement in the QIDS-SR16 with acute ketamine treatment.

METHODS: This was an exploratory retrospective analysis of observational data from the Hospital Episode Statistics dataset for England. All patients aged 18 years in England with a diagnosis of COVID-19 who had a hospital stay that was completed between 1st March 2020 and 31st March 2021 were included. A recorded diagnosis of VTE during the index stay or during a subsequent admission in the six weeks following discharge was the primary outcome in the main analysis. In secondary analysis, VTE diagnosis was the primary exposure and in-hospital mortality the primary outcome. RESULTS: Over the 13 months, 374,244 unique patients had a diagnosis of COVID-19 during a hospital stay, of whom 17,346 (4.6%) had a recorded diagnosis of VTE. VTE was more commonly recorded in patients aged 40C79 years, males and in patients of Black ethnicity, even after adjusting for covariates. Recorded VTE diagnosis was associated with longer hospital stay and higher adjusted in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.35 (95% confidence interval 1.29 to 1.41)).

METHODS We enrolled 4485 patients discharged from six sub-specialty medical services. We implemented late-afternoon CAPP rounds to identify patients who could have morning discharge the subsequent day. After an initial successful implementation of the intervention, we identified lack of sustainability. We made changes with sustained implementation of the intervention. This is a before-after study of a quality improvement intervention. PROGRAM EVALUATION Primary measures of intervention effectiveness were percentage of patients who received EDO by 11am and patients discharged by noon. Additional measure of effectiveness were percent of patients admitted to the correct ward, emergency department (ED)-to-ward transfer time compared between intervention and non-intervention periods. We compared the overall expected LOS and the average weekly discharges to assess for comparability across the control and intervention time periods. We used the readmission rate as balancing measure to ensure that the intervention was not have unintended negative patients consequences. RESULTS Expected length of stay based upon discharge diagnosis/comorbidities and readmission rates were similar across the intervention and control time periods. The average weekly discharges were not statistically significant. Percentage of EDO by 11 am was higher in the first intervention period, second intervention period and combined intervention periods (28.9% vs. 21.8%, P<0.001) compared with the respective control periods. Percent discharged before noon increased in the first intervention period, second intervention period and for the combined intervention periods (17 vs. 11.8%, P <0.001).

The advent of MRI-guided postmortem neuropathological examinations confirmed that, in the context of cerebrovascular disease, the vast majority of CMBs correspond to recent or old microhaemorrhages. Detection of CMBs is highly influenced by MRI parameters, in particular field strength, postprocessing methods used to enhance T2* contrast and three dimensional sequences. Despite recent progress, harmonising imaging parameters across research studies remains necessary to improve cross-study comparisons.

To clarify this we sought the key gene expression pathways altered in COVID-19 also affected in bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and schizophrenia, since this may identify pathways of interaction that could be treatment targets. We performed large scale comparisons of whole transcriptome data and immune factor transcript data in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from COVID-19 patients and patients with psychiatric disorders. We also analysed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for symptomatic COVID-19 patients, comparing GWAS and whole-genome sequence data from patients with bipolar disorder, PTSD and schizophrenia patients. These studies revealed altered signalling and ontology pathways shared by COVID-19 patients and the three psychiatric disorders. Finally, co-expression and network analyses identified gene clusters common to the conditions. COVID-19 patients had peripheral blood immune system profiles that overlapped with those of patients with psychiatric conditions. From the pathways identified, PTSD profiles were the most highly correlated with COVID-19, perhaps consistent with stress-immune system interactions seen in PTSD.

To understand the response of macrophages, they are often cultured in vitro on biomaterials. Since a wide range of biomaterials is currently used in the clinics, we undertook a systematic review of the macrophage polarization in response to these different surgical biomaterials in vitro. Beside the chemistry, material characteristics such as dimension, pore size, and surface topography are of great influence on the response of macrophages. The macrophage response also appears to depend on the differences in sterilization techniques that induce lasting biochemical changes or residues of chemicals and their byproducts used for sterilization. Regarding tissue-based biomaterials, macrophages on human or porcine dermis, strongly cross-linked by chemicals elicit in general a proinflammatory response with higher amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. Synthetic biomaterials such as polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) + polyacrylamide (PAAm), PET + sodium salt of poly(acrylic acid) (PAANa), perfluoropolyether (PFPE) with large posts, PEG-g-PA, and polydioxanone (PDO) always appear to elicit an anti-inflammatory response in macrophages, irrespective of origin of the macrophages, for example, buffy coats or full blood. In conclusion, in general in vitro models contribute to evaluate the foreign body reaction on surgical biomaterials. Although it is difficult to simulate complexity of host response elicited by biomaterials, after their surgical implantation, an in vitro model gives indications of the initial foreign body response and allows the comparison of this response between biomaterials.","output":"The Effect of Biomaterials Used for Tissue Regeneration Purposes on Polarization of Macrophages."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), lockdown periods have changed the way that people and communities live, work and interact.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that thermoregulatory function is impaired in MS patients compared with healthy controls (CON) exercising at similar rates of metabolic heat production. METHODS Sweating and skin blood flow responses were compared between 12 individuals diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (9 females, 3 males) and 12 sex-, age-, mass-, and BSA-matched CON during a single bout of cycling exercise (rate of metabolic heat production: 4.5 Wkg) for 60 min in a climate-controlled room (25C, 30% RH). RESULTS Individuals with MS exhibited an attenuated increase in cumulative whole-body sweat loss after 30 min (MS, 72  51 g; CON, 104  37 g; P = 0.04) and 60 min (MS, 209  94 g; CON, 285  62 g; P = 0.02), as well as lower sweating thermosensitivity (MS, 0.49  0.26 mgcmminC; CON, 0.86  0.30 mgcmminC; P = 0.049).

Create a single point of access to physiotherapy, with referral to onward services across East Lothian as appropriate. 2. Successfully address people's needs through early intervention and promote self-management. 3. Entrench a patient-focused approach with streamlined processes and pathways. 4. Reduce waiting times for MSK Physiotherapy and GP Practices, saving cost and improving patient experience. Methods: ? The MSK Advice Line opened in June 2020 and was based on a RFA service model. ? The service was provided by Advanced Physiotherapy Practitioners (APPs) who used advanced critical thinking and expert clinical and diagnostic reasoning skills to facilitate a patient-centred management plan. ? Access to the service was made by self-referral. Patients contacted a central number and were offered a telephone assessment. ? Following assessment and diagnosis, management options were discussed and decided upon in partnership with the patient. ? Due to Covid-19 remote platforms were utilised, with the option of escalation for face to face assessment or onward referral, in line with Government guidelines, as appropriate. ? Regular service development huddles were established to ensure consistent service provision across the team and create learning opportunities. ? Meetings were arranged with GP Practices in East Lothian to improve communication and build effective working relationships. Results: Over 6000 patients contacted the RFA phoneline ? Patient Outcomes: 1. 58% of patients were converted to ongoing physiotherapy treatment, either remotely or face to face. 2. 40% of patient were happy to self-manage and required no further input. 3. 2% of patients were referred onward to other services or did not answer their phone. ? A Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire was undertaken: 1. 58% reported the service as excellent. 2. 13% rated it as great. 3. 29% rated it as good. 4. 77% of respondents were happy with remote service. ? GP Outcomes 1. High levels of satisfaction among GP Practices was noted. 2. 31% reduction in requests for MRIs from GP Practices in East Lothian since launch. Conclusion(s): Implementation of the MSK Advice Line has demonstrated that the RFA model can be successful in creating a single point of access to physiotherapy services, ensuring patients are successfully directed to the most appropriate service to suit their needs.

Based on our discovery that the glycosaminoglycan dermatan sulfate (DS) displays peculiar affinity to apoptotic cells and autoantigens (autoAgs) and that DS-autoAg complexes cooperatively stimulate autoreactive B1 cell responses, we compiled a database of 751 candidate autoAgs from six human cell types. At least 657 of these have been found to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection based on currently available multi-omic COVID data, and at least 400 are confirmed targets of autoantibodies in a wide array of autoimmune diseases and cancer. The autoantigen-ome is significantly associated with various processes in viral infections, such as translation, protein processing, and vesicle transport. Interestingly, the coding genes of autoAgs predominantly contain multiple exons with many possible alternative splicing variants, short transcripts, and short UTR lengths. These observations and the finding that numerous autoAgs involved in RNA-splicing showed altered expression in viral infections suggest that viruses exploit alternative splicing to reprogram host cell machinery to ensure viral replication and survival. While each cell type gives rise to a unique pool of autoAgs, 39 common autoAgs associated with cell stress and apoptosis were identified from all six cell types, with several being known markers of systemic autoimmune diseases. In particular, the common autoAg UBA1 that catalyzes the first step in ubiquitination is encoded by an X-chromosome escape gene. Given its essential function in apoptotic cell clearance and that X-inactivation escape tends to increase with aging, UBA1 dysfunction can therefore predispose aging women to autoimmune disorders. In summary, we propose a model of how viral infections lead to extensive molecular alterations and host cell death, autoimmune responses facilitated by autoAg-DS complexes, and ultimately autoimmune diseases. Overall, this master autoantigen-ome provides a molecular guide for investigating the myriad of autoimmune sequalae to COVID-19 and clues to the rare but reported adverse effects of the currently available COVID vaccines.","output":"A master autoantigen-ome links alternative splicing, female predilection, and COVID-19 to autoimmune diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Discharge planning is important to prevent surgical site infections, reduce costs, and improve the hospitalization experience.

The adverse mental health effects caused by COVID-19 may be particularly acute for individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). For the present study, we developed an online survey to investigate how COVID-19 has affected the OCD community. The survey included both quantitative and qualitative questions to assess multiple facets of how the pandemic has affected individuals with OCD symptoms. Responses were collected from adults with self-identified OCD recruited from OCD-specific forums and websites (n = 252). The majority (76.2 %) of respondents reported that their OCD symptoms had worsened since the outbreak, though there was substantial variability in individual responses. Negative effects of COVID-19 were more strongly linked to contamination and responsibility for harm symptoms than for other symptom dimensions. The self-identified OCD group also reported heightened concerns about COVID-19 compared to a community control sample recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Lastly, many participants reported that the pandemic had interfered with their OCD treatment, yet they remained mostly satisfied with how their treatment providers had handled the crisis. These results highlight the importance of considering how COVID-19 has affected the OCD community, with possible implications for treatment providers.","output":"How is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder caused by selective death of the orexin neurons that often begins in childhood. Orexin neuron loss disinhibits REM sleep during the active period and produces cataplexy, episodes of paralysis during wakefulness. Cataplexy is often worse when narcolepsy develops in children compared to adults, but the reason for this difference remains unknown. We used orexin-tTA; TetO DTA mice to model narcolepsy at different ages. When doxycycline is removed from the diet, the orexin neurons of these mice express diphtheria toxin A and die within 2C3 weeks. We removed doxycycline at 4 weeks (young-onset) or 14 weeks (adult-onset) of age in male and female mice. We implanted electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) electrodes for sleep recordings two weeks later and then recorded EEG/EMG/video for 24 h at 3 and 13 weeks after removal of doxycycline. Age-matched controls had access to doxycycline diet for the entire experiment. Three weeks after doxycycline removal, both young-onset and adult-onset mice developed severe cataplexy and the sleep-wake fragmentation characteristic of narcolepsy. Cataplexy and maintenance of wake were no worse in young-onset compared to adult-onset mice, but female mice had more bouts of cataplexy than males. Orexin neuron loss was similarly rapid in both young- and adult-onset mice. As age of orexin neuron loss does not impact the severity of narcolepsy symptoms in mice, the worse symptoms in children with narcolepsy may be due to more rapid orexin neuron loss than in adults.","output":"The Impacts of Age and Sex in a Mouse Model of Childhood Narcolepsy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extensive experiments performed mostly in a variety of animal models convincingly demonstrated the protective effect of polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies administered by the mucosal route.

This study aimed to investigate perceived stress levels due to the COVID-19 outbreak and explore associated factors among students under lockdown. METHODS: Sociodemographic data, living and learning conditions and existing scales of perceived stress (PSS) and social support (MSPSS) were administered to French students via an online survey. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between severe perceived stress and different factors. RESULTS: Among 3764 university students, the average PSS score was 19.2 (SD=8.3), and 22% experienced high perceived stress. The presence of someone hospitalized for COVID-19 in one's household (OR=6, 95% CI: 2.4-14.6) and female gender (OR=2.3, 95% CI: 1.9-2.9) were the main risk factors for severe perceived stress. The following risk factors were also identified: enrollment in the arts, humanities and language program; postponement of a final examination; reduced learning time; conflicts at home and with neighbors; difficulties isolating; noise inside or outside one's home; a lack of direct outdoor access; increased alcohol and tobacco consumption; and the perceived ineffectiveness of the use of media entertainment to calm down. Friend support (OR=0.87, 95% CI: 0.82-0.93) and family support (OR=0.79, 95% CI: 0.74-0.84) and the perceived effectiveness of physical exercise (OR=0.5, 95% CI: 0.4-0.6) for calming down were protective factors.

AIM: To quantify oesophagogastric, colorectal, liver, pancreatic, ovarian, uterine, kidney, and bladder cancer risks associated with newly reported abdominal pain with or without other symptoms, signs, or abnormal blood tests (that is, features) indicative of possible cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was an observational prospective cohort study using Clinical Practice Research Datalink records with English cancer registry linkage. METHOD: The authors studied 125 793 patients aged 40 years with newly reported abdominal pain in primary care between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2013. The 1-year cumulative incidence of cancer, and the composite 1-year cumulative incidence of cancers with shared additional features, stratified by age and sex are reported. RESULTS: With abdominal pain, overall risk was greater in men and increased with age, reaching 3.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.0 to 3.7, predominantly colorectal cancer 1.9%, 95% CI = 1.6 to 2.1) in men 70 years, compared with their expected incidence of 0.88% (95% CI = 0.87 to 0.89). Additional features increased cancer risk; for example, for men, colorectal or pancreatic cancer risk with abdominal pain plus diarrhoea at 60C69 years of age was 3.1% (95% CI = 1.9 to 4.9) predominantly colorectal cancer (2.2%, 95% CI = 1.2 to 3.8). CONCLUSION: Abdominal pain increases intra-abdominal cancer risk nearly fourfold in men aged 70 years, exceeding the 3% threshold warranting investigation. This threshold is surpassed for the >60 years age group only with additional features. These results will help direct appropriate referral and testing strategies for patients based on their demographic profile and reporting features.

These include (a) almost constant and low daily case rates over extended periods of time, (b) sudden waves emerging from the above solution despite no or minimal change in the level of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and (c) reduction or flattening of case counts following relaxation of NPI. To explain these phenomena, we add contact tracing to our recently developed cluster seeding and transmission (CST) model. We find no fewer than four effects which make prediction of epidemic trajectories uncertain. These are (a) cryptogenic instability, where a small increase in population-averaged contact rate causes a large increase in cases, (b) critical mass effect, where a wave manifests after weeks of quiescence with no change in parameter values, (c) knife-edge effect, where a small change in parameter across a critical value causes a huge change in the response of the system, and (d) hysteresis effect, where the timing and not just the strength of a particular NPI determines the subsequent behaviour. Despite these effects however, some non-obvious conclusions regarding NPI appear to be robust. In particular, (a) narrowing the circle of ones social interactions can be as effective a measure as reducing interactions altogether, and (b) a good contact tracing program can effectively substitute for much more invasive measures. Finally, we propose the contact tracing capacity ratio - a metric of the load to which the tracers are subject - as a reliable early warning indicator of an imminent epidemic wave.","output":"Counter-intuitive COVID-19 Trajectories - Explanations, Early Warning Indicator and Mitigation Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Saudi Arabian authorities have implemented a number of preventive measures to confront COVID-19, including complete public lockdown, limitations on many services and a public awareness campaign. The success of these preventive measures is highly dependent on individuals compliance, which is influenced by their knowledge, attitudes and practices towards this disease. This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 among the population of Saudi Arabia.MethodsThis is a cross-sectional design study conducted between May 4 and May 21, 2020, using an online survey of 1135 participants. The survey instrument consisted of demographic characteristics, 19 items on knowledge, 4 items on attitudes and 6 items on practices. Descriptive statistics, independent sample t -test, analysis of variance, MannCWhitney U test, KruskalCWallis test, standard multiple regression analysis and ordinal logistic regression analysis were conducted. ResultsThe majority of the study participants were knowledgeable about COVID-19, with an overall correct rate of 77%. Most participants were worried of contracting COVID-19 (96.3%), and they held positive attitudes towards the intent to use a vaccine for COVID-19 if it was available (81%), informing health authorities if they developed symptoms of COVID-19 (98.1%) and confidence in the government efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic (90%). Most participants were also taking precautions such as keeping social distancing (99.2%), avoiding leaving the house (98.6%) and wearing face masks in public (92.2%). Nearly all of the respondents stated that they were avoiding shaking hands (96.8%), avoiding touching their face with unwashed hands (96.7%) and washing/rubbing hands as recommended (96.6%).

We conducted a qualitative study, collecting data from 30 employees working in a medium-sized public hospital in Israel using a semi-structured interview guide. Using a thematic analysis approach and drawing on social identity theory, we found that departmental identity is the most prominent social identity associated with the hospital staff. This identity was strengthened by strong in-group management, but little influenced by senior out-group management; its importance also caused organizational goals to be overlooked. We discuss these findings and offer recommendations for addressing the adverse impacts of departmental identity on staff, patients, and the organizations ability to meet challenges. This study has clarified sources and impacts of SI in a hospital context. It has also demonstrated the need for a more unified hospital identity to improve the hospitals daily work and achieve the organizations goals in a dynamic, competitive environment. Most literature on social identity has addressed personal- and group-level antecedents of social identity, neglecting the potential participation of in-group and out-group management in shaping these identities, as well as managements contribution to the achievement or nonachievement of organizational goals. By adopting a qualitative approach, the current study provides a deeper understanding of how senior management and direct in-group management can shape social identitiesa perspective heretofore missing from the research. Recognizing these identity-shaping forces is essential for understanding the challenges that hospitals face, and the various (at times, life-or-death) consequences of these forces.

However, the relationship between cell communication network factor 1 (CCN1) and PEDV infection has not been reported. In this study, we showed that the expression of CCN1 was enhanced by PEDV infection, and we observed that PEDV promotes the CREB and AP-1 activation to promote CCN1 expression. The PKA and p38 inhibitors significantly suppress CCN1 expression, indicating that PEDV-induced CCN1 expression may be through PKA and p38 pathway. Further tests confirmed that CREB and AP-1 are regulated by PKA and p38, respectively. Overexpression of CCN1 decreased the replication of PEDV, whereas knockdown of CCN1 increased the replication of PEDV. We proved that the overexpression of CCN1 increased the phosphorylation level of p53, promoted the expresion of Bax and the cleavage of caspase 9 and caspase 3, and inhibited the production of Bcl-2. CCN1 knockdown decreased the phosphorylation level of p53, inhibited the production of Bax and the cleavage of caspase 9 and caspase 3, and promoted the expression of Bcl-2. The treatment of PFT- (p53 inhibitor) significantly suppressed the expression of cleaved caspase 9 and caspase 3, leading to the decrease of apoptosis. Together, these studies showed that PEDV promotes the activation of CREB and AP-1 to increase the expression of CCN1. Overexpression of CCN1 promotes apoptosis by elevating p53 protein phosphorylation and inhibits PEDV replication, and knockdown of CCN1 inhibits apoptosis by decreasing p53 protein phosphorylation and promotes PEDV replication.

Almost overnight, providers of prenatal care adopted virtual visits and reduced visit schedules. These changes stood in stark contrast to the 12 to 14 in-person prenatal visit schedule than had been previously recommended for almost a century. As maternity care providers consider what prenatal care delivery changes we should maintain following the acute pandemic, we may gain insight from understanding the evolution of prenatal care delivery guidelines. In this paper, we start by sketching out the relatively unstructured beginnings of prenatal care in the 19th century. Most medical care fell within the domain of laypeople, and childbirth was a central feature of female domestic culture. We explore how early discoveries about \\"toxemia\\" created the groundwork for future prenatal care interventions, including screening of urine and blood pressure-which in turn created a need for routine prenatal care visits. We then discuss the organization of the medical profession, including the field of obstetrics and gynecology. In the early 20th century, new data increasingly revealed high rates of both infant and maternal mortality, leading to a greater emphasis on prenatal care. These discoveries culminated in the first codification of a prenatal visit schedule in 1930 by the Children's Bureau. Surprisingly, this schedule remained essentially unchanged for almost a century. Through the founding of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, significant technological advancements in laboratory testing and ultrasonography, and even an NIH Task Force call for changes in prenatal care delivery in 1989, prenatal care recommendations continued to be the same as they had been in 1930-monthly visits until 28 weeks, bimonthly visits until 36 weeks, and weekly visits until delivery. But COVID-19 forced us to change, to reconsider both the need for in-person visits and the frequency of visits. Now, as we transition from the acute pandemic, we should consider how to use what we have learned in this unprecedented time to shape future prenatal care. Lessons from over a century of prenatal care provide valuable insights to inform the next generation of prenatal care delivery.","output":"The Evolution of Prenatal Care Delivery Guidelines in the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Continual mutations to the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of influenza A virus generate novel antigenic strains that cause annual epidemics.

Their prevention is a priority to relieve the health system of from costly non-communicable disease treatments. The Accessible Quality Healthcare project is implementing a primary healthcare intervention that entails nurse-guided motivational counselling to facilitate change in the domains of smoking, diet, alcohol consumption and physical inactivity for at-risk patients. This study quantitatively assesses the uptake of motivational counselling and the distribution of health behaviours and stages of health behaviour change of the participants according to the intervention, as well as qualitatively describes experiences and perceived benefits of motivational counselling. METHODS: Study participants (n = 907) were recruited consecutively in 2019 from patients visiting the Main Family Medical Centres in 12 municipalities participating in the Kosovo Non-Communicable Disease Cohort study as part of the Accessible Quality Healthcare project. For the quantitative study, we used baseline and first follow-up data on smoking status, physical inactivity, obesity, fruit and vegetable as well as alcohol consumption, uptake of counselling, and stages for behavioural change. For the qualitative study, in-depth interviews were conducted with a subset of 26 cohort participants who had undergone motivational counselling. RESULTS: Motivational counselling was obtained by only 22% of the eligible participants in the intervention municipalities. Unhealthy behaviours are high even in persons who underwent counselling (of whom 13% are smokers; 86% physically inactive; 93% with inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption; and 61% are obese); only the rate of smoking was lower in those who obtained counselling. Among smokers, over 80% were still in the pre-contemplation phase of behaviour change. More advanced stages of behaviour change were observed among the highly prevalent group of inactive persons and participants with poor dietary habits, among the 5 intervention municipalities. According to the qualitative study results, the participants who obtained motivational counselling were very satisfied with the services but requested additional services such as group physical activity sessions and specialized services for smoking cessation.

METHODS: Data collection took place between November 25th, 2020 and January 11th, 2021 using a nationwide online survey. Subsequently, the researches performed a descriptive analysis on the main variables and used logistic regression models to investigate the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: Less concern over vaccine side effects could improve the willingness to be vaccinated (probability changed by 7.7 pp; p < 0.10). The current vaccine distrust espoused by the Brazilian president is associated with vaccine hesitancy, among his voter base. Lower performance perception (Very Bad with 10.7 pp; p < 0.01) or higher political opposition (left-oriented) regarding the current presidency is associated with the willingness to be vaccinated. Higher compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is usually positively associated with the willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine (+1 score to NPI compliance index is associated with higher willingness to be vaccinated by 1.4 pp, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Willingness to be vaccinated is strongly associated with political leaning, perceived federal government performance, vaccine side effects, and compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).","output":"Running away from the jab: factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Laparoscopic operations for obese patients remain challenging due to technical difficulties at operation as well as higher comorbidities and high risk of postoperative complications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The GST was developed on the basis of a comprehensive review of the literature, multidisciplinary expert opinion, and feedback from women with a history of gynecologic cancer. It is composed of 17 questions addressing six main categories-gynecologic health (abnormal bleeding/pain), lymphedema, vaginal/vulvar dryness, sexual health, menopause (hot flushes/sleep difficulties), and bowel/urinary issues. An electronic version using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Engage platform was piloted in two clinics for patients with endometrial or cervical cancer. Health information was generated into clinical summaries and identified concerns for actionable response. Associations of symptom and survey time point were assessed by longitudinal models using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS From January 1, 2019, to February 29, 2020, 3,357 GST assessments were assigned to 1,405 patients, with a 71% completion rate (90% within 5 minutes). Sixty-eight percent were performed at home via a patient portal, 32% at follow-ups using a clinic iPad. The most common symptoms were bowel problems, swelling/fluid, pain during examination, vaginal or vulvar dryness, and vaginal bleeding. Implementation challenges included improving patient compliance and ensuring that reports were reviewed by all clinical teams. We developed screening e-mails detailing patients whose assessments were due, planned training sessions for multidisciplinary teams, and incorporated feedback on methods for reviewing symptoms reports. CONCLUSION The GST demonstrated feasibility, a high completion rate, and minimal time commitment. It was an effective electronic reporting mechanism for patients, enabling the medical team to develop specific strategies for alleviating bothersome symptoms during follow-up.","output":"Gynecologic Survivorship Tool: Development, Implementation, and Symptom Outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More stringent constraints placed nowadays on water companies to provide high quality drinking water, increasing water resources scarcity in many areas of the planet, forcing water companies to work on marginal water bodies for supply, and the threat of hostile actions by political extremists and terrorist groups, that may willingly and deliberately cause contamination of an otherwise safe supply, are recent issues that have spurred demand for more efficient and comprehensive online water monitoring technologies.

The effects in primary care are understudied. This study aimed to explore changes in consultation numbers and patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify challenges for patient care. DESIGN: Survey of paediatric primary care practices on consultation numbers and patient management changes, and semistructured interviews to identify challenges for patient care. Surveys and interviews were partially linked in an explanatory sequential design to identify patient groups perceived to be at higher risk for worse care during the pandemic. SETTING: In and around Dsseldorf, a densely populated area in Western Germany. The primary care facilities are spread over an area with approximately 2 million inhabitants. PARTICIPANTS: Primary care in Germany is provided through practices run by self-employed specialist physicians that are contracted to offer services to patients under public health insurance which is compulsory to the majority of the population. The sample contained 44 paediatric primary care practices in the area, the response rate was 50%. RESULTS: Numbers of consultations for scheduled developmental examinations remained unchanged compared with the previous year while emergency visits were strongly reduced (mean 87.3 less/week in March-May 2020 compared with 2019, median reduction 55.0%). Children dependent on developmental therapy and with chronic health conditions were identified as patient groups receiving deteriorated care. High patient numbers, including of mildly symptomatic children presenting for health certificates, in combination with increased organisational demands and expected staff outages are priority concerns for the winter. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care paediatricians offered stable service through the early pandemic but expected strained resources for the upcoming winter. Unambiguous guidance on which children should present to primary care and who should be tested would help to allocate resources appropriately, and this guidance needs to consider age group specific issues including high prevalence of respiratory symptoms, dependency on carers and high contact rates.","output":"Paediatric primary care in Germany during the early COVID-19 pandemic: the calm before the storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antiviral activity of the oral disinfectant povidone-iodine (PVP-I) against severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) in vitro.

There are two groups of tests, which are in widespread use to identify patients who have contracted the virus. The commonly used reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test becomes negative once viral shedding ceases by approximately 2-3weeks. Antibody tests directed to viral antigens become positive after the second week of infection. IgG antibody responses to the virus are muted in children, pregnant females, and those with mild symptoms. IgA and IgM antibodies rapidly wane, although IgG antibodies directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein are more durable. Current data show variability in the sensitivity of commercial and in-house antibody tests to SARS-CoV-2.Areas covered: The role of T cells in acute illness is uncertain, but long-term protection against the virus may rely on memory T cell responses. Measuring memory T cell responses is important for retrospective confirmation of cases, who may have been infected early in the pandemic before reliable RT-qPCR tests were available and whose SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may have become undetectable.

These injuries, however, have not been quantified against previous seasons to highlight the altered season as a causative factor. METHODS: A review of an online database was conducted to search for injuries to football players in the Premier League across three seasons; 2018-2019, 2019-2020, and 2020-2021, to compare for difference in injury rates across the years and assess for higher rates in this current season, where athletes have had less play time due to COVID-19. Injury number and injury characteristics were abstracted from the online database Transfermarkt, with the provided information allowing for the sorting of the data into muscular and ligamentous injuries and skeletal injuries. RESULTS: Overall 226, 260, and 289 muscular and ligamentous injuries were observed across the 2018/2019, 2019/2020, and 2020/2021 seasons, respectively. There were 495 minutes on average played leading up to first injury in the 2020/2021 season, compared with 521 minutes in the 2019/2020 season and 536 minutes in the 2018/2019. There was an average of games played to injury of 5.6 games in the 2020/2021 year, with 6.0 in the 2019/2020 year and 6.1 in the 2018/2019 year. Additionally, there was a significantly shorter time in between games was noted during the COVID-affected season with a mean time of 6.8 days in-between games played during the 2020-2021 season as compared to the previous years of 9.12 and 7.12 days. CONCLUSION: Our study found that there were more injuries and a decreased time to first injury observed during the COVID-impacted 2020-2021 season than the two preceding seasons, perhaps demonstrating a link between fixture congestion and athlete injuries as evidenced by the significantly shorter time between games. It is therefore prudent to retain fixture spacing for athlete recovery even against the backdrop of an overall shortened season.","output":"The COVID lockdown and its effects on soft tissue injuries in Premier League Athletes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\\\\2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2), is currently posing significant threats to public health worldwide.

Preoperative Sco2, demographics, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitive troponin T, clinical outcomes, and 30-day and 1-yr mortality were recorded. RESULTS Median additive EuroSCORE was 5 (range: 0-19). Thirty-day and 1-yr mortality and major morbidity (at least two major complications and/or a high-dependency unit stay of at least 10 days) were 3.5%, 7.7%, and 13.3%, respectively. Median minimal preoperative oxygen supplemented Sco2 (Sco2min-ox) was 64% (range: 15-92%). Sco2min-ox was correlated (all: P value <0.0001) with N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (: -0.35), high-sensitive troponin T (: -0.28), hematocrit (: 0.34), glomerular filtration rate (: 0.19), EuroSCORE (: 0.20), and left ventricular ejection fraction class (: 0.12). Thirty-day nonsurvivors had a lower Sco2min-ox than survivors (median 58% [95% CI, 50.7-62%] vs. 64% [95% CI, 64-65%]; P < 0.0001). Receiver-operating curve analysis of Sco2min-ox and 30-day mortality revealed an area-under-the-curve of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.68-0.73%; P < 0.0001) in the total cohort and an area-under-the-curve of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.69-0.86%; P < 0.0001) in patients with a EuroSCORE more than 10. Logistic regression based on different EuroSCORE categories (0-2; 3-5, 6-10, >10), Sco2min-ox, and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass showed that a Sco2min-ox equal or less than 50% is an independent risk factor for 30-day and 1-yr mortality.

For this cross-sectional study, we used data from 425 older adults at 3 communities in Qingdao, Shandong Province in Northeastern China, from June to September 2021. Path analysis using the structural equation model was performed. We found that eHealth literacy was significantly associated with health promotion behaviors in older people. Additionally, eHealth literacy indirectly affected health promotion behaviors through self-efficacy and self-care ability, respectively. In addition, the chain mediation effect was identified in the relationship of eHealth literacy and health promotion behaviors: eHealth literacy self-efficacy self-care ability health promotion behaviors. These findings offer promising directions for developing interventions to modify older adults health behaviors through enhancing their eHealth literacy. These interventions should integrate components that target improving the self-efficacy and self-care ability of older people.","output":"Association of eHealth Literacy with Health Promotion Behaviors of Community-Dwelling Older People: The Chain Mediating Role of Self-Efficacy and Self-Care Ability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genome-scale orthology assignments are usually based on reciprocal best matches.

When there is overlap, the recommendations made here supersede those of previous guidelines. METHODS This focused update analyzes results from 8 randomized, clinical trials of endovascular treatment and other relevant data published since 2013. It is not intended to be a complete literature review from the date of the previous guideline publication but rather to include pivotal new evidence that justifies changes in current recommendations. Members of the writing committee were appointed by the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Stroke Council's Scientific Statement Oversight Committee and the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Manuscript Oversight Committee. Strict adherence to the American Heart Association conflict of interest policy was maintained throughout the consensus process. Recommendations follow the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association methods of classifying the level of certainty of the treatment effect and the class of evidence. Prerelease review of the draft guideline was performed by 6 expert peer reviewers and by the members of the Stroke Council Scientific Statement Oversight Committee and Stroke Council Leadership Committee. RESULTS Evidence-based guidelines are presented for the selection of patients with acute ischemic stroke for endovascular treatment, for the endovascular procedure, and for systems of care to facilitate endovascular treatment. CONCLUSIONS Certain endovascular procedures have been demonstrated to provide clinical benefit in selected patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) is increasingly recognised as a reliable option for colonic surveillance, but widespread adoption has been slow for several reasons, including the time-consuming reading process of the CCE recording. Automated image recognition and artificial intelligence (AI) are appealing solutions in CCE. Through a review of the currently available and developmental technologies, we discuss how AI is poised to deliver at the forefront of CCE in the coming years. Current practice for CCE reporting often involves a two-step approach, with a pre-reader and validator. This requires skilled and experienced readers with a significant time commitment. Therefore, CCE is well-positioned to reap the benefits of the ongoing digital innovation. This is likely to initially involve an automated AI check of finished CCE evaluations as a quality control measure. Once felt reliable, AI could be used in conjunction with a pre-reader, before adopting more of this role by sending provisional results and abnormal frames to the validator. With time, AI would be able to evaluate the findings more thoroughly and reduce the input required from human readers and ultimately autogenerate a highly accurate report and recommendation of therapy, if required, for any pathology identified. As with many medical fields reliant on image recognition, AI will be a welcome aid in CCE.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a member of beta coronavirus family which upon exposure caused a highly infectious disease called novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19, a probably bat originated disease was declared by World Health Organization (WHO) as a global pandemic in March 2020. Since then, despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the disease has affected nearly 56,261,952 laboratory confirmed human population and caused deaths of over 1,349,506 lives worldwide.

METHODS Mortality and underlying causes of death were ascertained from the National Death Index. Indirect standardization using age- and sex-specific nationwide all-cause and cause-specific mortality data extracted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder Online Database allowed for calculation of standardized mortality ratios (SMR). RESULTS There were 47 deaths (96% female) among 1437 IHR participants that met inclusion criteria. The average age at death was 46 years (range, 20-95 years). Participants of the IHR experienced higher all-cause mortality than the general population (SMR, 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.1). Suicide, accidents, and deaths from medical/surgical complications were the most common underlying causes, accounting for 43% of all deaths. When compared to the general population, the risk of suicide was over 6 times greater (SMR, 6.1; 95% CI, 2.9-12.7) and the risk of death from accidental overdose was over 3 times greater (SMR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.6-7.7). The risk of suicide by overdose was over 15 times greater among the IHR cohort than in the general population (SMR, 15.3; 95% CI, 6.4-36.7).

In this work, a novel, home-built, low-cost, and accurate metrology to visualize orally-generated fluid droplets has been developed. The project includes setup optimization, data collection, data analysis, and applications. The final materials chosen were quinine-containing tonic water, 397-402 nm wavelength UV tube lights, an iPhone and tripod, string, and a spray bottle. The experiment took place in a dark closet with a dark background. During data collection, the test subject first wets their mouth with an ingestible fluorescent liquid (tonic water) and speaks, sneezes, or coughs under UV darklight. The fluorescence from the tonic water droplets generated can be visualized, recorded by an iPhone 8+ camera in slo-mo (240 fps), and analyzed. The software VLC is used for frame separation and Fiji/ImageJ is used for image processing and analysis. The dependencies of oral fluid droplet generation and propagation on different phonics, the loudness of speech, and the type of expiratory event were studied in detail and established using the metrology developed. The efficacy of different types of masks was evaluated and correlated with fabric microstructures. All masks blocked droplets to varying extent. Masks with smaller-sized pores and thicker material were found to block the most droplets.

The South African government has imposed a number of measures aimed at controlling the pandemic, chief being a nationwide lockdown. This has resulted in income loss for individuals and firms, with vulnerable populations (low earners, those in informal and precarious employment, etc.) more likely to be adversely affected through job losses and the resulting income loss. Income loss will likely result in reduced ability to access healthcare and a nutritious diet, thus adversely affecting health outcomes. Given the foregoing, we hypothesize that the economic dislocation caused by the coronavirus will disproportionately affect the health of the poor. METHODS: Using the fifth wave of the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) dataset conducted in 2017 and the first wave of the NIDS-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM) dataset conducted in May/June 2020, this paper estimated income-related health inequalities in South Africa before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health was a dichotomized self-assessed health measure, with fair and poor health categorized as \\"poor\\" health, while excellent, very good and good health were categorized as \\"better\\" health. Household per capita income was used as the ranking variable. Concentration curves and indices were used to depict the income-related health inequalities. Furthermore, we decomposed the COVID-19 era income-related health inequality in order to ascertain the significant predictors of such inequality. RESULTS: The results indicate that poor health was pro-poor in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, with the latter six times the value of the former. Being African (relative to white), per capita household income and household experience of hunger significantly predicted income-related health inequalities in the COVID-19 era (contributing 130%, 46% and 9% respectively to the inequalities), while being in paid employment had a nontrivial but statistically insignificant contribution (13%) to health inequality. CONCLUSIONS: Given the significance and magnitude of race, hunger, income and employment in determining socioeconomic inequalities in poor health, addressing racial disparities and hunger, income inequality and unemployment will likely mitigate income-related health inequalities in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Income-related health inequalities associated with the coronavirus pandemic in South Africa: A decomposition analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This study aimed to investigate psychological distress among infectious disease (ID) physicians during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in the Republic of Korea Methods: Using an online-based survey link sent via text message and email, we conducted a survey from April 21 to 25, 2020, targeting all ID physicians currently working in ID (n = 265) The questionnaire was based on the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales, and information was collected on factors protecting against psychological distress and difficulties in relation to COVID-19 Results: Of 265 ID physicians, 115 (43 3%) responded, showing burnout (97, 90 4%), depression (20, 17 4%), anxiety (23, 20 0%), and stress (5, 4 3%) There were no differences in terms of distress between ID physicians who were directly involved in the care of patients with COVID-19 or not (Table 1) Greater than 50% of physicians valued their work and felt recognized by others, whereas &lt; 10% indicated that sufficient human and financial support and private time had been provided during the outbreak The most challenging issues concerned a lack of human resources for COVID-19 treatment or infection control, a shortage of personal protective equipment or airborne infection isolation rooms, pressure for research, and lack of guidelines for COVID-19 management (Figure 1) Conclusion: During the COVID-19 outbreak in the ROK, most respondents reported psychological distress Preparing strategies for infectious disease outbreaks that support ID physicians is essential (Figure Presented)","output":"Psychological distress among infectious disease physicians during the response to the COVID-19 outbreak in the republic of korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Providing a comfortable thermal environment to workers for better health and productivity is one of the necessary conditions for sustainable industrial development However, there is a dearth of field studies on the thermal comfort status and adaptation of workers in naturally ventilated industrial buildings across the world Therefore, an adaptive thermal comfort field study in a mini-industrial unit factory, located in the composite climate of India, was conducted in the warm summer and cold winter seasons Overall, 1276 valid subjective responses were collected from 325 factory workers during the field measurements and survey We found a seasonal comfort temperature variation of more than 9 5 C with a mean comfort temperature of 32 2 C The mean preferred temperature was observed about 3 5 C lower than their mean comfort temperature The adaptive comfort relation suggested that surveyed factory workers had a high thermal adaptation owing to the combined effect of behavioural adjustments and elevated airspeed A logistic regression analysis was carried out to predict the fan use behavior during the hot summer season Since the study duration also lies in the COVID-19 pandemic period, an effort has been made to quantify the psychological and behavioural changes of workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation at their workplace through a questionnaire-based study","output":"Adaptive thermal comfort study of workers in a mini-industrial unit during summer and winter season in a tropical country, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Policy Points Equitable access to a COVID-19 vaccine in all countries remains a key policy objective, but experience of previous pandemics suggests access will be limited in developing countries, despite the rapid development of three successful vaccine candidates. The COVAX Facility seeks to address this important issue, but the prevalence of vaccine nationalism threatens to limit the ability of the facility to meet both its funding targets and its ambitious goals for vaccine procurement. A failure to adequately address the underlying lack of infrastructure in developing countries threatens to further limit the success of the COVAX Facility. CONTEXT: Significant effort has been directed toward developing a COVID-19 vaccine, which is viewed as the route out of the pandemic. Much of this effort has coalesced around COVAX, the multilateral initiative aimed at accelerating the development of COVID-19 vaccines, and ensuring they are equitably available in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper represents the first significant analysis of COVAX, and the extent to which it can be said to have successfully met these aims. METHODS: This paper draws on the publicly available policy documents made available by the COVAX initiatives, as well as position papers and public statements from governments around the world with respect to COVID-19 vaccines and equitable access. We analyze the academic literature regarding access to vaccines during the H1N1 pandemic. Finally, we consider the WHO Global Allocation System, and its principles, which are intended to guide COVAX vaccine deployment. FINDINGS: We argue that the funding mechanism deployed by the COVAX Pillar appears to be effective at fostering at-risk investments in research and development and the production of doses in advance of confirmation of clinical efficacy, but caution that this represents a win-win situation for vaccine manufacturers, providing them with opportunity to benefit regardless of whether their vaccine candidate ever goes on to gain regulatory approval. We also argue that the success of the COVAX Facility with respect to equitable access to vaccine is likely to be limited, primarily as a result of the prevalence of vaccine nationalism, whereby countries adopt policies which heavily prioritize their own public health needs at the expense of others. CONCLUSIONS: Current efforts through COVAX have greatly accelerated the development of vaccines against COVID-19, but these benefits are unlikely to flow to LMICs, largely due to the threat of vaccine nationalism.","output":"International Collaboration to Ensure Equitable Access to Vaccines for COVID-19: The ACT-Accelerator and the COVAX Facility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article describes the implementation of IoT technology in the teaching of microprocessor technology.

However, its specific mechanism of action has not yet been clarified. This study aims to explore the mechanism of action of DYY in the treatment of COVID-19 with the hope of providing a theoretical basis for its clinical application. Methods: First, the TCMSP database was searched to screen the active ingredients and corresponding target genes of the DYY prescription and to further identify the core compounds in the active ingredient. Simultaneously, the Genecards database was searched to identify targets related to COVID-19. Then, the STRING database was applied to analyse protein-protein interaction, and Cytoscape software was used to draw a network diagram. The R language and DAVID database were used to analyse GO biological processes and KEGG pathway enrichment. Second, AutoDock Vina and other software were used for molecular docking of core targets and core compounds. Finally, before and after application of DYY, the core target gene IL6 of COVID-19 patients was detected by ELISA to validate the clinical effects. Results: First, 174 compounds, 7053 target genes of DYY and 251 genes related to COVID-19 were selected, among which there were 45 target genes of DYY associated with treatment of COVID-19. This study demonstrated that the use of DYY in the treatment of COVID-19 involved a variety of biological processes, and DYY acted on key targets such as IL6, ILIB, and CCL2 through signaling pathways such as the IL-17 signaling pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. DYY might play a vital role in treating COVID-19 by suppressing the inflammatory storm and regulating immune function. Second, the molecular docking results showed that there was a certain affinity between the core compounds (kaempferol, quercetin, 7-Methoxy-2-methyl isoflavone, naringenin, formononetin) and core target genes (IL6, IL1B, CCL2). Finally, clinical studies showed that the level of IL6 was elevated in COVID-19 patients, and DYY can reduce its levels.

Follow up was completed to 30/11/2012. RESULTS 147 patients received 232 sheets of ADM (156 Strattice, 73 Permacol and 3 Alloderm). Mean follow up was 687 days. In 40 cases unplanned implant explantation occurred (17.2% or 27.2% of patients). 7 of 27 (25.9%) patients requiring adjuvant therapy had this delayed due to problems with the reconstruction. 30 of 80 patients (37.5%) undergoing unilateral surgery have undergone contralateral surgery. Implant loss varied significantly with smoking (34.6% loss rate in smokers vs 13.2% in non-smokers, p = 0.001), with radiotherapy (28.1% loss rate vs 13.8% with no radiotherapy, p = 0.001) and with incision type.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort analysis of the cumulative incidence of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 among adult residents of Alcorcon (Spain) in the first wave of the disease up to April 25, 2020. RESULTS: The crude cumulative incidence among migrants (n=20419) was higher than among Spaniards (n=131599): 8.81 and 6.51 and per 1000 inhabitants, respectively (p < .001), but differed by region of origin. As per a negative binomial regression adjusted for age and sex, relative risk (RR) for COVID-19 for individuals from Europe, Asia, or North Africa was not significantly different from Spaniards.

Whether such unprecedented impact was due to lockdown itself and recedes when such measures are lifted is unclear. We assessed the short- and medium-term impacts of the first lockdown measures on hospital care for tracer non-COVID-19 conditions in England, Scotland and Wales across diseases, sexes, and socioeconomic and ethnic groups. METHODS: We used OpenSAFELY (for England), EAVEII (Scotland), and SAIL Databank (Wales) to extract weekly hospital admission rates for cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory conditions (excluding COVID-19) from the pre-pandemic period until 25/10/2020 and conducted a controlled interrupted time series analysis. We undertook stratified analyses and assessed admission rates over seven months during which lockdown restrictions were gradually lifted. FINDINGS: Our combined dataset included 32 million people who contributed over 74 million person-years. Admission rates for all three conditions fell by 34.2% (Confidence Interval (CI): -43.0, -25.3) in England, 20.9% (CI: -27.8, -14.1) in Scotland, and 24.7% (CI: -36.7, -12.7) in Wales, with falls across every stratum considered. In all three nations, cancer-related admissions fell the most while respiratory-related admissions fell the least (e.g., rates fell by 40.5% (CI: -47.4, -33.6), 21.9% (CI: -35.4, -8.4), and 19.0% (CI: -30.6, -7.4) in England for cancer, cardiovascular-related, and respiratory-related admissions respectively). Unscheduled admissions rates fell more in the most than the least deprived quintile across all three nations. Some ethnic minority groups experienced greater falls in admissions (e.g., in England, unscheduled admissions fell by 9.5% (CI: -20.2, 1.2) for Whites, but 44.3% (CI: -71.0, -17.6), 34.6% (CI: -63.8, -5.3), and 25.6% (CI: -45.0, -6.3) for Mixed, Other and Black ethnic groups respectively). Despite easing of restrictions, the overall admission rates remained lower in England, Scotland, and Wales by 20.8%, 21.6%, and 22.0%, respectively when compared to the same period (August-September) during the pre-pandemic years. This corresponds to a reduction of 26.2, 23.8 and 30.2 admissions per 100,000 people in England, Scotland, and Wales respectively. INTERPRETATION: Hospital care for non-COVID diseases fell substantially across England, Scotland, and Wales during the first lockdown, with reductions persisting for at least six months.

Preimplantation mouse embryos are known to express serotonin receptors, specifically the 5-HT1D and 5-HT7 serotonin receptor subtypes. Here we demonstrate that Hoxa10 regulates endometrial TDO expression and improves embryo viability through increased serotonin production. Transfection of pcDNA-Hoxa10 to the murine uterus increased total TDO expression. In vitro, epithelial cell TDO expression was decreased after transfection with Hoxa10. Decreased glandular TDO in response to HOXA10 may augment serotonin production by increasing tryptophan availability. Conversely, stromal TDO expression increased with constitutive Hoxa10 expression. In mice, epithelial serotonin was increased in response to constitutive expression of Hoxa10. Embryo quality was impaired after treatment with Hoxa10 antisense. Blockade of serotonin receptors 1D and 7 also resulted in impaired embryo development, indicating an essential role for Hoxa10 induction of TDO and subsequent serotonin production in embryo development. Transfection of pcDNA-TDO also decreased the number of T cells in the endometrial stroma. We have shown a novel mechanism by which HOXA10 regulates endometrial TDO expression. In the endometrial stroma, HOXA10 increases TDO mRNA, which may increase tryptophan catabolism, allowing for immune tolerance at the time of embryo implantation. In endometrial glands, HOXA10 decreases TDO mRNA leading to increased serotonin that in turn acts to promote normal embryo development.","output":"Regulation of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase by HOXA10 enhances embryo viability through serotonin signaling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To assess the levels of anxiety, depression and insomnia among Italian nurses directly involved in the care of patients with Covid-19, considering the first and the second wave of the pandemic. Methods: An online questionnaire was administered on some pages of the nursing social networks and addressed precisely to nurses directly involved in the care of patients affected by Covid-19 in two different periods of the pandemic: during the first wave (March2020 - May 2020) and during the second wave (October 2020 - November 2020).

A model for measuring and preventing the continued spread of COVID-19 is urgently required to provide smart health care services. This requires using advanced intelligent computing such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, cognitive computing, cloud computing, fog computing, and edge computing. This paper proposes a model for predicting COVID-19 using the SIR and machine learning for smart health care and the well-being of the citizens of KSA. Knowing the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered cases each day is critical for mathematical modeling to be able to identify the behavioral effects of the pandemic. It forecasts the situation for the upcoming 700 days. The proposed system predicts whether COVID-19 will spread in the population or die out in the long run. Mathematical analysis and simulation results are presented here as a means to forecast the progress of the outbreak and its possible end for three types of scenarios: no actions, lockdown, and new medicines. The effect of interventions like lockdown and new medicines is compared with the no actions scenario. The lockdown case delays the peak point by decreasing the infection and affects the area equality rule of the infected curves. On the other side, new medicines have a significant impact on infected curve by decreasing the number of infected people about time. Available forecast data on COVID-19 using simulations predict that the highest level of cases might occur between 15 and 30 November 2020. Simulation data suggest that the virus might be fully under control only after June 2021. The reproductive rate shows that measures such as government lockdowns and isolation of individuals are not enough to stop the pandemic. This study recommends that authorities should, as soon as possible, apply a strict long-term containment strategy to reduce the epidemic size successfully.","output":"Measuring and Preventing COVID-19 Using the SIR Model and Machine Learning in Smart Health Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Daily life of higher education students across the world changed profoundly in 2020 with the implementation of governmental and institutional measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated mental wellbeing and engagement in health risk behaviours (HRB) in German university students at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Data stem from the COVID-19 International Student Wellbeing Study (C19 ISWS). The web-based survey was conducted in May 2020 at four German universities. HRBs included tobacco and cannabis use, alcohol consumption, and engagement in physical activity. All HRBs were assessed retrospectively and at the time of data collection. Mental wellbeing was assessed using the 8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D 8). We conducted multinomial regression analyses to investigate factors associated with changes in HRBs and latent transition analysis to identify substance use profiles. Results 5021 students completed the survey (69% female;mean age 24.4 years, SD = 5.1). The mean score for depressive symptoms was 9.25 (SD = 0.67, range 0-24). Sixty-one percent of students reported consuming alcohol, 46% binge drinking, 44% inactivity, 19% smoking and 11% cannabis use. While smoking and cannabis use remained unchanged during the COVID-19 pandemic, 24% reported a decrease in binge drinking. Changes to physical activity were frequently reported, with 31% reporting an increase and 19% reporting a decrease in vigorous physical activity. Higher depressive symptoms were found to be associated with changes in HRBs. Five substance use behaviour profiles were identified, which remained fairly unchanged. Conclusions Engagement in HRBs remains at high level during the COVID-19 pandemic among German students. Depressive symptoms were found to be associated with changes in HRBs.

We identified, synthesized, and compared guidelines intended for anesthesiologists. SOURCE: Member society websites of the World Federation of Societies of Anesthesiologists and the European Society of Anesthesiologists were searched. Recommendations that focused on perioperative airway management of patients with proven or potential COVID-19 were included. Accelerated screening was used; data were extracted by one reviewer and verified by a second. Data were organized into themes based on perioperative phase of care. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Thirty unique sets of recommendations were identified. None reported methods for systematically searching or selecting evidence to be included. Four were updated following initial publication. For induction and airway management, most recommended minimizing personnel and having the most experienced anesthesiologist perform tracheal intubation. Significant congruence was observed among recommendations that discussed personal protective equipment. Of those that discussed tracheal intubation methods, most (96%) recommended videolaryngoscopy, while discordance existed regarding use of flexible bronchoscopy. Intraoperatively, 23% suggested specific anesthesia techniques and most (63%) recommended a specific operating room for patients with COVID-19. Postoperatively, a minority discussed extubation procedures (33%), or care in the recovery room (40%). Non-technical considerations were discussed in 27% and psychological support for healthcare providers in 10%. CONCLUSION: Recommendations for perioperative airway management of patients with COVID-19 overlap to a large extent but also show significant differences. Given the paucity of data early in the pandemic, it is not surprising that identified publications largely reflected expert opinion rather than empirical evidence.

Deferral of these visits may have critical health impact, including delayed diagnosis for melanoma and other skin cancers. We examined the influence of the pandemic on skin biopsy rates in a large population-based cohort. METHODS: Using a universal health care claims dataset from Ontario, we examined skin biopsies from January 6, 2020 to September 27, 2020, and compared these to the same period for 2019. Those diagnosed with anogenital cancers, younger than 20 years, residing out-of-province and with lapses in coverage were excluded. The sensitivity and specificity of claims diagnoses compared to a validated algorithm to identify keratinocyte carcinoma (KC), or to the cancer registry for melanoma was evaluated. Factors associated with biopsy during the early pandemic were investigated with modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: A precipitous drop in total skin biopsies (15% of expected), biopsies for KC (18%) and melanoma (27%) was seen with the onset of COVID-19 cases (p<0.01). Claims diagnoses were of high specificity for KC (99%), and for melanoma (98%), though sensitivity was less (61%, 28% respectively). In adjusted analysis, the elderly (80+ years), females and residents of certain regions were less likely to be biopsied during the pandemic. Subsequently, there were substantial improvements in biopsy rates over 10 weeks. However, compared to 2019, a large backlog of expected cases still remained 28 weeks after lockdown (45,710 all biopsy, 9,104 KC, 595 melanoma). INTERPRETATION: A drastic reduction in skin biopsies is noted early in the COVID-19 pandemic; this disproportionately affected the elderly, females and certain geographic regions. Though biopsies subsequently increased, a large backlog of cases remained after almost half a year. This will have implications for downstream care of skin cancer. Efforts should be made to limit diagnostic delay.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on skin cancer diagnosis: A population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The relationship between energy and output is one of the key issues in economic literature.

Case Report: A 39-year-old male presented to the hospital for acute onset shortness of breath. On admission, he was found to have right-sided pneumothorax and a pigtail catheter was placed with a proper expansion of the right lung. Approximately one month previously, he had been admitted for mild COVID19 pneumonia and successfully treated with dexamethasone and was discharged home with stable condition.On further evaluation, chest CT revealed multiple cavitary lesions with one large cavitation in the inferior right upper lobe with prominent mediastinal and hilar nodes. Quantiferon gold, AFB x3, and mycobacterium complex PCR were all negative. Fungitell, 1-3 B-D gluten, and coccioides antibodies were also negative.

Eleven electronic databases were searched to identify all relevant randomized and non-randomized controlled trials based on a priori defined eligibility criteria. Two independent reviewers screened the literature for eligibility and assessed risk of bias. Semiquantitative analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of intervention effects by taking sex/gender aspects into account.

Twelve studies were included that examined intervention effects on AC in girls and boys. Three intervention studies showed significant effects in increasing AC, with one study favoring girls, one favoring boys, and another focusing on a single sex/gender (only girls). According to the checklist, the overall sex/gender rating highlighted a lack of information in sex/gender consideration. Studies with and without significant effects indicated no differences in the sex/gender checklist. The results indicate that sex/gender is not considered adequately in primary interventional research on AC.

DESIGN: Rasch analysis of ICARE Phase III trial data, comparing three upper extremity (UE) motor treatments in stroke survivors enrolled 45.822.4 days post-stroke. Participants underwent a structured UE motor training called Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program, usual and customary care, or dose-equivalent care. UEFM data from Baseline, post-intervention, 6, and 12 months were included for analysis. SETTING: Outpatient stroke rehabilitation. PARTICIPANTS: ICARE participants. INTERVENTIONS: N/A MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Item difficulties, person abilities, sample size. RESULTS: Summed raw UEFM scores, because of their ordinality, measured motor impairment inconsistently across different ranges of stroke severity relative to the rescaled UEFM. In the full ICARE sample (N=361), raw UEFM understated scores relative to rescaled by 7.4 points for the most severely impaired, but overstated scores by up to 8.4 points towards the ceiling. As a result, 50.9% of all UEFM observations showed a residual error greater than 10% of the total UEFM score. Relative to the raw, the rescaled UEFM improved effect size of change in motor impairment between baseline and 1-year (d=0.35). For a hypothetical three-arm trial resembling ICARE, UEFM rescaling reduced required sample size by 32% (n = 108) compared to raw UEFM (n= 159). CONCLUSIONS: In UE rehabilitation trials, a rescaled UEFM potentially decreases sample size by 1/3, decreasing costs, duration, and subjects exposed to experimental risks. This benefit is obtained through increased measurement efficiency; reductions in ceiling effects are also possible. These findings apply to ICARE-like trials; confirmatory validation in another Phase III trial is needed.","output":"Inaccurate Use of the Upper Extremity Fugl Meyer Negatively Impacts UE Rehabilitation Trial Design: Findings from the ICARE RCT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of the three-dimensional (3D) exoscope is a marvel of technological innovation in modern surgical practice. While its predecessor, the operating microscope (OM), has long been the gold-standard surgical visualization modality, its particular limitations in terms of accessibility and ergonomic demand have led to the development of a more sophisticated, 3D model. Specifically, the 3D exoscope allows for an enhanced image quality of the surgical field, while also being more ergonomically favorable. Moreover, this devices ability to handle delicate microsensitve procedures, along with its alleviation of surgeon fatigue, indicates great potential for neurosurgical application. For this narrative review, the authors queried PubMed database using the keyword exoscope to identify relevant studies involving the specialty of neurosurgery that were published in English language full text. The search yielded full-text English language-related articles regarding neurosurgical exoscope, its applications and limitations. The 3D exoscope uniquely allows for enhanced surgeon comfort and superior imaging of the patients real-time anatomy. However, the OM was described to having a slight image favorability with fusion and decompression surgery. Cost analysis is highlighted for its potential disparity. 3D exoscopes will potentially be incorporated with intelligent carriers and robotic surgical systems. Ultimately, with further studies highlighting its use, the 3D exoscope is expected to continue to imprint its status as one of the most efficient technological visualization tools in the future of neurosurgical practice.","output":"The Role of 3D Exoscope Systems in Neurosurgery: An Optical Innovation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has placed nurses and other health care professionals in morally distressing situations related to personal safety, resource allocation, and family versus public care needs Making do, referring to managing with insufficient means, has been the norm of pandemic testing and care Health care professionals and essential employees at the sharp point of care and service have been required to pay the price associated with this new normal Some have described these crushingly difficult circumstances as contributing to moral injury and moral distress Nurses, physicians, and other essential professionals are affirmatively responding to demands for their services while acknowledging that necessary clinical equipment and protective gear are unavailable in the quantities required for safe care delivery Moral injury is unique from moral distress Moral injury has its roots in war and was diagnosed in veterans harmed after perpetrating, failing to thwart, or witnessing acts that violated their deeply held moral convictions and expectations","output":"Making Do During a Pandemic: Morally Distressing and Injurious Events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bicycling has grown significantly in the past ten years. In some regions, the implementation of large-scale bike-sharing systems and improved cycling infrastructure are two of the factors enabling this growth. An increase in non-motorized modes of transportation makes our cities more human, decreases pollution, traffic, and improves quality of life. In many cities around the world, urban planners and policymakers are looking at cycling as a sustainable way of improving urban mobility. Although bike-sharing systems generate abundant data about their users travel habits, most cities still rely on traditional tools and methods for planning and policy-making. Recent technological advances enable the collection and analysis of large amounts of data about urban mobility, which can serve as a solid basis for evidence-based policy-making. In this paper, we introduce a novel analytical method that can be used to process millions of bike-sharing trips and analyze bike-sharing mobility, abstracting relevant mobility flows across specific urban areas. Backed by a visualization platform, this method provides a comprehensive set of analytical tools to support public authorities in making data-driven policy and planning decisions. This paper illustrates the use of the method with a case study of the Greater Boston bike-sharing system and, as a result, presents new findings about that particular system. Finally, an assessment with expert users showed that this method and tool were considered very useful, relatively easy to use and that they intend to adopt the tool in the near future.","output":"Abstracting mobility flows from bike-sharing systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic COVID-19 has had a direct impact on the world of education.

The outbreak of SARS in 2002/2003 was associated with high morbidity and mortality and sparked international research efforts to develop antiviral strategies. Many of these efforts focussed on the viral surface protein spike (S), which facilitates the first indispensable step in the viral replication cycle, infectious entry into target cells. For infectious cellular entry to occur, the S protein must engage a cellular receptor, the carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The interface between ACE2 and S protein, which has been characterized at the structural level, constitutes a key target for vaccines and inhibitors, and is believed to be an important determinant of viral pathogenesis and interspecies transmission.

Participants were Jewish and Arab pregnant women (n = 403) aged 20-47, who completed a set of structured self-report questionnaires from 18 March to 9 April 2020. Findings indicated that Arab women reported higher level of COVID-19-related childbirth anxiety and COVID-19-related fears of being infected and concern for the foetus. In addition, poorer health, being an Arab woman, being in the third trimester, lower self-compassion, and higher COVID-19-related fears contributed significantly to greater COVID-19-related childbirth anxiety. Furthermore, poorer health, being primiparous, at-risk pregnancy, lower self-compassion and higher fear of being infected contributed significantly to greater FOC. Importantly, social support was found to moderate the association between self-compassion and FOC. The results highlight the need to be attentive to pregnant women in times of crisis, and in particular to especially vulnerable subgroups, such as cultural minorities.

These transitions present new stressors, including health-related concerns, new demands placed on families by lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, and the possibility of losing a job or inability to pay bills. Such stressors have the potential to disrupt collaboration between coparents in addition to basic family functioning. Drawing upon a family systems perspective, the current study thus sought to examine links between COVID-19-related stressors and family cohesion through coparental functioning. A total of 1,003 parent/caregivers (97% from the United States; 82% Caucasian, 74% female; M = 40.9 years old, SD = 8.5; Mincome = $83,631, SDincome = $36,320) of school-age children completed an initial online survey from the end of March to the end of April of 2020. Of the initial sample, a total of 685 parents/caregivers completed weekly diaries for a month. Based on multilevel modeling, results suggested that, at the between-family level, coparental conflict mediated the impact of the stress of parenting/work demands and financial stress on family cohesion. At the within-family level, weekly spikes in health-related stress were associated with corresponding spikes in coparental conflict, which, in turn, were associated with drops in family cohesion. Results from the current study suggest that beyond the fears associated with contracting the COVID-19 virus, other key stressors associated with the emerging pandemic played a role in increasing coparental conflict, ultimately exacerbating family functioning.

However, a detailed thermodynamic analysis of experimental data on the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses can enable a fundamental understanding of their thermal degradation that will help model the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigate future outbreaks. This work introduces a thermodynamic model that synthesizes existing data into an analytical framework built on first principles, including the rate law for a first-order reaction and the Arrhenius equation, to accurately predict the temperature-dependent inactivation of coronaviruses. The model provides much-needed thermal decontamination guidelines for personal protective equipment, including masks. For example, at 70 C, a 3-log (99.9%) reduction in virus concentration can be achieved, on average, in 3 min (under the same conditions, a more conservative decontamination time of 39 min represents the upper limit of a 95% interval) and can be performed in most home ovens without reducing the efficacy of typical N95 masks as shown in recent experimental reports.

On the other hand, three themes for negative effects emerged from the online assessment, including complication of evaluation administration, reduced interaction between teachers and students, and anxiety in English test. The effects emerge from how teachers and students view the drawbacks of the online assessment itself. Positive effects lead to students' learning better are caused by lesson taken from conducting the test;however, the negatives should be treated as challenges that will improve the teaching and learning.

Current estimates of time-varying epidemiological parameters often face problems such as lagging observations, averaging inference, and improper quantification of uncertainties. To address these problems, we propose a Bayesian data assimilation framework for time-varying parameter estimation. Specifically, this framework is applied to Rt estimation, resulting in the state-of-the-art DARt system. With DARt, time misalignment caused by lagging observations is tackled by incorporating observation delays into the joint inference of infections and Rt; the drawback of averaging is overcome by instantaneously updating upon new observations and developing a model selection mechanism that captures abrupt changes; the uncertainty is quantified and reduced by employing Bayesian smoothing. We validate the performance of DARt and demonstrate its power in revealing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. The proposed approach provides a promising solution for accurate and timely estimating transmission dynamics from reported data.","output":"Bayesian data assimilation for estimating epidemic evolution: a COVID-19 study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has created sudden and unique challenges within the field of clinical neuropsychology.

However, it has taken a long time to prove the beneficial effects of anti-inflammatory drugs on cardiovascular events. Diabetes can be both a product of inflammation and a cofactor implicated in the progression of vascular disease. When diabetes and inflammation are accompanied by obesity, this ominous trifecta leads to an increased incidence of atherothrombotic events. Research into earlier stages of vascular disease, and documentation of vulnerability to premature vascular disease, might be the key to success in preventing clinical events. Modulation of inflammation, combined with strict control of classical cardiovascular risk factors, seems to be the winning recipe.

The conventional technique involves rigid esophagoscopes and trocar performed by ENT surgeons alone, with technical limitations encountered in patients with cervical abnormalities - in particular those with free or rotational flap reconstructions and postradiotherapy strictures. We report our technique using flexible endoscopy which we show to be feasible and without major safety events, as a possible consideration in the anticipated difficult TEP. METHODS: Our study describes a multidisciplinary approach to secondary TEP involving a combined upper gastrointestinal (UGI) and (Ear, Nose, and Throat) ENT procedure, under the guidance of flexible esophagoscopy, with intraoperative involvement of the speech pathologist to guide VP insertion and placement. The procedure was performed with ease without major complications. RESULTS: We identified nine postlaryngectomy and laryngopharyngectomy patients in our institution who underwent secondary TEP with VP insertion using flexible esophagoscopy and multidisciplinary intra-operative involvement. All patients had pharyngeal reconstruction, including radial forearm free flap (n = 4), pectoralis major rotational flap (n = 3), and anterolateral thigh flap (n = 2). Eight out of nine patients underwent adjuvant radiotherapy. The technique was successfully performed in all patients. There were three cases of early TEP displacement in two patients, of which one patient had a successful repeat procedure. We found the technique advantageous in terms of feasibility and practicality compared to the conventional approach, and without intraoperative difficulties encountered in achieving the desired field of views or navigating the challenging anatomy in a free flap and post-radiotherapy patients. This includes distorted cervical anatomy, the presence of bulky and hair-bearing flap skin, and stricture formation. Minor complications in our cohort included pharyngo-esophageal spasm, TEP displacement, granulation tissue, and peri-prosthetic leaks. CONCLUSION: Our multidisciplinary approach to secondary TEP was performed with flexible esophagoscopy without major related complications. The technique is advantageous in the surgical approach to VP insertion in postlaryngectomy and laryngopharyngectomy patients who have had radiotherapy or pharyngeal reconstruction. It allows for safe anatomical insertion and thorough evaluation of the upper aerodigestive tract for comorbid benign or malignant esophageal pathology.","output":"A Multidisciplinary Approach to Secondary Tracheoesophageal Puncture for Voice Prosthesis Insertion Using Flexible Esophagoscopy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: For unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the standard therapy consists of chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by durvalumab maintenance for responding patients. The present study reports on the safety and outcome of durvalumab use after CRT in a real-world, multicenter, retrospective cohort. METHODS: Two hundred thirty-eight patients have been included. We collected data on systemic therapy, radiation therapy, the timing between CRT and durvalumab, number of durvalumab cycles, reasons for non-starting or discontinuation, incidence and grade of adverse events (AEs), and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five patients out of 238 (65.1%) received at least one durvalumab dose: 91 (58.7%) after concomitant CRT (cCRT) and 64 (41.3%) after sequential CRT (sCRT). Programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status was unknown in 7/155 (4.5%), negative in 14 (9.1%), and positive 1% in 134/155 (86.4%). The main reasons for non-starting durvalumab were progression (10.1%), PD-L1 negativity (7.5%), and lung toxicity (4.6%). Median follow-up time was 14 months (range 2C29); 1-year PFS and OS were 83.5% (95%CI: 77.6C89.7) and 97.2% (95%CI: 94.6C99.9), respectively. No significant differences in PFS or OS were detected for cCRT vs. sCRT, but the median PFS was 13.5 months for sCRT vs. 23 months for cCRT. Potentially immune-related AEs were recorded in 76/155 patients (49.0%). Pneumonitis was the most frequent, leading to discontinuation in 11/155 patients (7.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Durvalumab maintenenace after concurrent or sequential chemoradiation for unresectable, stage III NSCLC showed very promising short-term survival results in a large, multicenter, restrospective, real-world study. Durvalumab was the first drug obtaining a survival benefit over CRT within the past two decades, and the present study contributes to validating its use in clinical practice.","output":"A Real-World, Multicenter, Observational Retrospective Study of Durvalumab After Concomitant or Sequential Chemoradiation for Unresectable Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data on patient-related factors associated with pneumothorax among critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is limited Reports of spontaneous pneumothorax in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) suggest that the COVID-19 infection could itself cause pneumothorax in addition to the ventilator-induced trauma among mechanically ventilated patients Here, we report a case series of five mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 infection who developed pneumothorax Consecutive cases of intubated patients in the intensive care unit with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and pneumothorax were included Data on their demographics, preexisting risk factors, laboratory workup, imaging findings, treatment, and survival were collected retrospectively between March and July 2020 Four out of five patients (4/5;80%) had a bilateral pneumothorax, while one had a unilateral pneumothorax Of the four patients with bilateral pneumothorax, three (3/4;75%) had secondary bacterial pneumonia, two had pneumomediastinum and massive subcutaneous emphysema, and one of these two had an additional pneumoperitoneum A surgical chest tube or pigtail catheter was placed for the management of pneumothorax Three out of five patients with pneumothorax died (3/5;60%), and all of them had bilateral involvement The data from these cases suggest that pneumothorax is a potentially fatal complication of COVID-19 infection Large prospective studies are needed to study the incidence of pneumothorax and its sequelae in patients with COVID-19 infection [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Case Reports in Critical Care is the property of Hindawi Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Pneumothorax in Mechanically Ventilated Patients with COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serosurveillance of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is lagging due to concerns regarding testing performance and interpretation of what represents protective immunity.

OBJECTIVE To assess the geographical distribution of PCa, epidemiological differences, and the most relevant risk factors for the disease. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION Estimated incidence, mortality, and prevalence of PCa for the year 2020 in 185 countries were derived from the IARC GLOBOCAN database. A review of English-language articles published between 2010 and 2020 was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus to identify risk factors for PCa. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS In the year 2020, there were over 1414000 estimated new cases of PCa worldwide, with an age-standardized rate (ASR) incidence of 31 per 100000 (lifetime cumulative risk: 3.9%). Northern Europe has the highest all-age incidence ASR (83), while the lowest ASR was in South-Central Asia (6.3). In the year 2020, there were over 375000 estimated deaths worldwide, and the overall mortality ASR was 7.7 per 100000, with the highest ASR in the Caribbean (28) and the lowest in South-Central Asia (3.1). Family history, hereditary syndromes, and race are the strongest risk factors for PCa. Metabolic syndrome was associated with the risk of developing PCa, high-grade disease, and adverse pathology. Diabetes and exposure to ultraviolet rays were found to be inversely associated to PCa incidence. Cigarette smoking and obesity may increase PCa-specific mortality, while regular physical activity may reduce disease progression. Although 5-alpha reductase inhibitors are known to be associated with a reduced incidence of PCa, available studies failed to show an effect on overall mortality. CONCLUSIONS Family history, race, and hereditary syndromes are well-established risk factors for PCa. Modifiable risk factors may impact the risk of developing PCa and that of dying from the disease, but little evidence exist for any clear indication for prevention other than early diagnosis to reduce PCa mortality.

South-Central Asia has the lowest epidemiological burden. Family history, race, and hereditary syndromes are well-established risk factors for PCa.

However, the role of Fc-mediated functions in the efficacious in-vivo neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet clear, and it is of high importance to delineate the role this process plays in antibody-mediated protection. Toward this aim, we have chosen two highly potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies, MD65 and BLN1 that target distinct domains of the spike (RBD and NTD, respectively).

In this cross-sectional analysis of data collected at baseline, we examined SARS-CoV-2 infection status (as determined by presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in oropharyngeal swabs) by healthcare worker status and role. RESULTS: At baseline, 41 (5.0%) of the participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, of whom 14 (34.2%) reported symptoms.

(practice point). GUIDELINE 2A Identification of fast peritoneal solute transfer rate (PSTR): It is recommended that the PSTR is determined from a 4-h peritoneal equilibration test (PET), using either 2.5%/2.27% or 4.25%/3.86% dextrose/glucose concentration and creatinine as the index solute. (practice point) This should be done early in the course dialysis treatment (between 6 weeks and 12 weeks) (GRADE 1A) and subsequently when clinically indicated. (practice point). GUIDELINE 2B Clinical implications and mitigation of fast solute transfer: A faster PSTR is associated with lower survival on PD. (GRADE 1A) This risk is in part due to the lower ultrafiltration (UF) and increased net fluid reabsorption that occurs when the PSTR is above the average value. The resulting lower net UF can be avoided by shortening glucose-based exchanges, using a polyglucose solution (icodextrin), and/or prescribing higher glucose concentrations. (GRADE 1A) Compared to glucose, use of icodextrin can translate into improved fluid status and fewer episodes of fluid overload. (GRADE 1A) Use of automated PD and icodextrin may mitigate the mortality risk associated with fast PSTR. (practice point). GUIDELINE 3 Recognizing low UF capacity: This is easy to measure and a valuable screening test. Insufficient UF should be suspected when either (a) the net UF from a 4-h PET is <400 ml (3.86% glucose/4.25% dextrose) or <100 ml (2.27% glucose /2.5% dextrose), (GRADE 1B) and/or (b) the daily UF is insufficient to maintain adequate fluid status. (practice point) Besides membrane dysfunction, low UF capacity can also result from mechanical problems, leaks or increased fluid absorption across the peritoneal membrane not explained by fast PSTR. GUIDELINE 4A Diagnosing intrinsic membrane dysfunction (manifesting as low osmotic conductance to glucose) as a cause of UF insufficiency: When insufficient UF is suspected, the 4-h PET should be supplemented by measurement of the sodium dip at 1 h using a 3.86% glucose/4.25% dextrose exchange for diagnostic purposes. A sodium dip 5 mmol/L and/or a sodium sieving ratio 0.03 at 1 h indicates UF insufficiency. (GRADE 2B). GUIDELINE 4B Clinical implications of intrinsic membrane dysfunction (de novo or acquired): in the absence of residual kidney function, this is likely to necessitate the use of hypertonic glucose exchanges and possible transfer to haemodialysis. Acquired membrane injury, especially in the context of prolonged time on treatment, should prompt discussions about the risk of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis. (practice point). GUIDELINE 5 Additional membrane function tests: measures of peritoneal protein loss, intraperitoneal pressure and more complex tests that estimate osmotic conductance and 'lymphatic' reabsorption are not recommended for routine clinical practice but remain valuable research methods. (practice point). GUIDELINE 6 Socioeconomic considerations: When resource constraints prevent the use of routine tests, consideration of membrane function should still be part of the clinical management and may be inferred from the daily UF in response to the prescription.

We undertook a study to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the Widal test and the Typhidot immunoassay in patients suspected of having typhoid fever in the Menoua division, West Region of Cameroon. METHODS: Blood and stool samples were collected from 558 consenting febrile patients on the basis of suspicion of typhoid fever. These patients attended three district health services of the Menoua division between April 2018 and September 2019. These patients had clinical symptoms suggestive of typhoid fever as determined by their consultant. Serum was used for the Widal slide agglutination test and for the Typhidot rapid immunoassay test based on manufacturer's guidelines. A composite reference of fever plus positive coproculture for Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi was used as the reference. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the positive and negative tests were calculated as well as Cohen's kappa for agreement between the two tests. RESULTS: Of 558 patients, 12.90% tested positive for the reference method, 57.17% tested positive for the Widal slide agglutination test, while 15.59% were positive for Typhidot-IgM. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the positive and negative tests were 80.56%, 94.03%, 66.6%, and 97.03% for Typhidot-IgM and 94.44%, 48.35%, 21.32%, and 98.33% for the Widal slide agglutination test, respectively.

We assessed NIHSSo, occlusion type (cardioembolism vs atherosclerosis), occlusion level (supraclinoid-terminal, petrocavernous, or bulb-cervical), recanalization degree (TICI), and efficacy of recanalization (protective flow arrest vs nonprotection) leading to better outcome. RESULTS Successful recanalization (TICI  2) was obtained in 90% of patients and good recovery (mRS  2) in 60% of patients. Good outcome was related to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission (P < .001), TICI (P < .007), occlusion type (P = .022), and occlusion level (P = .038). Poor initial patient status, less recanalization, cardioembolism, and supraclinoid-terminal occlusion were associated with poor prognosis.

Prenatal education and breastfeeding may reduce the risk of diabetes in mothers and offspring. The rates of breastfeeding initiation and participation in the prenatal program are low in FN communities. Methods A prenatal educational website, social media-assisted prenatal chat groups and community support teams were developed in three rural or remote FN communities in Manitoba. The rates of participation of pregnant women in prenatal programs and breastfeeding initiation were compared before and after the start of the remote prenatal education program within 2014-2017. Findings The participation rate of FN pregnant women in rural or remote communities in the prenatal program and breastfeeding initiation during 1-year after the start of the community-based remote prenatal education program were significantly increased compared to that during 1-year before the start of the program (54% versus 36% for the participation rate, 50% versus 34% for breastfeeding initiation, p &lt; 0001). Availability of high-speed Wi-Fi and/or postpartum supporting team were associated with favorite study outcomes. Positive feedback on the remote prenatal education was received from participants. Interpretation The findings suggest that remote prenatal education is feasible and effective for improving the breastfeeding rate and engaging pregnant women to participate in the prenatal program in rural or remote FN communities. The remote prenatal education remained active during COVID-19 in the participating communities, which suggests an advantage to expand remote prenatal education in other Indigenous communities.

Experimental studies, however, have mostly focused on evaluating outcomes for a single interacting partner at a single location. Studies that evaluate spatial variation in the bidirectional effects between co-flowering species are necessary if we aim to advance our understanding of the processes that mediate species coexistence in diverse co-flowering communities. Here, we examine geographic variation (i.e. at landscape level) in bidirectional pollinator-mediated effects between co-flowering Mimulus guttatus and Delphinium uliginosum. We evaluated effects on pollen transfer dynamics (conspecific and heterospecific pollen deposition) and plant reproductive success. We found evidence of asymmetrical effects (one species is disrupted and the other one is facilitated) but the effects were highly dependent on geographical location. Furthermore, effects on pollen transfer dynamics did not always translate to effects on overall plant reproductive success (i.e. pollen tube growth) highlighting the importance of evaluating effects at multiple stages of the pollination process. Overall, our results provide evidence of a spatial mosaic of pollinator-mediated interactions between co-flowering species and suggest that community assembly processes could result from competition and facilitation acting simultaneously. Our study highlights the importance of experimental studies that evaluate the prevalence of competitive and facilitative interactions in the field, and that expand across a wide geographical context, in order to more fully understand the mechanisms that shape plant communities in nature.","output":"Spatial variation in bidirectional pollinator-mediated interactions between two co-flowering species in serpentine plant communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we study robust necessary optimality conditions for a nondifferentiable complex fractional programming with uncertain data.

RECENT FINDINGS: Many studies have shown that axSpA patients - both patients in their nonradiological and radiological stage - respond similarly well to biologic treatment and these patients should be seen as having the same disease at different stages. AxSpA respond best to TNF-blocker - and probably also to other biologics - if the disease duration is short and if objective parameters of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein or MRI are positive. Primary aim of treatment is to reach and maintain clinical remission. Once remission is achieved, it can be maintained by continuing treatment, and in a proportion of yet not well defined patients the drug dose can be reduced without inducing a flare. The recent demonstration of a good efficacy, in addition to TNF blockers, also of IL-17 inhibitors and JAK-inhibitors in axSpA patients raises the question how to select the best patients for the best treatment. Radiographic progression can best be stopped by effectively suppressing inflammation, whether different drugs have here a different effect has still to be defined. More sensitive measurements of radiographic progression are urgently needed. SUMMARY: Reaching and maintaining clinical remission and preventing structural bony damage is the primary treatment target in patients with axSpA.

The preparation of copper or copper-coated nanofibers can be pretty challenging, requiring many chemical steps that we eliminated in our robust approach, where for the first time, Cu was deposited by magnetron sputtering onto temperature-sensitive polymer nanofibers. For the first time, the large-scale modeling of PCL films irradiation by molecular dynamics simulation was performed and allowed to predict the ions penetration depth and tune the deposition conditions. The Cu-coated polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibers were thoroughly characterized and tested as antibacterial agents for various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Fast release of Cu(2+) ions (concentration up to 3.4 g/mL) led to significant suppression of E. coli and S. aureus colonies but was insufficient against S. typhimurium and Ps. aeruginosa. The effect of Cu layer oxidation upon contact with liquid media was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealing that, after two hours, 55% of Cu atoms are in form of CuO or Cu(OH)(2). The Cu-coated nanofibers will be great candidates for wound dressings thanks to an interesting synergistic effect: on the one hand, the rapid release of copper ions kills bacteria, while on the other hand, it stimulates the regeneration with the activation of immune cells. Indeed, copper ions are necessary for the bacteriostatic action of cells of the immune system. The reactive CO(2)/C(2)H(4) plasma polymers deposited onto PCL-Cu nanofibers can be applied to grafting of viable proteins, peptides, or drugs, and it further explores the versatility of developed nanofibers for biomedical applications use.","output":"Electrospun Biodegradable Nanofibers Coated Homogenously by Cu Magnetron Sputtering Exhibit Fast Ion Release.

This study aimed to evaluate the association between preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing and postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing elective cancer surgery. METHODS: This international cohort study included adult patients undergoing elective surgery for cancer in areas affected by SARS-CoV-2 up to 19 April 2020. Patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection before operation were excluded. The primary outcome measure was postoperative pulmonary complications at 30 days after surgery. Preoperative testing strategies were adjusted for confounding using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Of 8784 patients (432 hospitals, 53 countries), 2303 patients (26.2 per cent) underwent preoperative testing: 1458 (16.6 per cent) had a swab test, 521 (5.9 per cent) CT only, and 324 (3.7 per cent) swab and CT. Pulmonary complications occurred in 3.9 per cent, whereas SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 2.6 per cent. After risk adjustment, having at least one negative preoperative nasopharyngeal swab test (adjusted odds ratio 0.68, 95 per cent confidence interval 0.68 to 0.98; P = 0.040) was associated with a lower rate of pulmonary complications. Swab testing was beneficial before major surgery and in areas with a high 14-day SARS-CoV-2 case notification rate, but not before minor surgery or in low-risk areas. To prevent one pulmonary complication, the number needed to swab test before major or minor surgery was 18 and 48 respectively in high-risk areas, and 73 and 387 in low-risk areas. CONCLUSION: Preoperative nasopharyngeal swab testing was beneficial before major surgery and in high SARS-CoV-2 risk areas.

By 26 April 2020, more than 2.9 million people were infected by SARS-CoV-2 and over 203 thousand people lost their life globally. By 26 April 2020, 107773 confirmed cases were reported in Turkey with 2706 deaths. Majority of the cases in Turkey has been observed in Istanbul. In the world, the duration of availability of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be significantly longer in stool samples than in respiratory and serum samples [2]. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in wastewaters in Australia [3], Netherlands [4], USA [5], France [6], Spain [7] and USA [8] by using different virus concentration techniques. In this work, Istanbul metropole with 65 % of Covid-19 cases was chosen as the pilot city. On the 21st of April 2020, 24-hr composite samples were collected from the Ambarli, Pasakoy and Kadikoy wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). On the 25th of April 2020, more wastewater samples were taken from Terkos, Buyukcekmece, Baltalimani and Tuzla WWTPs. These wastewater treatment plants were selected among 81 plants in Istanbul in order to take representative samples from 4 different districts of Istanbul according to the severity of Covid-19 cases, like very serious, serious, moderate and mild. Grab samples were also collected from Bagcilar and Kartal manholes located nearby the pandemic hospitals on April 21st, 2020. Polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000) adsorption [5] SARS-Cov-2 concentration method was used for SARS-CoV-2 concentration after optimization. Real time RT-PCR diagnostic panel validated by US was used to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw sewage taken from the inlets of treatment plants and manholes. Five samples out of seven from wastewater and all samples from manholes were tested positive. SARS-CoV-2 in raw sewage from Ambarli, Pasakoy, Kadikoy, Terkos, Buyukcekmece, Baltalimani and Tuzla WWTPs were found as 8.26x103, 1.80x104, ND, ND, 3.73x103, 4.95x103, 2.89x103, respectively. The Bagcilar and Kartal manholes nearby pandemic hospitals exhibited 4.49x104 and 9.33x104, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 virus titers of manhole were higher than those of inlet of WWTPs. The observed copy numbers were presented against the number of Covid-19 cases coming to the WWTP per treatment plant capacity. Quantitative measurements of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can be used as a tool in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) and it can provide information about SARS-CoV-2 distribution in wastewater of various districts of Istanbul which exhibit different scores of Covid-19 cases. The distribution of epidemy was followed not only with blood test but with wastewater monitoring. This may allow us to identify the districts not exhibiting many Covid-19 cases, but under high risk.

FINDINGS: Using front of face ITIS for prediction of tympanic temperature 37.8C, the area under the ROC curve was 0.86 (95%CI 0.75C0.97) and setting sensitivity at 86% gave specificity of 71%. The PPV in this population of travellers, of whom 0.5% were febrile using this definition, was 1.5%. We identified influenza virus infection in 30 travellers (3 Type A and 27 Type B). For ITIS prediction of influenza infection the area under the ROC curve was 0.66 (0.56C0.75), a sensitivity of 87% gave specificity of 39%, and PPV of 2.8%. None of the 30 influenza-positive travellers had tympanic temperature 37.8C at screening (95%CI 0% to 12%); three had no influenza symptoms. CONCLUSION: ITIS performed moderately well in detecting fever but in this study, during a seasonal epidemic of predominantly influenza type B, the proportion of influenza-infected travellers who were febrile was low and ITIS were not much better than chance at identifying travellers likely to be influenza-infected. Although febrile illness is more common in influenza A infections than influenza B infections, many influenza A infections are afebrile. Our findings therefore suggest that ITIS is unlikely to be effective for entry screening of travellers to detect influenza infection with the intention of preventing entry of the virus into a country.","output":"Thermal Image Scanning for Influenza Border Screening: Results of an Airport Screening Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heterogeneity in number of deaths in different countries during the ongoing nCOVID crisis challenged us to look for determinants of pandemic death toll across the world.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic potentially affected prenatal care quality and maternal and fetal outcomes globally. What is added by this report? During COVID-19 pandemic period, the rates of caesarean sections (CS) and preterm birth for uninfected pregnant women increased slightly in areas that were relatively severely impacted by the pandemic in China. The overall number of prenatal examinations did not dramatically decrease, while the eligible examinations significantly decreased in Hubei Province. What are the implications for public health practice? Routine prenatal examinations had been well maintained during the pandemic period in China. In the future, in-time prenatal examinations should be provided to improve the quality of screening and management of high-risk pregnancy under pandemic-affected circumstances. Psychological counseling and transfer treatment channels should be strengthened for pregnant women during lockdown period.","output":"Clinical Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic Among the Uninfected Pregnant Women  6 PLADs, China, 2019?2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pandemics have a wide range of economic, health and social consequences related to both the spread of a disease and efforts made by government leaders to contain it which may be particularly detrimental for the child welfare-involved population. This is because child welfare agencies serve some of the highest needs children and families. A significant proportion of these families face economic hardship, and as a result of containment measures for COVID-19, more families inevitably will. OBJECTIVE: Given the range of negative consequences related to the pandemic and the evolving supports available to families, child protection workers needed a clinical tool to guide and support work with families informed by an understanding of economic hardship. The objective of this paper is to report on the development and implementation strategy of a tool to be used for practice intervention during the pandemic. METHODS: Action research methodology was utilized in the creation of the clinical tool. The tools development and implementation occurred through an academic/child welfare sector partnership involving child welfare agencies representing diverse regions and populations in Ontario, Canada. Factor analysis of representative child welfare data from the Ontario Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect 2018 (OIS-2018) on economic hardship was used to inform the development of questions on the clinical tool. RESULTS: The development and implementation strategy of the clinical tool are described, including the results from analyses of the OIS-2018.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to HV-KP is uncommon and details of its clinical and microbiological features are limited. We report the first case of CAP due to capsular genotype K2-ST86 HV-KP in Okinawa, Japan and review infections caused by the K2-ST86 strain. A 79-year-old woman presenting with fever and productive cough persisting for the past three days was admitted to hospital. Her vital signs indicated septic shock. Lung examination by auscultation revealed holo-crackle and lobar pneumonia in chest radiography, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was suspected. However, sputum and blood cultures revealed Gram-negative coccus identified as K. pneumoniae. Genetic analysis identified the isolated strain as the K2 serotype harboring rmpA, iutA, entB, and mrkD. Therefore, we identified the isolated strain as hypervirulent. The isolate belonged to ST86 as determined by multilocus sequence typing. The case was not complicated by predisposing factors such as diabetes mellitus and malignancy related to HV-KP infection; thus, this CAP-causing HV-KP strain may differ from the typical HV-KP strain that induces liver abscess. A literature review identified only nine cases with CAP due to HV-KP. In all cases, the disease mainly occurred in older males with diabetes mellitus, which makes the present case unusual, and had high rates of septic shock and death. No case, including ours, was complicated by metastatic infection, suggesting that CAP due to HV-KP poses little distant metastasis risk, even in patients with bloodstream infection. In our review, consistent with our case, K2-ST86 was the most common strain of HV-KP in patients with CAP. Therefore, studies are needed to elucidate the clinical and microbiological features of HV-KP CAP, with a focus on the K2-ST86 strain.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of pneumocytes, the hallmark of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) involving both alveolar interstitium and capillaries, is linked to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding and its functional downregulation. ACE2 is a key enzyme for the balance between the two main arms of the RAS: the ACE/angiotensin (Ang) II/Ang II type 1 receptor axis (classic RAS) and the ACE2/Ang(1C7)/Mas receptor (MasR) axis (anti-RAS). The ACE2 downregulation, as a result of SARS-coronaviruses binding, enhances the classic RAS, leading to lung damage and inflammation with leaky pulmonary blood vessels and fibrosis, when the attenuation mediated by the anti-RAS arm is reduced. ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) and Ang II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB), effective in cardiovascular diseases, were found to prevent and counteract acute lung injury in several experimental models by restoring the balance between these two opposing arms. The evidence of RAS arm disequilibrium in COVID-19 and the hypothesis of a beneficial role of RAS modulation supported by preclinical and clinical studies are the focus of the present review. Preclinical and clinical studies on drugs balancing RAS arms might be the right way to counter COVID-19.","output":"Disequilibrium between the classic renin-angiotensin system and its opposing arm in SARS-CoV-2-related lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the recent, Corona Virus epidemic (COVID-19) increases day-to-day from one individual to another because of contact transmission and COVID-19 is created by the SARS-CoV-2. Identifying and stopping the spreading of contagious epidemic such as COVID-19 is important to handling diseases. One major part contracted to find and detect their previous connections so as to then carefully dissociate any persons likely to have been affected and accommodate dispersion is to find out or explore more transmissible persons. These previous connections can be traced using smart machine such as smart watches and smart phones, which can frequently find and collect the connections and location of their infected ones through their embedded transmissions and localization methodologies or technologies, such as Global Positioning System (GPS) location-based navigation rule, Wi-Fi, biological connections, and Bluetooth.

Our aim was to evaluate burnout in primary care physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as associated contributing factors. METHODS: Cross-sectional study with an online questionnaire disseminated through social media, applying the snowball technique. The target population was primary care physicians working in Portugal during the first outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to sociodemographic data, the questionnaire collected responses to the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI), the Resilience Scale and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21). Data were collected from May 9 to June 8, 2020, a period comprising the declaration of a national calamity and then state of emergency, and the subsequent ease of lockdown measures. Levels of burnout in 3 different dimensions (personal, work, and patient-related), resilience, stress, depression, and anxiety were assessed. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with burnout levels. RESULTS: Among the 214 physician respondents, burnout levels were high in the 3 dimensions. A strong association was found between gender, years of professional experience, depression and anxiety, and burnout levels.

It is widely believed that cannabis, or its main psychoactive component (9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), impairs working memory, i.e., the ability to temporarily hold information in mind. However, our review of the literature yielded surprisingly little empirical support for an effect of THC or cannabis on working memory. We thus conducted a study with three main goals: (1) quantify the effect of THC on visual working memory in a well-powered sample, (2) test the potential role of cognitive effects (mind wandering and metacognition) in disrupting working memory, and (3) demonstrate how insufficient sample size and task duration reduce the likelihood of detecting a drug effect. We conducted two double-blind, randomized crossover experiments in which healthy adults (N = 23, 23) performed a reliable and validated visual working memory task (the Discrete Whole Report task, 90 trials) after administration of THC (7.5 and/or 15 mg oral) or placebo. We also assessed self-reported mind wandering (Exp 1) and metacognitive accuracy about ongoing task performance (Exp 2). THC impaired working memory performance (d = 0.65), increased mind wandering (Exp 1), and decreased metacognitive accuracy about task performance (Exp 2). Thus, our findings indicate that THC does impair visual working memory, and that this impairment may be related to both increased mind wandering and decreased monitoring of task performance. Finally, we used a down-sampling procedure to illustrate the effects of task length and sample size on power to detect the acute effect of THC on working memory.","output":"(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) impairs visual working memory performance: a randomized crossover trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with COVID-19 are increasingly reported to suffer from a wide range of neurological complications, affecting both the central and peripheral nervous system.

In an endeavor to understand the pathogenic mechanisms, extensive experimental studies have been conducted across the globe involving cell culture-based experiments, human tissue organoids, and animal models, targeted to various aspects of the disease, viz., viral properties, tissue tropism and organ-specific pathogenesis, involvement of physiological systems, and the human immune response against the infection. The vastly accumulated scientific knowledge on all aspects of COVID-19 has currently changed the scenario from great despair to hope. Even though spectacular progress has been made in all of these aspects, multiple knowledge gaps are remaining that need to be addressed in future studies. Moreover, multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have emerged across the globe since the onset of the first COVID-19 wave, with seemingly greater transmissibility/virulence and immune escape capabilities than the wild-type strain.

On multivariable analysis, AICIDs were not significantly associated with severe COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9-1.8). Among patients with AICID, use of biologics or nonbiologic immunosuppressives did not increase the risk of severe COVID-19. In contrast, systemic corticosteroid use was significantly associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 (aOR 6.8, 95% CI: 2.5-18.4). CONCLUSION: Patients with AICID are not at increased risk of severe COVID-19 with the exception of those on corticosteroids. These data suggest that patients with AICID should continue on biologic and nonbiologic immunosuppression but limit steroids during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Autoimmune and Chronic Inflammatory Disease Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 5G Release 17 specific work items are dealing with medical applications.

Based on initial data from the UK and later data from other countries, this variant was estimated to have a transmission fitness advantage of around 40C80 % (Volz et al., 2021; Leung et al., 2021; Davies et al., 2021). AIM: This study aims to estimate the transmission fitness advantage and the effective reproductive number of B.1.1.7 through time based on data from Switzerland. METHODS: We generated whole genome sequences from 11.8 % of all confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Switzerland between 14 December 2020 and 11 March 2021. Based on these data, we determine the daily frequency of the B.1.1.7 variant and quantify the variants transmission fitness advantage on a national and a regional scale. RESULTS: We estimate B.1.1.7 had a transmission fitness advantage of 43C52 % compared to the other variants circulating in Switzerland during the study period. Further, we estimate B.1.1.7 had a reproductive number above 1 from 01 January 2021 until the end of the study period, compared to below 1 for the other variants. Specifically, we estimate the reproductive number for B.1.1.7 was 1.24 [1.07C1.41] from 01 January until 17 January 2021 and 1.18 [1.06C1.30] from 18 January until 01 March 2021 based on the whole genome sequencing data. From 10 March to 16 March 2021, once B.1.1.7 was dominant, we estimate the reproductive number was 1.14 [1.00C1.26] based on all confirmed cases. For reference, Switzerland applied more non-pharmaceutical interventions to combat SARS-CoV-2 on 18 January 2021 and lifted some measures again on 01 March 2021. CONCLUSION: The observed increase in B.1.1.7 frequency in Switzerland during the study period is as expected based on observations in the UK. In absolute numbers, B.1.1.7 increased exponentially with an estimated doubling time of around 2C3.5 weeks.

Searching for proteins that modulate this event, we identified factors involved in the 3' end processing of polyadenylated RNA and components of the Integrator complex. Perturbation experiments established that, by promoting the cleavage of NEAT1_2, Integrator forces NEAT1_2 to NEAT1_1 isoform switching and, thereby, restrains PS assembly. Consistently, low levels of Integrator subunits correlated with poorer prognosis of cancer patients exposed to chemotherapeutics.

The aim of this study is to delineate the trauma patterns and outcomes at Aintree University Teaching Hospital level 1 Major Trauma Centre (MTC) during the COVID-19 lockdown imposed by the U.K. government. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study data from the Merseyside and Cheshire Trauma Audit and Research Network database were analysed. The 7-week 'lockdown period' was compared to a 7-week period prior to the lockdown and also to an equivalent 7-week period corresponding to the previous year. RESULTS: A total of 488 patients were included in the study. Overall, there was 37.6% and 30.0% reduction in the number of traumatic injuries during lockdown. Road traffic collisions (RTC) reduced by 42.6% and 46.6%. RTC involving a car significantly reduced during lockdown, conversely, bike-related RTC significantly increased. No significant changes were noted in deliberate self-harm, trauma severity and crude mortality during lockdown. There was 1 mortality from COVID-19 infection in the lockdown cohort. CONCLUSION: Trauma continues during lockdown, our MTC has continued to provide a full service during lockdown. However, trauma patterns have changed and departments should adapt to balance these alongside the COVID-19 pandemic.

This evolutionary ancient post-translational modification (PTM) is involved in fundamental processes including DNA repair, inflammation, cell death, differentiation and proliferation, among others. ADP-ribosylation is catalysed by two major families of enzymes: the cholera toxin-like ADP-ribosyl transferases (ARTCs) and the diphtheria toxin-like ADP-ribosyl transferases (ARTDs, also known as PARPs). ARTCs sensor and use extracellular NAD, which may represent a danger signal, whereas ARTDs are present in the cell nucleus and/or cytoplasm. ARTCs mono-ADP-ribosylate their substrates whereas ARTDs, according to the specific family member, are able to mono- or poly-ADP-ribosylate target proteins or are devoid of enzymatic activity. Both mono- and poly-ADP-ribosylation are dynamic processes, as specific hydrolases are able to remove single or polymeric ADP-moieties. This dynamic equilibrium between addition and degradation provides plasticity for fast adaptation, a feature being particularly relevant to immune cell functions. ADP-ribosylation regulates differentiation and functions of myeloid, T and B cells. It also regulates the expression of cytokines and chemokines, production of antibodies, isotype switch and the expression of several immune mediators. Alterations in these processes involve ADP-ribosylation in virtually any acute and chronic inflammatory/immune-mediated disease. Besides, pathogens developed mechanisms to contrast the action of ADP-ribosylating enzymes by using their own hydrolases and/or to exploit this PTM to sustain their virulence. In the present review, we summarize and discuss recent findings on the role of ADP-ribosylation in immunobiology, immune evasion/subversion by pathogens and immune-mediated diseases.","output":"ADP-Ribosylation in evasion, promotion and exacerbation of immune responses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital contact tracing appears as an ideal solution to tackle long-term economic damage due to necessary lockdown measures during a pandemic.

Previous studies have confirmed that MT promotes the normal development of plants under stress by mediating physiological regulation mechanisms. However, the physiological mechanism of exogenous MT regulating seed germination and seedling growth of wheat under salt stress is still unclear. In this study, NaCl stress decreased germination rate and inhibited seedling growth of wheat, but shoot length, root length, and plant weight of SM15 did not change significantly. The addition of 300 M MT in the cultivation solution directly promoted the germination rate of SM15 and ZM18, and lateral root production, but decreased the germination rate of JM22 and inhibited the length of germ and radicle of three varieties under salt stress. For wheat seedling, application of MT could increase proline content, soluble protein, soluble sugar, Ca2+ content, and vital amino acid content in leaves to keep high water content, low level of H2O2 content, and low [K+]/[Na+] ratio. MT increased root vigor and [K+]/[Na+] ratio and decreased H2O2 content in root induced by salt stress. In conclusion, MT enhanced salt tolerance in wheat seeds and seedlings by regulating the synthesis of soluble protein and sugar, ion compartmentation in roots and leaves, enhancement of enzymatic systems, and changes in amino acid levels. Salt resistance varied with different varieties under the same environmental condition. SM15 was a higher salt-resistant variety and JM22 was a salt-sensitive one.

Enfuvirtide is the first entry inhibitor to have been approved for clinical use. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW Relevant information through searches of MEDLINE (1998 to June 2010) and meeting abstracts of major HIV/AIDS conferences (2003 - June 2010) using the search terms 'enfuvirtide', 'T-20' and 'fusion inhibitor'. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN Enfuvirtide blocks HIV fusion to host cells. It works against the different HIV-1 variants but is not active against HIV-2. The recommended dosage of enfuvirtide is 90 mg b.i.d. subcutaneously. The two large Phase III pivotal clinical trials TORO 1 and 2 showed that enfuvirtide is an effective therapeutic option as rescue therapy in combination with other active antiretroviral drugs. Resistance to enfuvirtide is conferred by mutations in the HR1 region of gp41. Single and double mutations have been shown to result in high-level resistance to enfuvirtide. Postmarketing studies have been helpful to define more precisely the place of enfuvirtide in the sequence of antiretroviral therapy. TAKE HOME MESSAGE The emergence of new compounds and new classes of drugs, highly active against multiresistant virus but more convenient to administer than enfuvirtide, will probably prevent the extensive use of enfuvirtide. This drug remains attractive in some subgroups of patients because of its excellent systemic tolerance and the lack of interactions with the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.","output":"Enfuvirtide: from basic investigations to current clinical use."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an urgent need for effective antiviral drugs to alleviate the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Results: We identified 19 papers of interventions delivered in the emergency department, the home, outside of home but outside of clinics and in hospital clinics. The best evidence came from in-home interventions, in particular multisystemic therapy (MST), which proved to be promising alternatives by improving psychological outcomes and decreasing length of inpatient stay. The quality of included studies was low, with less than half being randomised controlled trials and only half of these at low risk of bias. Conclusions: We could not recommend a particular intervention as an alternative to inpatient admission, however our review describes benefits across a range of types of inteventions that might be considered in multi-modal treatments. We also provide recommendations for future research, in particular the evaluation of new interventions as they emerge.","output":"Alternatives to mental health admissions for children and adolescents experiencing mental health crises: a systematic review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Conventional semi-rigid fixation systems in maxillofacial trauma use self-tapping titanium miniscrews (STS) that require preliminary drilling of a pilot hole. Although drill-free miniscrews (DFS) accompany these systems, they have not dominated practice despite their allure of improved screw-bone contact and holding power. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought these DFS to light as they avoid aerosol production. The present study has compared DFS to STS in patients being treated with miniplate fixation for maxillofacial trauma to understand their feasibility for maxillofacial fracture fixation. METHODOLOGY: This prospective caseCcontrol study sampled 16 patients each with zygomaticomaxillary buttress fracture and parasymphysis fracture of the mandible and grouped alternating patients as case (DFS) and control (STS). Intraoperatively duration of fixation, incidence of screw failures and fragment stability; postoperatively occlusion, neurosensory deficits, teeth vitality and infection and removal rates were evaluated at postoperative week 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 using Cramer's V test. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In the 32 patients evaluated, DFS reduced internal fixation time at zygomaticomaxillary buttress (P = 0.001) but not at parasymphysis (P = 0.206). No significant difference in screw failures or fragment stability was observed. Stable occlusion was maintained in all groups with vital teeth and intact neurosensory function, but the summative incidence of infection was significant at week 24 when STS was used at parasymphysis (P = 0.019). DISCUSSION: While DFS may facilitate ease of insertion with a single instrument pick-and-screw-in approach, avoiding thermal osteonecrosis and aerosol production, they fail to confer any other clinical advantage.","output":"Comparative Evaluation of Drill-Free and Self-Tapping Titanium Miniscrews for Semi-Rigid Internal Fixation in Maxillofacial Trauma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Case definitions are vital in a pandemic to effectively identify, isolate, and contact trace, particularly were testing is slow, scant, or not available. While case definitions have been developed in the COVID-19 pandemic, their diagnostic properties have not been adequately assessed. This studys objective is to determine the diagnostic properties of local and World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 case definitions in the large metropolitan area of Mexico City. Methods We calculated the diagnostic properties of five COVID-19 definitions (three of the Mexican government and two of the WHO) using open data of suspected COVID-19 cases in Mexico City from March 24th 2020 until May 15th 2021. Results All 2 564 782 people included in the analysis met the WHO suspected case definition (sensitivity 100%, specificity 0%). The WHO probable case definition was met by 1.2%, while the first and second Mexican suspected case had sensitivities of 61% and specificities of 61 and 67%, respectively. Confirmed case by epidemiological contact had a low sensitivity (32%) but slightly higher specificity (81%). Conclusions Case definitions should maximize sensitivity, especially in a high-transmission area such as Mexico City. The WHO suspected case definition has the potential for detecting most symptomatic cases.

However, the popular inverse-variance weighted (IVW) estimator could be biased in the presence of weak IVs, a common challenge in MR studies. In this article, we develop a novel penalized inverse-variance weighted (pIVW) estimator, which adjusts the original IVW estimator to account for the weak IV issue by using a penalization approach to prevent the denominator of the pIVW estimator from being close to zero. Moreover, we adjust the variance estimation of the pIVW estimator to account for the presence of horizontal pleiotropy. We show that the recently proposed debiased IVW (dIVW) estimator is a special case of our proposed pIVW estimator. We further prove that the pIVW estimator has smaller bias and variance than the dIVW estimator under some regularity conditions. We also conduct extensive simulation studies to demonstrate the performance of the proposed pIVW estimator. Furthermore, we apply the pIVW estimator to estimate the causal effects of five obesity-related exposures on three coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes.

Rat primary CD4 T-cells, but not macrophages, display a profound transcriptional deficit that is ameliorated by transient trans-complementation with the human Tat-interacting protein Cyclin T1 (hCycT1). RESULTS Here, we generated transgenic rats that selectively express hCycT1 in CD4 T-cells and macrophages. hCycT1 expression in rat T-cells boosted early HIV gene expression to levels approaching those in infected primary human T-cells. hCycT1 expression was necessary, but not sufficient, to enhance HIV transcription in T-cells from individual transgenic animals, indicating that endogenous cellular factors are critical co-regulators of HIV gene expression in rats. T-cells from hCD4/hCCR5/hCycT1-transgenic rats did not support productive infection of prototypic wild-type R5 HIV-1 strains ex vivo, suggesting one or more significant limitation in the late phase of the replication cycle in this primary rodent cell type. Remarkably, we identify a replication-competent HIV-1 GFP reporter strain (R7/3 YU-2 Env) that displays characteristics of a spreading, primarily cell-to-cell-mediated infection in primary T-cells from hCD4/hCCR5-transgenic rats. Moreover, the replication of this recombinant HIV-1 strain was significantly enhanced by hCycT1 transgenesis. The viral determinants of this so far unique replicative ability are currently unknown. CONCLUSION Thus, hCycT1 expression is beneficial to de novo HIV infection in a transgenic rat model, but additional genetic manipulations of the host or virus are required to achieve full permissivity.","output":"Human cyclin T1 expression ameliorates a T-cell-specific transcriptional limitation for HIV in transgenic rats, but is not sufficient for a spreading infection of prototypic R5 HIV-1 strains ex vivo."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2, or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 Worldwide, more than 65 million people have been infected with this SARS-CoV-2 virus, and over 1 5 million people have died due to the viral illness Although a tremendous amount of medical progress has been made since its inception, there continues to be ongoing research regarding the pathophysiology, treatments, and vaccines While a vast majority of those infected develop only mild to moderate symptoms, about 5% of people have severe forms of infection resulting in respiratory failure, myocarditis, septic shock, or multi-organ failure Despite maximal cardiopulmonary support and invasive mechanical ventilation, mortality remains high Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remains a valid treatment option when maximal conventional strategies fail Utilization of ECMO in the pandemic is challenging from both resource allocation and ethical standpoints This article reviews the rationale behind its use, current status of utilization, and future considerations for ECMO in critically ill COVID-19 patients","output":"Utilization of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the UK, according to the 1967 Abortion Act, all abortions must be approved by two doctors, reported to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), and be performed by doctors within licensed premises. Removing abortion from the criminal framework could permit new service delivery models. We explore service delivery models in primary care settings that can improve accessibility without negatively impacting the safety and efficiency of abortion services. Novel service delivery models are common in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs) due to resource constraints, and services are sometimes provided by trained, mid-level providers via task-shifting. The aim of this study is to explore the quality of early abortion services provided in primary care of LMICs and explore the potential benefits of extending their application to the UK context. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, Maternity and Infant Care, CINAHL, and HMIC for studies published from September 1994 to February 2020, with search terms nurses, midwives, general physicians, early medical/surgical abortion. We included studies that examined the quality of abortion care in primary care settings of low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), and excluded studies in countries where abortion is illegal, and those of services provided by independent NGOs. We conducted a thematic analysis and narrative synthesis to identify indicators of quality care at structural, process and outcome levels of the Donabedian model. RESULTS: A total of 21 indicators under 8 subthemes were identified to examine the quality of service provision: law and policy, infrastructure, technical competency, information provision, client-provider interactions, ancillary services, complete abortions, client satisfaction. Our analysis suggests that structural, process and outcome indicators follow a mediation pathway of the Donabedian model. This review showed that providing early medical abortion in primary care services is safe and feasible and task-shifting to mid-level providers can effectively replace doctors in providing abortion. CONCLUSION: The way services are organised in LMICs, using a task-shifted and decentralised model, results in high quality services that should be considered for adoption in the UK.

METHODS All patients with carcinoid HD that underwent cardiac CT, either preoperatively or for assessment of coronary arteries, between Apr-2006 and Dec-2019 at the Royal Free Hospital, UK, were reviewed. RESULTS Of 32 patients with carcinoid HD, 29 (91%) had heart valve involvement. Abnormalities of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves were present in all patients, affecting all three leaflets in 23/26 (89%) unoperated patients for both valves. The aortic valve was affected in 4/29 (14%) patients and the mitral valve in 5/29 (17%). Left heart valves were affected in 6/29 (21%) patients. One patient (1/29; 3%) had all four valves affected. Severe changes with significant valvular regurgitation were seen in 75% of patients with tricuspid, pulmonary, and aortic valve abnormalities. Three patients had carcinoid myocardial metastases (3/32; 9%) and one patient had constrictive pericarditis (1/32; 3%). Ten patients had surgery of whom four (40%) had invasive coronary angiography preoperatively. Ten patients had a patent foramen ovale. Cardiac CT allowed an accurate assessment of damage to different leaflets/cusps, particularly of the pulmonary valve, where visualization with echocardiography was often (3/8; 38%) incomplete.

Developing rapid and sensitive diagnostic tools is key for successful patient management and curbing disease spread. Currently available diagnostics are very specific and sensitive but time-consuming and require expensive laboratory settings and well-trained personnel; thus, they are not available in resource-limited areas, for the purposes of large-scale screenings and in case of outbreaks and epidemics. Developing new, rapid, and affordable point-of-care diagnostic assays is urgently needed. This review focuses on CRISPR-based technologies and their perspectives to become platforms for point-of-care nucleic acid detection methods and as deployable diagnostic platforms that could help to identify and curb outbreaks and emerging epidemics. We describe the mechanisms and function of different classes and types of CRISPR-Cas systems, including pros and cons for developing molecular diagnostic tests and applications of each type to detect a wide range of infectious agents. Many Cas proteins (Cas3, Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, Cas14 etc.) have been leveraged to create highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic tools combined with technologies of signal amplification and fluorescent, potentiometric, colorimetric, lateral flow assay detection and other. In particular, the most advanced platforms -- SHERLOCK/v2, DETECTR, CARMEN or CRISPR-Chip -- enable detection of attomolar amounts of pathogenic nucleic acids with specificity comparable to that of PCR but with minimal technical settings. Further developing CRISPR-based diagnostic tools promises to dramatically transform molecular diagnostics, making them easily affordable and accessible virtually anywhere in the world. The burden of socially significant diseases, frequent outbreaks, recent epidemics (MERS, SARS and the ongoing COVID-19) and outbreaks of zoonotic viruses (African Swine Fever Virus etc.) urgently need the developing and distribution of express-diagnostic tools.

Traditionally, FCR take place in the patients room; however, due the COVID-19 pandemic, entering patient rooms was no longer advisable in order to maintain physical distancing and preserve personal protective equipment (PPE). Therefore, it became clear early in our pandemic response that a new process was required to ensure the benefits of FCR were maintained given their paramount importance to safe and quality patient care. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to virtualize the in-person FCR process used by our pediatric inpatient medicine teams to improve safety and reduce PPE costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN/METHODS: We quickly identified available hardware (laptops, tablets) and video conferencing software, assembled a multidisciplinary project team and secured administrative and quality improvement support. Quality improvement methodology and participatory design were used to develop and refine our virtual family-centered rounds (vFCR) standard work, and on April 6, 2020 we launched our first vFCR. Over the next 3 months we engaged in a series of plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles to iteratively improve our process: nurse auditors attended vFCR daily then met with our project team to review data and observations, and real-time feedback was sought from patients and caregivers. RESULTS: Data collected on 1792 vFCR between April 6 and July 31, 2020 revealed 74% of nurses, physicians and trainees were satisfied or very satisfied with vFCR and 88% felt they had a good understanding of the patient care plan after vFCR. 79% of patients and caregivers were satisfied or very satisfied with vFCR and 88% of caregivers felt like a valued member of their childs care team. We met our target of 10 minutes per patient in 74% of vFCR with an average transition time of <3 minutes between patients. Patients and caregivers felt vFCR were collaborative, more private and less intimidating than in-person FCR, and some even preferred the virtual approach. CONCLUSION: During this pilot, we achieved a standardized vFCR workflow that is safe, feasible, efficient and confidential, with high levels of stakeholder satisfaction and support. vFCR was highly valued by families and yielded unanticipated benefits. Based on current usage, vFCR are saving ~$36,000 monthly in PPE. The importance of this work during the COVID-19 pandemic is clear, but also has benefits in non-pandemic times, including allowing caregivers to participate in FCR when they cannot be at the bedside, enhancing FCR confidentiality, and improving communication and care for isolated patients. Furthermore, the vFCR process is easily adaptable to other inpatient workflows such as consults and multi-disciplinary meetings. We believe this virtual care model is both highly relevant and transferable to a variety of health care settings across Canada and beyond.

Belonging to diverse families, respiratory viruses differ in how easy they spread (transmissibility) and the mechanism (modes) of transmission. Transmissibility as estimated by the basic reproduction number (R0) or secondary attack rate is heterogeneous for the same virus. Respiratory viruses can be transmitted via four major modes of transmission: direct (physical) contact, indirect contact (fomite), (large) droplets and (fine) aerosols. We know little about the relative contribution of each mode to the transmission of a particular virus in different settings, and how its variation affects transmissibility and transmission dynamics. Discussion on the particle size threshold between droplets and aerosols and the importance of aerosol transmission for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus is ongoing. Mechanistic evidence supports the efficacies of non-pharmaceutical interventions with regard to virus reduction; however, more data are needed on their effectiveness in reducing transmission. Understanding the relative contribution of different modes to transmission is crucial to inform the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the population. Intervening against multiple modes of transmission should be more effective than acting on a single mode.","output":"Transmissibility and transmission of respiratory viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is facing an unprecedented global pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 In the absence /of a specific therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19 patients, the present study aimed to virtually screen out /the effective drug candidates from the approved main protease protein (MPP) inhibitors and their /derivatives for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Here, drug repurposing and molecular docking were /employed to screen approved MPinhibitors and their derivatives The approved MPinhibitors against /HIV and HCV were prioritized, whilst hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, remdesivir, and alpha-ketoamide /were studied as control The target drug surface hotspot was also investigated through the molecular /docking technique ADME analysis was conducted to understand the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness /of the screened MPinhibitors The result of this study revealed that Paritaprevir (-10 9 kcal/mol), and its /analog (CID 131982844)(-16 3 kcal/mol) showed better binding affinity than the approved MPinhibitor /compared in this study including favipiravir, remdesivir, and alpha-ketoamide A comparative study among /the screened putative MPinhibitors revealed that amino acids T25, T26, H41, M49, L141, N142, G143, /C145, H164, M165, E166, D187, R188, and Q189 are at critical positions for becoming the surface hotspot /in the MPof SARS-CoV-2 The study also suggested that paritaprevir and its' analog (CID 131982844), /may be effective against SARS-CoV-2 as these molecules had the common drug-surface hotspots on the /main protease protein of SARS-CoV-2 Other pharmacokinetic parameters also indicate that paritaprevir /and its toanalog (CID 131982844) will be either similar or better-repurposed drugs than already approved /MPinhibitors /br /div","output":"Main Protease Inhibitors and Drug Surface Hotspot for the Treatment of COVID-19: Drug Repurposing and Molecular Docking Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Acute stress reaction and Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are psychiatric disorders that develop in some people after traumatic events COVID-19 pandemic can be considered as a huge stress factor and a trigger for the occurrence of stress related disorders [1] Epidemiological studies of PTSD constantly indicate that the response of men and women to acute stress is significantly different -

Their unique working environment also puts them at-risk for physical health issues like obesity, headache, backache, and insomnia. Along with the stress associated with being on the receiving end of difficult calls, call-takers and dispatchers also deal with the pressure and demand of following protocol despite dealing with the variability of complex and stressful situations. METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted using the MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, and PsychInfo databases. RESULTS A total of 25 publications were retrieved by the search strategy. The majority of studies (n = 13; 52%) reported a quantitative methodology, while nine (36%) reported the use of a qualitative research methodology. One study reported a mixed-methods methodology, one reported an evaluability assessment with semi-structured interviews, one reported on a case study, and one was a systematic review with a narrative synthesis. DISCUSSION Challenges to physical health included: shift-work leading to lack of physical activity, poor nutrition, and obesity; outdated and ergonomically ill-fitted equipment, and physically confining and isolating work spaces leading to physical injuries; inadequate breaks leading to fatigue; and high noise levels and poor lighting being correlated with higher cortisol levels. Challenges to mental health included: being exposed to traumatic calls; working in high-pressure environments with little downtime in between stressful calls; inadequate debriefing after stressful calls; inappropriate training for mental-health-related calls; and being exposed to verbally aggressive callers. Lack of support from leadership was an additional source of stress. CONCLUSION Emergency service call-takers and dispatchers experience both physical and mental health challenges as a result of their work, which appears to be related to a range of both operational and support-based issues. Future research should explore the long-term effects of these physical and mental health challenges.","output":"Exploring the Physical and Mental Health Challenges Associated with Emergency Service Call-Taking and Dispatching: A Review of the Literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developing a system to detect online offensive language is very important to the health and the security of online users.

Software simulating viral evolution provides powerful tools for exploring hypotheses of viral systems, especially in situations where thorough empirical data are difficult to obtain or parameters of interest are difficult to measure. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection has no durable cure; this is primarily due to the virus ability to integrate into the genome of host cells, where it can remain in a transcriptionally latent state. An effective cure strategy must eliminate every copy of HIV-1 in this persistent reservoir because proviruses can reactivate, even decades later, to resume an active infection. However, many features of the persistent reservoir remain unclear, including the temporal dynamics of HIV-1 integration frequency and the longevity of the resulting reservoir. Thus, sophisticated analyses are required to measure these features and determine their temporal dynamics. Here, we present software that is an extension of SANTA-SIM to include multiple compartments of viral populations. We used the resulting software to create a model of HIV-1 within host evolution that incorporates the persistent HIV-1 reservoir. This model is composed of two compartments, an active compartment and a latent compartment. With this model, we compared five different date estimation methods (Closest Sequence, Clade, Linear Regression, Least Squares, and Maximum Likelihood) to recover the integration dates of genomes in our models HIV-1 reservoir. We found that the Least Squares method performed the best with the highest concordance (0.80) between real and estimated dates and the lowest absolute error (all pairwise t tests: P < 0.01).

DESIGN: We used an abbreviated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols to identify studies that investigated the effectiveness of travel-related measures preprinted or published by 1 June 2020. RESULTS: We identified 29 studies, of which 26 were modelled. Thirteen studies investigated international measures, while 17 investigated domestic measures (one investigated both). There was a high level of agreement that the adoption of travel measures led to important changes in the dynamics of the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic: the Wuhan measures reduced the number of cases exported internationally by 70%-80% and led to important reductions in transmission within Mainland China. Additional travel measures, including flight restrictions to and from China, may have led to additional reductions in the number of exported cases. Few studies investigated the effectiveness of measures implemented in other contexts. Early implementation was identified as a determinant of effectiveness. Most studies of international travel measures did not account for domestic travel measures thus likely leading to biased estimates. CONCLUSION: Travel measures played an important role in shaping the early transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to address important evidence gaps and also a need to review how evidence is incorporated in the IHR in the early phases of a novel infectious disease outbreak.","output":"Evidence of the effectiveness of travel-related measures during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and response measures, including lockdowns and the reorientation of health services, have disrupted essential health services for other diseases, including TB, HIV and malaria.

During the period of the pandemic of COVID-19, cancer patients should be paid more attention as more severe events are found in cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Basigin (BSG) is an essential factor for the infection and progression of COVID-19 and tumorigenesis of multiple tumors, which may serve as a novel target for the effective treatment against COVID-19 and multiple human cancers. Methods: A total of 19,020 samples from multiple centers were included in our research for the comprehensive investigation of the differences in BSG expression among human organs, cancer cells, cancer tissues, and normal tissues. Cox regression analysis and KaplanCMeier curves were utilized to explore the prognosis factor of BSG in cancers. Correlation analyses were used to determine associations of BSG expression with tumor mutational burden, the immune microenvironment, etc. Gene set enrichment analysis was applied to explore the underlying mechanisms of BSG in cancers. Results: Compared with normal tissues, BSG expression was high in 13 types of cancers (cholangiocarcinoma, etc.) and low in colon adenocarcinoma and rectum adenocarcinoma. BSG expression was related to the prognosis of eight cancers (e.g., invasive breast carcinoma) (p < 0.05). The gene also demonstrated a pronounced effect in identifying 12 cancers (cholangiocarcinoma, etc.) from their control samples (AUC >0.7). The BSG expression was associated with DNA methyltransferases, mismatch repair genes, immune infiltration levels, tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, neoantigen, and immune checkpoints, suggesting the potential of BSG as an exciting target for cancer treatment. BSG may play its role in several cancers by affecting several signaling pathways such as drug cytochrome metabolism P450 and JAK-STAT.

After the injection of LPS, D-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin complex increased and platelet numbers decreased, indicating the activation of coagulation. Microvascular thrombi were found in the liver. Markers of liver injury (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) also increased. Treatment with edoxaban attenuated the changes in the coagulation markers and microvascular thrombus formation in the liver. Edoxaban suppressed the increase in the liver injury markers and reduced the mortality. Edoxaban did not affect the levels of inflammatory cytokines. In conclusions, edoxaban significantly inhibited the activation of coagulation, the formation of microvascular thrombus in the liver and the liver damage, and reduced mortality in rats injected with LPS. These results suggest that the FXa inhibition by edoxaban might be a beneficial therapy for the management of infection-associated thrombosis.","output":"Edoxaban, a direct oral factor Xa inhibitor, ameliorates coagulation, microvascular thrombus formation, and acute liver injury in a lipopolysaccharide-induced coagulopathy model in rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: On 23rd March 2020, the UK government released self-isolation/social distancing guidance to reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The influence such guidance has on sexual activity is not known. AIM: To investigate levels and correlates of sexual activity during COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing in a sample of the UK public. METHODS: This paper presents preplanned interim analyses of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study, administered through an online survey. OUTCOMES: Sexual activity was measured using the following question: \\"On average after self-isolating how many times have you engaged in sexual activity weekly?\\" Demographic and clinical data were collected, including sex, age, marital status, employment, annual household income, region, current smoking status, current alcohol consumption, number of chronic physical conditions, number of chronic psychiatric conditions, any physical symptom experienced during self-isolation, and number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. The association between several factors (independent variables) and sexual activity (dependent variable) was studied using a multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: 868 individuals were included in this study. There were 63.1% of women, and 21.8% of adults who were aged between 25 and 34 years. During self-isolation/social distancing, 39.9% of the population reported engaging in sexual activity at least once per week. Variables significantly associated with sexual activity (dependent variable) were being male, a younger age, being married or in a domestic partnership, consuming alcohol, and a higher number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In this sample of 868 UK adults self-isolating owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of sexual activity was lower than 40%. Those reporting particularly low levels of sexual activity included females, older adults, those not married, and those who abstain from alcohol consumption. STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS: This is the first study to investigate sexual activity during the UK COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing. Participants were asked to self-report their sexual activity potentially introducing self-reporting bias into the findings. Second, analyses were cross-sectional and thus it is not possible to determine trajectories of sexual activity during the current pandemic. CONCLUSION: Interventions to promote health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic should consider positive sexual health messages in mitigating the detrimental health consequences in relation to self-isolation/social distancing and should target those with the lowest levels of sexual activity.

It has been postulated that BCG protection against SARS-CoV-2 has a potential role in the pandemic, through the presence of homologous amino acid sequences. To identify a possible link between BCG vaccination coverage and COVID-19 cases, we used official epidemic data and Ecuadorian Ministry of Health and Pan American Health Organization vaccination information. BCG information before 1979 was available only at a national level. Therefore, projections based on the last 20 years were performed, to compare by specific geographic units. We used a Mann-Kendall test to identify BCG coverage variations, and mapping was conducted with a free geographic information system (QGIS). Nine provinces where BCG vaccine coverage was lower than 74.25% show a significant statistical association (&#967;2 Pearson's = 4.800, df = 1, p = 0.028), with a higher prevalence of cases for people aged 50 to 64 years than in younger people aged 20 to 49 years. Despite the availability of BCG vaccination data and the mathematical models needed to compare these data with COVID-19 cases, our results show that, in geographic areas where BCG coverage was low, 50% presented a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases that were young; thus, low-coverage years were more affected.","output":"COVID-19 Infection and Previous BCG Vaccination Coverage in the Ecuadorian Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in intensive care units suffer from cytokine storm. Although anti-inflammatory therapies are available to treat the problem, very often, these treatments cause immunosuppression. Because angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells serves as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), to delineate a SARS-CoV-2-specific anti-inflammatory molecule, we designed a hexapeptide corresponding to the spike S1-interacting domain of ACE2 receptor (SPIDAR) that inhibited the expression of proinflammatory molecules in human A549 lung cells induced by pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, but not vesicular stomatitis virus. Accordingly, wild-type (wt), but not mutated (m), SPIDAR inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-induced activation of NF-B and expression of IL-6 and IL-1? in human lung cells. However, wtSPIDAR remained unable to reduce activation of NF-B and expression of proinflammatory molecules in lungs cells induced by TNF-, HIV-1 Tat, and viral dsRNA mimic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, indicating the specificity of the effect. The wtSPIDAR, but not mutated SPIDAR, also hindered the association between ACE2 and spike S1 of SARS-CoV-2 and inhibited the entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, but not vesicular stomatitis virus, into human ACE2-expressing human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Moreover, intranasal treatment with wtSPIDAR, but not mutated SPIDAR, inhibited lung activation of NF-B, protected lungs, reduced fever, improved heart function, and enhanced locomotor activities in SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-intoxicated mice.

Methods: Indias health security capacities were reviewed using five indices, i) prevent, ii) detect, iii) respond, iv) enabling function and v) operational readiness using the 2019 score of Indias State Party Annual Report. For subnational analysis, a composite measure is developed for operational readiness capacity for each state using Sustainable Development Goal index score for good health and well-being (SDG3) and indicators of COVID19 preparedness and readiness capacity. Results: India had score 60% for prevent, 90% for detect, 63.3% for respond, 80% for enabling function and 74.4% operational readiness and they were at level 3, 5, 4,5and 4 respectively.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a video-based cognitive-behavioral intervention for reducing COVID-19 anxiety. METHOD: In the present randomized controlled trial, 150 college students with severe COVID-19 anxiety were randomly assigned to either an intervention (n = 75) or a waiting list control (n = 75) group. The intervention group participated in a video-based cognitive-behavioral program consisting of nine 15-20-minute sessions (three days a week for three weeks). Dependent measures included the COVID-19 Anxiety Questionnaire, Short Health Anxiety Inventory, Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3, Somatosensory Amplification Scale, Experience of Parasocial Interaction Scale, and Source Credibility Scale. RESULTS: Participants who were randomly assigned to the cognitive-behavioral program reported high parasocial interaction, source credibility, and satisfaction with the intervention. Eighty percent reported that the video-based intervention was a beneficial alternative to traditional face-to-face therapeutic intervention. At post-treatment evaluation, the video-based cognitive-behavioral intervention group showed a significant reduction in COVID-19 anxiety, health anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, and somatosensory amplification when compared to the wait-listed control group.

This justifies the expansion of the LFS concept to a wider cancer predisposition syndrome designated heritable TP53-related cancer (hTP53rc) syndrome; (ii) the interpretation of germline TP53 variants remains challenging and should integrate epidemiological, phenotypical, bioinformatics prediction, and functional data; (iii) the penetrance of germline disease-causing TP53 variants is variable, depending both on the type of variant (dominant-negative variants being associated with a higher cancer risk) and on modifying factors; (iv) whole-body MRI (WBMRI) allows early detection of tumours in variant carriers and (v) in cancer patients with germline disease-causing TP53 variants, radiotherapy, and conventional genotoxic chemotherapy contribute to the development of subsequent primary tumours. It is critical to perform TP53 testing before the initiation of treatment in order to avoid in carriers, if possible, radiotherapy and genotoxic chemotherapies. In children, the recommendations are to perform clinical examination and abdominal ultrasound every 6 months, annual WBMRI and brain MRI from the first year of life, if the TP53 variant is known to be associated with childhood cancers.

Herein we used lipidomics to study the tissue lipid profiles of 40 patients with SqCC. Methods: Lipidomics, based on ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-Q Exactive hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry, was applied to identify altered lipid metabolites between tumor and adjacent noninvolved tissues (ANIT), and partial least squares-discriminant analysis model facilitated the identification of differentially abundant lipids. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve and variable importance in projection scores of the aforementioned model were calculated to select lipid profiles. Metabolic pathway analyses were completed using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and MetaboAnalyst. Results: Differences in lipid profiles were found between tumor and ANIT, early- and advanced-stage SqCC, and positive and negative lymph node metastases. The lipid profile panel was composed of five lipidsPC(44:4), diacylglycerol(36:5), sphingomyelin(d18:1/20:0), phosphatidylinositol(46:7), and HexCer-AP(t8:0/32:2 + O)and could effectively differentiate between tumor and ANIT. Further, pathway analyses revealed alterations in several lipid metabolism pathways, including glycerophospholipid metabolism, glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis, linoleic acid metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, and sphingolipid metabolism. Conclusion: Our data revealed several changes in the tissue lipid profiles of patients with SqCC; moreover, we identified a lipid profile panel that could effectually distinguish tumor tissues from ANIT.

Here we describe a case of pancytopenia resulting from bone marrow eosinophilia probably triggered by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.A 61- year-old male presented to us with cough and dyspnoea on exertion for the past 6 months with intermittent fever for the last 3 months. He didn't had any comorbidities, atopic disease, any addiction or drug intake. He was treated for pulmonary tuberculosis 22 years ago. He had received two units of blood transfusion in the past 3 months because of persistent pancytopenia. His general and systemic examinations were unremarkable except for pallor and bilateral diffuse rhonchi with crepitation over the chest. Initial blood investigations revealed pancytopenia (Haemoglobin-6.3g/dl, Total leucocyte count-1400cells/ul, Platelet count-60000/ul), mild eosinophilia (Absolute eosinophil count- 580cells/cumm), with blood peripheral smear showing normocytic normochromic picture with mild eosinophilia and no haemoparasite. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 115mm at 1-hour. Rapid filarial antigen was not detected. Stool for ova, cyst was normal. Liver function and renal function tests were normal. CECT Chest showed peribronchial thickening of central bronchi with fibrotic nodule and band in the apical segment of right upper lobe causing traction bronchiectasis, and non-necrotic mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Sputum culture was sterile with acid-fast stain and cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative. He was managed with antibiotics, albendazole, diethylcarbamazine but showed no improvement. On further workup for persistent symptoms, pancytopenia and mild eosinophilia, serum total IgE was found markedly elevated (2701 IU/ml). HIV I & II, ANA, P-ANCA, C-ANCA were negative, with normal angiotensin-converting enzyme (20 U/L) and aspergillus fumigatus-specific IgE (0.06 kUA/L). Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed a cellular marrow with trilineage haematopoiesis with 49% eosinophils and its precursor, without any cellular atypia. Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed positive CBNAAT test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a sterile culture for bacteria and fungi. He was discharged with antitubercular therapy, short course steroid, and lost to follow up during the COVID-19 pandemic.Though both peripheral and tissue eosinophilia are rare in tubercular infection with very few reported cases, our patient had significant bone marrow eosinophilia with markedly increased serum IgE level. So peripheral and bone marrow eosinophilia may be due to hypersensitivity reaction to Mycobacterium antigen in a susceptible patients. IL-5 has been implicated as an important cytokine for the expansion of peripheral/tissue eosinophilia in tuberculosis patients.

Adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR), expressed by a wide range of immune cells, as well as endothelial cells and platelets, exert cAMP-mediated anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects that potentially could be highly protective in this regard. The venerable drug pentoxifylline (PTX) exerts both anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects that reflect its ability to boost the responsiveness of A2AR to extracellular adenosine. The platelet-stabilizing drug dipyridamole (DIP) blocks intracellular uptake of extracellularly-generated adenosine, thereby up-regulating A2AR signaling in a way that should be functionally complementary to the impact of PTX in that regard. Moreover, DIP has recently been reported to slow the cellular replication of SARS-CoV-2 in clinically feasible concentrations. Both PTX and DIP are reasonably safe, well-tolerated, widely available, and inexpensive drugs. When COVID-19 patients can be treated within several days of symptom onset, using PTX + DIP in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and an antibiotic - azithromycin (AZM) or doxycycline C might be warranted. HCQ and AZM can suppress SARS-CoV-2 proliferation in vitro and may slow the cell-to-cell spread of the virus; a large case series evaluating this combination in early-stage patients reported an impressively low mortality rate. However, whereas HCQ and AZM can promote QT interval lengthening and may be contraindicated in more advanced COVID-19 entailing cardiac damage, doxycycline has no such effect and exerts a potentially beneficial anti-inflammatory action. In contrast to HCQ, we propose that the combination of PTX + DIP can be used in both early and advanced stages of COVID-19. Concurrent use of certain nutraceuticals C yeast beta-glucan, zinc, vitamin D, spirulina, phase 2 inducers, N-acetylcysteine, glucosamine, quercetin, and magnesium C might also improve therapeutic outcomes in COVID-19.","output":"Harnessing Adenosine A2A Receptors as a Strategy for Suppressing the Lung Inflammation and Thrombotic Complications of COVID-19: Potential of Pentoxifylline and Dipyridamole"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first description of the circulation of blood through the lungs has been attributed to Ibn Nafis (1210C1288).1 The concept was rediscovered by Michael Servetus, a Spanish physician during the Renaissance (1511C1553) and recorded, oddly enough, in two pages of his religious treatise, Christianismi Restitutio (1553).2 The definitive exposition of the pulmonary circulation was made by William Harvey in DeMotu Cordis (1628).3 The first observation of the pulmonary capillaries was first reported by Marcellus Malpighi (1661).4 Heart catheterization in humans, driven by a desire to obtain the perfect mixed venous specimen and measure cardiac output, was first performed in 1929 by the German urologist Forssmann,5 using a ureteral catheter to access his own right atrium.

The choice of treatment is based on several factors, including patient and surgeon preference. However, there is little data to guide the decision-making. This study examines the available literature comparing operative treatment in-office versus OR. METHODS A systematic review was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guidelines. Of 2,864 articles identified, 78 were reviewed full-length and 18 were included. Outcomes of interest were recurrence and complication rates, number of procedures, time interval between procedures, and cost. RESULTS Only one study compared outcomes of operative in-office to OR treatments. The weighted average complication rate for OR procedures was 0.02 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.00-0.32), n = 8, and for office procedures, 0.17 (95% CI 0.08-0.33), n = 6. The weighted average time interval between OR procedures was 10.59 months (5.83, 15.35) and for office procedures 5.40 months (3.26-7.54), n = 1. The weighted average cost of OR procedures was $10,105.22 ($5,622.51-14,587.83), n = 2 versus $2,081.00 ($1,987.64-$2,174.36), n = 1 for office procedures.

We set 1000 respondents/country quotas to reflect regional differences with data weighted as necessary. RESULTS: 5,036 women who met inclusion criteria responded: from the UK (1,003), Brazil (1,002), Germany (1,008), Italy (1,007), and Canada (1,016). Though most likely to receive vaccination info via their HCP: in Germany, women are least likely to be influenced by HCPs, with those aged 25C34 years more likely to turn to family members or online sources; in the UK, they are more likely to find info via a health authoritys website; and in Brazil, they are more likely to see info in traditional media and on Facebook. Only 50% ranked vaccine efficacy and disease risk in the Top 5 factors influencing their vaccine decisions, alongside the opinion of an HCP, recommendation of a Public Health Authority and impact of the disease. CONCLUSION: HCPs, families and peers are important sources of info regarding vaccination. COVID-19 is unlikely to improve vaccine confidence as the issue becomes increasingly polarized and communications more inconsistent. We can respond by investing in health promotion and harmonized communications through peer networks. Since caregivers, their families and peers have increased weight in vaccination decisions, then they should have increased weight in preventive health strategies.

However, the pathophysiology, extent of myocardial injury and clinical significance remains unclear. METHODS: COVID-HEART is a UK, multicentre, prospective, observational, longitudinal cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 and elevated troponin (sex-specific > 99th centile). Baseline assessment will be whilst recovering in-hospital or recently discharged, and include cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, quality of life (QoL) assessments, electrocardiogram (ECG), serum biomarkers and genetics. Assessment at 6-months includes repeat CMR, QoL assessments and 6-min walk test (6MWT). The CMR protocol includes cine imaging, T1/T2 mapping, aortic distensibility, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), and adenosine stress myocardial perfusion imaging in selected patients. The main objectives of the study are to: (1) characterise the extent and nature of myocardial involvement in COVID-19 patients with an elevated troponin, (2) assess how cardiac involvement and clinical outcome associate with recognised risk factors for mortality (age, sex, ethnicity and comorbidities) and genetic factors, (3) evaluate if differences in myocardial recovery at 6 months are dependent on demographics, genetics and comorbidities, (4) understand the impact of recovery status at 6 months on patient-reported QoL and functional capacity. DISCUSSION: COVID-HEART will provide detailed characterisation of cardiac involvement, and its repair and recovery in relation to comorbidity, genetics, patient-reported QoL measures and functional capacity.

METHODS This retrospective analysis was conducted based on the data of 119 cases from the Department of Fever and the Department of Infection undergoing chest high-resolution CT examinations in Sanshui District People's Hospital between January, 24 and February 10, 2020. The cases with no abnormality on chest CT were excluded. Twenty-three patients were diagnosed to have pneumonia, including 9 with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia and 14 with other types of pneumonia. We comparatively analyzed the CT signs, location of the lesions and the dandelion clock-like sign among different types of pneumonia. RESULTS Among the 23 patients with pneumonia, 9 (39.1%) had common or severe SARS-CoV-2- associated pneumonia with a positive epidemiological history and corresponding respiratory symptoms. Seven of the SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia patients had multiple lesions in bilateral lungs, compromising mainly the lung field and the subpleural area and showing patchy, lumpy, and umbrella-shaped ground glass opacity, often accompanied by pulmonary vascular thickening and increased microvessels, interlobular septal thickening and fibrosis and lined with grid-like and small-bubble-like \\"crazy-paving\\" patterns. The dandelion clock-like sign was found in all the 9 patients with SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia, with a total of 46 lesions (60.5%, 76 total lesions); 9 of the lesions presented with a \\"dandelion clek-like\\" sign and 37 with a \\"dandelion seed sign\\". These signs were not found in the 14 patients with other types of pneumonia.

METHODS: In a prospective cross-sectional comparative pilot study, we recruited patients with resolved endophthalmitis in one eye (study eye) and a normal fellow eye (control eye). Collected data included measurement of the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging and AO-SLO imaging and cone counting at the fovea in both eyes. RESULTS: The study included 12 eyes of 6 patients. The mean age was 51.6611.97 years (median 56 years). BCVA in all control eyes was 20/20 (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR) 0), and in the study, eyes was 0.210.13 (median 0.19, Snellen 20/30; p=0.001; 95% CI -0.39 to -0.09).

This study evaluates the clinical performance of the TMA Procleix SARS-CoV-2 assay in comparison to the RT-PCR assay AllplexTM SARS-CoV-2 for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Methods: Between November 2020 and February 2021, 610 upper-respiratory specimens received for routine SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing were prospectively collected and selected at the Hospital Universitari Vall dHebron and the Hospital Universitari Bellvitge in Barcelona, Spain. All samples were processed in parallel with the TMA and the RT-PCR assays, and results were compared. Discrepancies were retested by an additional RT-PCR method and the clinical history of these patients was reviewed. Results: Overall, the level of concordance between both assays was 92.0% (, 0.772). Most discordant results (36/38, 94.7%) corresponded to samples testing positive with the TMA assay and negative with the RT-PCR method. Of these discrepant cases, most (28/36, 77.8%) were finally classified as confirmed or probable SARS-CoV-2 cases according to the discrepant analysis. Conclusion: In conclusion, the TMA Procleix SARS-CoV-2 assay performed well for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a multisite clinical setting. This novel TMA assay demonstrated a greater sensitivity in comparison to RT-PCR methods for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2.

Subjects: A convenience sample of parents of children aged 5C12. Measures: Survey to assess parental perceptions of changes in children's physical activity before and during stay-at-home orders, and environmental and social barriers to physical activity. Analysis: Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics, bivariate comparisons, and multinomial-logistic regression models with covariates of environmental factors, social factors, and frequency of factors as barriers on association with perceived physical activity change. Results: Data from 245 parents were analyzed. A majority (63.7%) of parents reported a decrease in children's physical activity during stay-at-home orders. More parents indicated social barriers (e.g., lack of access to playmates) than environmental barriers (e.g., lack of access to neighborhood play spaces) to children's physical activity. In multivariate analyses, the odds of parents reporting decreased physical activity was greater for those reporting lack of playmates (OR = 4.72; 95% CI: 1.99C11.17) and lack of adult supervision (OR = 11.82; 95% CI: 2.48C56.28) as barriers.

This paper aims to define system requirements for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) surveillance under future transmission and response scenarios, based on surveillance system performance to date. METHODS: This study described and evaluated surveillance systems and epidemiological characteristics of novel outbreaks based on publicly available data, and assessed surveillance system sensitivity and timeliness in outbreak detection. These findings were integrated with analysis of other critical COVID-19 public health measures to establish future COVID-19 management requirements. RESULTS: Twenty-five epidemiologically distinct outbreaks and five distinct clusters were identified in the study period, all linked through genomic sequencing to novel introductions from international travellers. Seventy percent (21/30) were detected through community testing of people with acute respiratory illness, and 30% (9/30) through quarantine screening. On average, 2.07% of the State population was tested in the week preceding detection for those identified through community surveillance. From 17/30 with publicly available data, the average time from seeding to detection was 4.9 days. One outbreak was preceded by unexpected positive wastewater results. Twenty of the 24 outbreaks in 2021 had publicly available sequencing data, all of which identified VoCs. A surveillance strategy for future VoCs similar to that used for detecting SARS-CoV-2 would require a 100C1000-fold increase in genomic sequencing capacity compared to the study period. Other essential requirements are maintaining outbreak response capacity and developing capacity to rapidly engineer, manufacture, and distribute variant vaccines at scale. CONCLUSIONS: Australias surveillance systems performed well in detecting novel introduction of SARS-CoV-2 while community transmission was eliminated; introductions were infrequent and case numbers were low. Detection relied on quarantine screening and community surveillance in symptomatic members of the general population, supported by comprehensive genomic sequencing. Once vaccine coverage is maximised, future COVID-19 control should shift to detection of SARS-CoV-2 VoCs, requiring maintenance of surveillance systems and testing all international arrivals, alongside greatly increased genomic sequencing capacity. Effective government support of localised public health response mechanisms and engagement of all sectors of the community is crucial to current and future COVID-19 management.

Herein, we present a rapid (30 min) one-pot, solid-phase immunosensor, based on nanomaterials, by combining a nanometer-thick Au/TiO2 photocatalytic film and Cy5/capture antibody/gold nanorod (GNR) conjugates immobilized on a membrane (the fluorescence of Cy5 was enhanced by the GNR). The one-pot immunoassay is started by adding a drop of a mixture containing 4-chloro-1-naphthol (CN), a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled detection antibody, and an antigen onto the one-pot immunosensor and illuminating UV light. The UV illumination on the Au/TiO2 film results in the production of H2O2, which promotes a CN precipitation reaction. 4-Chloro-1-naphthol precipitates produced by the HRP, which was bound to the conjugates via the antibodies and antigens, could preliminarily quench Cy5 fluorescence via F?rster resonance energy transfer, because of their proximity to Cy5.

However, other potential means of transmission may be present. Fomite-mediated transmission occurs when viruses are deposited onto a surface and then transfer to a subsequent individual.

Transfer was first tested with cellular maintenance media and three viruses: two human coronaviruses, 229E and OC43, and murine norovirus-1, as a surrogate for human norovirus. There was no transfer for either of the human coronaviruses to any of the surfaces.

These tasks, however, often come with many challenges when using classical machine learning models due to a myriad of factors including class imbalance and data heterogeneity (i.e., the complex intra-class variances). To address some of these research gaps, this paper leverages the exciting contrastive learning framework and proposes a novel contrastive regularized clinical classification model. The contrastive loss is found to substantially augment EHR-based prediction: it effectively characterizes the similar/dissimilar patterns (by its\\"push-and-pull\\"form), meanwhile mitigating the highly skewed class distribution by learning more balanced feature spaces (as also echoed by recent findings). In particular, when naively exporting the contrastive learning to the EHR data, one hurdle is in generating positive samples, since EHR data is not as amendable to data augmentation as image data. To this end, we have introduced two unique positive sampling strategies specifically tailored for EHR data: a feature-based positive sampling that exploits the feature space neighborhood structure to reinforce the feature learning; and an attribute-based positive sampling that incorporates pre-generated patient similarity metrics to define the sample proximity.

METHODS: Population-based cohort study involving 79,083 individuals 50 years old in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain). Baseline cohort characteristics (demographic, pre-existing comorbidities, chronic medications and vaccinations history) were established at study start (01/03/2020) and primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 occurred among cohort members throughout 01/03/2020C30/06/2020. Risk of suffering COVID-19 was evaluated by Cox regression, estimating multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for age/sex and pre-existing comorbidities. RESULTS: Across study period, 536 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were observed (mean incidence: 39.5 cases per 100,000 persons-week). In multivariable-analysis, increasing age/years (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.00C1.02), nursing-home (HR: 20.19; 95% CI: 15.98C25.51), neurological disease (HR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.03C1.77), taking diuretics (HR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.10C1.75), antiplatelet (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.05C1.76) and benzodiazepines (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.00C1.53) increased risk; conversely, taking angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.61C1.00), angiotensin-receptor-blockers (HR: 0.70; 95%CI: 0.51C0.96) and statins (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.58C0.96) were associated with reduced risk. Among community-dwelling individuals, pre-existing cancer, renal and cardiac disease appeared also related with an increased risk, whereas influenza vaccination was associated with reduced risk. CONCLUSION: In a setting with relatively low incidence of COVID-19 across the first wave of pandemic period, increasing age, nursing-home residence and multiple comorbidities appear predisposing for COVID-19 among middle-aged/older adults. Conversely, statins, angiotensin-receptor blockers/inhibitors and influenza vaccination were related with decreased risk.","output":"Susceptibility and risk of SARS-COV-2 infection among middle-aged and older adults in Tarragona area, Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epigenetics, including histone modifications, play a significant role in central nervous system diseases, but the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of H3K27me3 in regulating transcriptomic and pathogenic mechanisms following global ischemic stroke. Here, we found that in vivo ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury induced marked upregulation of H3K27me3 in the hippocampus. The administration of GSK-126 to rat brains decreased the levels of H3K27me3 in the hippocampus and reduced neuronal apoptosis after experimental stroke. Furthermore, ChIP-seq data demonstrated that the primary role of GSK-126 in the ischemic brain is to reduce H3K27me3 enrichment, mediating negative regulation of the execution phase of apoptosis and the MAPK signaling pathway. Further study suggested that the protective role of GSK-126 in ischemic rats was antagonized by U0126, an inhibitor of ERK1/2. Collectively, we demonstrated the potential of H3K27me3 as a novel stroke therapeutic target, and GSK-126 exerted a neuroprotective function in ischemic brain injury, which might be associated with activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway.","output":"GSK-126 Protects CA1 Neurons from H3K27me3-Mediated Apoptosis in Cerebral Ischemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there have been intense structural studies on purified recombinant viral components and inactivated viruses. However, investigation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the native cellular context is scarce, and there is a lack of comprehensive knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 replicative cycle. Understanding the genome replication, assembly and egress of SARS-CoV-2, a multistage process that involves different cellular compartments and the activity of many viral and cellular proteins, is critically important as it bears the means of medical intervention to stop infection. Here, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells under the near-native frozen-hydrated condition using a unique correlative multi-modal, multi-scale cryo-imaging approach combining soft X-ray cryo-tomography and serial cryoFIB/SEM volume imaging of the entire SARS-CoV-2 infected cell with cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) of cellular lamellae and cell periphery, as well as structure determination of viral components by subtomogram averaging. Our results reveal at the whole cell level profound cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, exemplified by a large amount of heterogeneous vesicles in the cytoplasm for RNA synthesis and virus assembly, formation of membrane tunnels through which viruses exit, and drastic cytoplasm invasion into nucleus. Furthermore, cryoET of cell lamellae reveals how viral RNAs are transported from double-membrane vesicles where they are synthesized to viral assembly sites; how viral spikes and RNPs assist in virus assembly and budding; and how fully assembled virus particles exit the cell, thus stablishing a model of SARS-CoV-2 genome replication, virus assembly and egress pathways.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Assembly and Egress Pathway Revealed by Correlative Multi-modal Multi-scale Cryo-imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Having an infant admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is associated with increased parental stress, anxiety and depression. Enhanced support for parents may decrease parental stress and improve subsequent parent and child outcomes. The Coached, Coordinated, Enhanced Neonatal Transition (CCENT) programme is a novel bundled intervention of psychosocial support delivered by a nurse navigator that includes Acceptance and Commitment Therapy-based coaching, care coordination and anticipatory education for parents of high-risk infants in the NICU through the first year at home. The primary objective is to evaluate the impact of the intervention on parent stress at 12 months. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre pragmatic randomised controlled superiority trial with 1:1 allocation to the CCENT model versus control (standard neonatal follow-up). Parents of high-risk infants (n=236) will be recruited from seven NICUs across three Canadian provinces. Intervention participants are assigned a nurse navigator who will provide the intervention for 12 months. Outcomes are measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 4, 12 and 18 months. The primary outcome measure is the total score of the Parenting Stress Index Fourth Edition Short Form at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include parental mental health, empowerment and health-related quality of life for calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). A cost-effectiveness analysis will examine the incremental cost of CCENT versus usual care per QALY gained. Qualitative interviews will explore parent and healthcare provider experiences with the intervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research ethics approval was obtained from Clinical Trials Ontario, Childrens Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Ethics Board (REB), The Hospital for Sick Children REB, UBC Childrens and Womens REB and McGill University Health Centre REB.

Plastic pollution has been already one of the greatest threats to our planet before the Coronavirus outbreak. The disposal of millions of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the form of face masks has significantly contributed to the generation of plastic waste and has exacerbated plastic pollution. In an attempt to mitigate pollution caused by the excess PPE waste, an innovative way was developed in this research to reduce pandemic-generated wastes by using the shredded face mask (SFM) fibers as an additive to hot mix asphalt (HMA) to enhance rutting resistance. Rutting or permanent deformation is one of the major distresses of asphalt pavement. Since the SFM behaves as a semi-liquid between 115.5 and 160 C, which is in the range of HMA mixing and paving temperature, it can function as a binding agent to glue the aggregates. When the pavement is cooled down to ambient temperature, the hardened SFM can provide stability and stiffness to HMA. Based on the results of this study, the modified mixes exhibited excellent resistance to permanent deformation under the Asphalt Pavement Analyzer (APA), as rutting depth values were reduced from 3.0 mm to 0.93 mm by increasing the SFM content from 0% to 1.5%. From the rutting test results and premature distress mechanism study, the appropriate addition of SFM modifiers could improve the high-temperature properties of HMA that can be used to strengthen high-compression and shearing zones in the pavement structure.","output":"Use of COVID-19 single-use face masks to improve the rutting resistance of asphalt pavement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Near term forecasts, also called nowcasts, are most challenging but also most important when the economy experiences an abrupt change In this paper, we explore the performance of models with different information sets and data structures in order to best nowcast US initial unemployment claims in spring of 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic We show that the best model, particularly near the structural break in claims, is a state-level panel model that includes dummy variables to capture the variation in timing of state-of-emergency declarations Autoregressive models perform poorly at first but catch up relatively quickly The state-level panel model, exploiting the variation in timing of state-of-emergency declarations, also performs better than models including Google Trends Our results suggest that in times of structural change there is a biasCvariance tradeoff Early on, simple approaches to exploit relevant information in the cross sectional dimension improve forecasts, but in later periods the efficiency of autoregressive models dominates","output":"Nowcasting unemployment insurance claims in the time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is unlikely to end until there is global roll-out of vaccines that protect against severe disease and preferably drive herd immunity Regulators in numerous countries have authorised or approved COVID-19 vaccines for human use, with more expected to be licensed in 2021 Yet having licensed vaccines is not enough to achieve global control of COVID-19: they also need to be produced at scale, priced affordably, allocated globally so that they are available where needed, and widely deployed in local communities In this Health Policy paper, we review potential challenges to success in each of these dimensions and discuss policy implications To guide our review, we developed a dashboard to highlight key characteristics of 26 leading vaccine candidates, including efficacy levels, dosing regimens, storage requirements, prices, production capacities in 2021, and stocks reserved for low-income and middle-income countries We use a traffic-light system to signal the potential contributions of each candidate to achieving global vaccine immunity, highlighting important trade-offs that policy makers need to consider when developing and implementing vaccination programmes Although specific datapoints are subject to change as the pandemic response progresses, the dashboard will continue to provide a useful lens through which to analyse the key issues affecting the use of COVID-19 vaccines We also present original data from a 32-country survey (n = 26 758) on potential acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, conducted from October to December, 2020 Vaccine acceptance was highest in Vietnam (98%), India (91%), China (91%), Denmark (87%), and South Korea (87%), and lowest in Serbia (38%), Croatia (41%), France (44%), Lebanon (44%), and Paraguay (51%) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Challenges in ensuring global access to COVID-19 vaccines: Production, affordability, allocation, and deployment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rare disseminated form of Herpes Zoster occurred mainly in immunocompromised patients.

However, the main challenges are high time complexity. Moreover, the interaction between features is another big challenge in FS problems that directly affects the classification performance. In this paper, an estimation of distribution algorithm is proposed to meet three goals. Firstly, as an extension of EDA, the proposed method generates only two individuals in each iteration that compete based on a fitness function and evolve during the algorithm, based on our proposed update procedure. Secondly, we provide a guiding technique for determining the number of features for individuals in each iteration. As a result, the number of selected features of the final solution will be optimized during the evolution process. The two mentioned advantages can increase the convergence speed of the algorithm. Thirdly, as the main contribution of the paper, in addition to considering the importance of each feature alone, the proposed method can consider the interaction between features. Thus, it can deal with complementary features and consequently increase classification performance. To do this, we provide a conditional probability scheme that considers the joint probability distribution of selecting two features. The introduced probabilities successfully detect correlated features. Experimental results on a synthetic dataset with correlated features prove the performance of our proposed approach facing these types of features. Furthermore, the results on 13 real-world datasets obtained from the UCI repository show the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with some state-of-the-art approaches.","output":"An Evolutionary Correlation-aware Feature Selection Method for Classification Problems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent media reports identified that millions of personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies in Canada's National Emergency Stockpile System (NESS) have expired and gone to waste Government officials and health care organizations are also trying urgently to secure new stock to address widespread shortages Management of emergency stockpiling has proven challenging for Canada and other countries, including the United States and Australia, particularly regarding stock expiration and financial waste We propose an alternative long-term strategy to maintain Canada's stockpile that aims to minimize waste and ensure adequate supply, based on consideration of other countries' pandemic responses and stockpile audits After the novel influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009, an American analysis highlighted problems that arose with the PPE supply chain 10 Many organizations substantially increased orders to build their own stockpiles and, when orders were cancelled or partially filled, they placed orders with multiple vendors When the government tried to help coordinate a response, considerable challenges arose","output":"Canada's National Emergency Stockpile System: time for a new long-term strategy: CMAJ CMAJ"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading infectious diseases worldwide even with the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic in recent times.

The COVID-19 situation in a country could be dramatically different from that of others, which suggests that COVID-19 pandemic data are generated based on different mechanisms, making COVID-19 data in different countries follow different probability distributions. Learning more than one hundred underlying probability distributions for countries in the world from large scale COVID-19 data is beyond a single machine learning model. To address this challenge, we proposed two team-learning frameworks for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic trends: peer learning and layered ensemble learning framework. This addressed framework assigns an adaptive physics-guided graph attention network (GAT) to each learning agent. All the learning agents are fabricated in a hierarchical architecture, which enables agents to collaborate with each other in peer-to-peer and cross-layer way.

Descriptive statistics and the internal consistency of the MBI-GS (S) were assessed. In addition, mean MBI-SG (S) subscale scores for burnout were calculated for cynicism (CY), emotional exhaustion (EE), and academic efficacy (AE). RESULTS: 50 medical students completed the online survey, and 42% reported self-perceived burnout. The MBI-GS(S) subscale scores were higher for cynicism (CY) (52%) and low professional efficacy (PE) (60%), and almost half of the students (48%) reported emotional exhaustion (EE).

In addition, measuring burnout in the medical student population could be extended to all study years and how adequate educational strategies and wellness initiatives could ameliorate burnout.","output":"Prevalence of Burnout in Medical Students in Romania during Covid-19 Pandemic Restrictions (preliminary Data)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the world navigates unchartered territories and witnesses the overwhelming impact of COVID-19, investigators face important challenges to ensure continuity of research studies in a scientifically sound manner.

We employed online database analysis to compare the differences in the amino acid sequences of the homologous T epitopes of HCoV-229e and SARS-CoV. The identified T-cell epitope peptides were synthesized, and their binding affinities for HLA-A2 were validated and compared in the T2 cell system. The immunogenicity of all these peptides was assessed by using T cells obtained from donors who had fully recovered from SARS-CoV infection and from healthy donors with no history of SARS-CoV infection. HLA-A2 typing by indirect immunofluorescent antibody staining showed that 51.6% of SARS-CoV-infected patients were HLA-A2 positive. Online database analysis and the T2 cell binding test disclosed that the number of HLA-A2-restricted immunogenic epitopes of the S protein of SARS-CoV was decreased or even lost in comparison with the homologous sequences of the S protein of HCoV-229e. Among the peptides used in the study, the affinity of peptides from HCoV-229e (H77 and H881) and peptides from SARS-CoV (S978 and S1203) for binding to HLA-A2 was higher than that of other sequences. The gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) release Elispot assay revealed that only SARS-CoV-specific peptides S1203 and S978 induced a high frequency of IFN-gamma-secreting T-cell response in HLA-A2(+) donors who had fully recovered from SARS-CoV infection; such a T-cell epitope-specific response was not observed in HLA-A2(+) healthy donors or in HLA-A2(-) donors who had been infected with SARS-CoV after full recovery. Thus, T-cell epitopes S1203 and S978 are immunogenic and elicit an overt specific T-cell response in HLA-A2(+) SARS-CoV-infected patients.","output":"T-cell epitopes in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus spike protein elicit a specific T-cell immune response in patients who recover from SARS."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures have forced clinicians across the world to look on telemedicine. Although migraine as such seems an ideal option for telemedicine, a systematic study reviewing feasibility, efficacy, and advantages of current advanced telecommunication technologies in children with migraine is lacking. METHODS Clinical details of telephonic consultations performed between March 25 and June 4, 2020, including migraine characteristics, analgesic/prophylactic drug regimens, headache frequency/severity/disability, compliance, drug-related/unrelated adverse effects and unavailability of drugs were recorded. Suitable change in the dose/commercial brand of drug regimen and the addition of new drugs were done as required. Voice call, text messages, picture/video messages, and all other possible measures were used to accumulate maximum clinical information in real time. Unless contacted for trivial reasons, most children were later followed up telephonically to ensure health care concern was resolved and to fill up one 6-item trichotomous quality control questionnaire. RESULTS A total of 146 telephone consultations were performed in 51 participants. Thirty-six patients were identified to have 42 significant clinical events (worsening clinical status/partial response to medications [18; 44%], drug-related adverse effects [10; 19%], unrelated systemic complaints [7; 13%], and worsening of headache due to stress/triggers [7; 13%]). In the rest of the patients, the query of the caregiver included concern regarding COVID-19-related symptoms. Twenty-nine children required increment in drug dose or addition of new drug or commercial brand. Around 90% of caregivers were satisfied with the quality of teleconsultation.

To conduct population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in the United States, the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) was created using the existing infrastructure of the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) (4) and the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET). This report presents age-stratified COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates for patients admitted during March 1-28, 2020, and clinical data on patients admitted during March 1-30, 2020, the first month of U.S. surveillance. Among 1,482 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 74.5% were aged &#8805;50 years, and 54.4% were male. The hospitalization rate among patients identified through COVID-NET during this 4-week period was 4.6 per 100,000 population. Rates were highest (13.8) among adults aged &#8805;65 years. Among 178 (12%) adult patients with data on underlying conditions as of March 30, 2020, 89.3% had one or more underlying conditions; the most common were hypertension (49.7%), obesity (48.3%), chronic lung disease (34.6%), diabetes mellitus (28.3%), and cardiovascular disease (27.8%). These findings suggest that older adults have elevated rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and the majority of persons hospitalized with COVID-19 have underlying medical conditions. These findings underscore the importance of preventive measures (e.g., social distancing, respiratory hygiene, and wearing face coverings in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain)? to protect older adults and persons with underlying medical conditions, as well as the general public. In addition, older adults and persons with serious underlying medical conditions should avoid contact with persons who are ill and immediately contact their health care provider(s) if they have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) (5).

The viral RNA replicase polyproteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) are encoded by the two overlapping open reading frames 1a and 1b, which are connected by a ?1 PRF signal. We evaluated the antiviral effects of antisense peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) targeting a highly conserved RNA sequence on the C PRF signal. The ribosomal frameshifting was inhibited by the PNA, which bound sequence-specifically a pseudoknot structure in the ?1 PRF signal, in cell lines as assessed using a dual luciferase-based reporter plasmid containing the ?1 PRF signal. Treatment of cells, which were transfected with a SARS-CoV-replicon expressing firefly luciferase, with the PNA fused to a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) resulted in suppression of the replication of the SARS-CoV replicon, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 4.4 M. There was no induction of type I interferon responses by PNA treatment, suggesting that the effect of PNA is not due to innate immune responses.

In this work we consider susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) epidemics on networks with time-invariant spreading parameters. (For time-varying spreading parameters, our results correspond to an optimistic scenario for the predictability of epidemics.) Our contribution is twofold. First, accurate long-term predictions of epidemics are possible only after the peak rate of new infections. Hence, before the peak, only short-term predictions are reliable. Second, we define an exponential growth metric, which quantifies the predictability of an epidemic. In particular, even without knowing the future evolution of the epidemic, the growth metric allows us to compare the predictability of an epidemic at different points in time.

The authors discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic could stymie progress toward gender parity within the biomedical workforce and limit the retention and advancement of women in science and medicine. Women faculty face distinct challenges as they navigate the impact of shelter-in-place and social distancing on work and home life. An unequal division of household labor and family care between men and women means women faculty are vulnerable to inequities that may develop in the workplace as they strive to maintain academic productivity and professional development without adequate assistance with domestic tasks and family care. Emerging data suggest that gender differences in academic productivity may be forthcoming as a direct result of the pandemic. Existing gender inequities in professional visibility, networking, and collaboration may be exacerbated as activities transition from in-person to virtual environments and create new barriers to advancement. Meanwhile, initiatives designed to promote gender equity within academic medicine may lose key funding due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on higher education. To ensure that the gender gap within academic medicine does not widen, the authors call upon academic leaders and the broader biomedical community to support women faculty through deliberate actions that promote gender equity, diversity, and inclusion. The authors provide several recommendations, including faculty needs assessments; review of gender bias within tenure-clockCextension offers; more opportunities for mentorship, sponsorship, and professional recognition; and financial commitments to support equity initiatives. Leadership for these efforts should be at the institutional and departmental levels, and leaders should ensure a gender balance on task forces and committees to avoid overburdening women faculty with additional service work.

The risk of patients developing COVID-19 after undergoing ambulatory procedures in hospitals is unknown. This paper aims to investigate the risk of developing COVID-19 from day-case and overnight stay upper limb procedures during the peak of the pandemic in London, and to discuss the implications for the safe management of elective hand and upper limb patients in the coming months. METHODS: 56 patients underwent emergency trauma upper limb procedures as a day case or with a single overnight stay from 1st March to May 31, 2020 at two central London hospitals that were also key players in the pan-London COVID response. Data was collected retrospectively from clinical and theatre records. Patients were contacted post-operatively and answered a structured questionnaire, including whether patients had experienced any of the symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 in the 14 days prior or 30 days following surgery. RESULTS: Of 56 patients, one patient reported COVID-19 symptoms, which were minor and did not require hospitalisation. Five patients experienced minor post-operative complications such as stiffness and scar hypersensitivity; one patient had a superficial wound infection. The mean age was 46 years (20C90) with 68% patients ASA I, 25% ASA II and 4% ASA III. 9% had LA, 30% a regional block and 61% had a GA. The most common operation was a distal radius open reduction and internal fixation. The average time spent in hospital was 11 h (3C34 h) and 12 patients required an overnight stay. The median length of face-to-face follow up was 38.5 days. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that, with appropriate precautions, elective upper limb ambulatory surgery can be safely restarted with a low risk of contracting COVID-19 or its complications.","output":"Is it safe to restart elective day-case surgery?

Other known coronaviruses show a strong pattern of seasonality, with the infection cases in humans being more prominent in winter.

SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne droplets ejected from the upper respiratory tract of the infected individuals. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious for hours on surfaces. As such, the stability of viral particles both in liquid droplets as well as dried on surfaces is essential for infectivity. Here we have used atomic force microscopy to examine the structural stability of individual SARS-CoV-2 virus like particles at different temperatures. We demonstrate that even a mild temperature increase, commensurate with what is common for summer warming, leads to dramatic disruption of viral structural stability, especially when the heat is applied in the dry state.

Unadjusted and adjusted risk of mortality for TCZ treated patients versus TCZ untreated ones was estimated using robust Cox regression model. We considered the combination of TCZ and ICU as time-dependent exposure and created a model using duplication method to assess the TCZ effect in very severe COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: TCZ REDUCED DEATH DURING HOSPITAL STAY IN THE UNADJUSTED MODEL (HR 0.54, 95%CI 0.33- 0.88) and also in the adjusted model, although with loss of statistical significance (HR 0.72, 0.43- 1.20). Better effectiveness was observed in patients with low SpO2/FiO2 ratio (HR 0.35, 0.21-0.61 vs 1.61, 0.54-4.82, p<0.05), and, without statistical significance, in patients with high CRP (HR 0.51, 0.30-0.87 vs 0.41, 0.12-1.37, p =NS) and high IL-6 (HR 0.49, 0.29-0.82 vs 1.00, 0.28-3.55, p=NS).

Efficient techniques for detection of B. pertussis isolates are important for clinical diagnosis. Multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA), a novel isothermal amplification based molecular detection method, has been developed to overcome the technical drawback of the current methods in recent years. This aim of this study is to develop a MCDA with Nanoparticles-based Lateral Flow Biosensor (MCDA-LFB) for the detection of B. pertussis. RESULTS A set of 10 primers based on the pertussis toxin (PT) promoter region sequence of B. pertussis was designed. The B. pertussis-MCDA-LFB assay was successfully established and optimized at 64 C for reaction of 40 min. The detection limit was determined as 10 fg/reaction of pure DNA, and no cross-reactions to non-B. pertussis strains were observed, based on the specificity validation. The whole operation, ranging from template preparation to result reporting, could be completed within 70 min without requirement of costly equipment. The B. pertussis-MCDA-LFB in clinic sample detection yielded identical positive rates with traditional culture and showed higher sensitivity than conventional PCR. The results of MCDA-LFB are easier to read due to the usage of LFB. CONCLUSIONS The isothermal amplification based MCDA-LFB established in the present study is a specific, sensitive, rapid and economical technique for the detection of B. pertussis.","output":"Establishment and application of a multiple cross displacement amplification combined with nanoparticles-based biosensor method for the detection of Bordetella pertussis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 in advance, a method of counting the number of people in the space is needed However, when the camera is used for counting the number of people, privacy infringement may occur This method requires an additional cost of installing the camera With the use of internet of things (IoT) devices and the spread of smartphones, many Wi-Fi access points (APs) are installed In this paper, we suggest a method to count the number of people in a space using these Wi-Fi APs First, we show that the wireless channel changes depending on the person in the space After that, we propose a way to count the number of people through machine learning using channel state information (CSI) of the Wi-Fi signal ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Privacy-preserving People Counting with Channel State Information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During COVID-19 pandemic, the recruitment of new personnel was necessary to guarantee an adequate healthcare level to all patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 virus.

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records, and compared the perioperative outcomes of 66 and 34 patients for cT1a and cT1b tumors, respectively. Inner suture was carried out in the opened collecting system or renal sinus, whereas parenchymal renorrhaphy was not. For hemostasis, the soft-coagulation system was used, and absorbable hemostats were placed on the resection bed. RESULTS The median tumor size and RENAL nephrometry score were significantly different between the two groups (cT1a vs cT1b: 23.5 vs 45 mm, P < 0.001, 6 vs 8, P < 0.001).

It has been established that Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) interacts with sialylated molecules such as gangliosides and glycoproteins at the cell surface. Nevertheless, the specific receptor(s) that mediate virus entry are not well known. We have analysed the role of the sialic acid linkage in the early steps of the viral infection cycle. Pretreatment of ELL-0 cells with both 2,3 and 2,6 specific sialidases led to the inhibition of NDV binding, fusion and infectivity, which were restored after 2,3(N)- and 2,6(N)-sialyltransferase incubation. Moreover, 2,6(N)-sialyltransferases also restored NDV activities in 2-6-linked sialic acid deficient cells. Competition with 2-6 sialic acid-binding lectins led to a reduction in the three NDV activities (binding, fusion and infectivity) suggesting a role for 2-6- linked sialic acid in NDV entry. We conclude that both 2-3- and 2-6- linked sialic acid containing glycoconjugates may be used for NDV infection. NDV was able to efficiently bind, fuse and infect the ganglioside-deficient cell line GM95 to a similar extent to that of its parental MEB4, suggesting that gangliosides are not essential for NDV binding, fusion and infectivity. Nevertheless, the fact that the interaction of NDV with cells deficient in N-glycoprotein expression such as Lec1 was less efficient prompted us to conclude that NDV requires N-linked glycoproteins for efficient attachment and entry into the host cell.

The value of this paper is to draw a holistic picture of ongoing online teaching-learning activities during the lockdown period including establishing the linkage between change management process and online teaching-learning process in education system amid the COVID-19 outbreak so as to overcome the persisting academic disturbance and consequently ensure the resumption of educational activities and discourses as a normal course of procedure in the education system.","output":"Online teaching-learning in higher education during lockdown period of COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Negative experiences in dental clinics can induce anxiety in patients, and the effects are particularly pronounced in children. When behavior guidance methods (eg, direct observation, tell-show-do, and ask-tell-ask) fail, general anesthesia is an important alternative; however, the procedure of anesthesia can also induce fear and anxiety. This study assessed the effectiveness of guided imagery in relieving the anxiety associated with dental surgery in children and caregivers. DESIGN: A prospective randomized trial with two groups. METHODS: The guided imagery in this study was meant to establish a rapport between the medical team and the patient, by encouraging the child to imagine having an adventure while riding in a spacecraft. Anxiety levels and behavior were measured using five well-established scales: the modified Yale Preoperative Scale-Short Form, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-6 items, the Watcha score, the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergent Delirium scale, and the Posthospitalization Behavioral Questionnaire-Ambulatory Surgery. FINDINGS: The results indicate that the guided imagery had no significant effects on anxiety levels. CONCLUSIONS: Guided imagery is a low-cost, easy-to-implement, interesting exercise capable of enhancing interactions between nursing staff and children. It may also help to condition children to the environment and thereby assist them in overcoming their fears.","output":"Using Guided Imagery to Relieve the Anxiety of Preschool Children Undergoing Dental Procedures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing evidence points to endothelial cell dysfunction as a key pathophysiological factor in severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), manifested by platelet aggregation, microthrombi and altered vasomotor tone. This may be driven by direct endothelial cell entry by the virus, or indirectly by activated inflammatory cascade. Major risk groups identified for adverse outcomes in COVID-19 are diabetes, and those from the Black, Asian and ethnic minority (BAME) populations. Hyperglycaemia (expressed as glycated haemoglobin or mean hospital glucose) correlates with worse outcomes in COVID-19. It is not known whether hyperglycaemia is causative or is a surrogate marker - persistent hyperglycaemia is well known as an aetiological agent in microangiopathy. In this article, we propose that pre-existing endothelial dysfunction of microangiopathy, more commonly evident in diabetes and BAME groups, makes an individual vulnerable to the subsequent endothelitis of COVID-19 infection.","output":"The contribution of diabetic micro-angiopathy to adverse outcomes in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although COVID-19 emerged as a major concern to public health around the world, no licensed medication has been found as of yet to efficiently stop the virus spread and treat the infection. The SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell is driven by the direct interaction of the S1 domain with the ACE-2 receptor followed by conformational changes in the S2 domain, as a result of which fusion peptide is inserted into the target cell membrane, and the fusion process is mediated by the specific interactions between the heptad repeats 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2) that form the six-helical bundle. Since blocking this interaction between HRs stops virus fusion and prevents its subsequent replication, the HRs inhibitors can be used as anti-COVID drugs. The initial drug selection is based on existing molecular databases to screen for molecules that may have a therapeutic effect on coronavirus. Based on these premises, we chose two approved drugs to investigate their interactions with the HRs (based on docking methods). To this end, molecular dynamics simulations and molecular docking were carried out to investigate the changes in the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Our results revealed, cefpiramide has the highest affinity to S protein, thereby revealing its potential to become an anti-COVID-19 clinical medicine.

Under the concept of positive psychological intervention, the present work aims to alleviate the entrepreneurial pressure of college students and improve college students entrepreneurial education through the analysis of enterprise management elements. A 3-month intervention experiment, including the pre-test, preventive curriculum intervention, post-test, and delayed test, is conducted on a control group and an experimental group, to investigate entrepreneurial intention, emotional management ability, and ability to deal with entrepreneurial pressure of college students. In addition, based on a complex adaptive system (CAS), the enterprise management elements are analyzed, and a three-layer network model is constructed. Meanwhile, new diversified elements of enterprise management are defined to discuss the effectiveness and psychological impact of diversified management, proving that psychological security plays an intermediary role in the cross-layer relationship chain in the three-layer CAS network. The experimental results indicate that on the whole, the positive psychological intervention reduces the pressure of students in the experimental group, significantly ameliorates depression and anxiety, and promotes the positive personality in all directions. Besides, in the delayed test after 3 months, the experimental group can maintain a relatively better state than the control group. By exploring the role effectiveness and characteristics of diversified management, this experiment confirms that the improvement of psychological security under positive psychological intervention has a positive impact on the effectiveness of diversified management.

METHODS: We investigated if disease severity, phenotype or survival in patients with new-onset PD correlates with cNfL concentrations around the time of diagnosis in the population-based NYPUM study cohort (n = 99). A second, larger new-onset PD cohort (n = 194) was used for independent validation. Association of brain pathology with the cNfL concentration was examined using striatal dopamine transporter imaging and repeated diffusion tensor imaging, at baseline, 1 and 3 years. RESULTS: Higher cNfL in the early phase of PD was associated with greater severity of all cardinal motor symptoms except tremor, in both cohorts, and with shorter survival and impaired olfaction. cNfL concentrations above the median of 903 ng/L conferred an overall 5.8 times increased hazard of death, during follow-up. After adjustment for age and sex, higher cNfL correlated with striatal dopamine transporter uptake deficits and lower fractional anisotropy in diffusion tensor imaging of several axonal tracts. CONCLUSIONS: cNfL shows usefulness as a biomarker of disease severity and to predict survival in PD. The present results indicate that the cNfL concentration reflects the intensity of the neurodegenerative process, which could be of importance in future clinical trials.

METHODS: Data were retrieved from Eurobarometer 88.4, a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2017 with 28,031 over 15-year-old inhabitants of the European Union. PA prevalence was calculated along with the probability to be physically inactive by social stratification. Logistic regressions were run in the inactive population to show the social class effect on each barrier adjusted by sociodemographic factors employing a propensity score matched method. RESULTS: Low social class presented higher inactivity prevalence (43.11%), whilst the high social class reported the lowest prevalence (23.30%). Also, the low (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.47C0.58) and middle (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.64C0.79) social classes were less likely to be active compared to high social class. In the inactive population, the low social class had mostly higher odds to report each barrier. CONCLUSIONS: Social class is a relevant factor for low PA, with more barriers in the lower social classes.

Baseline demographic, clinical, laboratory examination was extracted from electronic medical records at the first day of admission and compared between short-term hospital stay and long-term hospital stay. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to explore the risk factors associated with hospital stay. Results Of 109 COVID-19 patients, 61 patients were short-term stay ( 10 days) and 48 patients were long-term stay (> 10 days). The average age of patients in short-term stay were younger than those long-term stay(P = 0.01). Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (34%, 21/61), followed by diabetes (15%,9/61) and Cardiopathy (8%, 5/61). Fever and cough were the typical clinical manifestation in two group. Decreased WBC, Hemoglobin and increased Monocyte, MLR (Monocyte Lymphocyte ratio) and Hypersensitive CRP showed a long-term stay (all P < 0.05).

Materials and Methods This retrospective multicenter study included consecutive patients who presented to emergency departments in six medical centers between March and April 2020 with moderate to severe upper respiratory symptoms suspicious for COVID-19. As part of clinical practice, chest CT was obtained for primary workup and scored using the 5-point CO-RADS scheme for suspicion of COVID-19. CT was compared with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, and a clinical reference standard established by a multidisciplinary group of clinicians based on RT-PCR, COVID-19 contact history, oxygen therapy, timing of RT-PCR testing and likely alternative diagnosis. Performance of CT was estimated using area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) analysis and diagnostic odds ratios (OR) against both reference standards. Subgroup analysis was performed based on symptom duration grouped presentations of < 48 hours, 48 hours through 7 days, and > 7 days. Results A total of 1070 patients (median age 66, IQR 54-75, 626 men) were included, of whom 536/1070 (50%) had a positive RT-PCR, 137/1070 (13%) patients were considered to have a possible or probable COVID- 19 based on the clinical reference standard. Chest CT yielded an AUC of 0.87 (95%CI 0.84-0.89) compared with RT-PCR and 0.87 (95%CI 0.85-0.89) compared with the clinical reference standard. A CO-RADS score &#8805;4 yielded an OR of 25.9 (95%CI 18.7-35.9) for a COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR, and an OR of 30.6 (95%CI 21.1-44.4) by the clinical reference standard.

The main isothermal methods reviewed here include loop-mediated isothermal amplification, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, and helicase-dependent amplification. In this review, design criteria, potential of amplification, and application of these alternative molecular tests will be discussed and compared to conventional NAATs.","output":"Alternative Molecular Tests for Virological Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 surrogate neutralization assays that obviate the need for viral culture offer substantial advantages regarding throughput and cost. The cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit (Genscript) is the first such commercially available assay, detecting antibodies that block RBD/ACE-2 interaction. We aimed to evaluate cPass to inform its use and assess its added value compared to anti-RBD ELISA assays. METHODS: Serum reference panels comprising 205 specimens were used to compare cPass to plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and a pseudotyped lentiviral neutralization (PLV) assay for detection of neutralizing antibodies. We assessed the correlation of cPass with an ELISA detecting anti-RBD IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies at a single timepoint and across intervals from onset of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Compared to PRNT-50, cPass sensitivity ranged from 77% - 100% and specificity was 95% - 100%. Sensitivity was also high compared to the pseudotyped lentiviral neutralization assay (93% [95%CI 85-97]), but specificity was lower (58% [95%CI 48-67]). Highest agreement between cPass and ELISA was for anti-RBD IgG (r=0.823). Against the pseudotyped lentiviral neutralization assay, anti-RBD IgG sensitivity (99% [95%CI 94-100]) was very similar to that of cPass, but overall specificity was lower (37% [95%CI 28-47]). Against PRNT-50, results of cPass and anti-RBD IgG were nearly identical.

Neutrophils are the first immune cells to migrate to sites of infection and inflammation, where they generate, among other mediators, the potent oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Here, we investigated the impact of MIF on HOCl production in neutrophils in response to phagocytic stimuli. METHODS: Production of HOCl during phagocytosis of zymosan was determined using the specific fluorescent probe R19-S in combination with flow cytometry and live cell microscopy. The rate of phagocytosis was monitored using fluorescently-labeled zymosan. Alternatively, HOCl production was assessed during phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by measuring the oxidation of bacterial glutathione to the HOCl-specific product glutathione sulfonamide. Formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), an oxidant-dependent process, was quantified using a SYTOX Green plate assay. RESULTS: Exposure of human neutrophils to MIF doubled the proportion of neutrophils producing HOCl during early stages of zymosan phagocytosis, and the concentration of HOCl produced was greater. During phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa, a greater fraction of bacterial glutathione was oxidized to glutathione sulfonamide in MIF-treated compared to control neutrophils. The ability of MIF to increase neutrophil HOCl production was independent of the rate of phagocytosis and could be blocked by the MIF inhibitor 4-IPP. Neutrophils pre-treated with MIF produced more NETs than control cells in response to PMA. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a role for MIF in potentiating HOCl production in neutrophils in response to phagocytic stimuli. We propose that this newly discovered activity of MIF contributes to its role in mediating the inflammatory response and enhances host defence.","output":"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) enhances hypochlorous acid production in phagocytic neutrophils"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"If you plan to meet people over the festive season, there are many ways you can reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus, says Clare Wilson","output":"Covid-safe celebrations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had an important impact on the academic world. It is known that university studies can influence the mental health of students, and especially those studying health sciences. In this study, we therefore sought to analyse whether the current pandemic has affected the mental well-being of final-year nursing students. This was a multi-centre study, with a descriptive, longitudinal, and prospective design. Mental well-being was evaluated using the General Health Questionnaire. A total of 305 participants were included in the study, of whom 52.1% had experienced the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistically significant differences were found between the two groups analysed in terms of age, access to university, average marks, mental well-being self-esteem, emotional exhaustion, and sense of coherence. In the case of mental well-being, a direct association was found with both the pandemic situation (OR = 2.32, P = 0.010) and emotional exhaustion scores (OR = 1.20, P < 0.001), while an inverse association was found with sense of coherence scores (OR = 0.45, P < 0.001).

This paper aims to present the PREparedness, RESponse and SySTemic transformation (PRE-RE-SyST): a model for a disability-inclusive pandemic responses and systematic disparities reduction. METHODS: Scoping review with a thematic analysis was conducted on the literature published up to mid-September 2020, equating to the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Seven scientific databases and three preprint databases were searched to identify empirical or perspective papers addressing health and socio-economic disparities experienced by PwD as well as reporting actions to address them. Snowballing searches and experts consultation were also conducted. Two independent reviewers made eligibility decisions and performed data extractions on any action or recommended action to address disparities. A thematic analysis was then used for the model construction, informed by a systems-thinking approach (i.e., the Iceberg Model). RESULTS: From 1027 unique references, 84 were included in the final analysis. The PRE-RE-SyST model articulates a four-level strategic action to: 1) Respond to prevent or reduce disability disparities during a pandemic crisis; 2) Prepare ahead for pandemic and other crises responses; 3) Design systems and policies for a structural disability-inclusiveness; and 4) Transform societys cultural assumptions about disability. Simple rules and literature-based examples on how these strategies can be deployed are provided. CONCLUSION: The PRE-RE-SyST model articulates main strategies, simple rules and possible means whereby public health authorities, policy-makers, and other stakeholders can address disability disparities in pandemic crises, and beyond. Beyond immediate pandemic responses, disability-inclusiveness is needed to develop everyday equity-oriented policies and practices that can transform societies towards greater resiliency, as a whole, to pandemic and other health and social emergencies.

We correlated the number of professionals with the parameters used by the World Health Organization. According to the Brazilian Intensive Care Medicine Association, we correlated the data for adult intensive care unit beds in each state with the number of professionals for each ten intensive care unit beds. The number of professionals, beds, and cases were then organized by state. Results The number of physicians per 100 thousand inhabitants followed the World Health Organization recommendations;however, the number of nurses did not. The number of intensivists, registered nurses, nurse technicians specialized in intensive care, and respiratory therapists, necessary for every ten intensive care beds, was not enough for any of these professional categories. A complete team of critical care specialists was available for 10% of intensive care unit beds in Brazil.

Methods Systematic searches of MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane and PsycINFO from database inception until June 2021 were undertaken. Additionally, the reference lists of included studies were searched for relevant articles. Psychometric properties of identified measures were evaluated against pre-determined and standard criteria. Results Eighteen tools met inclusion criteria: 11 were developed to assess unmet patient palliative care needs. Of those, 6 were generic, 4 were developed for heart failure and 1 was developed for interstitial lung disease. Seven tools identified those who may benefit from palliative care and include general and disease-specific indicators. The psychometric qualities of the tools varied. None met all of the accepted criteria for psychometric rigor in heart failure or respiratory disease populations. There is limited implementation of needs assessment tools in practice. Conclusion Several tools were identified, however further validation studies in heart failure and respiratory disease populations are required.

It has been recently reported that in U87 glioblastoma cells IFITM proteins inhibit HIV-1 entry in a co-receptor-dependent manner, that is, IFITM1 is more inhibitory on CCR5 tropic HIV-1 whereas IFITM2/3 confers a greater suppression of CXCR4 counterparts. However, how entry of HIV-1 with distinct co-receptor usage is modulated by different IFITM orthologs in physiologically relevant CD4(+) T cells and monocytes/macrophages has not been investigated in detail. Here, we report that overexpression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 in human CD4(+) HuT78 cells, SupT1 cells, monocytic THP-1 cells and U87 cells expressing CD4 and co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4, suppressed entry of CXCR4 tropic viruses NL4.3 and HXB2, CCR5 tropic viruses AD8 and JRFL, dual tropic 89.6 virus, as well as a panel of 32 transmitted founder (T/F) viruses, with a consistent order of potency, that is, IFITM3 > IFITM2 > IFITM1. Consistent with previous reports, we found that some CCR5-using HIV-1 isolates, such as AD8 and JRFL, were relatively resistant to inhibition by IFITM2 and IFITM3, although the effect can be cell-type dependent. However, in no case have we observed that IFITM1 had a stronger inhibition on entry of any HIV-1 strains tested, including those of CCR5-using T/Fs. We knocked down the endogenous IFITMs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and purified CD4(+) T cells and observed that, while this treatment did greatly enhance the multiple-round of HIV-1 replication but had modest effect to rescue the single-round HIV-1 infection, reinforcing our previous conclusion that the predominant effect of IFITMs on HIV-1 infection is in viral producer cells, rather than in target cells to block viral entry. Overall, our results argue against the idea that IFITM proteins distinguish co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 to inhibit entry but emphasize that the predominant role of IFITMs on HIV-1 is in producer cells that intrinsically impair the viral infectivity.","output":"The Inhibition of HIV-1 Entry Imposed by Interferon Inducible Transmembrane Proteins Is Independent of Co-Receptor Usage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study's primary objective is to evaluate the time spent in the peer-review process for orthopaedic publications related to the Covid-19 pandemic.

RESULTS Segments that had been treated with a hand-sutured ligature or double-sealed with HFEW were compared. Burst pressure was significantly higher in the hand-sutured group than in the HFEW group (136.2 mm Hg versus 75.8 mm Hg, P<.01). All 48 pig small bowels closed by the HFEW-300 generator showed a success rate of 100.0%. The closing time in the HFEW group was significantly shorter (P<.01). The pathological changes of the closed ends were mainly presented as acute thermal- and pressure-induced injuries. CONCLUSIONS Outcomes of the current in vivo study suggest that HFEW is an effective and safe method for ligation of the small bowel in pigs.","output":"Comparison of a New High-Frequency Electric Welding System for Intestinal Closure with Hand-Sewn In Vivo Pig Model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: To elucidate the perceptions on eye care of patients affected by the disruption of outpatient and surgical ophthalmological services during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted during the reopening of outpatient services at two tertiary eye care centres in Singapore and North India. Consecutive patients were recruited from general and specialist eye clinics in June 2020. RESULTS: A total of 326 patients were recruited, 200 patients from Singapore and 126 patients from New Delhi, India. The most common eye conditions were diabetic retinopathy and uveitis or ocular inflammatory conditions in the Indian centre, whereas the most common in the Singaporean centre were cataract in the pre- or postoperative stage and glaucoma. For patients from the Indian centre, 61.9% felt that COVID-19 had negatively impacted their eye disease, 58.7% were more distressed by their eye disease, 70.8% could not access appropriate eye care, 66.6% were afraid of contracting COVID-19 in the clinic, and 61.9% were accepting of teleconsultations. For patients from the Singaporean centre, 13.5% felt that COVID-19 had negatively impacted their eye disease, 19.5% were more distressed by their eye disease, 21.5% could not access appropriate eye care, 35% were afraid of contracting COVID-19 in the clinic, and only 31% were accepting of teleconsultations. CONCLUSION: Patients from India appear to have been more negatively affected by the pandemic compared to patients from Singapore. This study highlights patients perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on eye care, perceived risks, ease of access to care and attitudes towards eye care during the pandemic. Patients perceptions are integral in developing strategies for the best care possible. There were heterogeneous responses amongst our patients; hence, there may be a role for more individualized healthcare strategies in the future.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the mental health, well-being and changes in lifestyle among intensive care unit (ICU) healthcare workers (HCW) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare these results with those of HCW in other hospital units. Another objective was to understand which associated factors aggravate their mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey collected socio-demographic data, lifestyle changes and mental health evaluations as assessed by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 items (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 items (PHQ-9), the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI) and the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) from the 28th May to 7th July 2020. The study was carried out at Geneva University Hospitals, a group of eight public hospitals in Switzerland. ICU HCW were analyzed for mental health outcomes and lifestyles changes and then compared to non-ICU HCW. A series of linear regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with mental health scores. RESULTS: A total of 3461 HCW were included in the study, with 352 ICU HCW. Among ICU HCW, 145 (41%) showed low well-being, 162 (46%) symptoms of anxiety, 163 (46%) symptoms of depression and 76 (22%) had peritraumatic distress. The mean scores of GAD-7, PHQ-9 and WHO-5 were worse in ICU HCW than in non-ICU HCW (p < 0.01). Working in the ICU rather than in other departments resulted in a change of eating habits, sleeping patterns and alcohol consumption (p < 0.01). Being a woman, the fear of catching and transmitting COVID-19, anxiety of working with COVID-19 patients, work overload, eating and sleeping disorders as well as increased alcohol consumption were associated with worse mental health outcomes. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the suspicion of a high prevalence of anxiety, depression, peritraumatic distress and low well-being during the first COVID-19 wave among HCW, especially among ICU HCW. This allows for the identification of associated risk factors. Long-term psychological follow-up should be considered for HCW.

They are also responsible for the transmission of influenza because of their longer viral shedding compared to adults. In Malaysia, studies on influenza in children are scarce, and as a result, policy decisions cannot be formulated to control the infection. Hence, the objective of this study is to determine the prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of influenza among children with upper respiratory symptoms in the Sabah state of Malaysia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with a simple random sampling was conducted among children with upper respiratory symptoms in Sabah from 1 March 2019 to 29 February 2020. Patients admitted to a pediatric ward of Sabah Women and Childrens Hospital who presented with a fever >38 C and cough within 48 h of admission were enrolled in this study. A nasopharyngeal swab was taken, and influenza was diagnosed by lateral flow test. Clinical features of influenza-positive children were compared with children whose results were negative. RESULTS: A total of 323 nasopharyngeal samples were collected, and 66 (20.4%) of them were positive for influenza. Fifty-six (85%) were infected by influenza A whereas ten (15%) were by influenza B virus. Higher temperature (aOR 2.03, 95% CI 1.296C3.181), less activity (aOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.158C3.693), and seizure (aOR 4.2, 95% CI 1.614C10.978) on admission were significant risk factors associated with influenza in children.

METHOD: Panel members age 18 and over from the nationally representative Angus Reid Forum were invited to complete an online survey about their experience with COVID-19, including their intention to get vaccinated. Respondents were asked When a vaccine against the coronavirus becomes available to you, will you get vaccinated or not? Having no intention to vaccinate was defined as choosing No C I will not get a coronavirus vaccination as a response. Odds ratios and predicted probabilities are reported for no vaccine intentionality in demographic groups. FINDINGS: 14,621 panel members completed the survey. Having no intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 is relatively low overall (9%) with substantial variation among demographic groups. Being a resident of Alberta (predicted probability = 15%; OR 0.58 [95%CI 0.14-2.24]), aged 40-59 (predicted probability = 12%; OR 0.87 [0.78-0.97]), identifying as a visible minority (predicted probability = 15%; OR 0.56 [0.37-0.84]), having some college level education or lower (predicted probability = 14%) and living in households of at least five members (predicted probability = 13%; OR 0.82 [0.76-0.88]) are related to lower vaccination intention. INTERPRETATION: The study identifies population groups with greater and lesser intention to vaccinate in Canada. As the Canadian COVID-19 vaccination effort continues, policymakers may use this information to focus outreach, education, and other efforts on the latter groups, which also have had higher risks for contracting and dying from COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 vaccination intention during early vaccine rollout in Canada: a nationwide online survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Faced with the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a global public health threat, psychiatric hospitals are under huge pressure to prevent and control nosocomial infection. The current research analyzed the COVID-19 infection control practices in a regional mental health center in China and addressed how this type of medical institutions could enhance their ability to prevent and control hospital transmission of major respiratory diseases and general management of nosocomial infection risks. Firstly, hospital-related risks of COVID-19 were analyzed, and targeted prevention and control measures were then established. Pre- and post-intervention theoretical knowledge of nosocomial infection control, hand hygiene compliance and accuracy, use of personal protective equipment, and disinfection and sterilization effectiveness were evaluated and compared. All the indexes displayed significant improvements following the implementation of the prevention and control measures. Up to the submission of this paper, the mental health center had obtained no suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 infection due to hospital transmission. The findings provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of the COVID-19 preventive strategies and have important implications for integrated and characterized infection control in mental health centers during a major epidemic.

Often diaspora philanthropy happens through intermediary organizations such as hometown associations, internet-based philanthropic platforms and faith-based groups. Little research explores immigrant-owned small businesses as intermediary organizations for diaspora philanthropy. In the literature of social entrepreneurship, the theory of opportunity recognition provides insights on how do businesses identify opportunities for fulfilling social missions. However, it is uncertain whether this major theory can be applied to a specific context such as immigrant-owned small businesses. In this research, I aim to understand immigrant-owned small businesses' participation in social entrepreneurship through diaspora philanthropy, especially in responding to natural disasters. Specifically, three research questions were proposed: What role do small businesses play? What mechanisms do they use to partake in diaspora philanthropy? Moreover, what motivates them to participate? Design/methodology/approach: This research uses an in-depth case study that focuses on a specific diaspora philanthropy behavior in responding to a natural disaster in the diaspora's hometown. The subject of this work is a small business owned by an immigrant in New York City, the US. To collect data on this case, the author utilized a mixed-methods design, which involves two types of qualitative data: document analysis and interview. Giving the purpose of this study, the author used thematic coding for both newspaper article data and interview data following a deductive approach. Findings: The result shows that small businesses have an inherent advantage in building close interpersonal relationships with their customers and serve as the connector between their customers and larger philanthropic organizations. Because of their limitations on resources, small businesses collaborate with larger nonprofit organizations to do complicated philanthropic work for improved capacity. When diaspora philanthropy happens due to natural disasters in homelands, diasporas experience some level of guilt since they are not there with the people of their homeland in solidarity facing the difficulties. This guilt, which is related to cultural influences, is one of the motivations that make diasporas give to their homelands. The findings also show that the opportunity recognition theory fits well into explaining the altruistic behaviors of small businesses owned by immigrants. Originality/value: A lot remains unknown about immigrant-owned small businesses, including their altruistic behaviors and participation in social entrepreneurship. This research expands the current knowledge on diaspora philanthropy by identifying the roles of small businesses, the mechanisms used by small businesses and the motivations of giving during natural disasters. This research also validates the opportunity recognition theory of social entrepreneurship in a specific context. ? 2021, Ximeng Chen.","output":"Immigrant-owned small businesses' participation in diaspora philanthropy: a case study during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One hundred and twenty-four specimens of Corydoras paleatus (Jenyns, 1842) collected from July 2001 to December 2002 in five reservoirs in Paran state were analyzed.

The clinical characteristics of WNND have not been well described in Florida, an area with high mosquito activity. We hereby describe the clinical characteristics of WNND at two large hospitals in Miami. METHODS: A 10-year retrospective study was performed at the University of Miami Hospital and Mount Sinai Medical Center to identify adult patients with confirmed WNV infection and neuroinvasion. Patient demographics, symptoms, neurological exam findings, laboratory diagnostics, intensive care unit (ICU), and hospital length of stay (LOS), and outcomes were described. RESULTS: Eleven patients (73% male, mean age 64.4  16.3 years) were identified between January 2010 to December 2020. The most prevalent comorbidities were HTN (64%) and DM (27%). The most common positive findings on the review of symptoms were fever (100%), confusion (81.8%), and headache (63.6%). The mean hospital LOS was 15.5 11.3 days, while the mean ICU LOS was 7.2  11.9 days. The majority of patients (75%) spent more than 2 weeks in the ICU. Subject age was correlated with hospital LOS with a Pearson correlation of 0.624 (p=0.04). The survival rate was 91%.

CONCLUSION: This is the largest case series of WNND in Florida. Most cases occurred during summer 2020, which corresponds to the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite pandemic restrictions, we may have seen an increase in WNV cases due to higher-than-normal temperatures promoting mosquito abundance, increased outdoor activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and/or the redistribution of public health resources towards the pandemic rather than mosquito control. Residual neurological symptoms and impaired functional outcomes are common. Within the limitation of our small sample size, subject age appeared to correlate with hospital LOS. This correlation should be further explored in a larger case series. A high index of suspicion for WNND is suggested for patients presenting with fever and neurologic symptoms in Florida.

The objective of this study was to describe clinical outcomes associated with tocilizumab compared with those not receiving tocilizumab in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: Methods: Retrospective case series of 49 adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Patients receiving tocilizumab were compared with those not receiving tocilizumab. The primary outcome was clinical improvement (decrease in supplemental oxygen requirement, discharge from ICU, or live discharge from hospital). Secondary endpoints included mortality and frequency of extubation. All comparative endpoints were assessed at 2 weeks after ICU admission. RESULTS: Results: 49 patients were identified with SARS-CoV-2 who were admitted to an ICU, 16 received tocilizumab. Baseline characteristics were similar; most were African American males with comorbidities such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. The time from symptom onset to positive test and subsequent intubation were similar (4 and 7 days, respectively). 75% received one dose (all received 8 mg/kg).

Traditionally, a sheet of paper and a pencil or pen is used to document school attendance at universities. In most cases, the professor would hand out a piece of paper to a student. This student would mark their presence on the paper sheet and pass it to the person sitting next to them. The piece of paper would then travel throughout the classroom until the final student received the paper. Finally, the piece of paper would be given back to the professor or the teacher's assistant, so they may take note of which student is present and which student is absent. In the age of the COVID-19 pandemic, this method of taking attendance poses a great risk to possible disease transmission. Everyone within the room would be touching the same piece of paper, and sometimes students may even share the same pen or pencil with their classmates. Everyone in the classroom, including the professor, would be at risk if one student were infected with the COVID-19 virus. This is attributed to the attendance method. This paper proposes a zero-effort, zerointeraction attendance method based on two aspects that are currently present in a typical classroom: access points and a student's Wi-Fi enabled devices (e.g., smartphones).

Evidence suggests that attentional control may protect those individuals with outcome-specific vulnerabilities from developing maladaptive psychological outcomes. In the present study, attentional control was examined as a moderator of the relation between COVID-19 stress and generalized anxiety symptoms in a community sample (N = 359 adults). As predicted, the relationship between COVID-19 stress and anxiety was moderated by attentional control. Specifically, as attentional control decreased, the strength of the association between COVID-19 stress and anxiety increased. The results suggest that, among those with higher levels of COVID-19 stress, attentional control may act as a protective factor against developing anxiety. It may be beneficial as a matter of standard public health guidance to recommend that the general public engages in activities that are known to improve attentional control and alleviate emotional distress (e.g., mindfulness-based techniques) at the outset of a pandemic or other global catastrophe to reduce the likelihood that prolonged event-related stress will lead to impairing anxiety.","output":"The Moderating Effect of Attentional Control on the Relationship Between COVID Stress and Generalized Anxiety Symptoms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: For frontline healthcare workers (FHW) who are working with Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) patients, PPE is currently considered as one of the most discussed topics Recommendation from international organizations concerning the use of PPE are broadly consistent but equipment use is not No previous studies examined the use of PPE in Tunisia Aim:Evaluate the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) in addition to the reality and perception regarding personal safety in workplace Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional survey from 15th April to 5th May 2020 across public and private institutions in Tunisia A 33-item structured questionnaire was developed and administered to FHWs Results: We received 723 responses We found that there was a likely overuse of PPE in addition to a high rate of side effects caused by PPE Conclusions:Additional training in PPE use might be useful, and sessional work should be considered to decrease the side effects associated with PPE use ? 2020, Maison du Medicine All rights reserved","output":"Personal protective equipment: A cross-sectional study in frontline healthcare workers during covid-19 outbreak in Tunisia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As an aerosol and droplets generating procedure, tracheostomy increases contamination risks for health workers in the coronavirus disease context.

Characterizing the relationship between mutation activities and the risk of severe clinical outcomes is of public health importance for informing the healthcare decision-making process. Using a likelihood-based approach, we developed a statistical framework to reconstruct a time-varying and variant-specific case fatality ratio (CFR), and to estimate changes in CFR associated with a single mutation empirically. For illustration, the statistical framework is implemented to the COVID-19 surveillance data in the United Kingdom (UK). The reconstructed instantaneous CFR gradually increased from 1.0% in September to 2.2% in November 2020 and stabilized at this level thereafter, which monitors the mortality risk of COVID-19 on a real-time basis. We identified a link between the SARS-CoV-2 mutation activity at molecular scale and COVID-19 mortality risk at population scale, and found that the 501Y variants may slightly but not significantly increase 18% of fatality risk than the preceding 501N variants. We found no statistically significant evidence of change in COVID-19 mortality risk associated with 501Y variants, and highlighted the real-time estimating potentials of the modelling framework.","output":"Inferring the Association between the Risk of COVID-19 Case Fatality and N501Y Substitution in SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading fast globally.

Whether psychological interventions can be a viable alternative or addition to antidepressants remains unclear. AIMS To compare the effectiveness of psychological interventions as an alternative (including delivered when tapering antidepressants) or addition to antidepressants alone for preventing depressive relapse. METHOD Embase, PubMed, the Cochrane Library and PsycINFO were searched from inception until 13 October 2019. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with previously depressed patients in (partial) remission where preventive psychological interventions with or without antidepressants (including tapering) were compared with antidepressant control were included. Data were extracted independently from published trials. A random-effects meta-analysis on time to relapse (hazard ratio, HR) and risk of relapse (risk ratio, RR) at the last point of follow-up was conducted. PROSPERO ID: CRD42017055301. RESULTS Among 11 included trials (n = 1559), we did not observe an increased risk of relapse for participants receiving a psychological intervention while tapering antidepressants versus antidepressants alone (RR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.84-1.25; P = 0.85). Psychological interventions added to antidepressants significantly reduced the risk of relapse (RR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.97; P = 0.01) compared with antidepressants alone. CONCLUSIONS This study found no evidence to suggest that adding a psychological intervention to tapering increases the risk of relapse when compared with antidepressants alone. Adding a psychological intervention to antidepressant use reduces relapse risk significantly versus antidepressants alone.

However, recent molecular information about carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRK) epidemiology in Portugal is still scarce. Thus, this study aimed to provide the molecular epidemiology, resistome, and virulome of CRK clinical strains recovered from a tertiary care hospital centre (2019C2021) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the advanced molecular technique whole-genome sequencing (WGS). PCR amplification of carbapenemase genes was performed in 437 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strains. The most frequent carbapenemases were: KPC-3 (42%), followed by OXA-181 (20%), GES-5 (0.2%), and NDM-1 (0.2%). Additionally, 10 strains (2%) coproduced KPC-3 and OXA-181, and 1 strain coproduced KPC-3 and OXA-48 (0.2%). The genomic population structure of 68 strains characterized by WGS demonstrated the ongoing dissemination of four main high-risk clones: ST13, ST17, ST147, and ST307, while no clones belonging to the European predominant clonal groups (CG15 and CG258) were found. Moreover, we describe one K. pneumoniae ST39-KL62 that coproduced the NDM-1 carbapenemase and the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase CTX-M-15, and one K. pneumoniae ST29-KL54 GES-5 and BEL-1 coproducer. Furthermore, a high prevalence of iron siderophores were present in all CRK strains, with several strains presenting both colibactin and the hypermucoviscosity phenotype.

Objective: To conduct an updated and comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis comparing mortality and severe adverse events (AEs) associated with receipt vs nonreceipt of ACEIs or ARBs among patients with COVID-19. Data Sources: PubMed and Embase databases were systematically searched from December 31, 2019, until September 1, 2020. Study Selection: The meta-analysis included any study design, with the exception of narrative reviews or opinion-based articles, in which COVID-19 was diagnosed through laboratory or radiological test results and in which clinical outcomes (unadjusted or adjusted) associated with COVID-19 were assessed among adult patients (&#8805;18 years) receiving ACEIs or ARBs. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Three authors independently extracted data on mortality and severe AEs associated with COVID-19. Severe AEs were defined as intensive care unit admission or the need for assisted ventilation. For each outcome, a random-effects model was used to compare the odds ratio (OR) between patients receiving ACEIs or ARBs vs those not receiving ACEIs or ARBs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Unadjusted and adjusted ORs for mortality and severe AEs associated with COVID-19. Results: A total of 1788 records from the PubMed and Embase databases were identified; after removal of duplicates, 1664 records were screened, and 71 articles underwent full-text evaluation. Clinical data were pooled from 52 eligible studies (40 cohort studies, 6 case series, 4 case-control studies, 1 randomized clinical trial, and 1 cross-sectional study) enrolling 101a?949 total patients, of whom 26 545 (26.0%) were receiving ACEIs or ARBs. When adjusted for covariates, significant reductions in the risk of death (adjusted OR [aOR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43-0.76; P < .001) and severe AEs (aOR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.88; P < .001) were found. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses of a subgroup of patients with hypertension indicated decreases in the risk of death (unadjusted OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.49-0.91]; P = .01; aOR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.32-0.84]; P = .008) and severe AEs (unadjusted OR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.54-0.91]; P = .007; aOR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.36-0.85]; P = .007). Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, receipt of ACEIs or ARBs was not associated with a higher risk of multivariable-adjusted mortality and severe AEs among patients with COVID-19 who had either hypertension or multiple comorbidities, supporting the recommendations of medical societies. On the contrary, ACEIs and ARBs may be associated with protective benefits, particularly among patients with hypertension.

Exposed persons who were in quarantine could be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on or after quarantine day 7. Those who had remained asymptomatic throughout quarantine and who received a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result on or after day 7 could end quarantine. This policy was based on a report suggesting that symptom onset occurs within this time frame in approximately three quarters of COVID-19 cases (1) and on consultation of the Vermont Health Commissioner with the U.S. Surgeon General. VDH implemented this policy to minimize restrictions on state residents, recognizing that some reduction could occur in the prevention benefit of quarantine to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. State-run SARS-CoV-2 testing sites were made available to increase access to no-cost testing and facilitate implementation of this policy. During August 1-December 1, among persons seeking testing at a VDH SARS-CoV-2 testing site, 36% stated that their reason for seeking testing was to end quarantine early (VDH, unpublished data, December 7, 2020), indicating that persons were aware of and following the policy and using the testing services provided. To assess the effectiveness of this policy, VDH analyzed testing data for contacts of persons with a COVID-19 diagnosis. During May 8-November 16, VDH identified 8,798 exposed contacts of COVID-19 patients; 3,983 (45%) had sought testing within 14 days of their exposure, with day 0 defined as the date of last exposure noted in the case investigation record. Among these persons, 2,200 (55%) who received testing on days 7-10 were included in this analysis; 977 (44.9%) of these contacts had a specimen collected for testing on day 7.

In view that melatonin has been recommended as an adjuvant treatment in COVID-19 pandemic mainly due to its anti-inflammatory properties, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the history of COVID-19 infection and the requirement of hospitalization in a group of adult patients previously treated with melatonin for various sleep disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study of data from a closed population of 110 adult patients at a University Hospital treated with melatonin for various sleep disorders, analyzed until the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic and melatonin-related variables (dose, treatment time) were analyzed and were reevaluated during the pandemic period, by scheduled tele-consultation regarding diagnosis, hospitalization requirements, variables related to COVID-19 infection prior to specific vaccination. Categorical variables were described as relative and absolute frequencies. RESULTS: N = 110 patients. Age range = 40- 96 years (mean = 71 years  9.9), older adults > 65 years: N =87 (79,1%). COVID-19 infection was recorded in 15 patients (13.5%) requiring hospitalization in 5 of those infected, only one of them with severe pneumonia. There were no deaths due to COVID-19. There were no differences between infected vs. uninfected in age (p = 0.74), body mass index (p = 0.65) or melatonin dose (p = 0.10).The melatonin dose range was 3-150 mg / day (mean = 46.33  34.1), older adults receiving a mean dose of 50,3  35,6.The 75.5% of the patients were treated for at least 12 months with melatonin. CONCLUSION: We found that 13.5% of patients previously treated with melatonin for various sleep disorders were infected by COVID-19, requiring hospitalization with subsequent medical discharge one third of them. According to national records the lethality rate in older adults in August 2020 was 10.5%. No patient treated with melatonin died for this cause in this sample. We did not find statistically significant differences in terms of indicated melatonin dose, age or body mass index, when comparing those infected with those not infected. The patients in general were mostly older adults, treated with a mean dose greater than 40 mg / day of melatonin for various sleep disorders, mainly for complaints of insomnia, for more than 12 months. The results are consistent with a possible preventive effect of melatonin in the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"[Pre-pandemic melatonin treatment for sleep disorders and COVID-19 infection.

The rapid spreading of the virus effected, among other things, restriction on the freedom of movement. The EU member states introduced national response measures to contain the pandemic and protect public health. While broadly similar, the measures differ with regard to strictness and the manner of introduction, reflecting the political legitimacy of the respective country. With the 'Guidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers during COVID-19 outbreak' - its first COVID-19-related Communication - the European Commission (EC) attempted to curb differing practices of the EU member states and ensure a coordinated approach. Ultimately, this action was aimed at upholding of fundamental rights as guaranteed to EU citizens, one such being the freedom of movement. Thus, from the very start of the pandemic, the coordinated actions of EU institutions sought to contain the spread of COVID-19 infections with the support and cooperation of EU member states. This is confirmed by the most recent Council of the EU (Council) recommendation on a coordinated approach to restrictions to freedom of movement within the EU of October 2020. While they did prevent the spread of infection and save countless lives, the movement restriction measures and the resulting uncertainty have greatly affected the people, the society, and the economy, thereby demonstrating that they cannot remain in force for an extended period. This paper examines the measures introduced by EU member states and analyses the legal basis for introducing therewith limitations on human rights and market freedoms. To what extent are the EU and member states authorized to introduce restrictions on the freedom of movement in the interest of public health? Have the EU and member states breached their obligations regarding market freedoms and fundamental rights under the Treaty?

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are common during surgery and there is evidence of wide variability in practice. METHODS Major electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL), guideline clearinghouses and Google Scholar were systematically searched from inception to January 2019 for CPGs pertaining to indications for intraoperative RBC transfusion. Eligible guidelines were retrieved and their quality assessed using AGREE II. Relevant recommendations were abstracted and synthesized to allow for a comparison between guidelines. RESULTS Ten guidelines published between 1992 and 2018 provided indications for intraoperative transfusions. No guideline addressed intraoperative transfusion decision-making as its primary focus. Six guidelines provided criteria for transfusion based on hemoglobin (range 6.0-10.0 g/dL) or hematocrit (<30%) triggers. In the absence of objective transfusion rules, CPGs recommended considering other parameters such as blood loss (n = 7), signs of end organ ischemia (n = 5), and hemodynamics (n = 4). Evidence supporting intraoperative recommendations was extrapolated primarily from the non-operative setting. There was wide variability in the quality of included guidelines based on AGREE II scores. CONCLUSION This review has identified several clinical practice guidelines providing recommendations for intraoperative transfusion. The existing guidelines were noted to be highly variable in their recommendations and to lack a sufficient evidence base from the intraoperative setting. This represents a major knowledge gap in the literature.","output":"Intraoperative Red Blood Cell Transfusion Decision-Making: A systematic Review of Guidelines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to explore which age group out of the patients in quarantine wards with novel coronavirus pneumonia is the most susceptible to anxiety.

Design PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Sciences, WHO COVID-19 database and Google Scholar were used to identify articles published up to 20 July 2021. Peer-reviewed studies reporting adjusted estimates of the association between overweight or obesity and COVID-19 outcomes were included. Three authors reviewed the articles and agreed. The quality of eligible studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the combined effects. Results A total of 208 studies with 3 550 997 participants from over 32 countries were included in this meta-analysis. Being overweight was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisations (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.28, n=21 studies), but not death (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.13, n=21). However, patients with obesity were at increased risk of both COVID-19-related hospitalisations (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.62 to 1.84, n=58) and death (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.32, n=77).

However, many countries are facing limited supply of vaccine doses and medications. A model estimating the probabilities for hospitalization and mortality according to individual risk factors and vaccine doses received could help prioritize vaccination and yet scarce medications to maximize lives saved and reduce the burden on hospitalization facilities. MethodsElectronic health records from 101,039 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, since the beginning of the pandemic and until November 30, 2021 were extracted from a national healthcare organization in Israel. Logistic regression models were built to estimate the risk for subsequent hospitalization and death based on the number of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine doses received and few major risk factors (age, sex, body mass index, hemoglobin A1C, kidney function, and presence of hypertension, pulmonary disease and malignancy). ResultsThe models built predict the outcome of newly infected individuals with remarkable accuracy: area under the curve was 0.889 for predicting hospitalization, and 0.967 for predicting mortality. Even when a breakthrough infection occurs, having received three vaccination doses significantly reduces the risk of hospitalization by 66% (OR=0.339) and of death by 78% (OR=0.223).

Total duration of stretching per session increased from 540 s (week 1) to 900 s (week 12). At baseline, week 12 and after 3 weeks of detraining, muscle architecture at the middle and the distal part of both gastrocnemius heads (medialis and lateralis) and ankle angle were examined at rest and at maximum dorsiflexion.

Consecutive adult patients presenting to the ED of two university hospitals in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, between 01-10-2020 and 31-12-2020, who had a final diagnosis of COVID-19, were retrospectively included. D-dimer and CTPA results were obtained. Of 541 patients with a final diagnosis of COVID-19 presenting to the ED, 25 (4.6%) were excluded because D-dimer was missing, and 71 (13.1%) because they used anticoagulation therapy. Of 445 included patients, 185 (41.6%; 95%CI 37.0C46.3) had a D-dimer  1.00 mg/L. CTPA was performed in 169 of them, which showed PE in 26 (15.4%; 95%CI 10.3C21.7), resulting in an overall detection rate of 5.8% (95%CI 3.9C8.4) in the complete study group. In patients with and without PE at CTPA, median D-dimer was 9.84 (IQR 3.90C29.38) and 1.64 (IQR 1.17C3.01), respectively (p < 0.001).

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed. 141 MS and/or NMOSD experts from Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Brazil were invited to answer an web-based survey. RESULTS: A total of 129 (91.48 %) experts completed the survey. Only 19.4% had experience in TM previous COVID-19 pandemic, while 79.8% are currently using TM, most using video call (52.3%). Using TM, 44.1% of the experts were able to perform neurological examination, 85.6% believed to be able to identify a relapse, 48.6% use Patient Determined Disease Steps and 38.7% kept using the conventional Expanded Disability Status Scale. CONCLUSION: Our survey demonstrates preparedness and responsiveness among South American MS and/or NMOSD experts. Despite scarce prior TM experience, most experts felt confident to use TM as a new tool for monitoring their patients.","output":"Experience of South American MS and/or NMOSD experts in practice during the COVID-19 pandemic: Focus on Telemedicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To collate best practice recommendations on the management of patients receiving in-center hemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on published reports and current public health advice, while considering ethical principles and the unique circumstances of Canadian hemodialysis units across the country. Sources of information: The workgroup members used Internet search engines to retrieve documents from provincial and local hemodialysis programs; provincial public health agencies; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; webinars and slides from other kidney agencies; and nonreviewed preprints. PubMed was used to search for peer-reviewed published articles. Informal input was sought from knowledge users during a webinar. Methods: Challenges in the care of hemodialysis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted within the Canadian Senior Renal Leaders Forum discussion group. The Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN) developed the COVID-19 rapid response team (RRT) to address these challenges. They identified a pan-Canadian team of clinicians and administrators with expertise in hemodialysis to form the workgroup. One lead was chosen who drafted the initial document. Members of the workgroup reviewed and discussed all recommendations in detail during 2 virtual meetings on April 7 and April 9. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The document was reviewed by the CSN COVID-19 RRT, an ethicist, an infection control expert, a community nephrologist, and a patient partner. Content was presented during an interactive webinar on April 11, 2020 attended by 269 kidney health professionals, and the webinar and first draft of the document were posted online. Final revisions were made based on feedback received until April 13, 2020. CJKHD editors reviewed the parallel process peer review and edited the manuscript for clarity. Key findings: Recommendations were made under the following themes: (1) Identification of patients with COVID-19 in the dialysis unit, (2) hemodialysis of patients with confirmed COVID-19, (3) hemodialysis of patients not yet known to have COVID-19, (4) visitors; (5) testing for COVID-19 in the dialysis unit; (6) resuscitation, (6) routine hemodialysis care, (7) hemodialysis care under fixed dialysis resources. Limitations: Because of limitations of time and resources, and the large number of questions, formal systematic review was not undertaken. The recommendations are based on expert opinion and subject to bias. The parallel review process that was created may not be as robust as the standard peer review process. Implications: We hope that these recommendations provide guidance for dialysis unit directors, clinicians, and administrators on how to limit risk from infection and adverse outcomes, while providing necessary dialysis care in a setting of finite resources. We also identify a number of resource allocation priorities, which we hope will inform decisions at provincial funding agencies.","output":"Management of Outpatient Hemodialysis During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Recommendations From the Canadian Society of Nephrology COVID-19 Rapid Response Team"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel viral respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for an epidemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in cases in China and worldwide.

However, an important question has been raised about how to select the effective and secure medications for COVID-19 patients. The aim of this analysis was to assess the efficacy and safety of the various medications available for severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients based on randomized placebo-controlled trials (RPCTs). Methods: We did an updated network meta-analysis. We searched the databases from inception until July 31, 2021, with no language restrictions. We included RPCTs comparing 49 medications and placebo in the treatment of severe and non-severe patients (aged 18 years or older) with COVID-19 infection. We extracted data on the trial and patient characteristics, and the following primary outcomes: all-cause mortality, the ratios of virological cure, and treatment-emergent adverse events. Odds ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) were used as effect estimates. Results: From 3,869 publications, we included 61 articles related to 73 RPCTs (57 in non-severe COVID-19 patients and 16 in severe COVID-19 patients), comprising 20,680 patients. The mean sample size was 160 (interquartile range 96C393) in this study. The median duration of follow-up drugs intervention was 28 days (interquartile range 21C30). For increase in virological cure, we only found that proxalutamide (OR 9.16, 95% CI 3.15C18.30), ivermectin (OR 6.33, 95% CI 1.22C32.86), and low dosage bamlanivimab (OR 5.29, 95% CI 1.12C24.99) seemed to be associated with non-severe COVID-19 patients when compared with placebo, in which proxalutamide seemed to be better than low dosage bamlanivimab (OR 5.69, 95% CI 2.43C17.65). For decrease in all-cause mortality, we found that proxalutamide (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.09C0.19), imatinib (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25C0.96), and baricitinib (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42C0.82) seemed to be associated with non-severe COVID-19 patients; however, we only found that immunoglobulin gamma (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08C0.89) was related to severe COVID-19 patients when compared with placebo. For change in treatment-emergent adverse events, we only found that sotrovimab (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.13C0.34) was associated with non-severe COVID-19 patients; however, we did not find any medications that presented a statistical difference when compared with placebo among severe COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: We conclude that marked variations exist in the efficacy and safety of medications between severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19. It seems that monoclonal antibodies (e.g., low dosage bamlanivimab, baricitinib, imatinib, and sotrovimab) are a better choice for treating severe or non-severe COVID-19 patients. Clinical decisions to use preferentially medications should carefully consider the risk-benefit profile based on efficacy and safety of all active interventions in patients with COVID-19 at different levels of infection.","output":"Efficacy and safety of current medications for treating severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients: an updated network meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) greatly affected peoples lifestyles.

College students (N = 295) completed questions on sociodemographic characteristics, the Neck Disability Index (NDI), the Perceived Stress Scale, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and NP frequency (four-point scale). Logistic regression models were calculated with the NDI as the dependent variable. In total, 35.6% of students experienced at least moderate NP-related disability (NDI  15), more during than before the lockdown. NP increased gradually, from a lifetime mean of 1.80 to a lockdown mean of 3.07 ((2) = 316.72; p < 0.001). Students self-perceived stress was moderate, and 59.3% reported experiencing study-related stress.

METHODS: We evaluated ordering patterns during cardiovascular (CV) telehealth clinic visits in the Duke University Health System between March 15 - June 30, 2020 and 30-day outcomes compared with in-person visits in the same time frame in 2020 and in 2019. RESULTS: Within the Duke University Health System, there was a 33.1% decrease in the number of outpatient CV visits conducted in the first 15 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with the same time period in 2019. As a proportion of total visits initially booked, 53% of visits were cancelled in 2020 compared to 35% in 2019. However, patients with cancelled visits had similar demographics and comorbidities in 2019 and 2020. Telehealth visits comprised 9.3% of total visits initially booked in 2020, with younger and healthier patients utilizing telehealth compared with those utilizing in-person visits. Compared with in-person visits in 2020, telehealth visits were associated with fewer new (31.6% for telehealth vs 44.6% for in person) or refill (12.9% vs 15.6%, respectively) medication prescriptions, ECGs (4.3% vs 31.4%), laboratory orders (5.9% vs 21.8%), echocardiograms (7.3% vs 98.%), and stress tests (4.4% vs 6.6%). When adjusted for age, race, and insurance status, those who had a telehealth visit or cancelled their visit were less likely to have an emergency department (ED) or hospital encounter within 30 days compared with those who had in-person visits (aRR 0.76 [95% 0.65, 0.89] and aRR 0.71 [95% 0.65, 0.78], respectively).

thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy Recent studies have indicated a worse prognosis for people with COVID-19 who developed thromboembolism Anticoagulants are medications used in the prevention and treatment of venous or arterial thromboembolic events Several drugs are used in the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic events, such as heparinoids (heparins or pentasaccharides), vitamin K antagonists and direct anticoagulants Besides their anticoagulant properties, heparinoids have an additional anti-inflammatory potential, that may affect the clinical evolution of people with COVID-19 Some practical guidelines address the use of anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis in people with COVID-19, however, the benefit of anticoagulants for people with

Survey showed that 84% students of Industrial Engineering, Mulawarman University used smartphone while learning from home. Therefore, this study aimed to identify students behavior, to measure physical (i.e., musculoskeletal and visual fatique) and mental health (i.e., stress and smartphone addiction) problems that occurred when they were learning from home, as well as to suggest ergonomic recommendation for reducing the negative effects. At the time of the study, they were 155 students studied in the IE department and a total of 134 (86.45%) participated in the online survey. Musculoskeletal disorder was assessed using Nordic Body Map and visual fatique was evaluated using symptoms that were reported on previous studies. Additionally, Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were administered to identify smartphone addiction tendency and stress level respectively. The results showed that MSD occurred in left and right shoulder (95%), followed by upper neck (82.14%) and back (72.62%). 86% of participants experienced visual fatique with headache (71.55%), ache eye (68%) and dry eye (60.34%) symptoms. Subsequently, this survey revealed that 35% of the participants addicted to smartphone and 68.66% experienced moderate level of stress. To alleviate these physical problems, several ergonomic recommendations were proposed i.e., supporting the arm that holding the smartphone with the other hand, practicing the 20-20-20 rule and applying stop, drop and flop slogan.

However, there have been few systematic animal experiments demonstrating the virus distribution after H7N9 virus infection. The present study was carried out to investigate the viral distribution and pathological changes in the main organs of mice after experimental infection with highly pathogenic H7N9 virus. METHODS: Infection of mice with A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) virus was achieved via nasal inoculation. Mice were killed at 2, 3, and 7 days post infection. The other mice were used to observe their illness status and weight changes. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and viral isolation were used to analyse the characteristics of viral invasion. The pathological changes of the main organs were observed using haematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The weight of H7N9 virus-infected mice increased slightly in the first two days. However, the weight of the mice decreased sharply in the following days, by up to 20%. All the mice had died by the 8th day post infection and showed multiple organ injury. The emergence of viremia in mice was synchronous with lung infection. On the third day post infection, except in the brain, the virus could be isolated from all organs (lung, heart, kidney, liver, and spleen). On the seventh day post infection, the virus could be detected in all six organs. Brain infection was detected in all mice, and the viral titre in the heart, kidney, and spleen infection was high. CONCLUSION: Acute diffuse lung injury was the initial pathogenesis in highly pathogenic H7N9 virus infection.

However, some patients fail to achieve>50% of their excess weight loss (EWL), and others regain much of the weight that they lost. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to analyze early outcomes after conversion of RYGB to duodenal switch (DS) in terms of weight loss, change in co-morbidities, and complications. SETTING This is a retrospective analysis from 1 surgeon at a single private institution. METHODS We analyzed data from 32 obese patients retrospectively who underwent revision for failed RYGB. Nine patients underwent DS with Roux-en-Y reconstruction (RYDS), and 23 patients underwent single anastomosis DS between October 2012 and December 2015. Regression analyses were performed for all follow-up weight-loss data. RESULTS The patients experienced mean EWL of 16.2% over an average of 16 years (range: 0-38) with their primary RYGB surgery. Of 32 patients who underwent revision DS, 22 patients are beyond the 1-year postoperative mark (follow-up 81.8%), and 15 patients are beyond the 2-year postoperative mark (follow-up 73.3%). One patient was lost to follow-up. The patients experienced mean EWL of 31.2%, 45.1%, 51%, 54.2%, 56%, and 56.4% at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively, after their revisional surgery.

Against the background of cooperative promotion of big data and low-carbon policy, this paper constructs a cooperative game model under non cooperative game and demand disturbance respectively, analysing and discussing equilibrium strategy of supply chain. The results show that the price set by the manufacturer increases with the improvement of its technical level when consumers are more sensitive to technical level;with the increase of the Carbon Emission Technology Renewal Coefficient, the optimal price of all the three manufacturers will drop;when the market promotion rate is in the middle range, the price of zinc-nickel battery will be higher than that of lithium battery. In the demand disturbance model, the supply chain determines different optimal prices according to the different ranges of demand disturbance.","output":"Research On Equilibrium Strategy and Emergency Management of Three Oligarch Battery Manufacturers Under Cooperative Promotion and Low-Carbon Policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To describe lessons learned during the first COVID-19 outbreak in developing urgent interventions to strengthen healthcare workers capacity to cope with acute stress caused by health care pressure, concern about becoming infected, despair of witnessing patients suffering, and critical decision-making requirements of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic during the first outbreak in Spain. Methods: A task force integrated by healthcare professionals and academics was activated following the first observations of acute stress reactions starting to compromise the professionals capacity for caring COVID-19 patients. Literature review and qualitative approach (consensus techniques) were applied. The target population included health professionals in primary care, hospitals, emergencies, and nursing homes. Interventions designed for addressing acute stress were agreed and disseminated. Findings: There are similarities in stressors to previous outbreaks, and the solutions devised then may work now. A set of issues, interventions to cope with, and their levels of evidence were defined. Issues and interventions were classified as: adequate communication initiative to strengthen work morale (avoiding information blackouts, uniformity of criteria, access to updated information, mentoring new professionals); resilience and recovery from physical and mental fatigue (briefings, protecting the family, regulated recovery time during the day, psychological first aid, humanizing care); reinforce leadership of intermediate commands (informative leadership, transparency, realism, and positive messages, the current state of emergency has not allowed for an empirical analysis of the effectiveness of proposed interventions. Sharing information to gauge expectations, listening to what professionals need, feeling protected from threats, organizational flexibility, encouraging teamwork, and leadership that promotes psychological safety have led to more positive responses. Attention to the needs of individuals must be combined with caring for the teams responsible for patient care. Conclusions: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has a more devastating effect than other recent outbreaks, there are common stressors and lessons learned in all of them that we must draw on to increase our capacity to respond to future healthcare crises.","output":"Addressing Acute Stress among Professionals Caring for COVID-19 Patients: Lessons Learned during the First Outbreak in Spain (MarchCApril 2020)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUNDDespite a rapidly growing body of literature on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), our understanding of the immune correlates of disease severity, course, and outcome remains poor.METHODSUsing mass cytometry, we assessed the immune landscape in longitudinal whole-blood specimens from 59 patients presenting with acute COVID-19 and classified based on maximal disease severity. Hospitalized patients negative for SARS-CoV-2 were used as controls.RESULTSWe found that the immune landscape in COVID-19 formed 3 dominant clusters, which correlated with disease severity. Longitudinal analysis identified a pattern of productive innate and adaptive immune responses in individuals who had a moderate disease course, whereas those with severe disease had features suggestive of a protracted and dysregulated immune response. Further, we identified coordinate immune alterations accompanying clinical improvement and decline that were also seen in patients who received IL-6 pathway blockade.CONCLUSIONThe hospitalized COVID-19 negative cohort allowed us to identify immune alterations that were shared between severe COVID-19 and other critically ill patients. Collectively, our findings indicate that selection of immune interventions should be based in part on disease presentation and early disease trajectory due to the profound differences in the immune response in those with mild to moderate disease and those with the most severe disease.FUNDINGBenaroya Family Foundation, the Leonard and Norma Klorfine Foundation, Glenn and Mary Lynn Mounger, and the National Institutes of Health.","output":"The COVID-19 immune landscape is dynamically and reversibly correlated with disease severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considering the similarities with other pandemics due to respiratory virus infections and subsequent development of neurological disorders (e.g. encephalitis lethargica after the 1918 influenza), there is growing concern about a possible new wave of neurological complications following the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, data on COVID-19-related encephalitis and movement disorders are still limited. Herein, we describe the clinical and neuroimaging (FDG-PET/CT, MRI and DaT-SPECT) findings of two patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathy who developed prominent parkinsonism. None of the patients had previous history of parkinsonian signs/symptoms, and none had prodromal features of Parkinson's disease (hyposmia or RBD). Both developed a rapidly progressive form of atypical parkinsonism along with distinctive features suggestive of encephalitis. A possible immune-mediated etiology was suggested in Patient 2 by the presence of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands, but none of the patients responded favorably to immunotherapy. Interestingly, FDG-PET/CT findings were similar in both cases and reminiscent of those observed in post-encephalitic parkinsonism, with cortical hypo-metabolism associated with hyper-metabolism in the brainstem, mesial temporal lobes, and basal ganglia. Patient's FDG-PET/CT findings were validated by performing a Statistical Parametric Mapping analysis and comparing the results with a cohort of healthy controls (n = 48). Cerebrum cortical thickness map was obtained in Patient 1 from MRI examinations to evaluate the structural correlates of the metabolic alterations detected with FDG-PET/CT. Hypermetabolic areas correlated with brain regions showing increased cortical thickness, suggesting their involvement during the inflammatory process.

Substantial research gaps remain regarding the impact of the pandemic on access to abortion care. METHODS: We performed a cohort analysis of abortion requests made through the telemedicine abortion service Women on Web (WoW) between 18 March 2020 and 4 May 2020. We used binary logistic regression analyses to test the association between COVID-19 as a reason for the help request and reporting having had an ultrasound to determine gestation and/or use of contraception. A subanalysis of Italy, Argentina, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was executed to explore differences between countries. RESULTS: Of requests made during the study period, 43.5% (n=1972) were COVID-19-related. A negative association was found with having had an ultrasound to determine gestation length and COVID-19-related requests. Italy had the highest percentage (66.5%, n=117) of COVID-19-related requests in the subanalysis, followed by Argentina (55.3%, n=68), Malaysia (51.9%, n=41) and the UAE (44.4%, n=75).

The aims of the study were to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression in university students and to identify associated risk factors. DESIGN AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to 2,009 students in the University of Patras, Greece, during the national lockdown. Socio-demographic, academic data, and the forced disruption of daily life were assessed along with the Greek version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: Anxiety and depression prevalence was 35.8% and 51.2% respectively. Age, school of study, financial status, self-perceived health status, level of satisfaction with the state's and university's response and specific aspects in the daily routine were associated with both anxiety and depression scores. At higher odds of both depression and anxiety were students with low income, bad health status, annoyed at staying home and those who encountered difficulties with the online education system. Additional risk factors for depression were studies in humanities and social sciences, and low satisfaction with the university's response, while for anxiety were studies in agricultural sciences and absence of information about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of Greek students showing depression and anxiety, during the restrictive measures, is alarming. Mental health in university students should be monitored.

Practices were stratified according to their proportion of high-needs enrolled patients (Maori, Pacific or living in an area with the highest quintile of socioeconomic deprivation). Funding per practice was calculated for separate and total payments according to practice stratum of high-needs enrolled patients. RESULTS: The median combined March and April funding for general practices with 80% high-needs patients was 28% higher per practice ($36,674 vs $28,686) and 48% higher per patient ($10.50 vs $7.11) compared with the funding received by general practices with fewer than 20% high-needs patients. Although the March allocation did increase funding for high-needs patients, the April allocation did not.

Thus, what looks like a successful mitigation strategy in the short run, may prove to have devastating long-run effects.

It was believed that children fell ill from the infection more often, although the course of infection in the vast majority of pediatric cases has been asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. In April and May 2020, the first report of a rapidly progressing disease, similar to Kawasaki syndrome, was found in children who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Shortly thereafter, children with symptoms of pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS-ST [temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection]) began presenting to pediatric hospitals around the world. The syndrome has a mortality rate of up to 2%.

METHODS: This pilot study explored the use of virtual visits to collect functional information on patients living with heart failure. Patients were enrolled in an outpatient setting. Informed consent was obtained. Baseline testing consisted of patient-reported New York Hospital Association class, quality-of-life surveys (EQ-5D-5L, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ], Frailty Index for Elders), and cognitive assessments (Mini-Cog).

Propofol and dexmedetomidine, as widely used sedatives in patients with sepsis, are likely to depress gastrointestinal peristalsis. We queried whether propofol or dexmedetomidine, at sedative doses, aggravated sepsis-induced ileus. METHODS Sedative/Anesthetic Scores and vital signs of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemic mice were measured during sedation with propofol or dexmedetomidine. Endotoxemic mice were divided into 10% fat emulsion, propofol, saline, and dexmedetomidine group. The gastric emptying, small intestinal transit, tests of colonic motility, gastrointestinal transit and whole gut transit were evaluated at 15 mins and 24 h after intraperitoneal injection of sedatives/vehicles respectively. RESULTS 40 mgkg- 1propofol and 80 gkg- 1 dexmedetomidine induced a similar depth of sedation with comparable vital signs except that dexmedetomidine strikingly decreased heart rate in endotoxemic mice. Dexmedetomidine markedly inhibited gastric emptying (P = 0.006), small intestinal transit (P = 0.006), colonic transit (P = 0.0006), gastrointestinal transit (P = 0.0001) and the whole gut transit (P = 0.034) compared with the vehicle, whereas propofol showed no depression on all parts of gastrointestinal motility 15 mins after administration. The inhibitive effects of dexmedetomidine in these tests vanished 24 h after the administration. CONCLUSIONS Deep sedation with dexmedetomidine, but not propofol, significantly inhibited gastrointestinal peristalsis in endotoxemic mice while the inhibitory effect disappeared 24 h after sedation. These data suggested that both propofol and dexmedetomidine could be applied in septic patients while dexmedetomidine should be used cautiously in patients with cardiac disease or ileus.","output":"Effect of sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol on gastrointestinal motility in lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemic mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"China has been a pivotal player throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, yet there is very little research on how China's role and effort have been interpreted among African countries that are diverged in their crisis responses.

Open or traditional ventral hernia repairs involve the significant morbidity and expense of a laparotomy and a significant risk of recurrent herniation. Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) may offer a less-invasive alternative with shorter length of hospital stay, fewer cardiopulmonary complications, and low recurrence rates. METHODS 225 patients underwent laparoscopic ventral hernia repairs in which carboxymethylcellulose-sodium hyaluronate coating (Sepramesh, Davol, Providence, RI) was used primarily. All cases were included prospectively from the study period of 2002 through 2009. Patient characteristics were recorded, and follow-up analysis was performed over a period of 42 mo following surgery. Recurrence, reoperations, and all complications were recorded. Mesh awareness and mesh-related pain were assessed using the hernia-specific Carolinas Comfort Scale (CCS) instrument, completed by 72 patients. RESULTS Over 42 mo of follow-up, 2 ventral hernias have recurred, and no long-term bowel erosion or fistulization has occurred. Little or no mesh-related symptoms were reported, and mean scores for mesh awareness and mesh pain were 3.6 and 3.2, respectively, on a scale from 0 - 40 (lower scores signify less pain or awareness). Two serious early complications occurred related to intestinal ileus and metal tacks producing intestinal perforation, and this led to a change in the tacking devices used. CONCLUSIONS LVHR with carboxymethylcellulose-sodium hyaluronate coating (Sepramesh) is safe and effective. Complications are rare, the repair is durable, and long-term results are good with rare recurrences, low awareness of mesh, and little pain. Technical lessons include use of at least one transfascial suture and the avoidance of metal tacks for fixation.","output":"Long-term durability and comfort of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The recent unprecedented pandemic caused by Sars-Cov-2 (the new coronavirus 2019), is threatening public health around the world.

METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective cohort study of 285 confirmed Covid-19 in patients at (XXX). Depending on the date of admission, the patients were divided into two groups; group 1 (oseltamivir group) from February 20, 2020 to March 15, 2020 received Oseltamivir with routine regimen and group 2 (control group) from March 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020 received routine regimen alone that included Azithromycin 500 mg/day and Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg/12 h. Endpoints including duration of hospitalization, requirement to admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation, outcome and mortality rate. RESULTS: A total of 285 patients were enrolled in the two months, 120 patients for group 1 and 165 for group 2. The median time from admission to discharge was significantly shorter in the oseltamivir group compared to the control group (4.9 vs 6.6 days, p < 0.001). Additionally, the mortality rate was found to be lower in the oseltamivir group than in the control group (1.7% vs 6,7%, p = 0.06) which was statistically significant by multivariate analysis (p = 0.03).

AIM To describe the long-term evolution of branch pulmonary artery stents. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study at Tours University Hospital. All stents implanted by surgery or catheterization in branch pulmonary arteries with a minimum follow-up of 12 months and at least one catheterization control were included. The primary endpoint combined cardiovascular mortality, surgical or percutaneous reintervention for stent complication or new stent implantation. RESULTS Between 2007 and 2017, 76 stents in 51 patients were included (62 stents implanted by surgery, 14 by catheterization). At implantation, the patients' mean age and weight were 4.7years (interquartile range 4.2years) and 17.3kg (interquartile range 11.0kg), respectively. Mean branch pulmonary artery minimum diameter was 4.12.1mm (mean Z-score-4.92.9), and mean initial stent diameter was 9.13.1mm. During a follow-up of 5.3years (range 0-11.2 years), freedom from primary endpoint was 86.8% (95% confidence interval 79.6-94.8%) at 1 year, 71.5% (95% confidence interval 61.9-82.7%) at 5years and 69.6% (95% confidence interval 59.6-81.2%) at 10 years. We did not identify any factors associated with major adverse cardiovascular events. Among stents without major adverse cardiovascular events, the mean branch pulmonary artery diameter Z-score at last evaluation had increased by +4.83.2 compared with the initial diameter (P<0.001).

Methods: This retrospective study consisted of 181 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from January 29, 2020 to March 21, 2020 from a major hospital in Wuhan, China. The primary outcome was mortality. Demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests were collected at initial presentation, totaling 78 clinical variables. A deep-learning algorithm and a risk stratification score system were developed to predict mortality. Data were split into 85% training and 15% testing. Prediction performance were compared with those using COVID-19 severity score, CURB-65 score and pneumonia severity index (PSI). Results: Of the 181 COVID-19 patients, 39 expired and 142 survived. Five top predictors of mortality were D-dimer, O2 Index, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. The top 5 predictors and the resultant risk score yielded, respectively, an area under curve (AUC) of 0.968 ([95% CI:0.87-1.0]) and 0.954 ([95% CI:0.80-0.99]) for the testing dataset.

The most recognized extra-skeletal action of vitamin D is the regulation of immune function. Host defense against intracellular pathogens depends upon both innate and adaptive immunity. It has been suggested that vitamin D regulates the pro-inflammatory endothelial response to lipopolysaccharide, rendering it a role in the sepsis cascade. Recent studies have indicated that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with worse outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), such as more severe disease and higher mortality rates. To this end, clinical trials with vitamin D supplementation are being carried out in an effort to improve COVID-19 outcomes. In this review, we will discuss the role of vitamin D in the immune response, and more specifically its effect on immune cells. Subsequently, we will provide an overview of the studies that have investigated the predictive value of vitamin D in critical illness outcomes, and its therapeutic value as a supplement in critically ill patients. Finally, the emerging role of vitamin D deficiency in COVID-19 infection risk, and worse outcomes will be discussed.","output":"Vitamin D in infectious complications in critically ill patients with or without COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To assess the economic impact of bovine coronavirus (BCV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) infections, accurate estimates of their associated effects on animal performance are needed. This study aimed to quantify the variation in individual test-day milk yield and somatic cell count, risk of reproductive failure after first service of dairy cows, and risk of death of calves and heifers according to the BCV and BRSV status of the herd. Three types of status were defined for BCV and BRSV infections, based on 1) the dynamics over a 7-mo period of BCV- and BRSV-specific antibody levels in pooled milk of primiparous cows; 2) the possible occurrence of presumably BCV- and BRSV-related clinical outbreaks; and 3) the combination of both pieces of information. A total of 36,184 test days, 2,716 cows with a first service, and 4,104 calves and heifers in 65 Swedish herds were included in the analyses. Animal performance associated with BCV and BRSV infections was quantified using hierarchical mixed generalized and survival models, after adjustment for covariates known to influence the performance under study. A significant reduction in milk yield was observed for cows in presumably BRSV recently infected herds, as well as in herds having a presumably BRSV-related clinical outbreak (of 0.57 and 0.91 kg/d, respectively), compared with cows in presumably infection-free herds. There was also a significant increase in somatic cell count (of 12,000 cells/mL) for cows located in herds with a BRSV outbreak. The risk of failure after first service, as well as the risk of death in calf and heifer, was numerically higher in BRSV-infected herds, although this was not statistically significant. In contrast, BCV infection herd status, as defined in the present study, was not significantly associated with any production losses in animals from infected herds compared with those in infection-free herds.","output":"Associations between bovine coronavirus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus infections and animal performance in Swedish dairy herds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemic diseases are well known to be fatal and cause great loss worldwideeconomically, socially and mentally Even after around nine months, since the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) began to spread, people are getting infected all over the world This is one of the areas where human medical advancements fail because by the time the disease is identified and its treatment is figured out, most of the population is already exposed to it In such cases, it becomes easier to take steps if the dynamics of the disease and its sensitivity to various factors is known This chapter deals with developing a mathematical model for the spread of Coronavirus disease, by employing a number of parameters that affect its spread A compartmental modelling approach using ordinary differential equation has been used to formulate the set of equations that describe the model We have used the next generation matrix method to find the basic reproduction number of the system and proved that the system is locally asymptotically stable at the disease-free equilibrium for R0&amp;lt;1 Stability and existence of endemic equilibrium have been discussed, followed by sensitivity of infective classes to parameters like proportion of vaccinated individuals and precautionary measures like social distancing It is expected that after the vaccine is developed and is available to use, as the proportion of vaccinated individuals will increase, the infection will decrease in the population which can gradually lead to herd immunity Since, the vaccine is still under development, non-intervention measures play a major role in coping with the disease The disease generally transmits when the water droplets from an infected individuals mouth or nose are inhaled by a healthy individual The best measures that should be adopted are social distancing, washing ones hands frequently, and covering ones mouth with mask, quarantine and lockdowns Thus, as more and more precautionary measures are taken, it would gradually reduce the infection which has also been proved numerically by the sensitivity analysis of w in our dynamical analysis ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"Compartmental Modelling Approach for Accessing the Role of Non-Pharmaceutical Measures in the Spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incidence of severe manifestations of COVID-19 increases with age with older patients showing the highest mortality, suggesting that molecular pathways underlying aging contribute to the severity of COVID-19.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects many different cell types, forcing cell turn-over and regeneration to maintain tissue homeostasis. We hypothesize that presence of short telomeres in older patients limits the tissue response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We measure telomere length in peripheral blood lymphocytes COVID-19 patients with ages between 29 and 85 years-old. We find that shorter telomeres are associated to increased severity of the disease.

It featured in thousands of academic publications and received widespread attention from policymakers and the media. In this article, we trace the origins and use of the infodemic metaphor and examine the blind spots inherent in this seemingly intuitive term. Drawing from literature in the cognitive sciences and communication studies, we show why information does not spread like a virus and point out how the infodemic metaphor can be misleading, as it conflates multiple forms of social behaviour, oversimplifies a complex situation and helps constitute a phenomenon for which concrete evidence remains patchy. We point out the existing tension between the usefulness of the widespread use of the term infodemic and its uncritical adoption, which we argue can do more harm than good, potentially diluting the quality of academic work, public discourse and contributing to state overreach in policymaking.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines and examine the factors associated with the acceptance in Bangladesh. In between January 30 to February 6, 2021, we conducted a web-based anonymous cross-sectional survey among the Bangladeshi general population. At the start of the survey, there was a detailed consent section that explained the studys intent, the types of questions we would ask, the anonymity of the study, and the studys voluntary nature. The survey only continued when a respondent consented, and the answers were provided by the respondents themselves. The multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the factors that influence the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccination. A total of 605 eligible respondents took part in this survey (population size 1630046161 and required sample size 591) with an age range of 18 to 100. A large proportion of the respondents are aged less than 50 (82%) and male (62.15%). The majority of the respondents live in urban areas (60.83%). A total of 61.16% (370/605) of the respondents were willing to accept/take the COVID-19 vaccine. Among the accepted group, only 35.14% showed the willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine immediately, while 64.86% would delay the vaccination until they are confirmed about the vaccines efficacy and safety or COVID-19 becomes deadlier in Bangladesh. The regression results showed age, gender, location (urban/rural), level of education, income, perceived risk of being infected with COVID-19 in the future, perceived severity of infection, having previous vaccination experience after age 18, having higher knowledge about COVID-19 and vaccination were significantly associated with the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. The research reported a high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine refusal and hesitancy in Bangladesh. To diminish the vaccine hesitancy and increase the uptake, the policymakers need to design a well-researched immunization strategy to remove the vaccination barriers. To improve vaccine acceptance among people, false rumors and misconceptions about the COVID-19 vaccines must be dispelled (especially on the internet) and people must be exposed to the actual scientific facts.","output":"Knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and perceived risk about COVID-19 vaccine and determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Skin cancer rates are rising and earlier detection through screening leads to better outcomes.

Design, setting and participants Analysis of all confirmed COVID-19 cases diagnosed in NSW from 1 January to 31 May 2020 extracted from the NSW Notifiable Conditions Information Management System and linked to routinely collected hospitalisation data. Outcome measures In-patient hospitalisations and hospital service utilisation details. Results There were 3,101 COVID-19 cases diagnosed between 1 January and 31 May 2020 in NSW: mean age 46.7 years, 50.5% were females. Overall, 12.5% (n = 389) had a record of inpatient hospitalisation, 4.2% (n = 130) were admitted to ICU and 1.9% (n = 58) received ventilation. Among adult cases, hospital and ICU admission rates increased with increasing age: 2.9% of those aged 20-29 years were hospitalised, increasing to 46.6% of those aged 80-89 years; 0.6% of those aged 20-29 years were admitted to ICU, increasing to 11.2% of those aged 70-79 years. The median time from symptoms to hospitalisation was seven days (IQR 4-11). The median time in hospital was nine days (IQR 4-20), and in ICU six days (IQR 2-15); the median time in hospital increased with older age. Almost half (49.4%) of those hospitalised with a diagnostic code had pneumonia/lower respiratory tract infection and another 36.6% had an upper respiratory tract infection or other known COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusion COVID-19 is a serious infection particularly in older adults. During January to May of 2020, 1 in 8 of those diagnosed in NSW were hospitalised.

Globally, governments, communities, and other partners are experimenting with initiatives to support public participation at a local level. Little is known about how different approaches work, and how changing economic circumstances including the worldwide financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic create challenging circumstances for implementation. This review examined evidence on initiatives to increase peoples involvement in local decision-making, with a focus on how this may be affected by resource constraints. Methods: We carried out a mixed-method systematic review of European empirical literature published since 2008, on initiatives aiming to increase public participation in local decision-making/action which could affect public health outcomes. We supplemented this with worldwide literature outlining theories and frameworks to explore potential change pathways. We used narrative synthesis to analyse the literature identified, and a summary diagram to provide a reporting structure. Results: We included 42 documents. Much literature was from the United Kingdom, and of qualitative or case study design. There was limited reporting of the forms and intended/actual functions of initiatives to enhance public participation and influence. Diverse factors (organisational and community-related factors, features of the participatory process) were noted to shape pathways to potential outcomes. Positive and adverse outcomes were reported for communities, individuals, relationships, and the decision-making process. The review highlights how initiatives may be at risk during times of limited resourcing;undermining individual and community capacities to participate, and requiring organisational leaders to think/act differently. Conclusions: Areas to prioritise for action within local governance systems include: supporting community capabilities;relationships between organisations and communities;creating spaces for safe/equitable interaction and knowledge-sharing;and changing institutional culture. If investment is to be made by local governments or communities themselves in times of resource-constraint, there is an urgent need to clarify the functions of different activities and pathways to improvements in determinants of health and inequity. Support to enable change is needed, particularly in response to deep-seated issues within local governance systems, and more explicit engagement with concepts of politics and power.","output":"Increasing Public Participation and Influence in Local Decision-making to Address Social Determinants of Health During Times of Resource Constraint: A Systematic Review Examining Initiatives and Theories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Targeting the interaction between severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-receptor-binding domain (RBD) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is believed to be an effective strategy for drug design to inhibit the infection of SARS-CoV-2.

Ultrasound was conducted by experienced operators in a portable setting. Conventional six-point lung ultrasound method was used to evaluate B-lines, small (subpleural) consolidation and the pleura. Areas of small consolidation were targeted after intravenous administration of ultrasound contrast.ResultsThe areas of small consolidations, a potential sign of pneumonia on B-mode lung ultrasound, usually enhance on contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Our study revealed these areas to be avascular, indicating an underlying thrombotic/infarction process. Findings were present in 100% of the patients we examined.

During the 1980's coronavirus, genomic RNA was transcribed into a set of subgenomic mRNAs that encode viral proteins containing a leader sequence derived from the 5' end of the genome. The subgenomic mRNAs are transcribed from negative-strand RNAs, synthesized for the full-length genomic RNA - a unique mechanism, presumed to occur by a process involving viral polymerase jumping from one part of the genome template to another, leading to high rate of recombination for coronaviruses, playing role in viral interspecies infections. The sequence of SARS-CoV-2 confined that spike protein has furin cleavage site in the S1/S2 junction different from SARS-CoV and other closely related viruses. This has proved the possibility of Protease inhibitors as antivirals has led to the speculation about virulence and pathogenesis, and it is also possible that this new furin site may serve as a marker to identify a possible precursor virus.

Pandemics share features that increase fear. While some fear can stimulate preventive health behaviors, extreme fear can lead to adverse psychological and behavioral response. The media play a major role shaping these responses. When dealing with a PHEIC, the authorities' communication strategies are embedded in a multilevel governance and a highly hierarchal system, which adds another layer of complexity. Carrying out more 'real-world research' is crucial to generate evidence relating to the psychosocial and behavioral aspects involved during the COVID-19 pandemic and how it is shaped by authorities and media discourses. Interdisciplinary research and international collaborations could contribute to improve our understanding and management of risk information. Emerging from a socio-ecological perspective, future research must integrate multilevel analytical elements, to ensure triangulation of evidence and co-constructing robust recommendations. A mixed-method approach should be privileged to address these issues. At the micro-level, a population-based survey could be conducted in various jurisdictions to assess and compare psychosocial issues according to sociocultural groups. Then, a quantitative/qualitative discourse analysis of the media could be performed.

While theoretically effective, this policy places a substantial social and economic burden on both the individual and wider society, which might result in low adherence and reduced policy effectiveness. We aimed to assess the merit of testing contacts to avert onward transmission and to replace or reduce the length of quarantine for uninfected contacts. METHODS: We used an agent-based model to simulate the viral load dynamics of exposed contacts, and their potential for onward transmission in different quarantine and testing strategies. We compared the performance of quarantines of differing durations, testing with either PCR or lateral flow antigen (LFA) tests at the end of quarantine, and daily LFA testing without quarantine, against the current 14-day quarantine strategy. We also investigated the effect of contact tracing delays and adherence to both quarantine and self-isolation on the effectiveness of each strategy. FINDINGS: Assuming moderate levels of adherence to quarantine and self-isolation, self-isolation on symptom onset alone can prevent 37% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 12-56) of onward transmission potential from secondary cases. 14 days of post-exposure quarantine reduces transmission by 59% (95% UI 28-79). Quarantine with release after a negative PCR test 7 days after exposure might avert a similar proportion (54%, 95% UI 31-81; risk ratio [RR] 094, 95% UI 062-124) to that of the 14-day quarantine period, as would quarantine with a negative LFA test 7 days after exposure (50%, 95% UI 28-77; RR 088, 066-111) or daily testing without quarantine for 5 days after tracing (50%, 95% UI 23-81; RR 088, 060-143) if all tests are returned negative. A stronger effect might be possible if individuals isolate more strictly after a positive test and if contacts can be notified faster. INTERPRETATION: Testing might allow for a substantial reduction in the length of, or replacement of, quarantine with a small excess in transmission risk. Decreasing test and trace delays and increasing adherence will further increase the effectiveness of these strategies. Further research is required to empirically evaluate the potential costs (increased transmission risk, false reassurance) and benefits (reduction in the burden of quarantine, increased adherence) of such strategies before adoption as policy.

The aim of the study is to evaluate treatment needs of this special group of patients. The care facilities reported that 270 children and adolescents (62%) show psychiatric problems. Of these, 220 (50.1%) are diagnosed with one or more psychiatric diagnoses, and 200 children and adolescents are receiving child and adolescent psychiatric treatment. Eleven care facilities reported the necessity for treatment in 80C100% of their accommodated children and adolescents. This results in highly stressful working conditions for professional psychosocial helpers and high treatment needs within their fosterlings. It is evident that more intensive networking and cooperation between institutions and helpers involved is necessary. Further, the development of new, low-threshold child and adolescent psychiatric services would be desirable to adequately meet the increasing need for psychiatric treatment in children and adolescents.","output":"Kinder- und jugendpsychiatrischer und therapeutischer Behandlungsbedarf bei fremduntergebrachten Kindern und Jugendlichen.

Little work has focused on the general publics overall perception of the ideal breast or has validated them with patient photographs. OBJECTIVES: To validate crowdsourced perceptions of breasts with their alignment to the aesthetics of breast augmentation patients. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study was performed using participants enrolled through the AmazonMechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform (Amazon Web Services, Amazon, Seattle, WA) to obtain participant opinions ofhow closely patient breasts aligned with previously obtained results of 4 ideal breast characteristics. Outcomes were reported based on the correlation between breast attractiveness and alignment to ideal breast characteristics, both before and after breast implant procedures. RESULTS: 2306 responses from 737 participants reported patient photograph alignment with ideal breast projection proportion (1.0) as having the highest correlation to opinions of heightened aesthetic beauty (R = 0.98, P < 0.001), and ideal nipple direction (front) as having the lowest correlation to aesthetic beauty (R = 0.90, P < 0.001). Younger age groups (18-24) and participants with a high school diploma or less rated patients as less attractive, while married and wealthy individuals reported higher attraction levels. CONCLUSIONS: Crowdsourcing can be a useful tool for aesthetic surgery preferences and has helped reveal key takeaways. The importance of the 4 breast characteristics has been validated, with alignment to all 4 characteristics tested having a high correlation to preferences.

To test evolutionary trends that could inform us on the adaptive process of the virus to its human host, we summarize all this sequence variability by computing the Sequence Compositional Complexity (SCC) in more than 23,000 high-quality coronavirus genome sequences from across the globe, covering the period spanning from the start of the pandemic in December 2019 to March 2022. In early samples, we found no statistical support for any trend in SCC values over time, although the virus as a whole appears to evolve faster than Brownian Motion expectation. However, in samples taken after the first Variant of Concern (VoC) with higher transmissibility (Alpha) emerges, and controlling for phylogenetic and sampling effects, we were able to detect a statistically significant trend for decreased SCC values over time. SARS-CoV-2 evolution towards lower values of genome heterogeneity is further intensified by the emergence of successive, widespread VoCs. Concomitantly to the temporal reduction in SCC, its absolute evolutionary rate kept increasing toward the present, meaning that the SCC decrease itself accelerated over time. As compared to Alpha or Delta variants, the currently dominant VoC, Omicron, shows much stronger trends in both SCC values and rates over time. These results indicate that the increases in fitness of variant genomes associated to a higher transmissibility leads to a reduction of their genome sequence heterogeneity, thus explaining the general slowdown of SCC along with the pandemic course.","output":"The emergence of variants with increased fitness accelerates the slowdown of genome sequence heterogeneity in the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE A number of studies have examined the role of matrix metalloproteinases in aneurysm healing following endovascular coiling. Because ruptured aneurysms are known to express higher levels of matrix metalloproteinases, we hypothesized that patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage who were on a statin at the time of coil embolization would have lower aneurysm recanalization and retreatment rates than patients not on statins. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent intrasaccular coil embolization of ruptured intracranial aneurysms of 10 mm with at least 6 months of imaging follow-up. Patients were separated into 2 groups: 1) those on an oral statin medication at the time of coiling, and 2) those who were not. Outcomes studied were aneurysm recurrence and aneurysm retreatment after endovascular coiling. Student t and (2) tests were used for statistical significance of differences between groups. RESULTS One hundred thirty-two patients with 132 ruptured aneurysms were included in our study. Sixteen were on statins (12.1%) and 116 were not (87.9%). The recurrence rate was 6.3% in the statin group (1/16) and 36.2% in the nonstatin group (42/107) (P = .02). Unplanned retreatment rates were 6.3% (1/16) for the statin group and 25.9% (30/116) for the nonstatin group (P = .08). CONCLUSIONS Statins were associated with a lower rate of aneurysm recurrence following endovascular coiling of small- and medium-sized ruptured aneurysms in this small retrospective study. Further studies are needed to confirm this finding to determine whether statins can be used to reduce recurrence rates in these aneurysms.","output":"Could Statin Use Be Associated with Reduced Recurrence Rates following Coiling in Ruptured Intracranial Aneurysms?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a previous study, we identified a 117 base severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequence in the human genome with 94.6% identity. The sequence was in chromosome 1p within an intronic region of the netrin G1 (NTNG1) gene. The sequence matched a sequence in the SARS-CoV-2 Orf1b gene in non-structural protein 14 (NSP14), which is an exonuclease and NSP15, an endoribonuclease. In the current study we compared the human genome with other viral genomes to determine some of the characteristics of human sequences found in the latter. Most of the viruses had human sequences, but they were short. Hepatitis A and St Louis encephalitis had human sequences that were longer than the 117 base SARS-Cov-2 sequence, but they were in non-coding regions of the human genome. The SARS-Cov-2 sequence was the only long sequence found in a human gene (NTNG1). The related coronaviruses SARS-Cov had a 41 BP human sequence on chromosome 3 that was not part of a human gene, and MERS had no human sequence. The 117 base SARS-CoV-2 human sequence is relatively close to the viral spike sequence, separated only by NSP16, a 904 base sequence. The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the binding of the virus spike protein to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and internalization of the complex by the host cell.

Inter-hospital transfer of patients on ECMO support can be life-threatening. In this study, we report a single-center experience and a systematic review of the available published data on complications and mortality associated with ECMO transportation. METHODS: We reported single-center data regarding complications and mortality associated with the transportation of patients on ECMO support. Additionally, we searched multiple databases for case series, observational studies, and randomized controlled trials regarding mortality of patients transferred on ECMO support. Results were analyzed independently for pediatric (under 12 years old) and adult populations. We pooled mortality rates using a random-effects model. Complications and transportation data were also described. RESULTS: A total of 38 manuscripts, including our series, were included in the final analysis, totaling 1481 patients transported on ECMO support. A total of 951 patients survived to hospital discharge. The pooled survival rates for adult and pediatric patients were 62% (95% CI 57C68) and 68% (95% CI 60C75), respectively. Two deaths occurred during patient transportation. No other complication resulting in adverse outcome was reported. CONCLUSION: Using the available pooled data, we found that patient transfer to a referral institution while on ECMO support seems to be safe and adds no significant risk of mortality to ECMO patients.

METHODS: The data from 2217 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2020 and hospitalized or discharged with home isolation were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic data, comorbidities, PCR results, initial computed tomography (CT), laboratory values, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) / Lymphocyte ratio, initial treatments and last status were recorded. The diagnostic sensitivity of LDH / Lymphocyte ratio, which is the main purpose of the study, was analyzed statistically. RESULTS: In order to test the effectiveness of LDH / Lymphocyte ratio for COVID-19 for diagnostic purposes, CT results were considered as gold standard. The area under the curve (AUC) was found to be 0.706 (p < 0.001; cut-off> 0.06) (Sensitivity: 76.4, specificity: 59.60).

Although numerous SARS-CoV-2 CD8(+) T cell epitopes have been identified, the molecular basis underpinning T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells remains unknown. The T cell response directed towards SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-derived S(269-277) peptide presented by the HLA-A*02:01 allomorph (hereafter the HLA-A2(S269-277) epitope) is, to date, the most immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 epitope found in individuals bearing this allele. As HLA-A2(S269-277)-specific CD8(+) T cells utilize biased TRAV12 gene usage within the TCR -chain, we sought to understand the molecular basis underpinning this TRAV12 dominance. We expressed four TRAV12(+) TCRs which bound the HLA-A2(S269-277) complex with low M affinity and determined the crystal structure of the HLA-A2(S269-277) binary complex, and subsequently a ternary structure of TRAV12(+) TCR complexed to HLA-A2(S269-277). We found that the TCR made extensive contacts along the entire length of the S(269-277) peptide, suggesting that the TRAV12(+) TCRs would be sensitive to sequence variation within this epitope. To examine this, we investigated cross-reactivity towards analogous peptides from existing SARS-CoV-2 variants and closely related coronaviruses. We show via surface plasmon resonance and tetramer studies that the TRAV12(+) T cell repertoire cross-reacts poorly with these analogous epitopes. Overall, we defined the structural basis underpinning biased TCR recognition of CD8(+) T cells directed at an immunodominant epitope and provide a framework for understanding TCR cross-reactivity towards viral variants within the S(269-277) peptide.","output":"Structural basis of biased T cell receptor recognition of an immunodominant HLA-A2 epitope of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus has generated a pandemic, in which there are population groups at higher risk and who are potentially fatal victims of the disease.

This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. As a result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P=0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Overall, the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization.

During an extended stay-at-home period, individuals may engage in more online leisure activities. Internet use is a double-edged sword that may have both desirable and undesirable effects on psychological well-being, and this study sought to disentangle adaptive from maladaptive internet use amidst this unusual health crisis. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of probable depression during the COVID-19 stay-at-home period and to test three hypothesized risk reduction or risk elevation mechanisms, namely social capital-accrual, escape-from-self, and time-displacement effects. METHODS: This study took place from March to May 2020 at the early stage of the pandemic. The study adopted a prospective design, with an online survey administered to 573 UK and 474 US adult residents at two assessment points 2 months apart. RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate to severe depression was 36% (bootstrap bias-corrected and accelerated [BCa] 95% CI 33%-39%) at Time 1 (ie, initial time point) and 27% (bootstrap BCa 95% CI 25%-30%) at Time 2 (ie, follow-up time point). The results supported the social capital-accrual hypothesis by showing that the approach coping style was inversely associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both social networking and perceived family support. The results also supported the escape-from-self hypothesis by revealing that the avoidant coping style was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both gaming and cyberbullying victimization, but the serial mediation model was no longer significant after Time 1 depression and some demographic risk factors had been controlled for. Finally, the results supported the time-displacement hypothesis by showing that gaming was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its inverse associations with social networking and perceived family support.

DESIGN: This study used a cross-sectional observational study design. Patients attending Mount Sinais post-acute COVID-19 syndrome clinic completed surveys containing patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients completed the survey, at a median (range) time of 351 days (82C457 days) after COVID-19 infection. All patients were prevaccination. The most common persistent symptoms reported were fatigue (n = 128, 82%), brain fog (n = 105, 67%), and headache (n = 94, 60%). The most common triggers of symptom exacerbation were physical exertion (n = 134, 86%), stress (n = 107, 69%), and dehydration (n = 77, 49%). Increased levels of fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale) and dyspnea (Medical Research Council) were reported, alongside reductions in levels of regularly completed physical activity.

The virus binds to target cells by use of heparan sulfate proteoglycans and interacts with the ACE2 protein. Subsequent events, including virus internalization and trafficking, remain to be elucidated. In this study, we mapped the process of HCoV-NL63 entry into the LLC-Mk2 cell line and ex vivo three-dimensional (3D) tracheobronchial tissue. Using a variety of techniques, we have shown that HCoV-NL63 virions require endocytosis for successful entry into the LLC-MK2 cells, and interaction between the virus and the ACE2 molecule triggers recruitment of clathrin. Subsequent vesicle scission by dynamin results in virus internalization, and the newly formed vesicle passes the actin cortex, which requires active cytoskeleton rearrangement. Finally, acidification of the endosomal microenvironment is required for successful fusion and release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. For 3D tracheobronchial tissue cultures, we also observed that the virus enters the cell by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but we obtained results suggesting that this pathway may be bypassed.IMPORTANCE Available data on coronavirus entry frequently originate from studies employing immortalized cell lines or undifferentiated cells. Here, using the most advanced 3D tissue culture system mimicking the epithelium of conductive airways, we systematically mapped HCoV-NL63 entry into susceptible cells.

Given growing evidence that it is possible to slow the rate of many biological aging processes using pharmacological compounds has led to the proposal that such geroscience-guided interventions may help enhance immune resilience and improve outcomes in the face of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our review of the literature indicates that most, if not all, hallmarks of aging may contribute to the enhanced COVID-19 vulnerability seen in frail older adults. Moreover, varied biological mechanisms implicated in aging do not function in isolation from each other, and exhibit intricate effects on each other.

The severity of the disease increases with age and presence of comorbidities, including cancer. Multiple clinical studies have shown that the cancer patients are highly susceptible to the severe form of the viral disease. In this review article, we have summarized the available scientific literature regarding the molecular links between COVID-19 and cancer, which make the cancer patients highly susceptible to COVID-19. Few studies have shown that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and the immune response and inflammation establish the interconnection between the two diseases. Additionally, we have also discussed whether SARS-CoV-2 can contribute to cancer development in COVID-19 patients. A recent study has suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may create a microenvironment that may support cancer cell proliferation and induce the activation of dormant cancer cells (DCCs). In another study, the blood sera of COVID-19 patients were found to activate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells.

However, no linear relation between volume and outcome has been demonstrated. Aim of the study was to evaluate the increased surgical volume effect on early outcomes of patient undergoing laparoscopic restorative anterior rectal resection (ARR). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients undergoing ARR with primary anastomosis between November 2016 and December 2020 after centralization of rectal cancer cases in an academic Centre. Short-term outcomes are compared to those of patients operated in the same unit during the previous 10 years before service centralization. The primary outcome was estimated anastomotic leak rate. Mean operative time, need of conversion, postoperative use of blood transfusion, radicality, in-hospital stay, number and type of complications, readmission and reoperation rate, mortality and 1-year and stoma persistence rates were evaluated as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: 86 patients were operated in the study period and outcomes compared to those of 101 patients operated during the previous ten years. Difference in volume of surgery was significant between the two periods (p 0.019) and the estimated leak rate was significantly lower in the higher volume unit (p 0.047). Mean operative time, need of conversion, postoperative use of blood transfusion and in-hospital stay (p < 0.05) were also significantly reduced in Group A. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the shift toward higher volume in rectal cancer surgery is associated to decreased anastomotic leak rate. Potentiation of lower volume surgical units may yield optimal perioperative outcomes.","output":"Volume-outcome relationship in rectal cancer surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Construction 4.0 has become a buzzword since the penetration of building information modeling (BIM), cyber-physical systems, and digital and computing technologies into the construction industry. Among emerging technologies, distributed ledger technology (DLT), or blockchain, is a powerful business enhancer whose potential can disrupt projects, AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) firms, and construction supply chain, and in a broader sense, the whole construction industry. This technology has not reached the plateau of productivity due to several barriers and challenges. Previous studies have started to investigate the barriers to implementing DLT in various sectors and segmentations. However, we still need further surveys in the construction industry. This study evaluates the applicability of identified challenges and barriers based on a sustainability perspective. Precisely, we will answer which challenges need to be addressed for the sustainability of the construction industry. To meet the research objective, the ordinal priority approach (OPA) in multiple attributes decision-making (MADM) was utilized. This novel method determines the weight of sustainability attributes and barriers simultaneously. The results show that DLT implementation needs (i) infrastructure for data management, (ii) advanced applications and archetypes, and (iii) customers demand, interest, and tendency, and (iv) taxation and reporting.

However, data in stroke patients on understanding of the informed consent (IC) procedure are sparse. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study among ischemic stroke patients taking part in the IC procedure of an ongoing cluster-randomized secondary prevention trial. All aspects of the IC procedure were assessed in an interview using a standardized 20-item questionnaire. Responses were collected within 72 hours after the IC procedure and analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Participants were also asked regarding main reasons for participation. RESULTS 146 stroke patients (6512 years, 38% female) were enrolled. On average, patients recalled 66.4% (95% CI 65.2%-67.5%) of the content of the IC procedure. Most patients understood that participation was voluntary (99.3%) and that they had the right to withdraw consent (97.1%). 79.1% of the patients recalled the study duration, 56.1% the goal. Only 40.3% could clearly state a benefit of participation and 28.8% knew their group allocation. Younger age, higher graduation and allocation to the intervention group were associated with better understanding. Of all patients, 53% exclusively stated a personal, 22% an altruistic reason for participation. CONCLUSIONS While understanding of patient rights was high, many patients were unable to recall other important aspects of study content and procedures.

Here we assess the role of airborne transmission in spreading the disease and the effectiveness of face covering in preventing inter-human transmission for the top-fifteen infected U.S. states during March 1 and May 18, 2020. For all fifteen states, the curve of total confirmed infections exhibits an initial sub-exponential growth and a subsequent linear growth after implementing social distancing/stay-at-home orders. The linearity extends one to two months for the six states without mandated face covering and to the onset of mandated face covering for the other nine states with this measure, reflecting a dynamic equilibrium between first-order transmission kinetics and intervention. For the states with mandated face covering, significant deviation from this linearity and curve flattening occur after the onset of this measure for seven states, with exceptions for two states. Most states exhibit persistent upward trends in the daily new infections after social distancing/stay-at-home orders, while reversed downward or slowing trends occur for eight states after implementing mandated face covering. The inadequacy of social distancing and stay-at-home measures alone in preventing inter-human transmission is reflected by the continuous linear growth in the total infection curve after implementing these measures, which is mainly driven by airborne transmission. We estimate that the number of the total infections prevented by face covering reaches ~252,000 on May 18 in seven states, which is equivalent to ~17% of the total infections in the nation. We conclude that airborne transmission and face covering play the dominant role in spreading the disease and flattening the total infection curve, respectively. Our findings provide policymakers and the public with compelling evidence that universal face covering, in conjunction with social distancing and hand hygiene, represents the maximal protection against inter-human transmission and the combination of these intervention measures with rapid and extensive testing as well as contact tracing is crucial in containing the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Understanding transmission and intervention for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We herein report a rare case of co-infection of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and pulmonary CMV in a 3-month-old infant with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, in which diagnostic clues were obtained from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

RECENT FINDINGS: Recent evidence supports the use of physical activity and other nonpharmacologic therapies, either alone or with pharmacological therapies, for pain management. Nonopioid analgesics, including acetaminophen, topical analgesics, gabapentinoids, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and TCA may be considered based on pain cause and type, with careful dose considerations in kidney disease. NSAIDs may be used in CKD and ESKD for short durations with careful monitoring. Opioid use should be minimized and reserved for patients who have failed other therapies. Opioids have been associated with increased adverse events in this population, and thus should be used cautiously after risk/benefit discussion with the patient. Opioids that are safer to use in kidney disease include oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine. Buprenorphine appears to be a promising and safer option due to its partial agonism at the mu opioid receptor. SUMMARY: Pain is poorly managed in patients with kidney disease.

These cells are usually defective for many normal activities or functions due to significant genetic and epigenetic changes.

These normal cells cease after a few passages or population doublings due to very limited proliferative capacity. Animal models (ferret, mouse, etc.) are often used to study virus-host interaction. However, viruses usually need to be adapted to the animals by several passages due to tropism restrictions including viral receptors and intracellular restrictions.

CR allows to robustly propagate cells from non-invasive or minimally invasive specimens, for example, nasal or endobronchial brushing. This process is rapid (2 days) and conditional. The CRCs maintain their differentiation potential and lineage functions, and have been used for studies of adenovirus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses, parvovirus, and SARS-CoV. The CRCs can be easily used for air-liquid interface (ALI) polarized 3D cultures, and these coupled CRC/ALI cultures mimic physiological conditions and are suitable for studies of viral entry including receptor binding and internalization, innate immune responses, viral replications, and drug discovery as an ex vivo model for emerging viruses.","output":"Conditionally Reprogrammed Human Normal Airway Epithelial Cells at ALI: A Physiological Model for Emerging Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Healthcare professionals who are directly involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and general care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk of developing adverse psychological reactions. A cross-sectional study of healthcare professionals aimed to determine the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare professionals in two of the largest referral hospitals in Athens, Greece. METHODS: The study was conducted in the two largest SARS-CoV-2 referral hospitals in Athens, Greece. An assessment and the interrelationship of post-traumatic stress disorder, using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised [IES-R]) and burnout, using the Maslach Burnout Inventory [MBI]) was carried out. RESULTS: A total of 162 subjects were enrolled in the study. Fifty-six (35%) had an IES-R score > 33, suggesting post-traumatic stress disorder. Forty-nine (30%) had an MBI score > 27. Seventy-five (46%) had a personal accomplishment score of < 33 and 46 (28%) had a depersonalization score >10. Stepwise backward logistic regression revealed that the only independent variable that was retained regarding the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder was the emotional exhaustion score of the MBI (at a cut-off of 24 in this scale, the 95% CI of the odds ratio for the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 1.077-1.173).

It has recently been demonstrated, in an experimental model using WNV strain Sarafend and C57BL/6 mice, that both virus- and immune-mediated pathology is involved in WNV encephalitis, with CD8(+) T cells being the dominant subpopulation of lymphocyte infiltrates in the brain. Here, the role of activated WNV-immune CD8(+) T cells in mouse WNV encephalitis was investigated further. Passive transfer of WNV-immune CD8(+) T cells reduced mortality significantly and prolonged survival times of mice infected with WNV. Early infiltration of WNV-immune CD8(+) T cells into infected brains is shown, suggesting a beneficial contribution of these lymphocytes to recovery from encephalitis. This antiviral function was not markedly mediated by gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), as a deficiency in IFN-gamma did not affect mortality to two strains of WNV (Sarafend and Kunjin) or brain virus titres significantly. The cytolytic potential, as well as precursor frequency, of WNV-immune CD8(+) T cells were not altered by the absence of IFN-gamma. This was reflected in transfer experiments of WNV-immune CD8(+) T cells from IFN-gamma(-/-) mice into WNV-infected wild-type mice, which showed that IFN-gamma-deficient T cells were as effective as those from WNV-immune wild-type mice in ameliorating disease outcome. It is speculated here that one of the pleiotropic functions of IFN-gamma is mimicked by WNV-Sarafend-mediated upregulation of cell-surface expression of major histocompatibility complex antigens, which may explain the lack of phenotype of IFN-gamma(-/-) mice in response to WNV.","output":"CD8(+) T cell-mediated immune responses in West Nile virus (Sarafend strain) encephalitis are independent of gamma interferon."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Social media facilitates the rapid spread of information and misinformation to the public. Medical students as healthcare professionals in training have a responsibility to support public health advocacy. As such, it is important to understand whether medical students feel comfortable to use social media as a tool to promote public health. There is little literature evaluating this. The covid-19 pandemic gives us a unique opportunity to characterise this relationship. METHODS: This is a cross sectional survey-based study run by the student surgical society at Hull York Medical School. Data will be collected on confidence of medical students in receiving, appraising and resharing information on social media. The study will first be run as a single centre study. Following data collection and analysis, will be promoted to other student surgical societies across the UK to be run as a collaborative national study. RESULTS PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: How confident are medical students in receiving, appraising and resharing information they receive on social media?: Secondary Objective: Is there a relationship between years of training or postgraduate/undergraduate status and confidence in using social media amongst medical students? How often do medical students use social media as their primary source of information? Is there adequate education on how social media can be used to combat misinformation?: Conclusion: The covid-19 pandemic allows a unique opportunity to characterise the relationship between medical students, social media, and health advocacy.

In this study, we characterized the viral main protease (M(pro)) of the type species, White bream virus (WBV), of the newly established genus Bafinivirus (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Torovirinae). Comparative sequence analysis and mutagenesis data confirmed that the WBV M(pro) is a picornavirus 3C-like serine protease that uses a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad embedded in a predicted two--barrel fold, which is extended by a third domain at its C terminus. Bacterially expressed WBV M(pro) autocatalytically released itself from flanking sequences and was able to mediate proteolytic processing in trans. Using N-terminal sequencing of autoproteolytic processing products we tentatively identified Gln(Ala, Thr) as a substrate consensus sequence. Mutagenesis data provided evidence to suggest that two conserved His and Thr residues are part of the S1 subsite of the enzyme's substrate-binding pocket. Interestingly, we observed two N-proximal and two C-proximal autoprocessing sites in the bacterial expression system. The detection of two major forms of M(pro), resulting from processing at two different N-proximal and one C-proximal site, in WBV-infected epithelioma papulosum cyprini cells confirmed the biological relevance of the biochemical data obtained in heterologous expression systems. To our knowledge, the use of alternative M(pro) autoprocessing sites has not been described previously for other nidovirus M(pro) domains.

Clinical outcome of AIS in the course of COVID-19 remains unknown. We compared early clinical outcome and mortality of COVID-positive (+) patients admitted for AIS with COVID-negative (-) ones. We hypothesized that COVID+ patients would have poorer clinical outcomes and present a higher rate of TEs and mortality compared with COVID- ones. METHODS: In this multicentric observational retrospective study, we enrolled patients over 18 years old admitted for AIS in 3 stroke units of the Parisian region during lockdown from March 17, 2020, to May 2, 2020. COVID-19 status as well as demographic, clinical, biological, and imaging data was collected retrospectively from medical records. Poor outcome was defined as modified Rankin score (mRS) 3-6 (3-6) at discharge. We also compared TE frequency and mortality rate through a composite criterion in both groups. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixteen patients were enrolled; mean age was 68 years old, and 63% were male. Forty patients were CO-VID+ (18.5%) and 176 were COVID-. Obesity was statistically more frequent in the COVID+ group (36 vs. 13% p < 0.01). The percentage of patients with mRS (3-6) at discharge was higher in the COVID+ group compared with the COVID- group (60 vs. 41%, p = 0.034). The main predictor of presenting a mRS (3-6) at discharge was high NIHSS score at admission (OR, CI 95%: 1.325, 1.22-1.43). Mortality rate was higher in the COVID+ group (12 vs. 3.4%, p = 0.033) as well as TE frequency (15 vs. 2.8%, p < 0.01).

Therefore, studying food waste utilization potentials and minimizing its negative consequences becomes imperative. This study aims to assess the technical and economic potentials of substituting corn with unconventional extruded dried Arabic Bread waste (EDABW) in broilers diets, in terms of broilers performance, carcass characteristic, economic net returns, and income over feed cost (IOFC). One hundred eighty unsexed one-day-old broiler birds of Ross breed were distributed randomly in six treatments (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% EDABW group) of isocaloric and isonitrogenous diets in a completely randomized design with six replicated (5 chicks/replicate). The investigated traits were broilers performance (live body weight, total feed intake, total feed conversion ratio, and total weight gain. Other traits such as carcass weight, abdominal fat, edible offal (liver, heart, and gizzard), eviscerated (breast muscles, drum and thigh muscles, and wings) were weighed and expressed based on a live body weight. Results showed that the 20 % replacement level of corn with EDABW generated the highest increase in the live body weight and the eviscerated carcass at about 4.24% g and 4.90%, respectively. On the other hand, the economic analysis showed potential reductions in the broilers diet cost and the total broilers' production cost as the levels of corn substitution with by unconventional EDABW increased. The reductions were estimated at 5.1%, 6.3%, 8.4%, 9.3%, and 9.9% at substitution levels of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%, respectively as compared to the control diet. The results also showed a potential increase in the net economic returns of broiler meat as the increase in substitution levels ranged between 3.5C6.8% and 4.3C8.3% as compared to the control diets using the average retail and wholesale prices of broiler meats, respectively. In addition, the maximum IOFC was estimated potentially at a 20% substitution level of corn with EDABW. Conclusively, the study results show promising technical and economic potentials for unconventional EDABW in broilers diets that could lead to a thriving industry of unconventional broilers diets with high net economic returns and maximum IOFC.","output":"Technical and Economic Potentials of Unconventional Extruded Dried Arabic Bread Wastes in Broilers Diets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair has been shown to offer patients the benefit of less postoperative pain as compared to traditional open techniques. However, the risk of experiencing significant postoperative pain may affect patient's decision making. We aimed to elucidate potential patterns of pain and the predictors of such, up to 2 years postoperatively, using both generic and specific quality of life tools. METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic totally extra-peritoneal inguinal hernia repair were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Short form-36, Surgical Outcomes Measurement System (SOMS) and Carolinas Comfort Scale (CCS) surveys were administered pre- and postoperatively at 3 weeks, 6 months, 1 and 2 years. Patients with concomitant procedures were excluded. Significant pain was considered mild but bothersome or worse on either specific tool (SOMS scores 3/4, CCS scores 2). Predictors of significant pain were determined by logistic regression. RESULTS From 2009 to 2015, 482 patients enrolled in our database underwent elective TEP repair of 626 hernias and completed an assessment tool. Mean age was 57 (15) years, with 93 % male. Reported pain on all three tools improved significantly from baseline over time (p < 0.01). Significant pain on either specific tool, related or unrelated to surgery, was reported by 52 % of respondents (158/301) preoperatively, and postoperatively by 50 % at 3 weeks (111/220), 21 % at 6 months (15/70), 13 % at 1 year (14/108), and 25 % at 2 years (30/121). Significant pain at 6 months-2 years correlated more significantly with general health status than surgical factors. CONCLUSIONS Significant pain can be as high as 50 % at 3 weeks on surgery-specific quality of life measures, but with significant improvement by 6 months which is maintained through 2 years.

Genetic susceptibility to dysregulated immune response is highly likely to be among the host factors for adverse disease outcome.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A stratified randomised control clinical trial of a 4-week functional partial body weight support treadmill training, (5 days/week 45 min/day) and 2-month follow-up period will be applied in children with ataxia, aged 8C18 years old with Gross Motor Function Classification System IICIV. Participants will be allocated to experimental group (intervention and usual care) or control group (usual care), using stratified randomisation process into two strata (progressive and non-progressive ataxia). Participants will be assessed at baseline, by the end of the 4-week period and by the end of a 2-month period as a follow-up measurement. Motor and functional skills will be assessed using the Gross Motor Function Measure-D and E, the Pediatric Balance Scale, the 10-meter walk test, the 6-minute walk test, the Scale for Assessment and Rating Ataxia, the timed up and go test and childrens spatiotemporal gait features will be assessed through GaitSens software recording over a 2 min low treadmill gait speed, while three-dimensional gait analysis will be performed for kinetic and kinematic analysis of the lower limbs in all three levels of movement. Two-way mixed Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with factors intervention (between group) and time (within group) will be used for the analysis of all parameters. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) will be used in case of imbalance of baseline measurements. Statistical significance will be set at p<0.05 using the statistical package SPSS V.21.00. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: University of West Attica (studys protocol: 14/26-04-2021) and ATTIKON General University Hospital of Athens (studys protocol:  ,  149/20-3-2020). Trial results of the main trial will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and/or international conference.

Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of this deadly disease are of paramount importance in improving patient survival. MRI is the cornerstone of diagnosis of early extrasinus disease, particularly intracranial complications which have traditionally been associated with a high mortality rate. In this review, we depict the sinonasal, perisinus, orbital and intracranial involvement in CAM. Special emphasis is laid on intracranial disease which is categorized into vascular, parenchymal, meningeal, bony involvement and perineural spread. Vascular complications are the most common form of intracranial involvement. Some unusual yet interesting imaging findings such as nerve abscesses involving the optic, trigeminal and mandibular nerves and long segment vasculitis of the internal carotid artery extending till its cervical segment are also illustrated. In our experience, patient outcome in CAM (survival rate of 88.5%) was better compared to the pre-pandemic era. Presence of intracranial disease also did not affect prognosis as poorly as traditionally expected (survival rate of 82.8%). Involvement of brain parenchyma was the only subset of intracranial involvement that was associated with higher mortality (p value 0.016).

Obesity has been associated with increased disease severity in COVID-19, and obesity is strongly associated with hepatic steatosis (HS). However, how HS alters the natural history of COVID-19 is not well characterized, especially in Western populations. AIMS: To characterize the impact of HS on disease severity and liver injury in COVID-19. METHODS: We examined the association between HS and disease severity in a single-center cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at Michigan Medicine. HS was defined by either hepatic steatosis index > 36 (for Asians) or > 39 (for non-Asians) or liver imaging demonstrating steatosis > 30 days before onset of COVID-19. The primary predictor was HS. The primary outcomes were severity of cardiopulmonary disease, transaminitis, jaundice, and portal hypertensive complications. RESULTS: In a cohort of 342 patients, metabolic disease was highly prevalent including nearly 90% overweight. HS was associated with increased transaminitis and need for intubation, dialysis, and vasopressors. There was no association between HS and jaundice or portal hypertensive complications. In a sensitivity analysis including only patients with liver imaging > 30 days before onset of COVID-19, imaging evidence of hepatic steatosis remained associated with disease severity and risk of transaminitis.

Our obligation to rescue is commonly explained in terms of the identifiability of the rescuee, but I reject this account. Instead, I offer two considerations which may come into play. Firstly, I explain the seeming importance of identifiability in terms of an intuitive obligation to prioritise life-extending interventions for people who face a high risk of an early death, and I explain this in turn with a fair innings-style principle which prioritises life-extending interventions for people expected to die young. However, this account is incomplete. It does not explain why we would devote the same resources to rescuing miners stuck down a mine even if they are elderly. We are averse to letting people die suddenly, or separated from friends and family. And so, secondly, I give a new account that explains this in terms of narrative considerations. We value life stories that follow certain patterns, classic patterns which are reflected in many popular myths and stories. We are particularly averse to depriving people of the opportunity to follow some such pattern as they approach death. This means allowing them to sort out their affairs, say goodbyes to family and friends, review their life, or come to terms with death itself. Such activities carry a lot of meaning as ways of closing our life story in the right way. So, for someone who has not been given much notice of their death, an extra month is worth much more than for other patients. Finally, I review the UK National Health Service's end of life premium, which gives priority to patients with short life expectancy. I suggest it falls short in terms of such considerations. For example, the NHS defines its timings in terms of how long the patient can expect to live as at the time of the treatment decision, whereas the timings should be specified in terms of time from diagnosis.","output":"Explaining rule of rescue obligations in healthcare allocation: allowing the patient to tell the right kind of story about their life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Writing from Britain in the month of May 2020, this essay draws the multiple and conflicting alignments of the Covid-19 moment into conjunctural relief It seeks to understand how prominent trends of welfarism, collectivism and capitalism are being reorganised across a Left-Right spectrum and to specifically situate nationalism in this general political flux Focusing on Britain, the essay will explore how an otherwise unsettled ruling Right is reviving a nationalist political imagination through a pandemic consciousness - with an emphasis on the politics of bordering, the spectre of China, reheated civic patriotism, a poetics of survival and melancholic whiteness The essay will however also speculate about the limits to nationalism amid the imperatives of global pandemics","output":"Coronavirus Conjuncture: Nationalism and Pandemic States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progresses, prognostic markers for early identification of high-risk individuals are an urgent medical need.

Early attention to the novel virus, as measured by Google searches, is associated with deeper stock market drops in countries with SARS experience. In contrast, people in countries without SARS experience started to pay more attention much later, in March. Moreover, governments in these countries responded significantly more slowly in implementing social distancing policies to combat domestic COVID-19 outbreaks than governments in countries with SARS experience. Furthermore, people in countries with SARS experience are more compliant with social distancing rules. These timely attention and proactive responses of individuals and governments are more pronounced in countries that reported deaths caused by SARS, which left deeper imprints.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of a newly established protocol for medical abortion and to measure the level of satisfaction of the patients who experienced abortion at home. METHODS: This retrospective study compared all the patients who had an early medical abortion at up to 9 weeks of gestation during the two drastically different periods between December 2018 and March 2021 (hospital and home groups). We evaluated the expulsion of the gestational sac as a primary outcome. The rates of infection, hemorrhage, retained trophoblastic material and need for surgical management were also assessed. A survey was also used to measure the satisfaction and acceptability of the method. RESULTS: The rate of expulsion of pregnancy was not significantly different between the two groups: 92.9% in hospital versus 99% at home. Early retained trophoblastic material and surgical interventions were higher in the hospital group. No significant difference was observed for the remaining outcomes. Moreover, the level of acceptability was similar in both groups, though patients felt safer in the hospital group. CONCLUSION: Switching an early medical abortion protocol from expulsion of pregnancy in hospital to expulsion of pregnancy at home is effective and acceptable to woman, and may be associated with decreased rate of retained trophoblastic material.

Limited reports describing EEG abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 have been published. These articles reported nonspecific encephalopathic patterns, epileptiform discharges, and rarely seizures. Our primary aim was to assess EEG abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 and evaluate for epileptiform activity or seizures. METHODS: We identified five critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 who underwent EEG monitoring. All patients had Ceribell? rapid response EEG initially and two continued with conventional long-term video EEG. RESULTS: All 5 patients had encephalopathy and 3 also had seizure-like movements, thus prompting EEG monitoring. EEGs all showed nonspecific markers of encephalopathy including diffuse slowing and generalized rhythmic delta activity. Two also had epileptiform discharges reaching 2-3 Hz at times, with one patient in nonconvulsive status epilepticus and the other developing clinical status epilepticus with myoclonic movements. EEG and clinical symptoms improved with anti-seizure medications. CONCLUSION: Status epilepticus was present in 2 out of our cohort of 5 critically ill patients who underwent EEG monitoring.

In this way, the passenger pick-up and drop-off locations have been identified in order to obtain the population movement pattern. In this study, Morans I index was used to measure the spatial autocorrelation, and hot spot analysis was used to analyze spatial patterns of pick-up and drop-off locations.

The results of the spatiotemporal distribution map for pick-up and drop-off locations indicated a similarity in patterns and equal results for some locations. Results also indicated different features of spatial distribution during different hours of the day. Spatial autocorrelation analysis results indicated a low probability of randomness in the general spatial distribution of the locations. The result of modeling the parameters shows the positive effect of the parameters on the pattern of population movement, and according to the p-value of 0.000, Poisson regression is significant for the pick-up and drop-off locations.

Patients broadly triaged into 4 categories; discharge with advice, referral to VFC, referral to face to face clinic or discussion with on call team. The first 9 months of data were analysed to assess types of injury seen and outcomes. RESULTS In total 2489 patients were referred to VFC from internal and external sources. Seven hundred and thirty-four patients were discharged without follow-up and 182 patients were discharged for physiotherapy review. Only 3 patients required admission. Regarding follow-ups, 431 patients had a virtual follow-up while 1036 of patients required further face to face follow up. Eighty-seven patients were triaged into subspecialty clinics. Thirty-seven patients were felt to have been referred inappropriately. Discussion British Orthopaedic Association guidelines suggest all patients need to be reviewed within 72 hours of their orthopaedic injury. Implementation of a VFC allows this target to be achieved and at the same time reduce patient contact. Almost half the patients were discharged following VFC review; the remaining patients were appropriately followed up.

Asthmatic patients were not associated with higher odds of prolonged hospital length of stay (OR=1.48, 95%CI=0.82-2.66, p=0.20) or with the duration of ICU stay (OR=0.76, 95%CI=0.28-2.02, p=0.58). Kaplan-Meier curve showed no significant difference in overall survival of the two groups (p=0.65). Conclusion Despite the increased prevalence of hospitalization in asthmatic COVID-19 patients compared to the general population, after adjustment for other variables, it was neither associated with increased severity nor worse outcomes.","output":"Asthma in COVID-19: An extra chain fitting around the neck?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to characterize SARS-CoV-2 mutations which are primarily prevalent in the Cypriot population. Moreover, using computational approaches, we assess whether these mutations are associated with changes in viral virulence. We utilize genetic data from 144 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains from the Cypriot population obtained between March 2020 and January 2021, as well as all data available from GISAID. We combine this with countries regional information, such as deaths and cases per million, as well as COVID-19-related public health austerity measure response times. Initial indications of selective advantage of Cyprus-specific mutations are obtained by mutation tracking analysis. This entails calculating specific mutation frequencies within the Cypriot population and comparing these with their prevalence world-wide throughout the course of the pandemic. We further make use of linear regression models to extrapolate additional information that may be missed through standard statistical analysis. We report a single mutation found in the ORF1ab gene (S6059F) that appears to be significantly enriched within the Cypriot population. We further analyse this mutation using regression models to investigate possible associations with increased deaths and cases per million. Moreover, protein structure prediction tools show that the mutation infers a conformational change to the protein that significantly alters its structure when compared to the reference protein. Investigating Cyprus-specific mutations for SARS-CoV-2 can not only lead to important findings from which to battle the pandemic on a national level, but also provide insights into viral virulence worldwide.","output":"In depth analysis of Cyprus-specific mutations of SARS-CoV-2 strains using computational approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is the first regional, multi-annual assessment of floating microplastics in Scotland's seas.

As of 2019, only 3 countries remained to be polio endemic globally, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. The east and southern sub-region countries had shown progressive achievement towards polio eradication and to start with the African regional certification. The availability of sensitive AFP surveillance performance is among important strategies in the achievement of polio eradication. We, therefore, decided to conduct this assessment of AFP performance from 2012 to 2019 in the ESA sub-region have evidence documentation and support the certification process of the WHO AFRO region. Methods: we reviewed all reported acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases from 19 countries in the ESA sub region with the date of onset of paralysis from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2019. The data were run to descriptive analysis based on the personal characteristics and AFP surveillance performance indicators parameters. Results: a total of 46,014 AFP cases were reported from 19 countries in the ESA countries who were paralyzed from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2019. The most affected age group was children aged 0 to 3 years old where 19,740 children with acute paralysis were reported representing 42.9% of the total reported AFP for the period. The overall assessment of the non-polio AFP rate, there is an increase from a rate of 2.7 in 2012 to 3.5 in 2019 per 100,000 population aged less than 15 years, reflects a significant change with a p-value of 0.040 (95% C.I. ranges from 0.035 to 1.564). Furthermore, the percentage of stool adequacy raised from 86.4% in 2012 to 88.5% in 2019, with an observed 2.1% difference and no significant change over the 8 years. Conclusion: we observed an overall increase in the sensitivity of the AFP surveillance performance for the ESA sub-region countries from 2012 to 2019 using the national performance indicators.

The acute COVID-19 event can also impact activities of daily living and return to work;therefore COVID-19 can have lasting physical, emotional and social effects. Pulmonary rehabilitation services are well placed to provide the complex, multidisciplinary intervention required to treat the lasting effects of COVID-191, however the volume of patients requiring input is unknown. This study aims to explore the numbers of patients that self-identify a need for a rehabilitation intervention following discharge from hospital post COVID-19. Methods: Patients admitted to the University Hospitals of Leicester, UK between March and August 2020 were called by a healthcare professional following discharge to discuss lasting symptoms and offer a face to face rehabilitation assessment and intervention. Where it was not possible to contact patients, a letter was sent with contact details for patients to call back if they displayed ongoing symptoms. Patients that presented to hospital without a primary diagnosis of COVID and no respiratory symptoms were screened out and not contacted for the COVID rehabilitation pathway. Results: 938 patients who were discharged from the University Hospitals of Leicester between March and August 2020 were screened for rehabilitation. 37% (n=348) patients were deemed not appropriate (discharged to nursing home= 23, palliative=5, transferred out of area=18, incidental positive test without COVID symptoms= 127, not stated= 173). 13% (n=124) patients were not able to be contacted and did not return a call following postal contact. The mean [SD] time to telephone call was 32[18] days2. 50% (n=466) patients were assessed for ongoing symptoms and rehabilitation needs and 39% (n=184) of those assessed did not identify any rehabilitation needs. 61% (n=282) of patients assessed identified rehabilitation needs and were referred to a COVID rehabilitation program. The primary reported symptoms were fatigue, breathlessness, and limitations with activities of daily living2.

Individuals maintained on immunosuppression appear to be especially susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) frequently require immunosuppression and may be at increased risk for developing COVID-19. The incidence and impact of COVID-19 on patients with AAV is currently not known. We aimed to investigate this impact via a telephone questionnaire-based patient survey and chart review. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of AAV patients followed at two centers was conducted. Data regarding demographics, disease characteristics and therapy were confirmed by chart review. A telephone survey was conducted to ascertain symptoms and contact exposure related to COVID-19, as well as changes in health care delivery during the pandemic period between January and July, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 206 patients surveyed, the median age was 64 years, 51% were female and mean (SD) disease duration was 7 (5) years. The majority had kidney (n = 160) and lung (n = 108) involvement. Seventy-five percent (n = 155) were receiving immunosuppression, with 77 patients (50%) receiving rituximab during the pandemic period. Of the 10 patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) by PCR, three were positive. Patients had a significant disruption in care; none had an in-person visit and 69% had a telemedicine consultation. Rituximab maintenance was postponed in 21 patients. Twelve patients experienced disease relapse. CONCLUSION: The incidence of COVID-19 in patients with AAV appears to be similar to that of the general population. For a patient population that requires active clinical surveillance, there is significant disruption in care as a result of the pandemic. Reduction of immunosuppression may not be indicated, and the risk of relapse likely far outweighs the risk of COVID-19.

EAT is unique in its anatomy and unobstructed proximity to the heart and has a transcriptome and secretome very different from that of other fat depots. EAT has physiological and pathological properties that vary depending on its location. It can be highly protective for the adjacent myocardium through dynamic brown fat-like thermogenic function and harmful via paracrine or vasocrine secretion of pro-inflammatory and profibrotic cytokines. EAT is a modifiable risk factor that can be assessed with traditional and novel imaging techniques. Coronary and left atrial EAT are involved in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, respectively, and it also contributes to the development and progression of heart failure. In addition, EAT might have a role in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related cardiac syndrome.

In contrast, wearable accelerometer-based methods enable the measurement of physical behavior (PB) that encompasses not only PA but also sleep behavior, sedentary time, and rest-activity patterns. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review evaluates accelerometer-based methods used in patients carrying an ICD or at high risk of sudden cardiac death. METHODS: Papers were identified via the OVID MEDLINE and OVID EMBASE databases. PB could be assessed using a wearable accelerometer or an embedded accelerometer in the ICD. RESULTS: A total of 52 papers were deemed appropriate for this review. Out of these studies, 30 examined device-embedded accelerometry (189,811 patients), 19 examined wearable accelerometry (1601 patients), and 3 validated wearable accelerometry against device-embedded accelerometry (106 patients). The main findings were that a low level of PA after implantation of the ICD and a decline in PA were both associated with an increased risk of mortality, heart failure hospitalization, and appropriate ICD shock. Second, PA was affected by cardiac factors (eg, onset of atrial fibrillation, ICD shocks) and noncardiac factors (eg, seasonal differences, societal factors). CONCLUSION: This review demonstrated the potential of accelerometer-measured PA as a marker of clinical deterioration and ventricular arrhythmias. Notwithstanding that the evidence of PB assessed using wearable accelerometry was limited, there seems to be potential for accelerometers to improve early warning systems and facilitate preventative and proactive strategies.","output":"Accelerometer-assessed physical behavior and the association with clinical outcomes in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator recipients: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug repurposing has the advantage of shortening regulatory preclinical development steps.

Unlike the numerous systematic reviews on prevalence, symptoms and adverse outcomes of COVID-19 in pregnancy, there are very few on the effects of treatment on maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancy. We undertook a systematic review of all published and unpublished studies on the effects of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for COVID-19 on maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes. DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic literature search of the following databases: Medline, Embase, Cochrane database, WHO (World Health Organization) COVID-19 database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases from 1 December 2019 to 1 December 2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies were only included if they involved pregnant or postnatal women who were exposed to pregnancy specific interventions like the mode of delivery and type of anaesthesia, pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: We first screened the titles and abstracts of studies and then assessed the full text of the selected studies in detail for eligibility. Data on study design, population, type of screening for COVID-19, country, hospital, country status (high or low and middle income), treatment given (mode of delivery, type of anaesthesia, type of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment was extracted. The pre-defined maternal outcomes we collected were mode of delivery (vaginal or by caesarean section), severe or critical COVID-19 (as defined by the authors), symptomatic COVID-19, maternal death, maternal hospital admission, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, ECMO and maternal pneumonia. The pre-defined neonatal outcomes we extracted were preterm birth (<37 weeks), stillbirth, neonatal death, NICU admission, neonatal COVID-19 positive, neonatal acidosis (pH<7.0) and Apgar scores (<8 after 5 minutes). Study quality assessment was performed. RESULTS: From a total of 342 potential eligible studies, we included 27 studies in our systematic review, including 4943 pregnant women (appendix 3). Sixteen studies had a retrospective cohort design and 11 a prospective cohort design. There were no randomised controlled trials. There was a significant association between caesarean section and admission to ICU (OR 4.99, 95% CI 1.24 to 20.12; 4 studies, 153 women, I(2)=0%), and diagnosis of maternal COVID-19 pneumonia as defined by study authors (OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.52 to 6.28; 2 studies, 228 women, I(2)=0%). Women who had a preterm birth were more likely to have the baby via caesarean section (OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.71 to 5.36, 12 studies; 314 women, I(2)=0%).

The recent approval of two COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2) has accelerated mRNA vaccine technology and boosted the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. These mRNA vaccines will help to tackle COVID-19 pandemic through immunization, offering considerable hope for future mRNA vaccines. Human trials with data both from mRNA cancer vaccines and mRNA infectious disease vaccines have provided encouraging results, inspiring the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to focus on this area of research. In this article, we discuss current mRNA vaccines broadly in two parts. In the first part, mRNA vaccines in general and COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are discussed. We presented the mRNA vaccine structure in general, the different delivery systems, the immune response, and the recent clinical trials for mRNA vaccines (both for cancer mRNA vaccines and different infectious diseases mRNA vaccines). In the second part, different COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are explained. Finally, we illustrated a snapshot of the different leading mRNA vaccine developers, challenges, and future prospects of mRNA vaccines.","output":"From COVID-19 to Cancer mRNA Vaccines: Moving From Bench to Clinic in the Vaccine Landscape"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heat stress (HS) and its associated pathologies are major challenges facing the pig industry in southern China, and are responsible for large economic losses. However, the molecular mechanisms governing the abnormal secretion of HS-responsive hormones, such as glucocorticoids, are not fully understood. The goal of this study was to investigate differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the adrenal glands of pigs, and to elucidate changes in the immune neuroendocrine system in pigs following HS. Through a functional proteomics approach, we identified 1202 peptides, corresponding to 415 proteins. Of these, we found 226 DEPs between heat-stressed and control porcine adrenal gland tissue; 99 of these were up-regulated and 127 were down-regulated in response to HS. These DEPs included proteins involved in substrate transport, cytoskeletal changes, and stress responses. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to identify the subcellular characterization, functional pathway involvement, regulatory networks, and upstream regulators of the identified proteins. Functional network and pathway analyses may provide insights into the complexity and dynamics of HS-host interactions, and may accelerate our understanding of the mechanisms of HS.","output":"Proteomic analysis of the response of porcine adrenal gland to heat stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our understanding on phytoplankton diversity has largely been progressing since the publication of Hutchinson on the paradox of the plankton.

We show how ecological theories on species competition together with modelling approaches and laboratory experiments helped understand species coexistence and maintenance of diversity in phytoplankton. The non-equilibrium nature of phytoplankton and the role of disturbances in shaping diversity are also discussed. Furthermore, we discuss the role of water body size, productivity of habitats and temperature on phytoplankton species richness, and how diversity may affect the functioning of lake ecosystems.

The main objective of a standard epidemiological model is to estimate the number of infected, suspected, and recovered from the illness by mathematical modeling. This model does not capture how the disease transmits between neighboring regions through interaction. A more general framework such as Cellular Automata (CA) is required to accommodate a more complex spatial interaction within the epidemiological model. The critical issue of modeling in the spread of diseases is how to reduce the prediction error. This research aims to formulate the influence of the interaction of a neighborhood on the spreading pattern of COVID-19 using a neighborhood frame model in a Cellular-Automata (CA) approach and obtain a predictive model for the COVID-19 spread with the error reduction to improve the model. We propose a non-uniform continuous CA (N-CCA) as our contribution to demonstrate the influence of interactions on the spread of COVID-19. The model has succeeded in demonstrating the influence of the interaction between regions on the COVID-19 spread, as represented by the coefficients obtained. These coefficients result from multiple regression models. The coefficient obtained represents the population's behavior interacting with its neighborhood in a cell and influences the number of cases that occur the next day. The evaluation of the N-CCA model is conducted by root mean square error (RMSE) for the difference in the number of cases between prediction and real cases per cell in each region. This study demonstrates that this approach improves the prediction of accuracy for 14 days in the future using data points from the past 42 days, compared to a baseline model.","output":"A Non-Uniform Continuous Cellular Automata for Analyzing and Predicting the Spreading Patterns of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The high susceptibility of elderly to severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) indicates how crucial it is to protect the elderly by various strategies.

Specificities were evaluated on SARS-CoV-2-negative control sera collected before January 2020. RESULTS: A majority of severe-to-critically ill patients showed detectable Ab already at day 14 and sensitivities reached 100 % after 22 days pso. For patients with \\"mild-to-moderate\\" illness, sensitivities increased by at least 5-fold from day 0 to day 14 pso.

DESIGN: Economic analysis of a two-arm double-blind parallel group pragmatic randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Children were recruited from community-based healthcare settings, including general practices, walk-in centres and hospital ambulatory care. PARTICIPANTS: Children with risk factors for influenza-related complications, including respiratory, cardiac and neurological conditions, who presented within the first 5 days of an ILI. INTERVENTIONS: Co-amoxiclav 400/57 suspension or placebo. OUTCOME MEASURES: This economic analysis focused on quality of life measured by the EQ-5D-Y, symptoms assessed by the Canadian Acute Respiratory Infection and Flu Scale (CARIFS), healthcare use and costs including medication, hospital visits and admissions, general practitioner and nurse contacts. Outcomes were assessed for up to 28 days post randomisation. RESULTS: Information on resource use, EQ-5D-Y (day 28) and CARIFS (day 7) was available for 265 (98%), 72 (27%) and 123 (45%) out of 271 participants, respectively. Average costs in the co-amoxiclav group were 25 lower (95% CI ?113 to 65), but this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.566). The difference in EQ-5D-Y scores between groups was also not statistically significant (?0.014 (95% CI ?0.124 to 0.096), p=0.798). However, day 7 CARIFS scores were 3.5 points lower in the co-amoxiclav arm (95% CI ?6.9 to ?0.1, p=0.044). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings did not show evidence that early co-amoxiclav treatment improves quality of life or reduces healthcare use and costs in at-risk children with ILI, but may reduce symptom severity though confirmation from further research would be important.

METHODS: A comprehensive search was carried out to identify appropriate tools. Prior to beginning the search, criteria were defined to test the suitability of the identified tools. For one thing, there are minimum requirements that must be fulfilled so that the tool is accepted for the review process. There are also structuring criteria that can be divided into descriptive and evaluative aspects.

However, no research to date has validated a measure mental health symptomology for an athlete population. The current research addresses this gap by examining the internal consistency, factor structure, invariance, and convergent validity of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21; Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995) in two athlete samples. Participants completed the DASS-21 and sport-specific measures of mental health such as the Profile of Mood States C Depression subscale (POMS-D), Sport Anxiety Scale-2 (SAS-2), Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (ABQ), and Athlete Psychological Strain Questionnaire (APSQ). In sample one (n = 894), results of exploratory structural equation modeling indicated that a three-factor model provided good fit to the data, but a bifactor model provided better fit. Factor loadings indicated minimal misspecification and higher loadings on the general-factor. Invariance testing suggested equivalence across gender, athletic expertise, sport type, and injury status. Further, latent mean differences analyses indicated that females and injured athletes scored higher than male and non-injured athletes on all DASS-21 factors reporting higher mental health symptomology, those with more expertise scored higher on the general-factor and depression and those with less expertise scored higher on anxiety and stress, and no differences between team and individual athletes. In sample two (n = 589), the bifactor structure was replicated. Results largely supported the scales convergent validity with depression predicting POMS-D scores, whereas all three subscales predicted the SAS-2, ABQ, and APSQ scores.

While evidence suggests masks help curb the spread of respiratory pathogens, research is limited. Face masks have quickly become a topic of public debate as government mandates have started requiring their use. Here we investigate the association between self-reported mask wearing, social distancing and community SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the United States, as well as the effect of statewide mandates on mask uptake. METHODS: Serial cross-sectional surveys were administered June 3 through July 27, 2020 via web platform. Surveys queried individuals likelihood to wear a face mask to the grocery store or with family and friends. Responses (N=378,207) were aggregated by week and state and combined with measures of the instantaneous reproductive number (R(t)), social distancing proxies, respondent demographics and other potential sources of confounding. We fit multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the association between mask wearing and community transmission control (R(t) <1) for each state and week. Multiple sensitivity analyses were considered to corroborate findings across mask wearing definitions, R(t) estimators and data sources. Additionally, mask wearing in 12 states was evaluated two weeks before and after statewide mandates. RESULTS: We find an upward trend in mask usage across the U.S., although uptake varies by geography and demographic groups. A multivariate logistic model controlling for social distancing and other variables found a 10% increase in mask wearing was associated with a 3.53 (95% CI: 2.03, 6.43) odds of transmission control (R(t) <1). We also find that communities with high mask wearing and social distancing have the highest predicted probability of a controlled epidemic. These positive associations were maintained across sensitivity analyses. Segmented regression analysis of mask wearing found no statistical change following mandates, however the positive trend of increased mask wearing over time was preserved. CONCLUSION: Widespread utilization of face masks combined with social distancing increases the odds of SARS-CoV-2 transmission control. Mask wearing rose separately from government mask mandates, suggesting supplemental public health interventions are needed to maximize mask adoption and disrupt the spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially as social distancing measures are relaxed.","output":"Mask Wearing and Control of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and currently is considered a pandemic We present this review article with the aim of describing the characteristics of this disease in children Some hypotheses have been described that may explain the development of this disease in children, in addition to clinical and laboratory differences compared to adults No specific treatment has been reported for this population group Epidemiological studies in children should be carried out according to the context of each region to evaluate the behavior of this disease in this population","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19: Aspects to consider in children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has resulted in widespread social isolation, quarantines, and suspended academic activity.

These rVSV-based vaccines co-express SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant spike protein (SP) or the receptor binding domain (RBD) and four copies of the highly conserved M2 ectodomain (M2e) of influenza A fused with the Ebola glycoprotein DC-targeting/activation domain. Animal studies have shown that immunization with these bivalent rVSV vaccines induced efficient but variable levels of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza M2e protein. Significantly, our vaccine candidates induced production of high levels of neutralizing antibodies that protected cells against SARS-CoV-2 Delta and other SP-pseudovirus infections in culture. Furthermore, vaccination with the bivalent VSV vaccine via either intramuscular or intranasal route efficiently protected mice from the lethal challenge of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses and significantly reduced viral load in the lungs. These studies provide convincing evidence for the high efficacy of this bivalent vaccine to prevent influenza replication and initiate robust immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants. Further investigation of its efficacy to protect against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants will provide substantial evidence for new avenues to control two contagious respiratory infections, COVID-19 and influenza.","output":"Development and Characterization of Recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (rVSV)-based Bivalent Vaccine Against COVID-19 Delta Variant and Influenza Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To report the results of adjustable graded augmentation of superior rectus transposition, a novel modification of superior rectus transposition (SRT) designed to reduce postoperative vertical or torsional diplopia. METHODS The medical records of patients who underwent adjustable graded augmentation of SRT with or without adjustable medial rectus recession (MRc) from February 2017 to December 2019 were reviewed retrospectively. A Mendez ring was used to monitor torsional change after transposition of the superior rectus muscle to the lateral rectus muscle and after sequential placement of 2 or 3 augmentation sutures by superior rectus-lateral rectus loop myopexy. If excessive mechanical intorsion was induced, the responsible augmentation suture was severed intraoperatively. If torsional or vertical diplopia was noted after recovery, the distal-most augmentation suture was cut. Exotropia was managed by severing the distal-most augmentation suture or by medial rectus adjustment. RESULTS A total of 8 patients who underwent adjustable graded augmentation of SRT were included (6 using the 3-suture technique): 3 for esotropic Duane syndrome, 2 for abducens nerve palsy, 1 for Moebius syndrome, and 2 for combined trochlear and abducens nerve palsies. Of the 8 patients, 4 had prior strabismus surgery, and 1 patient had previously undergone treatment with botulinum toxin. Severing one augmentation suture in 3 cases resolved vertical (n = 2) or torsional (n = 1) diplopia and consecutive exotropia (n = 1), resulting in excellent alignment and reduction of torticollis to <4 in 7 cases. The technique proved insufficient in 1 patient, who had undergone 3 prior strabismus procedures.

We aimed to investigate the association of corticosteroids therapy with clinical outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this single-centre, retrospective cohort study, adult patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 and dead or discharged between 29 December 2019 and 15 February 2020 were studied; 1:1 propensity score matchings were performed between patients with or without corticosteroid treatment. A multivariable COX proportional hazards model was used to estimate the association between corticosteroid treatment and in-hospital mortality by taking corticosteroids as a time-varying covariate. RESULTS: Among 646 patients, the in-hospital death rate was higher in 158 patients with corticosteroid administration (72/158, 45.6% vs. 56/488, 11.5%, p < 0.0001). After propensity score matching analysis, no significant differences were observed in in-hospital death between patients with and without corticosteroid treatment (47/124, 37.9% vs. 47/124, 37.9%, p 1.000). When patients received corticosteroids before they required nasal high-flow oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation, the in-hospital death rate was lower than that in patients who were not administered corticosteroids (17/86, 19.8% vs. 26/86, 30.2%, log rank p 0.0102), whereas the time from admission to clinical improvement was longer (13 (IQR 10-17) days vs. 10 (IQR 8-13) days; p < 0.001). Using the Cox proportional hazards regression model accounting for time varying exposures in matched pairs, corticosteroid therapy was not associated with mortality difference (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93-1.03, p 0.4694).

Open tumorectomy was performed with parenchymal clamping. The warm ischemia time was 18 min. Pathologic examination confirmed a diagnosis of pT1a clear cell renal cell carcinoma with negative surgical margins. At 3 months postoperatively, computed tomography showed no local recurrence or metastasis and renal function was intact. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Horseshoe kidney is a rare congenital abnormality. Renal cell carcinoma is the most frequent tumor in adults having this anomaly and treatment in localised tumors if usually tumorectomy. Surgery may be challenging in some cases because of its difficulty.

Our objective was to assess the perception of patient safety in our unit at the end of the third wave of the COVID pandemic, with the intention of conducting subsequent improvement actions. METHODS: Observational, cross-sectional, and descriptive study. The perception of Safety Culture was estimated using the HSOPS questionnaire translated into Spanish. Some questions were posed in a positive sense, and others in a negative sense. The response was also rated as positive, negative, or neutral. Our findings were compared visually, not mathematically, with those found in the previous national study ?Analysis of the culture on patient safety in the hospital setting of the Spanish National Health System? published in 2009. A subgroup analysis was performed according to professional group and seniority as a health worker. The Student's t, (?) and ANOVA tests were used. RESULTS: Sixty-two professionals responded to the questionnaire, 73.90% of the total. The median time working in ICU 2 years (interquartile range 2-4.5 years). The rating for the degree of safety was 8.06 (SD 1.16). The majority (91.20%) had not reported any adverse event in the last year. A total of 30.90% had recently received patient safety training. The dimensions considered as weaknesses were 9 (?Staffing?, with 27.57% of positive responses) and 10 (Support of the hospital management in safety, with 17.64% of positive responses). The dimensions considered as strengths were 3 (?Expectation of actions by management / supervision of the service?) with 85.29% of positive responses, and 5 (?Teamwork?) with 95.58% of positive responses. The Cronbach's alpha index values suggest that the questionnaire has adequate internal consistency. In general, our data are more positive than those collected in the 2011 national survey, although the 2 dimensions considered weaknesses were already considered such in the previous work. CONCLUSIONS: The perception of patient safety in the ICU of our hospital after the end of the third wave of the COVID pandemic is adequate, with a more positive rating than that of the national study on safety culture at the hospital level carried out in 2009. The constant quest for patient safety should prioritize activity in the 2 dimensions considered weaknesses: staffing, and support from hospital management in everything related to patient safety.","output":"Valoracin de la cultura de seguridad del paciente en la UCI de un hospital de segundo nivel al finalizar la tercera oleada de COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The use of Google search engine has been widely used in public health-related concerns. Previous studies found that Google search trends (GST) can predict influenza, mortality, Zika epidemics, Ebola, etc. This study examines the relationship between the timing of Coronavirus-related Google search trends, lockdown, and new cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. Methods: We use national-level Google search trend data to examine whether the timing of Google search terms, i.e., their lag effects are associated with actual COVID-19 new cases from March 2, 2020, to December 7, 2020. We examine the effects of search terms (facemasks, handwash, n95) on the actual COVID-19 new cases using the vector autoregression (VAR) model. Results: Our general recursive vector autoregression model shows that search on facemasks and hand-wash can potentially decrease the risk communication of COVID-19 new cases. We find that the search on facemasks can substantially reduce that risk in the sense that search can increase the use of facemasks. We also examine the lag effect of lockdown and find that the effects are not sizeable on the risk communication because their lag-effects are different. The results of the impulse-response functions show that among the protective measures, lag effects of facemasks can substantially decrease the future risk communication of COVID-19 new cases. Conclusion: Because wearing facemasks can substantially reduce the risk of COVID-19 new cases, the government can utilize the Google search trends related to COVID-19 to disseminate the preventive information on COVID-19 and thus minimize the new cases and deaths.","output":"Google Search Interests and New Cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh: A Vector Autoregression Analysis for Disease Surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Routinely collected real world data (RWD) have great utility in aiding the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic response [1,2].

As part of the research by Fiocruz on working conditions among HCWs, we have conducted this study of death among MDs. We analyzed data from Federal Council of Medicine, the only national platform with details about deaths in MDs. A broad search of other sources, including the Ministry of Health, was done, but unfortunately, the data does not exist. A total of 622 MDs died from March 2020 to March 2021: 87.6% male and 75% over age 60. The Southeast had the highest percentage (34.7%), followed by the Northeast (27.2%), and rankings by state showed Rio de Janeiro (15.8%), followed by S?o Paulo, Par, Paran and Paraba, totalizing 50.1%. The specialties with highest mortality were gynecology (12.2%), pediatrics (10.0%), internal medicine (9.3%), general surgery (7.8%) and cardiology (7.6%). May 2020 was the month of worst mortality (16.9%) followed by July and June. A slow decline was observed until October, when Brazil begun to experience the second wave. The vaccination of MDs began at the end of January 2021 and has not been sufficient time to evaluate the impact on morbimortality. The results of a study of 50 professional categories are under analysis and will be published soon as well as a study of invisible HCWs, who do not have specific training but are essential to supporting health care system, from primary care units to high-complexity hospitals.

In January 2018, we selected five barbershops/salons in Japan where customers were educated on frailty, which was classified as normal, prefrail, and frail. We developed a web-based assessment tool to reduce the workload for barbers/stylists. Participants included 45 customers (82% women), with a median (interquartile range) age of 53.0 (47.5C57.5) years, and a mean  SD BMI of 22.3  2.7. Frailty scores indicated that 35% of participants were normal, 58% were prefrail, and 7% were frail. Frailty status scores reflected no significant differences after the intervention. Customers classified as frail were advised to visit the regional comprehensive support center for further professional frailty assessment. Participants, especially those aged over 65 years, found the web-based assessment difficult to use.

As evidence is emerging that these measures may have slowed the spread of the pandemic, it is important to assess the impact of any changes in strategy, including scenarios for school reopening and broader relaxation of social distancing. This work uses an individual-based model to predict the impact of a suite of possible strategies to reopen schools in the UK, including that currently proposed by the UK government. Methods We use Covasim, a stochastic agent-based model for transmission of COVID-19, calibrated to the UK epidemic. The model describes individuals' contact networks stratified as household, school, work and community layers, and uses demographic and epidemiological data from the UK. We simulate a range of different school reopening strategies with a society-wide relaxation of lockdown measures and in the presence of different non-pharmaceutical interventions, to estimate the number of new infections, cumulative cases and deaths, as well as the effective reproduction number with different strategies. To account for uncertainties within the stochastic simulation, we also simulated different levels of infectiousness of children and young adults under 20 years old compared to older ages. Findings We found that with increased levels of testing of people (between 25% and 72% of symptomatic people tested at some point during an active COVID-19 infection depending on scenarios) and effective contact-tracing and isolation for infected individuals, an epidemic rebound may be prevented across all reopening scenarios, with the effective reproduction number (R) remaining below one and the cumulative number of new infections and deaths significantly lower than they would be if testing did not increase. If UK schools reopen in phases from June 2020, prevention of a second wave would require testing 51% of symptomatic infections, tracing of 40% of their contacts, and isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed cases. However, without such measures, reopening of schools together with gradual relaxing of the lockdown measures are likely to induce a secondary pandemic wave, as are other scenarios for reopening. When infectiousness of <20 year olds was varied from 100% to 50% of that of older ages, our findings remained unchanged. Interpretation To prevent a secondary COVID-19 wave, relaxation of social distancing including reopening schools in the UK must be implemented alongside an active large-scale population-wide testing of symptomatic individuals and effective tracing of their contacts, followed by isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed individuals. Such combined measures have a greater likelihood of controlling the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and preventing a large number of COVID-19 deaths than reopening schools and society with the current level of implementation of testing and isolation of infected individuals.","output":"Determining the optimal strategy for reopening schools, work and society in the UK: balancing earlier opening and the impact of test and trace strategies with the risk of occurrence of a secondary COVID-19 pandemic wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona viruses (CoVs) are a group of infectious viruses that causes the regular cold to more extreme illnesses like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and epic Covid (nCoV) is another strain that has been recently recognized in people.

More than one out of five women treated for breast cancer will develop lymphedema in an upper extremity. Current evidence advocates transdisciplinary oncological rehabilitation. Therefore, research in this area is necessary since limited consensus having been reached with regard to the basic essential components of this rehabilitation. Consensus has, however, been reached on the use of decongestive lymphedema therapy (DLT), but due to a lack of tests, the necessary dosages are unknown and its level is moderately strong. This study attempts to verify both the efficacy of activity-oriented proprioceptive antiedema therapy (TAPA), as compared to conventional treatments such as DLT or Complex Physical Therapy (CPT), as well as its efficiency in terms of cost-effectiveness, for patients affected by breast cancer-related arm lymphedema. METHODS: Controlled, randomized clinical trial with dual stratification, two parallel arms, longitudinal and single blind. 64 women with breast cancer-related arm lymphedema will take part in the study. The experimental group intervention will be the same for stage I and II, and will consist of neuro-dynamic exercises oriented to the activity, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation activities and proprioceptive anti-edema bandaging. The control group intervention, depending on the stage, will consist of preventive measures, skin care and exercise-prescribed training in the lymphedema workshop as well as compression garments (Stage I) or conservative Complex Decongestive Therapy treatment (skin care, multi-layer bandaging, manual lymphatic drainage and massage therapy) (Stage II). RESULTS: Sociodemographic and clinical variables will be collected for the measurement of edema volume and ADL performance. Statistical analysis will be performed on intent to treat. DISCUSSION: It has been recommended that patient training be added to DLT, as well as a re-designing of patient lifestyles and the promotion of health-related aspects. In addition, clinical trials should be undertaken to assess neural mobilization techniques and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation should be included in the therapy. Cohesive bandaging will also be performed as an early form of pressotherapy. The proposed study combines all of these aspects in order to increased comfort and promote the participation of individuals with lymphedema in everyday situations. LIMITATIONS: The authors have proposed the assessment of the experimental treatment for stages I and II. One possible limitation is the lack of awareness of whether or not this treatment would be effective for other stages as well as the concern for proper hand cleansing during use of bandages, given the current COVID-19 pandemic situation.

Proteolytic cleavage of pp1ab generates products nsp9 to nsp12. The proteolytic pp1a cleavage products process and cleave pp1a and pp1ab into nsp products. The nsp9 to nsp12 are involved in virus genome transcription and replication. The 3' end of the viral genome encodes four minor and three major structural proteins. The GP(2a), GP? and GP? (encoded by ORF2a, 3 and 4), are glycosylated membrane associated minor structural proteins. The fourth minor structural protein, the E protein (encoded by ORF2b), is an unglycosylated membrane associated protein. The viral envelope contains two major structural proteins: a glycosylated major envelope protein GP? (encoded by ORF5) and an unglycosylated membrane M protein (encoded by ORF6). The third major structural protein is the nucleocapsid N protein (encoded by ORF7). All PRRSV non-structural and structural proteins are essential for virus replication, and PRRSV infectivity is relatively intolerant to subtle changes within the structural proteins.

The intermolecular interactions were analyzed in a qualitative manner based on the Hirshfeld surface and 2D-fingerprint plots.

Antibiotics treatment enhances serum IgG1 responses in mice immunized systemically with a model polyvalent vaccine. This increase was not seen for other IgG subclasses and was dependent on the immunogenicity of vaccine antigens. The broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail also enhanced serum IgA responses. Interestingly, both the broad spectrum and the antibiotic targeting Gram-negative bacteria enhanced the number of IgA antibody secreting cells in the intestinal lamina propria. This effect was unlikely to be due to an increase in cells expressing gut-homing receptors (i.e., CCR9 and (4)(7)) in peripheral tissues. On the other hand, the microbiome in mice treated with antibiotics was characterized by an overall reduction of the number of firmicutes. Furthermore, Bacteroidetes were increased by either treatment, and Proteobacteria were increased by the broad-spectrum antibiotics cocktail.

This pandemic demonstrates the importance of timely access to intensive care and, therefore, this study aims to explore the accessibility of intensive care beds in 14 European countries and its impact on the COVID-19 case fatality ratio (CFR). METHODS: We examined access to intensive care beds by deriving (1) a regional ratio of intensive care beds to 100,000 population capita (accessibility index, AI) and (2) the distance to the closest intensive care unit. The cross-sectional analysis was performed at a 5-by-5 km spatial resolution and results were summarized nationally for 14 European countries. The relationship between AI and CFR was analyzed at the regional level. RESULTS: We found national-level differences in the levels of access to intensive care beds. The AI was highest in Germany (AI = 35.3), followed by Estonia (AI = 33.5) and Austria (AI = 26.4), and lowest in Sweden (AI = 5) and Denmark (AI = 6.4). The average travel distance to the closest hospital was highest in Croatia (25.3 min by car) and lowest in Luxembourg (9.1 min). Subnational results illustrate that capacity was associated with population density and national-level inventories. The correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation of ICU accessibility and COVID-19 CFR (r = - 0.57; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Geographical access to intensive care beds varies significantly across European countries and low ICU accessibility was associated with a higher proportion of COVID-19 deaths to cases (CFR). Important differences in access are due to the sizes of national resource inventories and the distribution of health-care facilities relative to the human population.

Ivermectin has a better output on treating mild to moderate symptoms covid-19 but further study is required to know the outcome from treating severe to critical illness. Oseltamivir only works on mild cases of covid-19, early-onset therapy on patient covid-19 can reduce the time of fever. An antibacterial is applied on the covid-19 patients with pneumonia and for cytokine storm patients required tocilizumab on therapy. Severe to critical cases of covid-19 can be given corticosteroid. Lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have a poor antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. In conclusion, for severe to critical illness required hydroxychloroquine or favipiravir as antiviral agent plus antibacterial agent, if cytokine storm is developed tocilizumab can be given.

METHODS One patient underwent LESS splenectomy for idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), and a pediatric patient with sickle cell disease underwent LESS splenectomy and cholecystectomy. In each case, a 2-cm vertical incision was made within the confines of the umbilical ring, and a SILS port (Covidien, Norwalk CT) inserted. A 5-mm, 30-degree laparoscope and standard 5-mm instruments were used. After isolation of the splenic hilum, one 5-mm trocar of the SILS port was upsized to 12mm, and a laparoscopic stapler was used to divide the splenic artery and vein. An internal retractor consisting of a laparoscopic bulldog clamp with a hook attachment was used to retract the gallbladder, and to secure the specimen retrieval bag during splenic extraction, which eliminated the need for a fourth trocar. RESULTS Total operative time was 160 minutes for the LESS splenectomy, and 216 minutes for the LESS splenectomy and cholecystectomy. Both procedures were successfully completed with conventional instrumentation and a SILS port, without the need for additional incisions or trocars. No complications occurred, and both patients had an uneventful recovery. CONCLUSIONS LESS splenectomy is a feasible procedure that can be performed safely. Although articulating instruments and laparoscopes may offer advantages, they are not necessary for performing LESS splenectomy.","output":"Laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) splenectomy with a conventional laparoscope and instruments."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The study of flaviviruses, which cause some of the most important emerging tropical and sub-tropical human arbovirus diseases, has greatly benefited from the use of reverse genetic systems since its first development for yellow fever virus in 1989. Reverse genetics technology has completely revolutionized the study of these viruses, making it possible to manipulate their genomes and evaluate the direct effects of these changes on their biology and pathogenesis. The most commonly used reverse genetics system is the infectious clone technology. Whilst flavivirus infectious clones provide a powerful tool, their construction as full-length cDNA molecules in bacterial vectors can be problematic, laborious and time consuming, because they are often unstable, contain unwanted induced substitutions and may be toxic for bacteria due to viral protein expression. The incredible technological advances that have been made during the past 30years, such as the use of PCR or new sequencing methods, have allowed the development of new approaches to improve preexisting systems or elaborate new strategies that overcome these problems. This review summarizes the evolution and major technical breakthroughs in the development of flavivirus reverse genetics technologies and their application to the further understanding and control of these viruses and their diseases.","output":"Flavivirus reverse genetic systems, construction techniques and applications: A historical perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although viruses are the most common causes of childhood throat infections, interest in the etiology of these infections has primarily focused on whether an individual episode is caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), particularly since the recent outbreaks of rheumatic fever in certain areas of the country.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a class of crucial regulators for gene expression and are involved in the regulation of virus defence and immunological processes. To understand miRNA regulation in chickens in response to IBV infection, high-throughput sequencing was performed to compare the small RNA libraries from the kidneys of chicken infected with SCK2, SCDY2 and LDT3-A. By comparing these data to healthy chickens, a total of 58 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were identified. The DE miRNAs were further classified into five miRNA expression patterns (up or down regulation compared to control). Using Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment prediction, the DE miRNAs were shown to be mostly associated with metabolic processes, catalytic activities, gene expression, binding activities and immune responses. Seven highly expressed miRNAs (gga-miR-30d, gga-miR-1454, gga-miR-7b, gga-miR-215-5p, gga-miR-1a-3p, gga-miR-3538 and gga-miR-2954) were selected for miRNA-mRNA conjoint analysis. Furthermore, the miRNAs inversely correlated with the corresponding target gene mRNAs. These seven miRNAs were considered to play an important role in IBV-host interactions and the differing virulence of IBV strains. This is the first demonstration that infection with different virulent IBVs elicits different expression of miRNAs in chicken kidneys; this expression also seems to be associated with the virulence of IBV. These results are significant for the study of immune responses to infection with different virulent IBVs mediated by miRNAs as well as the interaction between the chicken host and IBV.","output":"MicroRNA transcriptome analysis in chicken kidneys in response to differing virulent infectious bronchitis virus infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the cointegration between possible determinants of crude oil futures prices during the COVID-19 pandemic period.

Therefore, the main aim of this study is to investigate maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Besides, it investigates the likelihood of vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection from pregnant women to their neonates. Methods A retrospective descriptive study was conducted in three medical centers during the period from March to November 2020. Data were collected from the available medical records in the respective hospitals using a standardized questionnaire on maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes. All pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection across the three hospitals and their neonates were eligible to participate in this study. Descriptive statistics were presented as a median and interquartile range (IQR) or frequencies and percentages as appropriate using SPSS 24.0 software. Results This study has identified a total of 288 pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection over the study period of a median age of 30 years and median GA at diagnosis 38 weeks (IQR: 39 -33) as well as 27% of them were obese (n=78). The majority of pregnant women were symptomatic with cough (n=92, 31.9%) being the most frequent COVID-19 symptom followed by fever and dyspnea (n=36, 12.5%). Two-hundred and four pregnant delivered (70.84%) and caesarean sections were prevalent among 35.8% of them. The most common adverse pregnancy outcome was premature (n=31, 15.5%), followed by fetal distress (n=13, 6.5%), preeclampsia (n=4, 2.0%), and one pregnant woman died. The laboratory results exhibit that temperature higher than 38 (n=27), leukopenia (n=19), neutropenia (n=54), ALT (n=12), AST (n=31), and thrombocytopenia (n=35) were less frequent among pregnant women while lymphopenia (n=126), hemoglobin levels lower than 13.0 (n=218), deceased albumin levels (n=195) were most frequent among them. However, a small proportion of pregnant women were admitted to the ICU (3.8%). The most frequent maternal treatments were antibiotics (n=81), antiviral (n=49), and corticosteroid (n=24). Of 204 neonates, four had died and all the remaining neonates were alive. The median gestational age at delivery was 39 weeks (IQR: 35C40). Most neonates had normal laboratory results. However, 14 had lymphopenia (7.0%), 22 had neutropenia (11.0%), and 11 had thrombocytopenia (5.5%). Four infants had low hemoglobin levels of less than 13.0 (2.0%) and 81 had hyperbilirubinemia (e.g., total bilirubin of higher than 23; 40.5%). Approximately less than one-half of neonates required admission to the NICU (n=86, 43%), 7% of them required respiratory support of mechanical ventilation, and none of them get infected with COVID-19 disease. Conclusion This multicenter study suggests that the majority of pregnant women had mild or moderate disease symptoms. Nevertheless, this study did not find any evidence of possible vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection from mothers to their babies.

We recruited primary care physicians (PCPs) and measured PIM use in a sample of their patients (65 years or older). Educational workshops for PCPs were organized with the involvement of clinician champions. Practical deprescribing algorithms were designed based on Beers criteria. Automatic email alerts based on specific PIMs recorded in each patient's electronic health record were used as a reminder tool. PCPs were responsible for deprescribing decisions. We randomly sampled 879 patients taking PIMs from eight of the most commonly used drug classes at our institution and compared basal (6 months prior to the intervention) and final (12 months after) prevalence of PIM use using a test of proportions.

The Covid-19 health emergency has seen healthcare workers in the front line facing all the difficulties related to the care burden. One of the most significant and probably underinvestigated aspects is the psychological stress of the healthcare staff managing the emergency. The aim of the paper is to analyze the literature on the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the psychological well-being of health professionals. Methodology: We conducted a systematic review of articles published on this topic during the months from January 2020 to December 2020, searching on Pub Med, Scopus and Web of Science databases. Results: Most of the issues can be summarized into five conceptual categories: Stress, Depression and Infection Anxiety, Anguish, Insomnia, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Suicide. The literature identifies many factors contributing to the onset of anxiety, depression, and stress, like the fear of contracting the disease and transmitting it to family members and friends, stressful shifts, and little rest among several others. The literature highlights the needs for adequate measures, including proper psychological support. Conclusion: The conducted review suggests that the behaviours of healthcare professionals during the emergency phase of the Covid-19 pandemic show psychological disorders that can compromise mental health. Therefore, there is a call for those in chief like hospital managers and policymakers to take action, promoting measures like surveillance, monitoring, and psychological support among others, to increase the resilience of healthcare workers, limiting stress and anxiety and allowing them to keep their performance at work.","output":"The impact of Covid-19 healthcare emergency on the psychological well-being of health professionals: a review of literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objective: To assess the frequency of mental health problems among healthcare workers related to COVID-19 pandemic among health care workers in a tertiary cardiac care center Study Design: Descriptive cross sectional study Place and Duration of Study: This study was conducted at Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology/National Institute of Heart Diseases (AFIC/NIHD) Rawalpindi (Pakistan) from Apr 2020 to Jun 2020 Methodology: This study was a hospital-based cross-sectional study consisted of 100 healthcare workers including 50 nurses and 50 doctors who volunteered to enroll in our study were included Approval from the clinical research ethics committee of cardiac care hospital was received before the initiation of this study Verbal informed consent was provided by all study participants prior to their enrollment Exclusion criteria comprised of the healthcare workers who refused to participate in it This study followed the COVID-19 Pandemic Mental Health Questionnaire (CoPaQ) 14 Descriptive statistics were used to describe the percentages and frequencies Descriptive statistics were used to describe the percentages and frequencies were calculated and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 23 0 Results: A total of 100 healthcare workers completed the survey Mean age of the healthcare workers was 36 5  27 0 years (median=36 00), and 75 (75%) were women and men comprised 25 (25%) Of all participants, 50 (50 0%) were nurses, and 50 (50%) were doctors A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of COVID-19, 6 (6 0%), tested positive 14 (14%), currently quarantine 24 (24 0%) While 12 healthcare workers experienced 14 day quarantine time period 16 healthcare workers reported COVID test positive of their closed one The fear of infecting others with COVID-19 was found to be 30 (30%) The mental stress that that COVID-19 will personally affect us was found in 28 (28%) of healthcare workers The fear that consequences of the COVID-19 will be severe health disasters was found in 40 (40%) of the individuals Conclusion: In this study of physicians and nurses in hospitals with wards for patients with COVID-19, health care workers responding to the spread of COVID-19 reported high rates of symptoms of anxiety, fear, and distress","output":"Impact of Covid-19 on Mental Health of Healthcare Workers during Pandemic;an Experience at a Tertiary Cardiac Care Set Up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Keywords: passive risk;compliance;COVID-19;self-control;time perspective","output":"Compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines: Active vs. passive risk takers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early in the COVID-19 pandemic there was widespread concern that healthcare systems would be overwhelmed, and specifically, that there would be insufficient critical care capacity in terms of beds, ventilators or staff to care for patients.

The hyperphosphorylated guanine nucleotide (p)ppGpp is an ancient and universal second messenger of bacteria that has pleotropic effects on the physiology of these organisms. Initially described as a stress signal-an alarmone-it is now clear that (p)ppGpp plays a more general and fundamental role in bacterial adaptation, by integrating multiple internal and environmental signals to establish the optimal balance between growth and maintenance functions at any given time. Given such centrality, perturbation of the (p)ppGpp pathway will affect bacteria in multiple ways, from the ability to adjust metabolism to the available nutrients to the capacity to differentiate into developmental forms adapted to colonize different niches. Here, we provide an overview of the (p)ppGpp pathway, how it affects bacterial growth, survival and virulence, and its connection with antibiotic tolerance and persistence. We will emphasize the dysfunctions of cells living without (p)ppGpp and finalize by reviewing the efforts and prospects of developing inhibitors of this pathway, and how these could be employed to improve current antibiotic therapy.","output":"Many birds with one stone: targeting the (p)ppGpp signaling pathway of bacteria to improve antimicrobial therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Currently, there are two well-established methods of bowel lengthening in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS)-longitudinal intestinal lengthening and tailoring (LILT) and serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP) [1-4]. Both procedures may carry a high reported morbidity and mortality of 30.2% and 14.4%, respectively [5]. We report the outcomes of a novel technique: double barrel enteroplasty (DBE) for autologous intestinal reconstruction. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of all ten patients who underwent DBE at our institution since 2011. All patients have SBS and were dependent on parenteral nutrition (PN) at the time of surgery. Etiologies were gastroschisis (n = 4), bowel atresia (n = 3), necrotising enterocolitis (n = 1), volvulus (n = 1), and near-total intestinal aganglionosis (n = 1). Patient survival, complications, and subsequent enteral autonomy were evaluated. RESULTS All patients are alive with normal liver function. Five children achieved enteral autonomy, while the remaining are on weaning PN. There was no bleeding, anastomotic leak, perforation, infective complications, or intestinal necrosis. No patient has required a liver and/or intestinal transplant. CONCLUSIONS Double barrel enteroplasty is technically feasible and safe. It has similar efficacy and may have fewer complications when compared with other methods of autologous intestinal reconstruction.","output":"Double barrel enteroplasty for the management of short bowel syndrome in children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although many persons in the United States have acquired immunity to COVID-19, either through vaccination or infection with SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 will pose an ongoing threat to non-immune persons so long as disease transmission continues. We can estimate when sustained disease transmission will end in a population by calculating the population-specific basic reproduction number [R]0, the expected number of secondary cases generated by an infected person in the absence of any interventions. The value of [R]0 relates to a herd immunity threshold (HIT), which is given by 1 - 1/[R]0. When the immune fraction of a population exceeds this threshold, sustained disease transmission becomes exponentially unlikely (barring mutations allowing SARS-CoV-2 to escape immunity). Here, we report state-level [R]0 estimates obtained using Bayesian inference. Maximum a posteriori estimates range from 7.1 for New Jersey to 2.3 for Wyoming, indicating that disease transmission varies considerably across states and that reaching herd immunity will be more difficult in some states than others. [R]0 estimates were obtained from compartmental models via the next-generation matrix approach after each model was parameterized using regional daily confirmed case reports of COVID-19 from 21-January-2020 to 21-June-2020. Our [R]0 estimates characterize infectiousness of ancestral strains, but they can be used to determine HITs for a distinct, currently dominant circulating strain, such as SARS-CoV-2 variant Delta (lineage B.1.617.2), if the relative infectiousness of the strain can be ascertained. On the basis of Delta-adjusted HITs, vaccination data, and seroprevalence survey data, we find that no state has achieved herd immunity as of 20-September-2021.

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is the most important initiative to monitor and regulate the international trade of wildlife but its credibility is dependent on the quality of the trade data. We report on the performance of CITES reporting by focussing on the commercial trade in non-native reptiles and amphibians into Thailand as to illustrate trends, species composition and numbers of wild-caught vs. captive-bred specimens. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Based on data in the WCMC-CITES trade database, we establish that a total of 75,594 individuals of 169 species of reptiles and amphibians (including 27 globally threatened species) were imported into Thailand in 1990C2007. The majority of individuals (59,895, 79%) were listed as captive-bred and a smaller number (15,699, 21%) as wild-caught. In the 1990s small numbers of individuals of a few species were imported into Thailand, but in 2003 both volumes and species diversity increased rapidly. The proportion of captive-bred animals differed greatly between years (from 0 to >80%). Wild-caught individuals were mainly sourced from African countries, and captive-bred individuals from Asian countries (including from non-CITES Parties). There were significant discrepancies between exports and imports. Thailand reports the import of >10,000 individuals (51 species) originating from Kazakhstan, but Kazakhstan reports no exports of these species. Similar discrepancies, involving smaller numbers (>100 individuals of 9 species), can be seen in the import of reptiles into Thailand via Macao. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: While there has been an increase in imports of amphibian and reptiles into Thailand, erratic patterns in proportions of captive-bred specimens and volumes suggests either capricious markets or errors in reporting. Large discrepancies with respect to origin point to misreporting or possible violations of the rules and intentions of CITES.","output":"The Role of Thailand in the International Trade in CITES-Listed Live Reptiles and Amphibians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Column subset selection is a hard combinatorial optimization problem with applications in operations research, data analysis, and machine learning It involves the search for fixedClength subsets of columns from large data matrices and can be used for lowCrank approximation of highCdimensional data It can be also used to preprocess data for image classification In this work, we study column subset selection in the context of radiography image analysis and concentrate on the detection of COVID-19 from chest XCray imagery ?

The country first experienced the outbreak on February 27, 2020, and the experience since then has shown negative effects not only on the socioeconomic conditions but also on agriculture, food security and dietary intake. Long term in-depth analysis of the effects of this pandemic on food security and dietary intake using quantitative data is still very difficult due to paucity of data and the great level of the improbability of the trajectory of the spread of the Virus. This study is a rapid assessment of the short and long-term potential effects of the disease. It relied on a review of situation reports especially by the Nigeria Centre of Disease Control and other reports around the world on COVID-19, personal observations, and public opinion via mobile telephone survey of Lagos and Oyo States, Nigeria. Findings show that food demand and supply shocks caused by COVID-19 outbreak affect agriculture, food and dietary intake negatively through COVID-19 policies. It leads to a reduction in household income coupled with hike in food prices. Owing to the Nigerias crude farming practice, there was a scarcity of hired labour required for production process during 2020 farming season. This implies a high likelihood of low output and further surge in food prices in the future. Food access was also compromised with the accumulation of unsold fresh produce by the smallholder farmers and the low salary earners during movement restrictions and of loss income as a result of international border closure. Food and dietary intake is affected as people are shifting diets to more affordable and low quality foods, while food stability is not guaranteed due to market insecurity, prompting an extraordinary level of indecision. The study concludes that the shock of COVID-19 is not only a demand management problem but a multidimensional crisis requiring monetary, fiscal, and health policy responses with global collaboration and cooperation.","output":"Assessment of the Immediate and Potential Long-Term Effects of COVID-19 Outbreak on Socioeconomics, Agriculture, Security of Food and Dietary Intake in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Students in higher education often face mental health problems with inadequate treatment options.

Medical oncology communities have developed treatment modifications to balance the risk of contracting the virus with the benefit of improving cancer-related outcomes. METHODS: We systemically examined our community cancer center database to display patterns of change and to unveil factors that have been considered with each decision. We studied a cohort of 282 patients receiving treatment and found that 159 patients (56.4%) had treatment modifications. RESULTS: The incidence of treatment modification was observed in patients undergoing adjuvant and neoadjuvant (41.4%), palliative (62.9%), or injectable endocrine or bone-modulating only (76.0%) treatments. Modifications were applied to regimens with myelosuppressive (56.5%), immunosuppressive (69.2%), and immunomodulating (61.5%) potentials. These modifications also affected intravenous (54.9%) and subcutaneous injectable treatments (62.5%) more than oral treatments (15.8%). Treatment modifications in 112 patients (70.4%) were recommended by providers, and 47 (29.6%) were initiated by patients. The most common strategy of modification was to skip or postpone a scheduled treatment (49%). Among treatment with no modifications, treatment regimens were maintained in patients who tolerated treatment well (37.0%), in treatments with curative intent (22%), and in symptomatic patients who required treatment (14%). CONCLUSION: Our observation and analysis suggested that the primary goal of treatment modification was to decrease potential exposure. The pattern also reflected the negative impact of the pandemic on health care providers who initiated these changes.

We examined disability, quality of life, survival and acute care costs in the EXTEND-IA trial, which used CT-perfusion imaging selection. Methods Large vessel ischemic stroke patients with favorable CT-perfusion were randomized to endovascular thrombectomy after alteplase versus alteplase-only. Clinical outcome was prospectively measured using 90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS). Individual patient expected survival and net difference in Disability/Quality-adjusted life years (DALY/QALY) up to 15 years from stroke were modeled using age, sex, 90-day mRS, and utility scores. Level of care within the first 90 days was prospectively measured and used to estimate procedure and inpatient care costs (US$ reference year 2014). Results There were 70 patients, 35 in each arm, mean age 69, median NIHSS 15 (IQR 12-19). The median (IQR) disability-weighted utility score at 90 days was 0.65 (0.00-0.91) in the alteplase-only versus 0.91 (0.65-1.00) in the endovascular group (p = 0.005). Modeled life expectancy was greater in the endovascular versus alteplase-only group (median 15.6 versus 11.2 years, p = 0.02). The endovascular thrombectomy group had fewer simulated DALYs lost over 15 years [median (IQR) 5.5 (3.2-8.7) versus 8.9 (4.7-13.8), p = 0.02] and more QALY gained [median (IQR) 9.3 (4.2-13.1) versus 4.9 (0.3-8.5), p = 0.03]. Endovascular patients spent less time in hospital [median (IQR) 5 (3-11) days versus 8 (5-14) days, p = 0.04] and rehabilitation [median (IQR) 0 (0-28) versus 27 (0-65) days, p = 0.03]. The estimated inpatient costs in the first 90 days were less in the thrombectomy group (average US$15,689 versus US$30,569, p = 0.008) offsetting the costs of interhospital transport and the thrombectomy procedure (average US$10,515).

Upon coinfection with infectious standard virus (STV), DIPs interfere with STV replication through competitive inhibition. Thus, DIPs are proposed as potent antivirals for treatment of the influenza disease. To select corresponding candidates, we studied de novo generation of DIPs and propagation competition between different defective interfering (DI) vRNAs in an STV coinfection scenario in cell culture. A small-scale two-stage cultivation system that allows long-term semi-continuous propagation of IAV and its DIPs was used. Strong periodic oscillations in virus titers were observed due to the dynamic interaction of DIPs and STVs. Using next-generation sequencing, we detected a predominant formation and accumulation of DI vRNAs on the polymerase-encoding segments. Short DI vRNAs accumulated to higher fractions than longer ones, indicating a replication advantage, yet an optimum fragment length was observed. Some DI vRNAs showed breaking points in a specific part of their bundling signal (belonging to the packaging signal), suggesting its dispensability for DI vRNA propagation. Over a total cultivation time of 21 days, several individual DI vRNAs accumulated to high fractions, while others decreased. Using reverse genetics for IAV, purely clonal DIPs derived from highly replicating DI vRNAs were generated. We confirm that these DIPs exhibit a superior in vitro interfering efficacy compared to DIPs derived from lowly accumulated DI vRNAs and suggest promising candidates for efficacious antiviral treatment. IMPORTANCE Defective interfering particles (DIPs) emerge naturally during viral infection and typically show an internal deletion in the viral genome. Thus, DIPs are propagation-incompetent. Previous research suggests DIPs as potent antiviral compounds for many different virus families due to their ability to interfere with virus replication by competitive inhibition. For instance, the administration of influenza A virus (IAV) DIPs resulted in a rescue of mice from an otherwise lethal IAV dose. Moreover, no apparent toxic effects were observed when only DIPs were administered to mice and ferrets. IAV DIPs show antiviral activity against many different IAV strains, including pandemic and highly pathogenic avian strains, and even against nonhomologous viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, by stimulation of innate immunity. Here, we used a cultivation/infection system, which exerted selection pressure toward accumulation of highly competitive IAV DIPs. These DIPs showed a superior interfering efficacy in vitro, and we suggest them for effective antiviral therapy.","output":"Semi-continuous Propagation of Influenza A Virus and Its Defective Interfering Particles: Analyzing the Dynamic Competition To Select Candidates for Antiviral Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fluorescence microscopy is a workhorse tool in biomedical imaging but often poses substantial challenges to practitioners in achieving bright or uniform labeling.

In this study, inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in thin-film buffered aqueous solution (pH 7.4) was determined across UVC irradiation wavelengths of 222 to 282 nm from krypton chloride (KrCl*) excimers, a low-pressure mercury-vapor lamp, and two UVC light-emitting diodes. Our results show that all tested UVC devices can effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2, among which the KrCl* excimer had the best disinfection performance (i.e., highest inactivation rate).

The associations between 1) BMI and 2) nutritional status, assessed using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment - Short Form (MNA-SF) scale, and short-term in-geriatric hospital mortality were performed using logistic regression. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, polypharmacy, frailty and the wave of the pandemic (first vs. second), underweight defined as BMI<18.5 increased the risk of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients (odds ratio [OR] = 2.30; confidence interval [CI] = 1.17C4.31). Overweight and obesity were not associated with in-hospital mortality. Malnutrition; i.e. MNA-SF 0C7 points, increased the risk of in-hospital mortality in patients treated for COVID-19 (OR = 2.03; CI = 1.16C3.68) and other causes (OR = 6.01; CI = 2.73C15.91). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that obesity is not a risk factor for very old patients with COVID-19, but emphasize the role of underweight and malnutrition for in-hospital mortality in geriatric patients with COVID-19.","output":"Body mass index and Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form as predictors of in-geriatric hospital mortality in older adults with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proceedings contain 53 papers The topics discussed include: Ras mutations in the Erk-MAPK pathway and cancer: alternate therapies examined in an ODE-based computational model;mathematic models of interspecific relationships;evaluation of COVID-19 epidemic based on sir model;predictive modeling of diabetic kidney disease using random forest algorithm along with features selection;text classification of diseases treated by traditional Chinese medicine prescription based on machine learning;whole scene reconstruction of medical service robots fused with key frame focus stack images;arrhythmia classifier using a layer-wise quantized convolutional neural network for resource-constrained devices;research on promoting the application of disease prediction system based on machine learning;and spectrum analysis of bone-conducted speech  a study based on intelligibility scoring","output":"Proceedings of the 2020 International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence in Medical Sciences, ISAIMS 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 can be accompanied by acute neurological complications of both central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS and PNS).

The training is based on the method of video analysis, involving simulated patients, making online implementation extremely challenging. AIM: The study aims to present our experiences with the online training and to analyse the students' evaluations. METHOD: We used the free version of Zoom for small groups of five students, a trainer and a simulated patient. All students participated in a situation that we recorded. The viewing of the recordings was followed by group discussion. Then, the students evaluated the course using an online questionnaire. We used descriptive statistics and content analysis. RESULTS: 74.4% of the students (n = 64) completed the questionnaire. 78.1-100% of them gave a good (4) or excellent (5) evaluation for the questions. The highest average score (4.95  0.21) was given to the professionalism of the trainers, the lowest was given to the choice of topic of the theoretical part (4.06  1.02). The majority of the students were satisfied with the course, they would be happy to attend it again; however, in-person learning still seems to be the preferred option. CONCLUSION: The online practice was a success. In many ways, it proved to be an adequate replacement for the traditional form. The students evaluated the training similarly to those of previous years. The lack of personal contact is a limiting factor, thus, online practice should not be seen as an alternative to personal communication trainings; however, as an independent form of training, it can make a significant contribution to effective, modern education.

These molecules include extracellular nucleic acids, extracellular purinergic nucleotides (ATP, ADP), cytokines and extracellular HMGB1. They are recognized as a danger signal by immune cells, platelets and endothelial cells. Hence, endothelial cells are capable of sensing environmental cues through a wide variety of receptors expressed at the plasma membrane. The endothelium is then responding by expressing pro-coagulant proteins, including tissue factor, and inflammatory molecules such as cytokines and chemokines involved in the recruitment and activation of platelets and leukocytes. This ultimately leads to thrombosis, which is an active pro-inflammatory process, tightly regulated, that needs to be properly resolved to avoid further vascular damages. These mechanisms are often dysregulated, which promote fibrinolysis defects, activation of the immune system and irreversible vascular damages further contributing to thrombotic and inflammatory processes. The concept of thrombo-inflammation is now widely used to describe the complex interactions between the coagulation and inflammation in various cardiovascular diseases. In endothelial cells, activating signals converge to multiple intracellular pathways leading to phenotypical changes turning them into inflammatory-like cells. Accumulating evidence suggest that endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) may be a major mechanism of endothelial dysfunction induced during inflammation and thrombosis. EndMT is a biological process where endothelial cells lose their endothelial characteristics and acquire mesenchymal markers and functions. Endothelial dysfunction might play a central role in orchestrating and amplifying thrombo-inflammation thought induction of EndMT processes. Mechanisms regulating endothelial dysfunction have been only partially uncovered in the context of thrombotic diseases. In the present review, we focus on the importance of the endothelial phenotype and discuss how endothelial plasticity may regulate the interplay between thrombosis and inflammation. We discuss how the endothelial cells are sensing and responding to environmental cues and contribute to thrombo-inflammation with a particular focus on venous thromboembolism (VTE). A better understanding of the precise mechanisms involved and the specific role of endothelial cells is needed to characterize VTE incidence and address the risk of recurrent VTE and its sequelae.","output":"Endothelial Cell Phenotype, a Major Determinant of Venous Thrombo-Inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is raging worldwide. This potentially fatal infectious disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the complete mechanism of COVID-19 is not well understood. Therefore, we analyzed gene expression profiles of COVID-19 patients to identify disease-related genes through an innovative machine learning method that enables a data-driven strategy for gene selection from a data set with a small number of samples and many candidates. Principal-component-analysis-based unsupervised feature extraction (PCAUFE) was applied to the RNA expression profiles of 16 COVID-19 patients and 18 healthy control subjects. The results identified 123 genes as critical for COVID-19 progression from 60,683 candidate probes, including immune-related genes. The 123 genes were enriched in binding sites for transcription factors NFKB1 and RELA, which are involved in various biological phenomena such as immune response and cell survival: the primary mediator of canonical nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) activity is the heterodimer RelA-p50. The genes were also enriched in histone modification H3K36me3, and they largely overlapped the target genes of NFKB1 and RELA. We found that the overlapping genes were downregulated in COVID-19 patients. These results suggest that canonical NF-B activity was suppressed by H3K36me3 in COVID-19 patient blood.","output":"PCA-based unsupervised feature extraction for gene expression analysis of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical research under the usual regulatory constraints may be difficult or even impossible in a public health emergency.

METHODS: 200 patients underwent elective, unilateral primary day case total hip (THA, n = 94), total knee (TKA, n = 60) and unicondylar knee replacements (UKA, n = 46). SDD rates, reasons for failure to discharge, readmission, complication and satisfaction rates were recorded at 6-week follow up. Changes in LOS of inpatient arthroplasties (n = 6518) and rate of patients discharged with only one night stay treated at the same ward were tracked from 1 year prior to introduction of day case arthroplasty (DCA) program to the end of observation period. RESULTS: 166 patients (83%) had SDD while 34 (17%) needed overnight stay. Main reasons for failure to discharge were lack of confidence (4%) fainting due to single vasovagal episode (3.5%), urine retention (3%) and late resolution of spinal anaesthesia (3%). 5 patients (3%) had readmission within 6 weeks, including 1 (0.6%) with a partial and treated pulmonary embolism. 163 patients were satisfied with SDD (98%). After launching the DCA program, average LOS of inpatients was reduced from 2.3 days to 1.8 days and rate of discharge with only 1-night stay increased from 12% to around 60%.

Cellular consequences were investigated in patient fibroblasts and VPS41-depleted HeLa cells. All mutants prevented formation of a functional HOPS complex, causing delayed lysosomal delivery of endocytic and autophagic cargo. By contrast, VPS41S285P enabled regulated secretion. Strikingly, loss of VPS41 function caused a cytosolic redistribution of mTORC1, continuous nuclear localization of Transcription Factor E3 (TFE3), enhanced levels of LC3II, and a reduced autophagic response to nutrient starvation. Phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates S6K1 and 4EBP1 was not affected.

In pythons, nidovirus infection induces an inflammation of the upper respiratory and alimentary tract which can develop into a severe and often fatal proliferative pneumonia. We observed pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic lesions in organ systems other than the respiratory tract during full post mortem examinations on 30 nidovirus RT-PCR positive pythons of varying species originating from Switzerland and Spain. The observations prompted us to study whether the atypical tissue tropism associates with previously unknown nidoviruses or changes in the nidovirus genome. RT-PCR and inoculation of Morelia viridis cell cultures served to recruit the cases and to obtain virus isolates. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining against nidovirus nucleoprotein demonstrated that the virus not only infects a broad spectrum of epithelial (respiratory and alimentary epithelium, hepatocytes, renal tubules, pancreatic ducts etc.), but also intravascular monocytes, intralesional macrophages and endothelial cells. By next-generation sequencing we obtained full length genome for a novel nidovirus species circulating in Switzerland. Analysis of viral genomes recovered from pythons showing nidovirus infection-associated respiratory or systemic disease did not explain the observed phenotypes. The results indicate that python nidoviruses have a broad cell and tissue tropism, further suggesting that the course of infection could vary and involve lesions in a broad spectrum of tissues and organ systems as a consequence of monocyte-mediated systemic spread of the virus. IMPORTANCE During the last years, python nidoviruses have become a primary cause of fatal disease in pythons. Nidoviruses represent a threat to captive snake collections, as they spread rapidly and can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our study indicates that, different from previously evidence, the viruses do not only affect the respiratory tract, but can spread in the entire body with blood monocytes, have a broad spectrum of target cells, and can induce a variety of lesions. Nidovirales is an order of animal and human viruses that compromise important zoonotic pathogens such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as well as the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. Python nidoviruses belong to the same subfamily as the mentioned human viruses and show similar characteristics (rapid spread, respiratory and gastrointestinal tropism, etc.).

These study participants were provided with appropriate personal protective equipment to deliver healthcare to patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 and were involved in aerosol generating procedures. 77 healthcare professionals with no exposure history to covid-19 and 80 patients who had recovered from covid-19 were recruited to verify the accuracy of antibody testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Covid-19 related symptoms (fever, cough, and dyspnoea) and evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, defined as a positive test for virus specific nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs, or a positive test for IgM or IgG antibodies in the serum samples. RESULTS: The average age of study participants was 35.8 years and 68.1% (286/420) were women. These study participants worked 4-6 hour shifts for an average of 5.4 days a week; they worked an average of 16.2 hours each week in intensive care units.

Respiratory testing by PCR allows detection of human rhinovirus (HRV), but few data exist on the risk of concomitant BI in HRV-positive FI. METHODS: We identified well-appearing FI 1C90 days old within Intermountain Healthcare evaluated in the ED or inpatient setting (IP) with viral respiratory testing by PCR (RVPCR) from August 2007 to August 2016. Respiratory viruses detected by RVPCR included: adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A/B, parainfluenza 1C4, RSV and HRV. We used relative risk (RR) to compare the risk of BI for infants with HRV vs. non-HRV viruses detected. Similarly, we used RR to compare risk of UTI and invasive bacterial infection (IBI; bacteremia and meningitis) for infants with HRV detected compared with those who were virus negative. RESULTS: 10,964 FI were evaluated in the ED/IP during the study period. 4037 (37%) had RVPCR and were included. 2212 (55%) FI were positive for a respiratory virus and 73% were 29C90 days old. HRV was detected alone in 1392 (34%) and non-HRV viruses were detected in 820 (20%). The overall frequency of BI in the cohort was 9.5%. FI with HRV were more likely to have BI when compared with those with non-HRV viruses [7.8% vs 3.7% P < 0.0001; RR 2.12 (95% CI; 1.43C3.15)]. When compared with virus-negative infants, HRV detection in infants 1C28 days did not decrease the risk for UTI [RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.58C1.29)]; risk of IBI was statistically decreased [RR 0.41 (95% CI 0.19C0.88)] but with wide CI approaching 1 suggesting that this may not be clinically meaningful. Similarly, UTI risk in infants 29C90 days was statistically lower with HRV detection [RR 0.78 (95% CI 0.65C0.95)], but unlikely to be clinically important. For infants 29C90 days with HRV, risk of IBI was statistically decreased [RR 0.52 (95% CI 0.34C0.80)] with possible clinical relevance. CONCLUSION: HRV detection was common in young febrile infants. Infants with HRV were at higher risk of BI than infants with non-HRV infection. Detection of HRV did not meaningfully change risk for UTI at any age or meaningfully impact risk of IBI in infants 1C28 days. HRV detection may be associated with a decreased risk for IBI in infants 29C90 days. DISCLOSURES: A. J.

Entry is mediated by the viral membrane protein hemagglutinin (HA), which triggers membrane fusion and genome release under acidic conditions in the endosome. In addition to changes in the receptor binding domain, the acid stability of HA has been linked to the successful transmission of virus between avian and human hosts. However, to fully understand the connection between changes in HA and host tropism, additional factors relevant to HA structure-function and membrane fusion are also likely to be important. Using single-particle-tracking (SPT) techniques, individual membrane fusion events can be observed under specific conditions, which provide detailed information regarding HA pH sensitivity and acid stability and the rate and extent of membrane fusion. This provides a comparative way to characterize and distinguish influenza virus fusion properties among virus strains. We used SPT to quantify the fusion properties of three H3 influenza strains: A/Aichi/68/H3N2 (X:31), A/Udorn/72/H3N2 (Udorn), and A/Brisbane/07/H3N2 (Brisbane). The rate of fusion for the most clinically relevant strain, Brisbane, is generally insensitive to decreasing pH, while the fusion of the egg-adapted strains Udorn and X:31 is strongly dependent on pH (and is faster) as the pH decreases. All strains exhibit similar acid stability (the length of time that they remain fusogenic in an acidic environment) at higher pHs, but the egg-adapted strains become less acid stable at lower pHs. Thus, it appears that the laboratory-adapted H3 strains tested may have evolved to compensate for the faster HA deactivation at low pH, with a commensurate increase in the rate of fusion and number of proteins facilitating fusion, relative to the Brisbane strain. IMPORTANCE The ability of influenza virus to release its genome under different acidic conditions has recently been linked to the transmission of influenza virus between different species. However, it is yet to be determined how acid-induced membrane fusion varies with virus strain and influences tropism. The results presented here are the results of an intra-H3-subtype study of acid stability and fusion kinetics. Using a single-particle-tracking (SPT) technique, we show here that the highest pH that initiates fusion is not necessarily the pH at which the kinetics of fusion is fastest and most abundant for a given strain. Strains exhibit different fusion behaviors, as evidenced by their unique kinetic trends; pH sensitivities, as evidenced by the differences when the first fusion events commence; and HA stabilities, as evidenced by the length of time that virions can persist in an acidic environment and still be fusion competent.","output":"Variations in pH sensitivity, acid stability, and fusogenicity of three influenza virus H3 subtypes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The long-acting injectable G-CSF, pegfilgrastim and its biosimilars have historically been given to patients 24 hours following the administration of myelosuppressive chemotherapy for either primary or secondary prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia (FN). Previous literature has indicated that pegfilgrastim administration prior to 24 hours post chemotherapy, may result in a deepened and prolonged neutropenia due to the increase in circulating granulocytes exposed to chemotherapy. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and to reduce potential SAR-CoV-2 exposure to cancer patients on therapy, we implemented same day administration of injectable pegfilgrastim-cbqv among select breast cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens from March 2020 - February 2021. Methods: Utilizing retrospective EHR chart reviews, 55 patients among 4 medical oncologists in our breast cancer group were identified as meeting the criteria of same day pegfilgrastim-cbqv administration. Inclusion was based on completion of at least 2 consecutive cycles of same day pegfilgrastim-cbqv 6 mg subcutaneous injection for primary or secondary prophylaxis. The selected patient charts were reviewed for the incidence and severity of FN. Among the patients who had documented FN, further subgroup analyses were done regarding baseline characteristics, timing of neutropenia, regimens, regimen sequence, and reported ADRs associated with pegfilgrastim-cbqv. Results: 9 (16.4%) of the 55 patients experienced FN (Grades 3-4) and 6 (10.9%) patients were hospitalized. There were no Grade 5 events and none had therapy discontinued due to FN. 8 (88.9%) of the patients experienced FN between cycles 1 and 2. Of note, there were no cases of COVID-19 among the 9 patients who had an episode of FN. 52 (94.5%) of the 55 patients received treatment with curative intent and 3 (5.5%) had metastatic disease on a subsequent line of therapy. The median age was 49.1 years (range 29-71) and patients were 56.4% Caucasian, 18.1% Black or African American, 12.7% Asian, and 12.7% Hispanic/Latina. Conclusions: Based on the retrospective data analysis, same day pegfilgrastim-cbqv appears to be a safe and effective option in the primary and secondary prophylaxis of FN with myelosuppressive standard of care chemotherapy used in breast cancer treatment. Though our review was limited by a relatively small sample size and confined to younger (49.1 median age) breast cancer patients, this opens the door to further re-evaluation of same day pegfilgrastim-cbqv administration in other patient populations. In a post pandemic treatment world, this slight change in practice has the potential to reduce patient financial toxicity associated with multiple medical visits, provide an alternative to on-body injector formulations, and ensure treatment adherence.","output":"The feasibility of same day pegfilgrastim-cbqv administration in breast cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens at a northern Virginia cancer center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To verify whether porcine deltacoronavirus infection induces disease, we inoculated gnotobiotic pigs with 2 virus strains (OH-FD22 and OH-FD100) identified by 2 specific reverse transcription PCRs.

We show that PIKfyve controls recycling of cargoes including integrins, receptors that control cell migration. Furthermore, endogenous PIKfyve colocalizes with SNX17, Retriever, WASH and CCC complexes on endosomes. Importantly, PIKfyve inhibition causes a loss of Retriever and CCC from endosomes, and mutation of the lipid binding site on a CCC subunit impairs its endosomal localization and delays integrin recycling. In addition, we show that recruitment of SNX17 is an early step and requires VPS34.

Methods: We performed a case series of COVID-19 positive/suspected patients admitted between 2/1/2020 and 4/4/2020 who were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine or a combination. We evaluated baseline and post-medication QT interval (QTc, Bazett) using 12-lead ECGs. Critical QTc prolongation was defined as: a) maximum QTc []500 ms (if QRS <120 ms) or QTc []550 (if QRS []120 ms) and b) increased QTc of []60 ms. Tisdale score and Elixhauser comorbidity index were calculated. Results: Of 490 COVID-19 positive/suspected patients, 314 (64%) received either/both drugs, and 98 (73 COVID-19 positive, 25 suspected) met study criteria (age 62{+/-}17 yrs, 61% male). Azithromycin was prescribed in 28%, hydroxychloroquine in 10%, and both in 62%. Baseline mean QTc was 448{+/-}29 ms and increased to 459{+/-}36ms (p=0.005) with medications. Significant prolongation was observed only in men (18{+/-}43 ms vs -0.2{+/-}28 ms in women, p=0.02). 12% of patients reached critical QTc prolongation. In a multivariable logistic regression, age, sex, Tisdale score, Elixhauser score, and baseline QTc were not associated with critical QTc prolongation (p>0.14). Changes in QTc were highest with the combination compared to either drug, with many-fold greater prolongation with the combination vs. azithromycin alone (17{+/-}39 vs. 0.5{+/-}40 ms, p=0.07). No patients manifested torsades de pointes. Conclusions: Overall, 12% of patients manifested critical QTc interval prolongation, and traditional risk indices failed to flag these patients. With the drug combination, QTc prolongation was several-fold higher compared to azithromycin alone.

This marker can facilitate molecular epidemiology studies, incorporating this segment of the viral genome, to better explain the links between emergence, spreading and maintenance of the very virulent IBD virus (vvIBDV) strains worldwide. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sequences of the segment B gene from IBDV strains isolated from diverse geographic locations were obtained from the GenBank Database; Cuban sequences were obtained in the current work. A phylogenetic marker named B-marker was assessed by different phylogenetic principles such as saturation of substitution, phylogenetic noise and high consistency. This last parameter is based on the ability of B-marker to reconstruct the same topology as the complete segment B of the viral genome. From the results obtained from B-marker, demographic history for both main lineages of IBDV regarding segment B was performed by Bayesian skyline plot analysis. Phylogenetic analysis for both segments of IBDV genome was also performed, revealing the presence of a natural reassortant strain with segment A from vvIBDV strains and segment B from non-vvIBDV strains within Cuban IBDV population. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study contributes to a better understanding of the emergence of vvIBDV strains, describing molecular epidemiology of IBDV using the state-of-the-art methodology concerning phylogenetic reconstruction.

Using a mixed-methods design (convergent parallel design), we aimed to assess the experience, perceptions, and reactions of cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were cancer patients receiving treatment at the hospital during the pandemic (July to August 2020). In study 1, 95 participants filled out a questionnaire measuring COVID-19 experiences and perceptions, psychological distress, and intolerance of uncertainty. In study 2, in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 cancer patients, probing their experience during the COVID-19 period. RESULTS: Most participants experienced the COVID-19 pandemic as a major threat that would affect future health, most attended all or most of their scheduled treatments, and their mean level of psychological distress was low. A mild decrease in social support was reported, and remote contacts and support from the community had not compensated for decreased person-to person contacts. In addition, intolerance of uncertainty was related to higher psychological distress, which was partially mediated by perceptions of threat. The analysis of in-depth interviews strengthened the quantitative findings by elucidating the experience of fear of contagion alongside determination to continue treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: The mixed-methods design enabled us to examine the responses of cancer patients attending treatment. The findings suggest that in times of extreme uncertainty such as COVID-19, health experts need to screen cancer patients and survivors for emotional and instrumental support needs and identify patients and survivors with high intolerance of uncertainty as a risk factor for psychological distress.","output":"Cancer patients attending treatment during COVID-19: intolerance of uncertainty and psychological distress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A growing interest has been observed among K-12 school educators to incorporate maker pedagogy into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education to engage students in the design and making process.

METHODS: Consecutive patients with non-severe COVID-19 and no risk factors for complicated disease attending the emergency room of the Clnica Universidad de Navarra between July 31, 2020 and September 11, 2020 were enrolled. All enrollments occurred within 72 h of onset of fever or cough. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ivermectin, 400 mcg/kg, single dose (n = 12) or placebo (n = 12). The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR from nasopharyngeal swab at day 7 post-treatment. The primary outcome was supported by determination of the viral load and infectivity of each sample. The differences between ivermectin and placebo were calculated using Fisher's exact test and presented as a relative risk ratio. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04390022. FINDINGS: All patients recruited completed the trial (median age, 26 [IQR 19C36 in the ivermectin and 21C44 in the controls] years; 12 [50%] women; 100% had symptoms at recruitment, 70% reported headache, 62% reported fever, 50% reported general malaise and 25% reported cough). At day 7, there was no difference in the proportion of PCR positive patients (RR 092, 95% CI: 077C109, p = 10). The ivermectin group had non-statistically significant lower viral loads at day 4 (p = 024 for gene E; p = 018 for gene N) and day 7 (p = 016 for gene E; p = 018 for gene N) post treatment as well as lower IgG titers at day 21 post treatment (p = 024). Patients in the ivermectin group recovered earlier from hyposmia/anosmia (76 vs 158 patient-days; p < 0.001).

Identifying knowledge, attitude, and practice of healthcare workers regarding face mask utilization is very important to identify gaps and intervene immediately to control the spread of the infection. Hence, the main aim of this study was to determine the health workers knowledge, attitude, and practice of proper face mask utilization and associated factors at police health faculties in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 2020. METHODS: Across-sectional, quantitative approach study was conducted from June to July 2020. The study covered 408 health professionals of all categories working in the different police health facilities found in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, during the study period. Data were collected using a pre-tested self-administered questionnaire adopted from different studies after getting consent from the study participants. After the data were collected, it was entered and analyzed using SPSS version 23 computer software. A logistic regression model was used to measure the association between the predictor and outcome variables. Statistical significance was declared at p-value<0.05. Direction and strength of association were expressed using OR and 95% CI. RESULTS: The study showed that the overall knowledge, attitude, and practice of the healthcare provider towards proper face mask utilization were 98 (33.5%), 185 (45.3%), and 272 (33.3%) respectively. Factors associated with proper utilization of face mask were educational status (AOR = 10.4, 95% CI: 2.51, 43.32), police rank (AOR=0.2. CI: 0.05, 0.41), profession (AOR = 7.7, 95% CI: 2.63, 22.65), and knowledge about face mask use (AOR = 0.01, 95% CI: 0.003, 0.023). CONCLUSION: In this study, the level of knowledge and attitude towards face mask utilization was relatively low, and the level of proper face mask utilization was quite low in comparison with some studies. Comprehensive training about a face mask that focuses on its proper use should be designed and given by the authorities to healthcare workers who are on the front-line in the fight against COVID-19.","output":"Healthcare Workers Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice of Proper Face Mask Utilization, and Associated Factors in Police Health Facilities of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is the second global health emergency the world has faced in less than two decades, after the H1N1 Influenza pandemic in 2009C2010 Spread of pandemics is frequently associated with increased population size and population density The geographical scales (national, regional or local scale) are key elements in determining the correlation between demographic factors and the spread of outbreaks The aims of this study were: (a) to collect the Mexican data related to the two pandemics;(b) to create thematic maps using federal and municipal geographic scales;(c) to investigate the correlations between the pandemics indicators (numbers of contagious and deaths) and demographic patterns (population size and density) Methods The demographic patterns of all Mexican Federal Entities and all municipalities were taken from the database of Instituto Nacional de Estadstica y Geografa (INEGI) The data of Centro Nacional de Programas Preventivos y Control de Enfermedades (CENAPRECE) and the geoportal of Mexico Government were also used in our analysis The results are presented by means of tables, graphs and thematic maps A Spearman correlation was used to assess the associations between the pandemics indicators and the demographic patterns Correlations with a p value &lt; 0 05 were considered significant Results The confirmed cases (ccH1N1) and deaths (dH1N1) registered during the H1N1 Influenza pandemic were 72 4 thousand and 1 2 thousand respectively Mexico City (CDMX) was the most affected area by the pandemic with 8,502 ccH1N1 and 152 dH1N1 The ccH1N1 and dH1N1 were positively correlated to demographic patterns;p-values higher than the level of marginal significance were found analyzing the % ccH1N1 and the % dH1N1 vs the population density The COVID-19 pandemic data indicated 75 0 million confirmed cases (ccCOVID-19) and 1 6 million deaths (dCOVID-19) worldwide, as of date The CDMX, where 264,330 infections were recorded, is the national epicenter of the pandemic The federal scale did not allow to observe the correlation between demographic data and pandemic indicators;hence the next step was to choose a more detailed geographical scale (municipal basis) The ccCOVID-19 and dCOVID-19 (municipal basis) were highly correlated with demographic patterns;also the % ccCOVID-19 and % dCOVID-19 were moderately correlated with demographic patterns Conclusion The magnitude of COVID-19 pandemic is much greater than the H1N1 Influenza pandemic The CDMX was the national epicenter in both pandemics The federal scale did not allow to evaluate the correlation between exanimated demographic variables and the spread of infections, but the municipal basis allowed the identification of local variations and red zones such as the delegation of Iztapalapa and Gustavo A Madero in CDMX","output":"Using demographic data to understand the distribution of H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics cases among federal entities and municipalities of Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Presentation of antigen is key to the development of the immune response, mediated by association of antigen with major histocompatibility complex glycoproteins abbreviated as MHC1 and MHC2. In the current study, we examined the regulation of MHC1 in the brain after facial axotomy. The normal facial motor nucleus showed no immunoreactivity for MHC1 (MHC1-IR). Transection of the facial nerve led to a strong and selective up-regulation of MHC1-IR on the microglia in the affected nucleus, beginning at day 2 and reaching a maximum 14 days after axotomy, coinciding with a peak influx of the T lymphocytes that express CD8, the lymphocyte coreceptor for MHC1. Specificity of the MHC1 staining was confirmed in beta2-microglobulin-deficient mice, which lack normal cell surface MHC1-IR. MHC1-IR was particularly strong on phagocytic microglia, induced by delayed neuronal cell death, and correlated with the induction of mRNA for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and interferon-gamma and the influx of T lymphocytes. Mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (scid), lacking T and B cells, showed an increase in the number of MHC1-positive nodules but no significant effect on overall MHC1-IR. Transgenic deletion of the IL1 receptor type I, or the interferon-gamma receptor type 1 subunit, did not affect the microglial MHC1-IR. However, a combined deletion of TNF receptors 1 and 2 (TNFR1&2-KO) led to a decrease in microglial MHC1-IR and to a striking absence of the phagocytic microglial nodules. Deletion of TNFR2 (p75) did not have an effect; deletion of TNFR1 (p55) reduced the diffuse microglial staining for MHC1-IR but did not abolish the MHC1(+) microglial nodules. In summary, neural injury leads to the induction of MHC1-IR on the activated, phagocytic microglia. This induction of MHC1 precedes the interaction with the immune system, at least in the facial motor nucleus model. Finally, the impaired induction of these molecules, up to now, only in the TNFR-deficient mice underscores the central role of TNF in the immune activation of the injured nervous system.","output":"Microglial major histocompatibility complex glycoprotein-1 in the axotomized facial motor nucleus: regulation and role of tumor necrosis factor receptors 1 and 2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Data on social contact patterns are widely used to parameterise age-mixing matrices in mathematical models of infectious diseases designed to help understand transmission patterns or estimate intervention impacts. Despite this, little attention is given to how social contact data are collected and analysed, or how the types of contact most relevant for transmission may vary between different infections. In particular, the majority of studies focus on close contacts only - people spoken to face-to-face. This may be appropriate for infections spread primarily by droplet transmission, but it neglects the larger numbers of 'shared air' casual contacts who may be at risk from airborne transmission of pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, measles, and SARS-CoV-2. Methods. We conducted social contact surveys in communities in two provinces of South Africa in 2019 (KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape). In line with most studies, we collected data on people spoken to (close contacts). We also collected data on places visited and people present, allowing casual contact patterns to be estimated. Using these data, we estimated age mixing patterns relevant for i) droplet and ii) non-saturating airborne transmission. We also estimated a third category of pattern relevant for the transmission of iii) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), an airborne infection where saturation of household contacts plays an important role in transmission dynamics. Results. Estimated contact patterns by age did not vary greatly between the three transmission routes/infections, in either setting. In both communities, relative to other adult age groups, overall contact intensities were lower in 50+ year olds when considering contact relevant for non-saturating airborne transmission or the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis than when considering contact relevant for droplet transmission. Conclusions. Our findings provide some reassurance that the widespread use of close contact data to parameterise age-mixing matrices for transmission models of airborne infections may not be resulting in major inaccuracies. The contribution of older age groups to transmission may be over-estimated, however. There is a need for future social contact surveys to collect data on casual contacts, to investigate whether our findings can be generalised to a wider range of settings, and to improve model predictions for infections with substantial airborne transmission.","output":"Improving estimates of social contact patterns for the airborne transmission of respiratory pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have developed a complete model of monitoring patients at regular intervals through an interconnected network among the doctors, nurses and patients with a view to minimizing the workload of the doctors and nurses, reducing the chances of medical professionals being infected by COVID-19 type of contagious disease and increasing the overall efficiency of patient monitoring in hospitals Bio-medical sensors interfaced with microcontroller are used to collect the data of heart beat rate, body temperature and body movement to get an overview of the present health condition of the patient The recorded data are stored in an excel file and updated automatically to the internet via OneDrive in every 30 seconds In case of any large deviation from the normal condition, an automated alarm system will notify the assigned doctor about the condition of the patient A medication reminder system is added in our designed android app to notify the patient to take the medicine prescribed by the doctor at proper time The patient can also call the nurse in case of emergency and there is also scope for the patient to control the position of the bed according to his comfort The level of saline or blood injected into the vein of the patient can also be monitored in our system to inform the nurse at the time of being finished ? 2020 IEEE","output":"IoT based medical assistant for efficient monitoring of patients in response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Changes in social and behavioral rhythms (SBR) in the elderly are related to health status.

A negative binomial regression with LoS as the dependent variable and a logistic regression of in-hospital mortality data, using age, insurance status, sex, comorbidities as the dependent variables, were performed. ResultsFrom March 1, 2020 to August 23, 2020, of 111,849 covid testing patient records, excluding those with missing data (n=7), without confirmed COVID-19 (n=27,225), and those from a carceral environment (n=1,861), left 84,624 eligible patients. Compared to the US population, the covid cohort had more black patients (23.17% vs 13.4%). Compared to the white cohort, the black cohort had higher private insurance rates (28.52% vs. 23.68%), shorter LoS (IRR=0.97 CI=0.95-0.99, P<0.01) and lower adjusted mortality (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.97). Increasing age was associated with increased mortality and LoS. Patients with Medicare or Medicaid had longer LoS (IRR=1.07, 95% CI=1.04-1.09) and higher adjusted mortality rates (OR=1.11, 95% CI=1-1.23) than those with private insurance ConclusionConclusions We found that when blacks have higher rates of private insurance, they have shorter hospitalizations and lower mortality than whites, when diagnosed with Covid-19.

However, in some instances, it might result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that poses a significant mortality risk. ARDS is postulated to be mediated by a surge of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to a dysregulated hyper inflammatory response. Colchicine being an anti-inflammatory agent, might mitigate this dysregulated response. Thus, in the absence of therapeutic options available to manage coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is imperative to ascertain the effect of colchicine on improving outcomes in COVID-19 patients. METHOD: We will perform a systematic review including a search of the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Clinicaltrials.gov, Cochrane library, and google scholar since inception. We will include randomized controlled trials exploring the effect of colchicine on the efficacy and safety outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Subsequently, we will perform a meta-analysis utilizing the random-effects to ascertain the effect of colchicine on reducing COVID-19 related mortality (primary endpoint) and other efficacy and safety outcomes. RESULTS: Our review results are anticipated in early 2021 (based on the completion of several ongoing randomized controlled trial). Our review results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Glial cells, on the other hand, can divide and repopulate themselves under injury or diseased conditions. We have previously reported that ectopic expression of NeuroD1 in dividing glial cells can directly convert them into neurons. Here, using astrocytic lineage-tracing reporter mice (Aldh1l1-CreER(T2) mice crossing with Ai14 mice), we demonstrate that lineage-traced astrocytes can be successfully converted into NeuN-positive neurons after expressing NeuroD1 through adeno-associated viruses. Retroviral expression of NeuroD1 further confirms that dividing glial cells can be converted into neurons. Importantly, we demonstrate that for in vivo cell conversion study, using a safe level of adeno-associated virus dosage (10(10)C10(12) gc/mL, 1 L) in the rodent brain is critical to avoid artifacts caused by toxic dosage, such as that used in a recent bioRxiv study (2  10(13) gc/mL, 1 L, mouse cortex). For therapeutic purpose under injury or diseased conditions, or for non-human primate studies, adeno-associated virus dosage needs to be optimized through a series of dose-finding experiments.

METHODS: From 16 to 24 March 2020, 241 consecutive patients addressed to hospital for COVID-19 suspicion had both chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Eight observers (2 thoracic and 2 general senior radiologists, 2 junior radiologists, and 2 emergency physicians) retrospectively categorized each CT into one out of 4 categories (evocative, compatible for COVID-19 pneumonia, not evocative, and normal). Observer agreement for categorization between all readers and pairs of readers with similar experience was evaluated with the Kappa coefficient. The results of a consensus categorization were correlated to RT-PCR. RESULTS: Observer agreement across the 4 categories was good between all readers (&#954; value 0.61 95% CI 0.60-0.63) and moderate to good between pairs of readers (0.54-0.75). It was very good (&#954; 0.81 95% CI 0.79-0.83), fair (&#954; 0.32 95% CI 0.29-0.34), moderate (&#954; 0.56 95% CI 0.54-0.58), and moderate (0.58 95% CI 0.56-0.61) for the categories evocative, compatible, not evocative, and normal, respectively.

However, there are few studies about the rare variants, typically inborn errors of immunity, in understanding the host genetics behind Covid-19 infection, especially in the Chinese population. To fill this gap, we investigate likely-deleterious missense and high-confidence predicted loss-of-function variants by (a) performing gene- and pathway-level association analyses, (b) examining known genes involved in type I interferon signaling and others previously reported in Covid-19 disease, and (c) identifying candidate genes with accumulating mutations and their potential protein-protein interactions with known genes. Based on our analyses, several putative genes and pathways are uncovered and worth further investigation, for example, genes IL12RB1, TBK1, and TLR3, and pathways Tuberculosis (hsa:05152), Primary Immunodeficiency (hsa:05340), and Influenza A (hsa:05164). These regions generally play an essential role in regulating antiviral innate immunity responses to foreign pathogens and in responding to many inflammatory diseases. We believe that to some extent, as an acute inflammatory disease, Covid-19 is also affected by these inborn errors of immunity.

Some measures such as excessive use of disinfectants, increased production of nonbiodegradable waste, and water pollution will be the consequences of fighting against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which harms the environment. Due to the fact that these effects will be identified in the long term, they may be neglected in the current situation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the environmental challenges caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic crisis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a review study conducted by search in databases, including Scopus, PubMed, and science direct until early May 2020. Keywords included \\"SARS-CoV-2,\\" \\"COVID-19,\\" and \\"Environment.\\" Studies published in English and conducted in different countries were also selected for the analysis. The guidelines published by reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control prevention (CDC), and the Ministry of Health have also been used in this study. CONCLUSION: The results of this study have shown that the COVID-19 virus, in addition to human damage and mortality, also affects the environment, and the damages and losses resulting from this pandemic may be identified later. Water pollution, increasing chemical pollution in the air, and increasing the production of nonbiodegradable waste are of these issues. For this purpose, it is recommended that, in addition to trying to improve the control of this pandemic, other environmental aspects in disinfection methods and disposal of dry and wet contaminated waste should be done more accurately and based on standard protocols. Infectious waste, in addition to the problem of standard sanitation, will become a major challenge that pollutes the environment. Based on this, it can be said that if home quarantine is observed voluntarily, in addition to reducing the risk of the SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the volume of visits to medical centers, it can be associated with another positive achievement, which is the reduction in waste production and protection of the environment.","output":"Review of environmental challenges and pandemic crisis of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging Viral diseases are incredibly infectious and proficient in inducing pandemics.

However, all these data refer to regional settings and national data are still missing. We aimed to assess the OHCA incidence and population mortality during COVID-19 pandemic in whole Switzerland and in the different regions (Cantons) according to the infection rate. METHODS: We considered OHCAs and deaths which occurred in Switzerland after the first diagnosed case of COVID-19 (February 25th) and for the subsequent 65 days and in the same period in 2019. We also compared Cantons with high versus low COVID-19 incidence. RESULTS: A 2.4% reduction in OHCA cases was observed in Switzerland. The reduction was particularly high (?21.4%) in high-incidence COVID-19 cantons, whilst OHCAs increased by 7.7% in low-incidence COVID-19 cantons. Mortality increased by 8.6% in the entire nation: a 27.8% increase in high-incidence cantons and a slight decrease (?0.7%) in low-incidence cantons was observed. The OHCA occurred more frequently at home, CPR and AED use by bystander were less frequent during the pandemic. Conversely, the OHCAs percentage in which a first responder was present, initiated the CPR and used an AED, increased. The outcome of patients in COVID-19 high-incidence cantons was worse compared to low-incidence cantons.

Despite the worldwide use of anti-VEGFs, their use remains limited in Sudan. This study aimed to assess the impact of anti-VEGF (ranibizumab and bevacizumab) injections in patients with diabetic macular oedema in Khartoum, Sudan. METHODS: An analytical comparative cross-sectional study was implemented in Alfaisal referral eye centre. A Standard questionnaire was used to collect the variables related to the research objectives. Thirty-four patients were recruited; 16 patients under ranibizumab (Lucentis) and 18 under bevacizumab (Avastin). Data were analyzed through SPSS 23, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) measurements were considered as main outcomes to evaluate the treatment effectiveness. RESULTS: Among the 34 participants, 64.7% were males and 35.3% were females, with an average age of 62 years and 13 years of long standing diabetes. A total of 54 eyes received an average of 2.3 injections in an average of 7 months period. The mean BCVA before and after treatment for both drugs respectively 0.19 min and 0.21 min was statistically correlated (p = 0.000). For patients under Lucentis, the mean BCVA before and after medication was 0.20 minC0.24 min and 0.19C0.19 min for those who used Avastin. The mean central retinal thickness (CRT), before and after treatment for both drugs, was 492.22mC422.89m, respectively, with a significant correlation (p = 0.003). For patients under Lucentis, the mean CRT decreased from 536.30 m to 425.19 m; it dropped from 453.16m to 421.18m for patients under Avastin. About 79.4% (27/34) of the participants reported that injections were not affordable and 14.7% (5/34) complained from shortage of one dose, regardless of which type of treatment. Glycaemia control, duration of treatment, type and frequency of injections used were found to be the most contributing factors to the effectiveness of anti-VEGF medications.

To prevent humanitarian health hazards such as COVID-19, people are strongly suggested to purchase and use Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs) for self-protection. However, the fraction of the population who refused to comply with the PPEs is high (and also much higher in some regions than others). In this paper, we focus on an empirically tested behavioral explanation for the compliance obstacle (a lack of self-control) based on the present-bias effect, which means the trend to give a higher valuation to a present reward but a lower valuation to a future reward (ODonoghue & Rabin, 2006). Since the utility of PPEs is realized in the future, a consumer may postpone his purchase decision but finally abandon his purchase plan in the future period due to this present-bias effect. The key take-away we focus on is that advance selling can be beneficial to the consumers as a commitment device (Bryan et al., 2010). However, the effect of advance selling may be limited, especially for consumers with low valuation, and can only encourage a part of consumers to purchase PPEs. Advance selling alone cannot fully address the compliance obstacles in PPEs. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Subsidy Design for Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs) Adoption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies had been described in patients with disabling, chronic and painful conditions; these characteristics define the majority of vascular surgery (VS) entities. A lack of disclosure about CAM use from patients has been universally cited and may impact effective patient-doctor communication. Our primary objective was to describe CAM use, modalities, perceived benefits, safety, and associated factors among adult patients attending a VS outpatient clinic; we additionally explored patient's attitudes about CAM disclosure with their primary vascular surgeon. METHODS This cross-sectional study invited 223 consecutive outpatients to an interview where the ICAM-Q (International Complementary and Alternative Medicine Questionnaire) and the PDRQ-9 (Patient-Doctor Relationship Questionnaire-9 items) were applied. In addition, sociodemographics, vascular disease and treatment-related information, comorbidity, and disease severity characteristics were obtained. Appropriated statistics was used; multiple logistic regression analysis identified factors associated to CAM use. All statistical tests were two-sided, and a p value  0.05 was considered significant. IRB approval was obtained. RESULTS Patients recruited were primary females (69%) and had a median age of 65 years (54-75). Most frequent vascular diagnoses were chronic venous insufficiency (36.2%) and peripheral artery disease (26%). There were 104 (46.6%) patients who referred CAM use, primarily self-helped practices (96%), and use of herbal, vitamins, or homeopathic medicines (23.7%). Overall, the majority of the patients perceived CAM modalities helpful and 94.6% denied any adverse event. Female sex (OR: 1.768, 95% CI: 0.997-3.135, p = 0.051) and hospitalization during the previous year (OR: 3.173, 95% CI: 1.492-6.748, p = 0.003) were associated to CAM use. The majority of the patients (77%) agreed about CAM disclosure with their primary vascular surgeon; meanwhile, among CAM users, up to 54.9% did not disclose it, and their main reasons were \\"Doctor didn't ask\\" (32%) and \\"I consider it unnecessary\\" (16%). The patient-doctor relationship was rated by the patients with high scores. CONCLUSIONS CAM use is frequent and perceived as safe and beneficial among VS outpatients; nonetheless, patients do not disclose CAM use with their primary vascular surgeons, and a wide range of reasons are given by the patients that prevent effective and open communication.","output":"A comprehensive approach to complementary and alternative medicine usage among patients from a vascular department."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a new approach using artificial intelligence (AI) to study and classify the severity of COVID-19 using 1208 chest X-rays (CXRs) of 396 COVID-19 patients obtained through the course of the disease at Emory Healthcare affiliated hospitals (Atlanta, GA, USA). Using a two-stage transfer learning technique to train a convolutional neural network (CNN), we show that the algorithm is able to classify four classes of disease severity (normal, mild, moderate, and severe) with the average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.93.

Answering this question requires accurate forecasting the spread of confirmed cases as well as analysis of the number of deaths and recoveries. Forecasting, however, requires ample historical data. At the same time, no prediction is certain as the future rarely repeats itself in the same way as the past. Moreover, forecasts are influenced by the reliability of the data, vested interests, and what variables are being predicted. Also, psychological factors play a significant role in how people perceive and react to the danger from the disease and the fear that it may affect them personally. This paper introduces an objective approach to predicting the continuation of the COVID-19 using a simple, but powerful method to do so. Assuming that the data used is reliable and that the future will continue to follow the past pattern of the disease, our forecasts suggest a continuing increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases with sizable associated uncertainty.

Despite its diverse functions, the role of TAS2R138 in host defense against bacterial infection is largely unknown.

The released PPARG then migrates from nuclei to the cytoplasm to accelerate the degradation of LDs by binding PLIN2 (perilipin-2). Subsequently, the TAS2R138CAHL-12 complex targets LDs to augment their degradation, and thereby facilitating the clearance of AHL-12 in neutrophils to maintain homeostasis in the local environment.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the CT reaction of LFB with 2,3-dichloro-3,5-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) and its application in the development of a novel 96-microwell spectrophotometric assay for LFB. METHODS: The reaction was investigated, its conditions were optimized, the physicochemical and constants of the CT complex and stoichiometric ratio of the complex were determined. The solid-state LFB-DDQ complex was synthesized and its structure was analyzed by UV-visible, FT-IR, and (1)H-NMR spectroscopic techniques, and also by the computational molecular modeling. The reaction was employed in the development of a novel 96-microwell spectrophotometric assay for LFB. RESULTS: The reaction resulted in the formation of a red-colored product, and the spectrophotometric investigations confirmed that the reaction had a CT nature. The molar absorptivity of the complex was linearly correlated with the dielectric constant and polarity index of the solvent; the correlation coefficients were 0.9526 and 0.9459, respectively. The stoichiometric ratio of LFB:DDQ was 1:2. The spectroscopic and computational data confirmed the sites of interaction on the LFB molecule, and accordingly, the reaction mechanism was postulated. The reaction was utilized in the development of the first 96-microwell spectrophotometric assay for LFB. The assay limits of detection and quantitation were 1.31 and 3.96 g/well, respectively. The assay was successfully applied to the analysis of LFB in its bulk and tablets with high accuracy and precision.

Thermally-activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is often influenced by close packing of the chromophore assembly. In this context, the metal-organic framework (MOF) approach has several advantages: it can be used to steer aggregation such that the orientation within aggregated structures can be predicted using rational approaches. We demonstrate this design concept for a DPA-TPE (diphenylamine-tetraphenylethylene) chromophore, which is non-emissive in its solvated state due to vibrational quenching. Turning this DPA-TPE into a ditopic linker allows to grow oriented MOF thin films exhibiting pronounced green electroluminescence with low onset voltages. Measurements at different temperatures clearly demonstrate the presence of TADF. Finally, we show that the layer-by-layer process used for MOF thin film deposition allowed to integrate the TADF-DPA-TPE in a functioning LED device.","output":"Tuning Optical Properties by Controlled Aggregation: Electroluminescence Assisted by Thermally-Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Thin Films of Crystalline Chromophores."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Canadian and international data suggest the risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis is elevated during the week after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, particularly in younger age groups, in males, and after second doses. OBJECTIVES: This article examines whether there is a product-specific difference in the risk for myocarditis and/or pericarditis between the two mRNA vaccines administered in Canada: BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna Spikevax). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Reporting rates of myocarditis and/or pericarditis were calculated from reports received by the Canadian Adverse Events Following Immunization Surveillance System from December 2020-March 2022. Excess cases and attributable incidence among individuals aged 18-39 were estimated for each vaccine in comparison with background rates from 2015C2019. Head-to-head comparisons used Poisson regression, conditioned on week of vaccine administration, to estimate rate ratios for the week after mRNA-1273 vaccination versus the week after BNT162b2, by age and sex as well as overall. Analyses were restricted to May 30CMarch 13, 2021, when heightened media awareness was unlikely to have affected reporting rates for the two products differentially. RESULTS: In 18-29 year-old males who received a second dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, attributable risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis was found to be 5.69 (95% CI: 4.07 C 7.95; p < 0.001) times higher among mRNA-1273 recipients (n=106) as compared to BNT162b2 recipients (n=33). In the same group, Poisson regression modelling estimated that the risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis was 4.72 (p-value = <0.001) times higher after mRNA-1723 compared to BNT162b2 vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis is higher after mRNA-1723 vaccination than BNT162b2 vaccination in those aged 18-39 years, especially in males aged 18-29 years, where the risk is several times higher.","output":"Myocarditis and/or pericarditis risk after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination: a Canadian head to head comparison of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo: identificar en la literatura la produccin cientfica sobre exmenes y manifestaciones clnicas de COVID-19 en ni?os y discutir el papel de la enfermera en su atencin.

The project team facilitated 13 sharing circles in November 2019 in three communities in the Northwest Arctic. There were a total of 122 participants, including teachers/school staff (31%), community members (30%), high school students (23%), and health professionals (16%). The circles explored youth knowledge, perceptions, questions, concerns, and hopes for cancer information; community members desires for youth knowledge about cancer; and how teachers would like content to be formatted for effective inclusion in their classrooms. Common themes from the sharing circles included a desire for information on cancer prevention (all 13 sharing circles) and a need for information on cancer risk factors (12). In most sharing circles, participants shared that cancer information for youth should include stories like those of local people, cancer survivors, and role models (11), visuals (8), and local data and statistics (8).

However, the cause for this enhanced susceptibility remains unclear, and the effects of HIV on pulmonary perfusion and ventilation are unknown. METHODS: We used PET-CT in 46 smokers and non-smokers, 23 of whom had documented HIV infection. Emphysema was assessed by CT and perfusion by nitrogen-13 (13NN) PET scans. After removal of image noise, vertical and axial gradients in perfusion were calculated. We tested for differences in the total spatial heterogeneity of perfusion (CV2Qtotal) and its components (CV2Qtotal = CV2Qvgrad (vertical gradient) + CV2Qzgrad (axial gradient) + CV2Qr (residual heterogeneity)) among groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in demographic parameters among groups, and all subjects had minimal radiographic evidence of emphysema. Compared to controls, non-smokers living with HIV had a significantly greater CV2 Qr/ CV2Qtotal (0.48 vs 0.36, P = 0.05) and reduced CV2Qvgrad/ CV2Qtotal (0.46 vs 0.65, P = 0.038). Smokers also had a reduced CV2Qvgrad/ CV2Qtotal, however, there was no significant difference in CV2Qvgrad/ CV2Qtotal between smokers living with and without HIV (0.39 vs 0.34, P = 0.58), despite a decreased vertical perfusion gradient (Qvgrad) in smokers living with HIV. CONCLUSION: In non-smokers living with well-controlled HIV and minimal radiographic emphysema, HIV infection contributes to pulmonary perfusion abnormalities similar to smokers. These data indicate the onset of subclinical pulmonary perfusion abnormalities that could herald the development of significant lung disease in these susceptible individuals.","output":"PET Imaging Reveals Early Pulmonary Perfusion Abnormalities in HIV Infection Similar to Smoking."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19-related headache is one of the most important newly emerging forms of headache in this century and deserves a special place in our headache classification.

METHODS: An online survey of 15-24-year-olds in a high deprivation region of New Zealand asked about the need for, and receipt of, sexual healthcare during lockdown. Experience of telehealth and preferences for future receipt of sexual healthcare were also explored. Social media advertising was used to recruit participants over five weeks in August and October 2020. RESULTS: The survey sample included 500 respondents comprising 58.8% females, 25.4% Maori (indigenous) ethnicity and 21.4% LGBTQI+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex +) young people. During lockdown, 22.2% of respondents reported sexual health needs (111/500), but fewer than half this group got help (45%, 50/111), believing their issue could wait, or due to barriers contacting services and lack of information about service availability. Experience of telehealth consultations (by 28/50 participants) was mostly favourable though only 46% agreed it was easier than going to the clinic. Telehealth methods were the preferred option by some participants for future receipt of sexual healthcare; but for most scenarios suggested, respondents favoured in-person clinic visits. CONCLUSIONS: Young people experienced unmet need for sexual healthcare during lockdown in New Zealand, but not because services were unavailable. Findings point to the need for targeted information dissemination to young people about available services and the importance of seeking help during lockdown. More research is needed to understand the advantages and disadvantages of sexual healthcare delivered via telehealth to inform future service provision.","output":"Access to sexual healthcare during New Zealand's COVID-19 lockdown: cross-sectional online survey of 15-24-year-olds in a high deprivation region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has outspread obstreperously in India.

In order to investigate the impact of weather conditions on daily transmission occurring in India, daily data of Maximum (TMax), Minimum (TMin), Mean (TMean) and Dew Point Temperature (TDew), Diurnal Temperature range (TRange), Average Relative Humidity, Range in Relative Humidity, and Wind Speed (WS) over 9 most affected cities are analysed in several time frames: weather of that day, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16 days before transmission. Spearman rank correlation (r) shows significant but low correlation with most of the weather parameters, however, comparatively better association exists on 14 days lag. Diurnal range in Temperature and Relative Humidity shows non-significant correlation. Analysis shows, COVID-19 cases likely to be increased with increasing air temperature, however role of humidity is not clear.

As severe acute respiratory syndrome is the major cause of mortality after COVID-19 infection, patients with COVID-19 who are prone to severe acute respiratory problems may require mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO; Alhazzani et al., 2020). Ongoing advances in intensive care medicine are continuing to improve survival in critically ill patients (Kaukonen, Bailey, Suzuki, Pilcher, & Bellomo, 2014). However, intensive care unit (ICU) survivors may experience complications and problems related to their disease and treatment such as critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy, and post intensive care syndrome (PICS; Alhazzani et al., 2020). Harvey (2012) reported that 85%-95% of ICU patients have ICU-acquired weakness after ICU discharge and 74% of ICU patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome have cognitive impairment after ICU discharge. Physical disabilities, cognitive impairment, and mental or psychological distress (e.g., anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder) after ICU discharge may be symptoms of PICS, and may continue to affect surviving patients for several years after ICU discharge (Elliott et al., 2014; Held & Moss, 2019; Jackson et al., 2014; Jubran et al., 2010). Efforts to prevent and treat COVID-19 in Taiwan have proven more effective compared to most other places in the world. In addition to the low number of diagnosed cases, the mortality rate (seven of 440 confirmed cases) in Taiwan has been significantly lower than in most other countries (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, ROC, 2020, May 14). However, post-discharge care for ICU survivors, especially those hospitalized after a sudden onset of severe disease symptoms and then discharged after a long ICU stay or after receiving mechanical ventilation, require specialized care to minimize PICS. Nurses are responsible not only for treating patients with the disease but also for preventing the further spread of disease. Therefore, providing continued care to patients discharged from the ICU is essential. Specifically, interventions to avoid PICS must be implemented rapidly by multidisciplinary medical teams during and immediately after ICU discharge.","output":"[Intensive Care During a Global Epidemic]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) are widely used in various disciplines, and it is imperative to evaluate their safety in the environment. In this paper, Bombyx mori (silkworm) was used as a model organism to evaluate the biological effects of different sized TiO2 NPs, taking into consideration their effect on the larval growth, cocoon shell weight, tissues, and silk produced. The effect of the different sized TiO2 NPs on the larval and cocoon shell weight was dose-dependent. The highest accumulation of titanium (Ti) following a modified TiO2 NPs-treated mulberry diet was observed in the midgut. The expression of the light chain fibroin (FIBL) was three times higher in 0.33 g TiO2 NPs-treated silk gland after 96 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis demonstrated that TiO2 NPs-treated silk fiber (TiSF) exhibited a diminutive decrease in silk fiber (SF) crystallization and ?-sheet compared to the control SF, respectively. The tensile tests of SF from silkworm fed with 0.03 g of 25 nm TiO2 NPs were significantly improved when compared to the control SF. Significant changes in the surface morphology and thermal stability of SF were observed.

Furthermore, regulatory B cells (Bregs: CD19CD20CD24CD38) declined sharply owing to prednisolone. Serum IL-6 remained undetectable at all times. We demonstrated for the first time immune monitoring in a child with AIH and T1D before, during and after COVID-19. We hypothesize that continuing with low level of prednisolone without azathioprine may have abrogated activated Tregs, Bregs and IL-6 production and therefore permitting the activation of CD8 T cells, clearing the virus.","output":"Immune monitoring of a child with autoimmune hepatitis and type 1 diabetes during COVID-19 infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), which began as a small outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019, became a global pandemic within months due to its high transmissibility. In the absence of pharmaceutical treatment, various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain the spread of COVID-19 brought the entire world to a halt. After almost a year of seemingly returning to normalcy with the worlds quickest vaccine development, the emergence of more infectious and vaccine resistant coronavirus variants is bringing the situation back to where it was a year ago. In the light of this new situation, we conducted a study to portray the possible scenarios based on the three key factors : impact of interventions (pharmaceutical and NPIs), vaccination rate, and vaccine efficacy. In our study, we assessed two of the most crucial factors, transmissibility and vaccination rate, in order to reduce the spreading of COVID-19 in a simple but effective manner. In order to incorporate the time-varying mutational landscape of COVID-19 variants, we estimated a weighted transmissibility composed of the proportion of existing strains that naturally vary over time. Additionally, we consider time varying vaccination rates based on the number of daily new cases. Our method for calculating the vaccination rate from past active cases is an effective approach in forecasting probable future scenarios as it actively tracks peoples attitudes toward immunization as active cases change. Our simulations show that if a large number of individuals cannot be vaccinated in a short period of time, adopting NPIs is the best approach to manage disease transmission with the emergence of new vaccine breakthrough variants and more infectious variants.","output":"Incorporating the mutational landscape of SARS-COV-2 variants and case-dependent vaccination rates into epidemic models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had profound pernicious effects, it revealed deficiencies in health systems, particularly among low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). With increasing uncertainty in healthcare, existing unmet needs such as poor outcomes of lung cancer (LC) patients in LMICs, mainly due to late stages at diagnosis, have been challenging-necessitating a shift in focus for judicious health resource utilization. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for screening large volumes of pulmonary images performed for noncancerous reasons, such as health checks, immigration, tuberculosis screening, or other lung conditions, including but not limited to COVID-19, can facilitate easy and early identification of incidental pulmonary nodules (IPNs), which otherwise could have been missed. AI can review every chest X-ray or computed tomography scan through a trained pair of eyes, thus strengthening the infrastructure and enhancing capabilities of manpower for interpreting images in LMICs for streamlining accurate and early identification of IPNs. AI can be a catalyst for driving LC screening with enhanced efficiency, particularly in primary care settings, for timely referral and adequate management of coincidental IPN. AI can facilitate shift in the stage of LC diagnosis for improving survival, thus fostering optimal health-resource utilization and sustainable healthcare systems resilient to crisis. This article highlights the challenges for organized LC screening in LMICs and describes unique opportunities for leveraging AI. We present pilot initiatives from Asia, Latin America, and Russia illustrating AI-supported IPN identification from routine imaging to facilitate early diagnosis of LC at a potentially curable stage.","output":"Artificial intelligence for early diagnosis of lung cancer through incidental nodule detection in low- and middle-income countries-acceleration during the COVID-19 pandemic but here to stay."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current study had two aims.

METHODS: People with OA scheduled for TKR (TKR group; N = 19) and not scheduled (NTKR group; N = 17) were age-matched with People without OA (N = 19). Outcome measures included: joint range of motion (ROM), Timed Up and Go (TUG), joint pain levels, Oxford score, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire, and the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale. Also, spatiotemporal gait parameters and joint kinematics were recorded during perturbed and unperturbed gait. The perturbed gait data were normalized by unperturbed gait data. RESULTS: There were no differences between the two OA groups in the four questionnaire scores and joint ROM. The TUG score of the TKR group was higher than that of the NTKR group. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in the normalized spatiotemporal parameters. The OA groups showed statistically significant lower anterior pelvic tilt ranges and higher maximal hip adduction of the contralateral limb compared to the Non-OA group. When the contralateral limb was perturbed, the TKR group showed significantly lower pelvic rotation range compared to the NTKR and Non-OA groups. When the OA limb was perturbed, the maximal hip flexion of the injured limb was significantly lower and the maximal knee flexion higher in the OA groups compared with the Non-OA group. CONCLUSION: The recovery strategy from trip-simulated perturbation of individuals with OA differs from that of individuals without OA. This may emphasize the importance of devising a treatment plan that focuses on improving balance and reactions to gait perturbation.","output":"Kinematics following gait perturbation in adults with knee osteoarthritis: Scheduled versus not scheduled for knee arthroplasty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY QUESTION How are progesterone (P4)-induced repetitive intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) signals (oscillations) in human sperm generated? SUMMARY ANSWER P4-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations are generated in the flagellum by membrane potential (Vm)-sensitive Ca2+-influx through CatSper channels. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY A subset of human sperm display [Ca2+]i oscillations that regulate flagellar beating and acrosome reaction. Although pharmacological manipulations indicate involvement of stored Ca2+ in these oscillations, influx of extracellular Ca2+ is also required. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This was a laboratory study that used >20 sperm donors and involved more than 100 separate experiments and analysis of more than 1000 individual cells over a period of 2 years. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Semen donors and patients were recruited in accordance with local ethics approval from Birmingham University and Tayside ethics committees. [Ca2+]i responses and Vm of individual cells were examined by fluorescence imaging and whole-cell current clamp. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE P4-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations originated in the flagellum, spreading to the neck and head (latency of 1-2 s). K+-ionophore valinomycin (1 M) was used to investigate the role of membrane potential (Vm). Direct assessment by whole-cell current-clamp confirmed that Vm in valinomycin-exposed cells was determined primarily by K+ equilibrium potential (EK) and was rapidly 'reset' upon manipulation of [K+]o. Pre-treatment of sperm with valinomycin ([K+]o = 5.4 mM) had no effect on the P4-induced [Ca2+] transient (P = 0.95; eight experiments), but application of valinomycin to P4-pretreated sperm suppressed activity in 82% of oscillating cells (n = 257; P = 5  10-55 compared to control) and significantly reduced both the amplitude and frequency of persisting oscillations (P = 0.0001). Upon valinomycin washout, oscillations re-started in most cells. When valinomycin was applied in saline with elevated [K+], the inhibitory effect of valinomycin was reduced and was dependent on EK (P = 10-25). Amplitude and frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations that persisted in the presence of valinomycin showed similar sensitivity to EK (P < 0.01). The CatSper inhibitor RU1968 (4.8 and 11 M) caused immediate and reversible arrest of activity in 36% and 96% of oscillating cells, respectively (P < 10-10). Quinidine (300 M) which blocks the sperm K+ current (IKsper) completely, inhibited [Ca2+]i oscillations. LARGE SCALE DATA N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION This was an in-vitro study and caution must be taken when extrapolating these results to in-vivo regulation of sperm. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS [Ca2+]i oscillations in human sperm are functionally important and their absence is associated with failed fertilisation at IVF. The data reported here provide new understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the regulation and generation (or failure) of these oscillations.

This limited approach has precluded our ability to isolate and genetically manipulate PSCs in a cell specific manner. We have identified neuron-glia antigen 2 (NG2) as a unique molecular marker of S100+ PSCs in skeletal muscle. NG2 is expressed in Schwann cells already associated with the NMJ, indicating that it is a marker of differentiated PSCs.

In Europe, the use and indications of fnECHO and the extent of point-of-care fnECHO training and accreditation are unknown. We aimed to assess utilisation and training of fnECHO in Europe. For this, we conducted an email survey of 45 randomly chosen tertiary NICUs in 17 European countries. The recall rate was 89 % (n = 40). Neonatologists with skills in fnECHO worked in 29 NICUs (74 %), but paediatric cardiologists would routinely perform most fnECHOs. Twenty-four-hour echocardiography service was available in 31 NICUs (78 %). Indications for fnECHO included assessment of haemodynamic volume status (53 %), presence or absence of pulmonary hypertension of the neonate (55 %), indication for and effect of volume replacement therapy (58 %), PDA assessment and monitoring of PDA treatment (80 %). Teaching of fnECHO was offered to trainees in 22 NICUs (55 %). Teaching of fnECHO was provided by paediatric cardiologists (55 %) or by neonatologists (45 %). Only six (15 %) national colleges accredited fnECHO teaching courses. CONCLUSION fnECHO is widely practiced by neonatologists across Europe for a broad range of clinical questions.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the outcomes of the COVID-19 testing algorithm established for surgery patients presenting to a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, and to compare the outcomes among patients who underwent elective versus emergency surgery. Methodology This is a cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan to apply and assess the outcomes of the COVID-19 testing algorithm established for patients presenting for surgery. We included all patients who underwent any surgery from May to October 2020. The total sample size was 6,846. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The categorical variables were assessed using the chi-square or Fishers exact test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results A total of 6,846 surgeries were performed from May 1 to October 31, 2020. In total, 74% of the surgeries were elective procedures. We observed that a significantly higher proportion of emergency surgery patients tested positive for COVID-19 (4.2%) compared to elective surgery patients (25/5,063, 0.5%). A higher proportion of surgeries were performed in September (1,437, 21%) and October (1,445, 21%) while the lowest number of surgeries were performed in May (625, 9.1%). From week one to week five, a higher proportion of emergency surgeries were performed (32%) compared to elective surgeries (25%).

Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT and CEUS revealed that there was a large hemangioma in the right liver, with a size of approximately 95x97x117 mm. Due to the patient's refusal of surgical treatment, hepatic artery embolization was performed in the first stage, then after 25 days of liver protection treatment, the liver function indexes decreased to normal levels. Then, B-ultrasound-guided microwave ablation of the giant hepatic hemangioma was performed. Ten days after the surgery, hepatobiliary ultrasonography showed that the hemangioma of the right liver was smaller than the previous size (the volume was reduced by approximately 30%).

Methods: We describe the main features of recipients, donors, surgical procedure, and immunosuppression in 2020. We also analyze the temporal trends of these characteristics and outcomes (survival) for the period 2011 to 2019. Results: In 2020, 278 heart transplants were performed (7.3% decrease vs 2019). The findings in 2020 confirmed previous observations of an increase in pretransplant sternotomy, a slight decrease in urgent transplants carried out with ventricular assist devices, a slight decrease in donor age, an increase in the use of allografts with previous arrest, and a decrease in ischemia time. Survival continued to improve in recent triennia, reaching 82.0% at 1 year in the period 2017 to 2019. Conclusions: The slight decrease in the number of heart transplants performed in 2020 in Spain, most likely due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, did not change the main characteristics of the procedure.

Between then and the end of April 2020, literally all enveloped respiratory viruses declined to virtually undetectable levels, suggesting a successful interruption of transmission. Weekly percentage positivity rates for M. pneumoniae and all other respiratory viruses from BioFire Syndromic Trends for weeks ending 3/7/2020- 4/24/2020. [Image: see text] Weekly percentage positive rates are shown, with the Rhinovirus/Enterovirus rate divided by 3 and the M. pneumoniae rate multiplied by 10 to fit on the same scale. METHODS: We used the percentage positivity rates from BioFire Syndromic Trends and from GenMark Diagnostics to examine the post lockdown response of M. pneumoniae versus other respiratory viruses on the Respiratory Virus Panel (RP 2.0) RESULTS: As has been reported (Nawrocki J., et al, OFID 2021) and as shown in Figure 1, there was a rapid drop in the positivity rate for all enveloped respiratory viruses by 85.6% from an average rate of 2.014% positive for the week ending 3/14/20 to 0.29% for the week ending 4/18/20, while the positivity rate for M. pneumoniae actually increased by 44% from 0.536 % to 0.772%. The increase in M. pneumoniae positivity rate from its baseline of 0.51  0.38 between 1/25/20 - 3/21/20 vs 0.71  0.09 between 3/28/20 - 4/25/20 was significantly higher by t test, p=0.00574. Data from GenMark was available only monthly but also showed an upward rise from march to April, 2020. CONCLUSION: It is well documented that M. pneumoniae is transmitted through respiratory mechanisms, yet lockdown measures sufficient to dramatically reduce ordinary respiratory virus transmission had no comparable effect on transmission of Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It is also well known that M. pneumoniae persists in the respiratory tract as long as months after an infection. Therefore, it is possible that this reservoir continued to be a source of transmission for M. pneumoniae, even though lockdown measures effectively interrupted the enveloped respiratory viruses.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective and cross-sectional study included 294 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a tertiary referral pandemic center. The study cohort was grouped into tertiles based on the initial PNI values as T1, T2, and T3. The PNI was calculated for each case and the prognostic value of this index was compared to CURB-65 and 4C mortality risk scores in predicting in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Patients stratified into the T1 tertile had a lower lymphocyte count, serum albumin level, and PNI values. In a multivariate analysis, the PNI (OR: 0.688,%95CI: 0.586-0.808, p < 0.001) was an independent predictor for all-cause in-hospital death. After adjusting for confounding independent parameters, patients included in the T1 tertile were found to have 11.2 times higher rates of in-hospital mortality compared to the T3 group, which was presumed as the reference group. In addition, we found that the area under curve (AUC) value of PNI was significantly elevated than that of serum albumin level and total lymphocyte counts alone. [(AUC):0.79 vs AUC:0.75 vs AUC:0.69; respectively). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the PNI is independently related with in-hospital mortality in patient with COVID-19 and cardiovascular risk factors.

A worrisome side effect of the Covid-19 pandemic is the delay in surgical treatment for seriously ill patients, a rise in surgical complications due to delayed care, lack of access to the healthcare system, and patients' hesitancy to seek care due to fear of the virus. In Ecuador, where limitations were present even in the absence of a pandemic, we are yet to fully know the full extent of the damage this pandemic has caused to ourselves and our patients. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present the case of a 51-year-old female; she presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and a gastric GIST was diagnosed. Due to the size and the symptoms, surgery was planned. Nonetheless, as Ecuador was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic to cope with the respiratory patients, surgeries were delayed or canceled. Our patient surgery was delayed for five months until she presented with severe gastrointestinal bleeding that required urgent action and care. Thankfully, she completely recovered. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This case is an example of the many complications we expect due to the pandemic; delay in treatment leads to troublesome complications. In these emergencies, time is of the essence, and surgical services must rise to the challenge; in a particular way, this case also proves that if there are the necessary tools to enhance the patient's recovery, we should hesitate to use them. Complete resection of the gastric GIST in a prompt matter must be done to avoid these potentially deadly complications.","output":"A bleeding GIST in pandemic times, a cooperative approach to a delayed complication, a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: A pathogenic interaction between Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa has recently been demonstrated. In addition, experimental and clinical studies identified Candida spp. tracheobronchial colonization as a risk factor for P. aeruginosa pneumonia. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of antifungal treatment on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheobronchial colonization due to P. aeruginosa. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective observational caseCcontrol study conducted in a 30-bed ICU during a 1-year period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and two patients intubated and ventilated for longer than 48 h with tracheobronchial colonization by Candida spp. Routine screening for Candida spp. and P. aeruginosa was performed at ICU admission and weekly. Antifungal treatment was based on medical staff decisions. Patients with P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization were matched (1:2) with patients without P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization. In case and control patients, risk factors for P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (35%) received antifungal treatment. Nineteen patients (18%) developed a P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization, and all were successfully matched. Antifungal treatment [31% vs 60%; p = 0.037, OR (95% CI) = 0.67 (0.45C0.90)], and duration of antifungal treatment (7  11 vs 14  14 days; p = 0.045, in case and control patients respectively) were significantly associated with reduced risk for P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization. Antifungal treatment was the only variable independently associated with P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.49C0.90, p = 0.046).

However, other less lipophilic -blockers, such as nadolol, may be preferable in individuals who experience propranolol unresponsiveness or adverse events. OBJECTIVE: To document the noninferiority and safety of oral nadolol compared with oral propranolol in infants with IH. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This double-blind noninferiority prospective study with a noninferiority margin of 10% compared propranolol with nadolol in infants aged 1 to 6 months with problematic IH. The study was conducted in 2 academic pediatric dermatology centers in Canada between 2016 and 2020. Infants aged 1 to 6 months with a hemangioma greater than 1.5 cm on the face or 3 cm or greater on another body part causing or with potential to cause functional impairment or cosmetic disfigurement. INTERVENTIONS: Oral propranolol and nadolol in escalating doses up to 2 mg/kg/d. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURE: Between-group differences comparing changes in the bulk (size and extent) and color of the IH at week 24 with baseline using a 100-mm visual analog scale. RESULTS: The study included 71 patients. Of these, 36 were treated with propranolol. The mean (SD) age in this group was 3.1 (1.4) months, and 31 individuals (86%) were female. Thirty-five infants were treated with nadolol. The mean (SD) age in this group was 3.2 (1.6) months, and 26 individuals (74%) were female. The difference in IH between groups by t test was 8.8 (95% CI, 2.7-14.9) for size and 17.1 (95% CI, 7.2-30.0) for color in favor of the nadolol group, demonstrating that nadolol was noninferior to propranolol. Similar differences were noted at 52 weeks: 6.0 (95% CI, 1.9-10.1) and 10.1 (95% CI, 2.9-17.4) for size and color improvement, respectively. For each doubling of time unit (week), the coefficient of involution was 2.4 (95% CI, 0.5-4.4) higher with nadolol compared with propranolol. Safety data were similar between the 2 interventions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Oral nadolol was noninferior to oral propranolol, indicating it may be an efficacious and safe alternative in cases of propranolol unresponsiveness or adverse events, or when faster involution is required.

Through a comparative case study of two processes that ran in the UK in 2019 (the Leeds Climate Change Citizens Jury and the Oxford Citizens Assembly on Climate Change), this paper investigates how far citizen assemblies and juries are increasing citizen engagement on climate change and creating more citizen-centred climate policymaking. Interviews were conducted with policymakers, councillors, professional facilitators and others involved in running these processes to assess motivations for conducting these, their structure and the impact and influence they had. The findings suggest the impact of these processes is not uniform: they have an indirect impact on policy making by creating momentum around climate action and supporting the introduction of pre-planned or pre-existing policies rather than a direct impact by truly being citizen-centred policy making processes or conducive to new climate policy. We conclude with reflections on how these processes give elected representatives a public mandate on climate change, that they help to identify more nuanced and in-depth public opinions in a fair and informed way, yet it can be challenging to embed citizen juries and assemblies in wider democratic processes.","output":"Are citizen juries and assemblies on climate change driving democratic climate policymaking?

Humans, animals and mixed farming, produce emissions which contribute so much to the change in climate. Heat stress associated with climate change has an enormous effect on poultry production as it affects chicken growth and productivity as poultry meat and eggs play an important food security role across Africa and world at large. Understanding how farmers deal with the realities of poultry production due to climate change is critical. In pig production the influence of climate change may differ slightly depending on the breed types and locality but common problems are lack of water, pests and diseases, death of the animal at extreme heat stress and possible alteration in grazing behavior which will lead ultimately to decrease in feed intake and feed digestibility and efficiency of feed utilization which can be seen in terms of growth, pork yield and milk production. Ruminants which are the primary producers of methane (CH4) has many factors influencing these emissions such as level of feed intake, type of carbohydrate in the diet and feed processing.

Remote monitoring through CO@h aims to identify early patient deterioration and provide timely escalation for cases of silent hypoxia, while reducing the burden on secondary care. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective service evaluation of COVID-19 patients onboarded to CO@h from November 2020 to March 2021 in the North Hampshire (UK) community led service (a collaboration of 15 General Practitioner (GP) practices covering 230 000 people). We have compared outcomes for patients admitted to Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital who were CO@h patients (COVID-19 patients with home monitoring of oxygen saturation (SpO(2); n=115), with non-CO@h patients (those directly admitted without being monitored by CO@h (n=633)). Crude and adjusted OR analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of CO@h on patient outcomes of 30-day mortality, Intensive care unit (ICU) admission and hospital length of stay greater than 3, 7, 14 and 28 days. RESULTS: Adjusted ORs for CO@h show an association with a reduction for several adverse patient outcome: 30-day hospital mortality (p<0.001, OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.47), hospital length of stay larger than 3 days (p<0.05, OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.00), 7 days (p<0.001, OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.54), 14 days (p<0.001, OR 0.22 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.41), and 28 days (p<0.05, OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.59).

Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal death, and survivors face lifelong risks of adverse outcomes. New approaches with large sample sizes are needed to identify strategies to predict and prevent preterm birth. The primary aims of the Washington University Prematurity Research Cohort Study were to conduct three prospective projects addressing possible causes of preterm birth and provide data and samples for future research. Study Design Pregnant patients were recruited into the cohort between January 2017 and January 2020. Consenting patients were enrolled into the study before 20 weeks' gestation and followed through delivery. Participants completed demographic and lifestyle surveys; provided maternal blood, placenta samples, and cord blood; and participated in up to three projects focused on underlying physiology of preterm birth: cervical imaging (Project 1), circadian rhythms (Project 2), and uterine magnetic resonance imaging and electromyometrial imaging (Project 3). Results A total of 1260 participants were enrolled and delivered during the study period. Of the participants, 706 (56%) were Black/African American, 494 (39%) were nulliparous, and 185 (15%) had a previous preterm birth. Of the 1260 participants, 1220 (97%) delivered a live infant. Of the 1220 with a live birth, 163 (14.1%) had preterm birth, of which 74 (6.1%) were spontaneous preterm birth. Of the 1220 participants with a live birth, 841 participated in cervical imaging, 1047 contributed data and/or samples on circadian rhythms, and 39 underwent uterine magnetic resonance imaging. Of the 39, 25 underwent electromyometrial imaging. Conclusion We demonstrate feasibility of recruiting and retaining a diverse cohort in a complex prospective, longitudinal study throughout pregnancy.

Apparently soa recent exemplar appears in United States v. Arthrex, one of the three IP decisions handed down near the end of the 2020 term. In this deeply fractured Supreme Court decisionwith different majorities for the merits and the remedyfive justices held that PTAB judges, who are appointed as inferior Officers under the Appointments Clause and have traditionally wielded unreviewable authority during IPR to cancel patents, have unconstitutionally acted as principal Officers, and should therefore have been nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. To remedy such an Appointments Clause violation, seven justices voted to judicially convert these principal Officers to inferior Officers by allowing the USPTO Director to discretionarily review the PTABs IPR decisions.Consequently, Arthrex has expanded the Directors power to review the PTABs IPR cases and reach her own decisions. As Justice Gorsuchs dissent suggested, the new power creates risk that the Director, as a political appointee, may be politically motivatedor perceived as politically motivatedto cancel patents that carry with them significant financial or social consequences. This puts more pressure on the currently unfilled Director post in the Biden Administration. It is not difficult to imagine lobbying campaigns aimed to influence the Directors decision. Recent examples of patents at potential risk include those related to COVID vaccines. Not to put too fine a point on it, patents have become less free of political influence than they might have been in the past, as patents are certainly political. Arthrex sends a strong message that patent adjudication is not special in the administrative state and reaffirms the long-observed pattern of no patent exceptionalism in the justices eyes.More broadly, this case has provided a clear roadmap for Congress to rethink current regulatory regimes and design adjudicative regimes in the future: outside of patent law, Arthrexs ruling may upend a handful of adjudicative agencies with internal administrative-law bodies that have final decision-making authority like the PTAB, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, and the Social Security Administration. Under Arthrex, those administrative law judges are, like APJs, appointed as inferior Officers, but unconstitutionally acting as principal Officers. These apparent Duffy Defects may lead to future constitutional challenges based on the Appointments Clause (as well as the Vesting Clause), including those unresolved by Arthrex.

Relevant literature reveals that the presence of an element of surprise in the story is a strong driving force for the rapid dissemination of misinformation, which attracts immediate attention and invokes strong emotional stimulus in the reader. False stories or fake information are written to arouse interest and activate the emotions of people to spread it. Thus, false stories have a higher level of novelty and emotional content than true stories. Hence, Novelty of the news item and recognizing the Emotional state of the reader after reading the item seems two key tasks to tightly couple with misinformation Detection. Previous literature did not explore misinformation detection with mutual learning for novelty detection and emotion recognition to the best of our knowledge. Our current work argues that joint learning of novelty and emotion from the target text makes a strong case for misinformation detection. In this paper, we propose a deep multitask learning framework that jointly performs novelty detection, emotion recognition, and misinformation detection. Our deep multitask model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for fake news detection on four benchmark datasets, viz. ByteDance, FNC, Covid-Stance and FNID with 7.73%, 3.69%, 7.95% and 13.38% accuracy gain, respectively. The evaluation shows that our multitask learning framework improves the performance over the single-task framework for four datasets with 7.8%, 28.62%, 11.46%, and 15.66% overall accuracy gain. We claim that textual novelty and emotion are the two key aspects to consider while developing an automatic fake news detection mechanism.

DESIGN: A literature review of the historical costs of surgical fellowship interviews and a summary of how the shift to virtual interviews has unintended positive and negative effects on costs for applicants and training programs. RESULTS: Transitioning fellowship interviews to virtual platforms affects expenditures of finances and time. Each fellowship candidate saves close to $6,000 in interview travel expenses. Applicants require less time off from their residency programs during this critical time of need for frontline healthcare workers. However, applicants miss some of the live aspects of interviewing, and training programs invest more effort upfront altering their interviews to virtual formats. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 public health crisis has had a significant impact on surgical education, including how selection is conducted. Virtual recruitment has the potential for cost savings but should continue to be refined. This is an opportune time to innovate and rethink how to recruit prospective surgical residency and fellowship candidates during the current and forthcoming interview seasons.","output":"How Has COVID-19 Affected the Costs of the Surgical Fellowship Interview Process?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related death necessitates better understanding of the early viral dynamics, host responses and immunopathology. While studies have reported immune profiling using single cell RNA sequencing in terminal human COVID-19 patients, performing longitudinal immune cell dynamics in humans is challenging. Macaques are a suitable model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell suspensions from adult rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=6) to delineate the early dynamics of immune cells changes. The bronchoalveolar compartment exhibited dynamic changes in transcriptional landscape 3 days post-SARS-CoV-2-infection (3dpi) (peak viremia), relative to 14-17dpi (recovery phase) and pre-infection (baseline). We observed the accumulation of distinct populations of both macrophages and T-lymphocytes expressing strong interferon-driven inflammatory gene signature at 3dpi. Type I IFN response was highly induced in the plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The presence of a distinct HLADR+CD68+CD163+SIGLEC1+ macrophage population exhibiting higher angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression was also observed. These macrophages were significantly recruited to the lungs of macaques at 3dpi and harbored SARS-CoV-2, while expressing a strong interferon-driven innate anti-viral gene signature. The accumulation of these responses correlated with decline in viremia and recovery.

It is unknown to which extent presymptomatic residents and staff contribute to the spread of the virus. AIMS: To assess the contribution of asymptomatic and presymptomatic residents and staff in SARS-CoV-2 transmission during a large outbreak in a Dutch NH. METHODS: Observational study in a 185-bed NH with two consecutive testing strategies: testing of symptomatic cases only, followed by weekly facility-wide testing of staff and residents regardless of symptoms. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing with RT-PCR for SARs-CoV-2, including sequencing of positive samples, was conducted with a standardized symptom assessment. RESULTS: 185 residents and 244 staff participated. Sequencing identified one cluster. In the symptom-based test strategy period 3/39 residents were presymptomatic versus 38/74 residents in the period of weekly facility-wide testing (p-value<0.001). In total, 51/59 (91.1%) of SARS-CoV-2 positive staff was symptomatic, with no difference between both testing strategies (p-value 0.763). Loss of smell and taste, sore throat, headache or myalga was hardly reported in residents compared to staff (p-value <0.001). Median Ct-value of presymptomatic residents was 21.3, which did not differ from symptomatic (20.8) or asymptomatic (20.5) residents (p-value 0.624). CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms in residents and staff are insufficiently recognized, reported or attributed to a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, residents without (recognized) symptoms showed the same potential for viral shedding as residents with symptoms.

One proposed explanation for this is the role of the AHR in innate immune signaling within barrier tissues in response to the presence of microorganisms. A number of cytokine/chemokine genes exhibit a combinatorial increase in transcription upon toll-like receptors and AHR activation, supporting this concept. The AHR also plays a role in the enhanced differentiation of intestinal and dermal epithelium leading to improved barrier function. Importantly, from an evolutionary perspective many of these tryptophan metabolites exhibit greater activation potential for the human AHR when compared to the rodent AHR. These observations underscore the importance of the AHR in barrier tissues and may lead to pharmacologic therapeutic intervention.","output":"How Ah Receptor Ligand Specificity Became Important in Understanding Its Physiological Function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Binge patterns of alcohol use among post-high school emerging adults are associated with both immediate negative consequences and increased risk of long-term drinking problems, particularly among individuals with a family history (FH) of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Therefore, the developmental time period of emerging adulthood, paired with the high-risk environment of college campuses, represents an important target for interventions. Attentional ability has recently emerged as a mediator of resilience to stress-related psychopathology and offers a potential neurocognitive target for interventions. We tested the hypothesis that attentional ability promotes resilience to binge drinking in a sample of 464 college students with (n = 221) or without (n = 243) familial risk for AUD. Two-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) tested effects of FH and self-reported binge drinking on attention scores from the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS). In addition, mediation analyses tested whether BIS attention scores mediated the relationship between Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale scores and binge drinking. ANCOVA results indicated a significant FH-by-binge drinking interaction (p = 0.008) in which FH positive subjects who did not binge drink had the fewest attention problems, consistent with a marker of resilience. Furthermore, BIS attention scores significantly mediated the effect of Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale scores on binge drinking, with stronger effects in FH positive subjects (p < 0.001) than FH negative subjects (p = 0.49). The findings suggest that attention promotes resilience to binge drinking in individuals with familial risk for AUD. Interventions targeting attentional ability in this high-risk population, particularly FH positive individuals with attention deficits, may serve to reduce binge drinking and its consequences.","output":"High Trait Attention Promotes Resilience and Reduces Binge Drinking Among College Students With a Family History of Alcohol Use Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case study examines Indonesian first-grade teachers' emotions when teaching online during the pandemic.

While sand mining supports urbanization by providing essential aggregate materials for urban real estate and construction sectors, it however undermines environmental sustainability especially in coastal regions. In spite of this, very sparse research has explained the socio-environmental dimensions of sand mining in Nigerian coastal communities. This study therefore explored the drivers and impacts of sand mining based on the data from a survey of residents in four Lagos sand mining coastal communities. Results showed that sand mining activity is driven by a number of urbanization related factors while sand mining impacts are underlined by a number of sustainability related factors. However, using exploratory analytical techniques we found that four urbanization components described the drivers of sand mining and four sustainability components described the impacts of sand mining in Lagos. The paper concludes on the puzzling dilemma of sand mining that supports thriving urbanization but undermines environmental sustainability in Lagos.

We previously demonstrated exacerbation of JE following CD11c(hi) dendritic cell (DC) ablation in CD11c-DTR transgenic mice. Moreover, CD11c(hi) DC ablation led to abnormal differentiation of CD11b(+)Ly-6C(hi) monocytes and enhanced permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), resulting in promoting the progression of JE. Here, we examined changes in lymphoid and myeloid-derived leukocyte subpopulations associated with pro- and anti-inflammation during JE progression. The analyses of this study focused on regulatory CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs), IL-17(+)CD4(+) Th17 cells, and CD11b(+)Ly-6C(hi) and Ly-6C(lo) monocytes. CD11c(hi) DC ablation resulted in the accumulation of IL-17(+)CD4(+) Th17 cells in the CNS, thereby leading to lower ratio of Tregs to Th17 cells. This result was corroborated by the higher expression levels of IL-17 and RORT in CD4(+) T cells from the brains of CD11c(hi) DC-ablated mice. In addition, CD11c(hi) DC-ablated mice showed higher frequency and total number of inflammatory CD11b(+)Ly-6C(hi) monocytes, whereas CD11b(+)Ly-6C(lo) monocytes were detected with lower frequency and total number in CD11c(hi) DC-ablated mice. Furthermore, CD11c(hi) DC ablation altered the phenotype and function of CD11b(+)Ly-6C(lo) monocytes, resulting in lower levels of activation marker and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10 and TGF-) expression. Collectively, these results indicate that CD11c(hi) DC ablation caused an imbalance in CD4(+) Th17/Treg cells and CD11b(+)Ly-6C(hi)/Ly-6C(lo) monocytes in the lymphoid tissue and CNS during JE progression.

The CTL, HTL, MHC I, and IFN- epitopes were predicted via CTLPRED, IEDB, and IFN epitope servers, respectively. Also, to stimulate strong helper T lymphocytes (HTLs) responses, Pan HLA DR-binding epitope (PADRE) was used. Also, for boosting the immune response, -defensin 2 was added to the construct as an adjuvant. Furthermore, TAT was applied to the vaccine to facilitate the intracellular delivery. Finally, TAT, adjuvant, PADRE, and selected epitopes were appropriately assembled. Based on the predicted epitopes, a trivalent multi-epitope vaccine with a molecular weight of 74.8 kDa was constructed. Further analyses predicted the molecule to be a strong antigen, and a non-allergenic and soluble protein. Secondary and tertiary structures were predicted. Additionally, analyses validated the stability of the proposed vaccine. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) showed binding affinity and stability of the vaccine-TLR3 complex was favorable. The predicted epitopes demonstrated a strong potential to stimulate T and B-cell mediated immune responses. Furthermore, codon optimization and in silico cloning guaranteed increased expression.

How this maps onto SARS-CoV-2 organ tropism at the histological level, however, remains unclear. Here, we perform a comprehensive validation of a monoclonal antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) followed by systematic multisystem organ immunohistochemistry analysis of the viral cellular tropism in tissue from 36 patients, 16 post-mortem cases and 16 biopsies with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 status from the peaks of the pandemic in 2020 and four pre-COVID post-mortem controls. SARS-CoV-2 anti-NP staining in the post-mortem cases revealed broad multiorgan involvement of the respiratory, digestive, haematopoietic, genitourinary and nervous systems, with a typical pattern of staining characterised by punctate paranuclear and apical cytoplasmic labelling. The average time from symptom onset to time of death was shorter in positively versus negatively stained post-mortem cases (mean = 10.3 days versus mean = 20.3 days, p = 0.0416, with no cases showing definitive staining if the interval exceeded 15 days). One striking finding was the widespread presence of SARS-CoV-2 NP in neurons of the myenteric plexus, a site of high ACE-2 expression, the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and one of the earliest affected cells in Parkinson's disease.

We then reviewed strategies to remove and recover DON based on results of a range of treatment technologies reported in the literature, including laboratory-scale up to full-scale operation in wastewater treatment plants. Our meta-analysis showed that DON concentrations are greatest in wastewater effluent followed by surface water and groundwater. The concentration of DON in wastewater effluent varied from 0.01 to 10.9 mg N/L (number of data points, n = 163), where the range in surface water was 0.002 to 14.3 mg N/L (n = 11,803). Organic N accounted for the majority of total N in 12.3% of wastewater effluent samples and 49.1% of surface waters. Our literature review showed that currently available wastewater treatment processes do not efficiently target DON removal nor recovery of the N as a valuable product. One potential DON removal and recovery strategy is transforming DON into DIN, which is generally more easily removed and recovered. Transformation strategies reported in the literature include ozonation, UV/H2O2, and electrooxidation. However, as advanced oxidation processes are often energy- and cost-intensive, further research is needed to improve DON removal and recovery.","output":"Meta-analysis of the prevalence of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in water and wastewater and review of DON removal and recovery strategies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Andexanet alfa is a recombinant modified human FXa (factor Xa) developed to reverse FXa inhibition from anticoagulants. Hemostatic efficacy and reversal of anti-FXa activity with andexanet were assessed in patients from the ANNEXA-4 study (Andexanet Alfa, a Novel Antidote to the Anticoagulation Effects of FXa Inhibitors) with intracranial hemorrhage (ICrH). METHODS: ANNEXA-4 was a single-arm study evaluating andexanet in patients presenting with major bleeding 18 hours after taking an FXa inhibitor. Patients received a bolus plus 2-hour infusion of andexanet. Brain imaging in patients with ICrH was performed at baseline and at 1 and 12 hours postandexanet infusion. Coprimary efficacy outcomes were change in anti-FXa activity and hemostatic efficacy at 12 hours (excellent/good efficacy defined as 35% increase in hemorrhage volume/thickness). Safety outcomes included occurrence of thrombotic events and death at 30 days. RESULTS: A total of 227 patients with ICrH were included in the safety population (51.5% male; mean age 79.3 years) and 171 in the efficacy population (99 spontaneous and 72 traumatic bleeds). In efficacy evaluable patients, excellent/good hemostasis 12 hours postandexanet occurred in 77 out of 98 (78.6%) and in 58 out of 70 (82.9%) patients with spontaneous and traumatic bleeding, respectively. In the subanalysis by FXa inhibitor treatment group in the efficacy population, median of percent change in anti-FXa from baseline to nadir showed a decrease of 93.8% for apixaban-treated patients (n=99) and by 92.6% for rivaroxaban-treated patients (n=59). Within 30 days, death occurred in 34 out of 227 (15.0%) patients and thrombotic events occurred in 21 out of 227 (9.3%) patients (safety population). CONCLUSIONS: Andexanet reduced anti-FXa activity in FXa inhibitor-treated patients with ICrH, with a high rate of hemostatic efficacy.

The speed and severity of the viral contagion has rendered devastatingly, undeniably visible the vast, racial gap between those with reliable health care, child care, housing, nutrition, household wealth, and income and those without, but that gap was already widening well before the pandemic amid accelerating economic inequality, racial disparity, and precarity for those fortunate enough to find paid work. By the summer of 2020, pandemic isolation gave way to mass protests supporting the Movement for Black Lives with calls to end anti-Black police brutality and mass incarceration, but also seeking to end exploitation of Black essential workers and increase attention to longstanding economic devastation of divestment from communities of color. With physical health and safety linked inextricably to material deprivation came heightened public demands for racial, social, and economic justice to help marginalized communities not just survive in times of crisis, but thrive every day. This Article examines reinvigorated proposals for universal basic income (UBI) and a federal job guarantee (JG) to reduce poverty, income inequality, and the widening racial wealth gap. It examines the potential of such reforms to put more money into the hands of those most likely to use it while ending involuntary unemployment and boosting labor conditions for all, but especially Blacks and people of color with less access to generational wealth, higher education, and protection against employment discrimination. It concludes that both UBI and JG are necessary but each insufficient on its own to achieve greater economic security and mobility, with dignified work for all. Crucially, a universal minimum income untethered to any form of work requirement is essential to break the racialized and gendered stigma that frames economic need as welfare dependency;equally important is the guarantee of public employment at a living wage to those who voluntarily choose to avoid gaps in earned income and employment history but have historically been excluded from the best work-life options. Together, UBI and JG form vital pillars of social support for withstanding future crises, large or small, and for creating the future society we want.","output":"From Stigma to Dignity?

This vision paper discusses pre-COVID-19 educational methodologies and best evidence, adaptations required under COVID-19 and evidence for these modifications and suggests future directions for anesthesiology education.Learning management systems provide structure to online learning. They have been increasingly utilized to improve access to didactic materials asynchronously. Despite some historic reservations, the pandemic has necessitated a rapid uptake across programs. Commercially available systems offer a wide range of peer-reviewed curricular options.The flipped classroom promotes learning foundational knowledge prior to teaching sessions with a focus on application during structured didactics. There is growing evidence that this approach is preferred by learners and may increase knowledge gain. The flipped classroom works well with learning management systems to disseminate focused pre-class work. Care must be taken to keep virtual sessions interactive.Simulation, already used in anesthesiology, has been critical in preparation for the care of COVID-19 patients. Multidisciplinary, in-situ simulations allow for rapid dissemination of new team workflows. Physical distancing and reduced availability of providers have required more sessions. Early pandemic decreases in operating volumes have allowed for this; future planning will have to incorporate smaller groups, sanitizing of equipment, and attention to use of personal protective equipment.Effective technical skills training requires instruction to mastery levels, use of deliberate practice, and high-quality feedback. Reduced sizes of skills training workshops and approaches for feedback that are not in-person will be required.Mock oral and OSCE examinations allow for training and assessment of competencies often not addressed otherwise. They provide formative and summative data and objective measurements of ACGME Milestones. They also allow for preparation for the ABA APPLIED examination. Adaptations to teleconferencing or videoconferencing can allow for continued use.Benefits of teaching in this new era include enhanced availability of asynchronous learning and opportunities to apply universal, expert-driven curricula. Burdens include decreased social interactions and potential need for an increased amount of smaller, live sessions.Acquiring learning management systems and holding more frequent simulation and skills sessions with fewer learners may increase cost.

Momentum then started to build toward understanding how antibodies could recognize the vast universe of potential antigens and how antibody-combining sites could be tailored to engage antigens with high specificity and affinity through recombination of germline genes (V, D, J) and somatic mutation. Equivalent groundbreaking structures in the cellular immune system appeared some 15 to 20 years later and illustrated how processed protein antigens in the form of peptides are presented by MHC molecules to T cell receptors. Structures of antigen receptors in the innate immune system then explained their inherent specificity for particular microbial antigens including lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, small molecules, and specific proteins. These two sides of the immune system act immediately (innate) to particular microbial antigens or evolve (adaptive) to attain high specificity and affinity to a much wider range of antigens. We also include examples of other key receptors in the immune system (cytokine receptors) that regulate immunity and inflammation. Furthermore, these antigen receptors use a limited set of protein folds to accomplish their various immunological roles. The other main players are the antigens themselves. We focus on surface glycoproteins in enveloped viruses including SARS-CoV-2 that enable entry and egress into host cells and are targets for the antibody response.

METHODS: At the 11 intervention clinics, HR-MAM children were given RUTF and amoxicillin along with standard nutrition counseling, for 2C12 wk. All others received 6 wk of nutrition counseling alone. HR-MAM was defined as midupper arm circumference (MUAC) <11.9 cm, weight-for-age z score (WAZ) <?3.5, mother not the main caregiver, or a child <2 y old not being breastfed. Outcomes were compared using intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: Analysis included 573 children at the intervention sites and 714 children at the control sites. Of the intervention group, 317 (55%) were classified as HR-MAM. Short-term recovery was greater at the intervention sites [48% compared with 39% at week 12; risk difference (rd): 0.08; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.13]. The intervention group had lower risk of deteriorating to severe acute malnutrition (SAM) (18% compared with 24%; rd: ?0.07; 95% CI: ?0.11, ?0.04), lower risk of dying (1.8% compared with 3.1%; rd: ?0.02; 95% CI: ?0.03, ?0.00), and greater gains in MUAC and weight than did children at the control sites.

METHODS: We used an age-structured, expanded SEIR model with social contact matrices to assess age-specific vaccine allocation strategies in India. We used state-specific age structures and disease transmission coefficients estimated from confirmed incident cases of COVID-19 between 1 July and 31 August 2020. Simulations were used to investigate the relative reduction in mortality and morbidity of vaccine allocation strategies based on prioritizing different age groups, and the interactions of these strategies with concurrent non-pharmaceutical interventions. Given the uncertainty associated with COVID-19 vaccine development, we varied vaccine characteristics in the modelling simulations. RESULTS: Prioritizing COVID-19 vaccine allocation for older populations (i.e., >60 years) led to the greatest relative reduction in deaths, regardless of vaccine efficacy, control measures, rollout speed, or immunity dynamics. Preferential vaccination of this group often produced relatively higher total symptomatic infections and more pronounced estimates of peak incidence than other assessed strategies. Vaccine efficacy, immunity type, target coverage, and rollout speed significantly influenced overall strategy effectiveness, with the time taken to reach target coverage significantly affecting the relative mortality benefit comparative to no vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support global recommendations to prioritize COVID-19 vaccine allocation for older age groups.

Generalized estimating equations with a working independence correlation structure were used to compare anti-RBD IgG levels between SOTR and HC at each study visit and within each group over time. All models were adjusted for age, sex, and pre-vaccination seroreactivity in the ELISA. RESULTS: A total of 54 SOTR and 26 HC were enrolled, with mean (SD) ages of 72 (3.6) and 62 (6.7) years, 61% and 35% were male, and 91% and 88% were white, respectively. The most common organ transplant types were kidney (41%) and liver (37%). All SOTR were receiving calcineurin inhibitors. The median time post-transplantation was 7 years. SOTR had markedly lower mean anti-RBD IgG levels when compared to HC with adjusted mean differences of -0.76 (95%CI: [-1.04, -0.47]; p < 0.001) ELISA units (EU) and -1.35 (95%CI [-1.68, -1.01]; p < 0.001) EU after the first and second doses, respectively (Figure 1). Both groups had a significant increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels after the second dose. However, the magnitude was lower in SOTR, 0.49 (95%CI [0.31, 0.69]; p < 0.001) EU than in HCs, 1.08 (95% CI [0.91, 1.24]; p < 0.001) EU. Figure 1. [Image: see text] Anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG levels in solid organ transplant recipients and healthy controls before receiving the BNT162b2 vaccine (baseline), post-vaccine dose 1, and post-vaccine dose 2. CONCLUSION: Our study showed SOTR mounted weaker humoral immune responses than HC to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Given a lower response, SOTR should continue to practice social distancing and masking until data on vaccine efficacy are available in this vulnerable population. DISCLOSURES: Natasha B.

Repair of more technically challenging hernias, such as patients previously receiving prostatectomy, has been less studied and may not have these advantages. We aimed to compare safety, feasibility, and clinical outcomes for repairs in patients who previously underwent prostatectomy to control subjects. METHODS We undertook a case-control study using a prospectively collected database. From 2004, all patients were routinely offered totally extraperitoneal laparoscopic repair. All patients who had a history of previous prostatectomy were identified and compared to a matched control group. Both operative and follow-up data were analyzed. RESULTS Of 987 patients undergoing surgery during this time period, 52 prostatectomy patients were identified (44% open, 44% robotic, 3% laparoscopic) and matched to 102 control subjects. Accounting for bilateral repairs, 203 hernia repairs had been performed. Patients were well matched for age and American Society of Anesthesiologists score. Operative time was longer for prostatectomy patients (mean, 70 vs. 52 min, p < 0.0001); however, this reduced over time when comparing the first and second half prostatectomy patients (77 vs. 63 min, p = 0.144). Overall, there were no intraoperative or major postoperative complications and only one conversion (prostatectomy group). No significant differences were found for rates of minor postoperative complications, length of stay, or recurrence (n = 1, control group). No difference was observed for chronic pain, and all patients in each group reported satisfaction with surgery at contemporary follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In experienced hands, totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair for patients previously having undergone prostatectomy is safe and has equivalent outcomes to patients not having undergone prostatectomy, and is an option to open repair. Understandably, slightly longer operative times may be justified, given the benefits of early discharge and less postoperative pain after laparoscopic surgery.","output":"Totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair in patients previously having prostatectomy is feasible, safe, and effective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has created a healthcare crisis across the world and has put human life under life-threatening circumstances. The recent discovery of the crystallized structure of the main protease (Mpro) from SARS-CoV-2 has provided an opportunity for utilizing computational tools as an effective method for drug discovery. Targeting viral replication has remained an effective strategy for drug development. Mpro of SARS-COV-2 is the key protein in viral replication as it is involved in the processing of polyproteins to various structural and nonstructural proteins. Thus, Mpro represents a key target for the inhibition of viral replication specifically for SARS-CoV-2. We have used a virtual screening strategy by targeting Mpro against a library of commercially available compounds to identify potential inhibitors. After initial identification of hits by molecular docking-based virtual screening further MM/GBSA, predictive ADME analysis, and molecular dynamics simulation were performed. The virtual screening resulted in the identification of twenty-five top scoring structurally diverse hits that have free energy of binding (&#916;G) values in the range of -26-06 (for compound AO-854/10413043) to -59.81 Kcal/mol (for compound 329/06315047). Moreover, the top-scoring hits have favorable AMDE properties as calculated using in silico algorithms. Additionally, the molecular dynamics simulation revealed the stable nature of protein-ligand interaction and provided information about the amino acid residues involved in binding. Overall, this study led to the identification of potential SARS-CoV-2 Mpro hit compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic properties. We believe that the outcome of this study can help to develop novel Mpro inhibitors to tackle this pandemic. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The effect of a mainshock in the form of aftershocks can be felt throughout the recovery phase of stock price. As the market remains in stress during recovery, any small perturbation leads to a relatively smaller aftershock. The duration of the recovery phase has been estimated using structural break analysis. We have carried out statistical analyses of the 1987 stock market crash, 2008 financial crisis and 2020 COVID-19 pandemic considering the actual crash-times of the mainshock and aftershocks. Earlier, such analyses were done considering an absolute one-day return, which cannot capture a crash properly. The results show that the mainshock and aftershock in the stock market follow the Gutenberg-Richter (GR) power law. Further, we obtained a higher $$ value for the COVID-19 crash compared to the financial-crisis-2008 from the GR law. This implies that the recovery of stock price during COVID-19 may be faster than the financial-crisis-2008. The result is consistent with the present recovery of the market from the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis shows that the high magnitude aftershocks are rare, and low magnitude aftershocks are frequent during the recovery phase.

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING University research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS Women (N=56) 19 to 35 years of age, including 36 with patellofemoral pain and 20 controls. INTERVENTIONS Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Participants sustained an isometric knee extension contraction at 10% of their maximal voluntary effort for 70 seconds. Motor units (N=414) were identified using high-density surface electromyography. Average firing rate was calculated between 5 and 35 seconds after recruitment for each motor unit. Initial firing rate was the inverse of the first 3 motor unit interspike intervals. RESULTS In control participants, vastus medialis motor units discharged at higher rates than vastus lateralis motor units (P=.001). This was not observed in women with patellofemoral pain (P=.78) because of a higher discharge rate of vastus lateralis compared with control participants (P=.002). No between-group differences were observed for vastus medialis (P=.93). Similar results were obtained for the initial motor unit firing rate. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that women with patellofemoral pain have a higher neural drive to vastus lateralis but not vastus medialis, which may be a contributor of the altered patellar kinematics observed in some studies. The different neural drive may be an adaptation to patellofemoral pain, possibly to compensate for decreased quadriceps force production, or a precursor of patellofemoral pain.","output":"Vastus Lateralis Motor Unit Firing Rate Is Higher in Women With Patellofemoral Pain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUTION: COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events. However, the contribution of platelet reactivity (PR) to the aetiology of the increased thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19 remains unclear. Our aim was to evaluate PR in stable patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized with respiratory symptoms (mainly dyspnoea and dry cough), in comparison with a control group comprised of non-hospitalized healthy controls. METHODS: Observational, case control study that included patients with confirmed COVID-19 (COVID-19 group, n = 60) and healthy individuals matched by age and sex (control group, n = 60). Multiplate electrode aggregometry (MEA) tests were used to assess PR with adenosine diphosphate (MEA-ADP, low PR defined as < 53 AUC), arachidonic acid (MEA-ASPI, low PR < 86 AUC) and thrombin receptor-activating peptide 6 (MEA-TRAP, low PR < 97 AUC) in both groups. RESULTS: The rates of low PR with MEA-ADP were 27.5% in the COVID-19 group and 21.7% in the control group (OR = 1.60, p = 0.20); with MEA-ASPI, the rates were, respectively, 37.5% and 22.5% (OR = 3.67, p < 0.001); and with MEA-TRAP, the incidences were 48.5% and 18.8%, respectively (OR = 9.58, p < 0.001). Levels of d-dimer, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) were higher in the COVID-19 group in comparison with the control group (all p < 0.05).

This study assesses the sleep behaviours of Canadian adults and how these behaviours align with the recommendations. DATA AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study uses nationally representative data from the 2020 Canadian Community Health Survey healthy living rapid response module (N = 9,248), collected from January to March 2020. Sleep behaviours were self-reported by respondents, and descriptive statistics were used to calculate means or percentages for sleep duration, guideline adherence, physical activity and screen time, sleep timing, and sleep variability in the full sample. This was done by age, sex, household education, household income adequacy and employment status. RESULTS: Mean sleep duration was 7.9 hours for adults aged 18 to 64, with 77% meeting sleep duration recommendations, and 8.1 hours for adults aged 65 and older, with 55% meeting sleep duration recommendations.

The psychotherapies to be assessed in this study are trial-based cognitive therapy (TBCT), mindfulness-based health promotion (MBHP) and positive psychotherapy (PPT). Objectives: (1) to assess the online efficacy of TBCT compared to MBHP and PPT to reduce the symptoms of PTSD in the context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; (2) to compare the efficacy of these psychotherapies in improving anxiety, depression, guilt and in promoting well-being; and (3) to describe how professionals perceive online treatment. Methods: A randomized, multicenter, single-blind clinical trial will be conducted, with three separate arms. An estimated sample of 135 patients will receive either TBCT, MBHP or PPT and will be treated through online, individual, weekly visits, totaling 14 sessions. The primary outcome will be CAPS-5 and secondary outcomes will be HADS and WHO-5. The variables used to mediate these outcomes will be the Trauma-Related Guilt Inventory (TRGI), Negative Core Beliefs Inventory (NCBI) and the California Psychotherapy Alliance Scale (CALPAS-P). Expected results: PTSD symptoms are expected to be reduced after TBCT, MBHP and PPT. No statistical difference is expected to be found among the three. Discussion: The present study will evaluate and contribute towards the development of new psychotherapeutic options for patients with PTSD. The results of this study will allow the dissemination of new effective and adaptable interventions for patients with PTSD.","output":"A Randomized Clinical Trial to Assess the Efficacy of Online-Treatment with Trial-Based Cognitive Therapy, Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion and Positive Psychotherapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Study Protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ubiquity of sensor technology and the Internet of Things prompted us to propose to develop a real-time digital dashboard to visualize the anxiety risks of populations during a pandemic, as in the case of COVID-19.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate elective surgical procedures in the inpatient and outpatient ASC setting using currently available administrative claims data. METHODS: We used the 2019 Medicare Point of Service (POS) file to evaluate the geographic distribution of Medicare-certified ASCs in the U.S. To evaluate the volume and scope of elective procedures in the inpatient and outpatient ASC setting, we used the 2016 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) National Inpatient Sample (NIS) and the 2018 California HHS Open Data Portal ambulatory surgery database. HCUP software programs were used to clinically categorize procedures and determine Elixhauser comorbidity profiles for each patient. RESULTS: Among the 8,540 Medicare certified ASCs in 2019, the majority are freestanding (99.5%) and privately owned (92.9%). In the inpatient setting, 13.3% of elective operating room procedures occur in patients without any Elixhauser comorbidities and require < 2 days of hospital stay. However, the types of elective procedures performed in the inpatient setting are different from the types of procedures routinely performed in ASCs.

In this extensive review, we document the most recent information on Coronavirus proteins, with emphasis on the membrane proteins in the Coronaviridae family. We include information on their structures, functions, and participation in pathogenesis. While the shared proteins among the different coronaviruses may vary in structure and function, they all seem to be multifunctional, a common theme interconnecting these viruses. Many transmembrane proteins encoded within the SARS-CoV-2 genome play important roles in the infection cycle while others have functions yet to be understood. We compare the various structural and nonstructural proteins within the Coronaviridae family to elucidate potential overlaps and parallels in function, focusing primarily on the transmembrane proteins and their influences on host membrane arrangements, secretory pathways, cellular growth inhibition, cell death and immune responses during the viral replication cycle. We also offer bioinformatic analyses of potential viroporin activities of the membrane proteins and their sequence similarities to the Envelope (E) protein. In the last major part of the review, we discuss complement, stimulation of inflammation, and immune evasion/suppression that leads to CoV-derived severe disease and mortality. The overall pathogenesis and disease progression of CoVs is put into perspective by indicating several stages in the resulting infection process in which both host and antiviral therapies could be targeted to block the viral cycle.

The aim of our study was to assess the diversity of biofilm formed in different urinary tract diseases and their impact on monocytes adherence and activation. The bacteria were obtained from patients with different kidney problems. Some of the patients were after renal transplantation, some of them were not. Changes in the size and granularity of monocytes, as well as their adherence to biofilm, were assessed using FACSVerse flow cytometer after 1 h co-incubation of monocytes and bacterial biofilm in 37 C. The obtained results were validated against monocytes incubated without bacteria. The isolates from patients with chronic kidney disease formed the most adherent biofilm regardless the presence or absence of inflammatory reaction. Adherence of monocytes also increased during therapy with immunosuppressive agents, but monocytes response was different when cyclosporine or tacrolimus were used. Additionally the presence of inflammatory reaction in patients with kidney disease modified the monocytes response when the immunosuppressive drugs were used. Considering the obtained results, we conclude that the changes of monocytes morphology in response to biofilm formed by Gram negative rods could become a tool to detect urinary tract infection, especially in those groups of patients, where the knowledge of ongoing inflammation is important and the standard tools fail to detect it.","output":"Changes of urine isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae biofilm affect monocytes response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this mixed-methods study, we performed content analysis on openended survey items to reveal primary themes related to how PhD students are responding to the Trump policies and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS)/tRNAPyl pairs are ideal for genetic code expansion and have been extensively engineered for developing mutually orthogonal pairs. Here, we identify two novel wild-type PylRS/tRNAPyl pairs simultaneously present in the deep-rooted extremely halophilic euryarchaeal methanogen Candidatus Methanohalarchaeum thermophilum HMET1, and show that both pairs are functional in the model halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii.

Surprisingly, these two PylRS/tRNAPyl pairs display mutual orthogonality enabled by two unique features, the A73 discriminator base of tRNAPyl2 and a shorter motif 2 loop in PylRS2. In vivo translation experiments show that tRNAPyl2 charging by PylRS2 is defined by the enzyme's shortened motif 2 loop.

Since little is known about empathy and well-being before students enter medical schoolduring pre-medical educationthe main goal of this study is to test a conceptual model of how clinical empathy is related to two indicators of well-being, depression, and burnout among pre-medical students. The theoretical model hypothesizes that three dimensions of clinical empathyPerspective-Taking, Compassionate Care, and Standing in Patients Shoes will be directly and negatively related to depression, as well as indirectly through its inverse relationship with three facets of burnout, Emotional Exhaustion, Poor Academic Efficacy, and Cynicism. METHODS: Using survey data from a sample of 132 pre-medical students at an American Midwestern university, this study employs structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the theoretical model of the relationships between empathy, burnout, and depression among pre-medical students. We identify the direct effects of the three dimensions of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSE-S) on depression (CES-D), as well as the indirect effects of clinical empathy on depression through the three dimensions of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI-S). RESULTS: SEM analyses show that while none of the three dimensions of the JSE-S are directly related to depression, clinical empathy does significantly affect depression indirectly through burnout. Specifically, as predicted, we find that Perspective-Taking decreases Emotional Exhaustion, but, contrary to expectations, Compassionate Care increases it. And, the positive relationship between Compassionate Care and Emotional Exhaustion is particularly strong. In turn, Perspective-Taking and Compassionate Care are associated with depression in opposite directions and to different degrees. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that clinical empathy as measured by the JSE-S produces both positive and negative effects on personal well-being. We conclude that further conceptual clarity of clinical empathy is needed to better discern how the different dimensions impact different indicators of well-being. Given that pre-medical education is a crucial time for emotional socialization, the challenge for medical education will be fostering the positive, cognitive aspects of clinical empathy while simultaneously mitigating the adverse effects of affective empathy on medical student well-being.","output":"The direct and indirect effects of clinical empathy on well-being among pre-medical students: a structural equation model approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Precise tourist arrivals prediction is required since tourism products are perishable and vulnerable to environmental change.

The purpose of this article is to review the spectrum of the various neurological manifestations and underlying associated pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients. Method: We conducted a review of the various case reports and retrospective clinical studies published on the neurological manifestations, associated literature, and related pathophysiology of COVID-19 using PUBMED and subsequent proceedings. A total of 118 articles were thoroughly reviewed in order to highlight the plausible spectrum of neurological manifestations of COVID 19. Every article was either based on descriptive analysis, clinical scenarios, correspondence, and editorials emphasizing the neurological manifestations either directly or indirectly. We then tried to highlight the significant plausible manifestations and complications that could be related to the pandemic. With little known about the dynamics and the presentation spectrum of the virus apart from the respiratory symptoms, this area needs further consideration. Conclusion: The neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 such as Encephalitis, Meningitis, acute cerebrovascular disease, and Guillain Barr Syndrome (GBS) are of great concern. But in the presence of life-threatening abnormal vitals in severely ill COVID-19 patients, these are not usually underscored. There is a need to diagnose these manifestations at the earliest to limit long term sequelae.

The prevalence of VTE in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is unclear. METHODS: Eligible studies on COVID-19 were collected from PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. Patient characteristics and information were extracted for three categories of patients: consecutive, ICU, and non-ICU group. All PEs and DVTs were diagnosed by computed tomographic pulmonary arteriography and duplex ultrasound examination, respectively. A subgroup analysis of testing strategies in ICU and non-ICU patients for PE and DVT was also performed. RESULTS: Forty clinical studies involving 7966 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were included. Pooled VTE prevalence was 13% in consecutive patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05-0.24; I2 = 97%), 7% in non-ICU patients (95% CI, 0.01-0.18; I2 = 93%), and 31% in ICU patients (95% CI, 0.22-0.42; I2 = 91%). ICU patients had the highest prevalence of PE among the three groups (17% [95% CI, 0.12-0.23] vs 8% in consecutive patients [95% CI, 0.04-0.13], 4% in non-ICU patients [95% CI, 0.01-0.08]). ICU patients also had the highest DVT prevalence (25% [95% CI, 0.14-0.37] vs 7% in consecutive patients [95% CI, 0.03-0.14], and 7% in non-ICU [95% CI, 0.02-0.14]). The subgroup analysis showed a three-fold improvement in the PE and DVT detection rates in both ICU and non-ICU patients with COVID-19 when the screening test for VTE was applied. In the settings of screening tests for VTE, ICU patients have a significantly higher prevalence of PE (37% vs 10%; P < .0001) and DVT (40% vs 12%; P = .0065) compared with non-ICU patients.

We have measured the iron and oxygen abundances of of 89 Cepheids in the LMC, one of the anchors of the local Distance Scale, quadrupling the prior sample and including 68 of the 70 Cepheids used to constrain Ho by the SH0ES program. The goal is to constrain the extent to which the Cepheid luminosity is influenced by their chemical composition, an important contributor to the uncertainty on the determination of the Ho itself and a critical factor in the internal consistency of the distance ladder. We have derived stellar parameters and abundances from a self-consistent spectroscopic analysis based on Equivalent Width of absorption lines. The [Fe/H] distribution of LMC Cepheids is a single Gaussian with a mean of -0.4079+-0.003 dex (0.1 dex systematic uncertainty) and sigma 0.076+-0.003 dex. The latter is fully compatible with the measurement error and supports the low dispersion of 0.069 mag seen in the NIR HST LMC period-luminosity relation. The uniformity of the abundance has the important consequence that the LMC Cepheids alone cannot provide any meaningful constraint on the dependence of the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation on chemical composition at any wavelength. This revises a prior claim based on a small sample of 22 LMC Cepheids that there was little dependence (or uncertainty) between composition and NIR luminosity, a conclusion which would produce a conflict between anchors of the distance ladder with different mean abundance. The chemical homogeneity of the LMC Cepheid population makes it an ideal environment to calibrate the metallicity dependence between the more metal poor SMC and metal rich Milky Way and NGC4258.","output":"The iron and oxygen content of LMC Classical Cepheids and its implications for the Extragalactic Distance Scale and Hubble constant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the world economically and medically.

This study's objective was to apply morphoproteomics to pulmonary lung sections from a forensic autopsy of an untreated COVID-19 victim, so that we may better define its biology from the perspective of its interaction with the host and provide options for therapeutic targets. DESIGN: Morphoproteomic analysis from a case study of this COVID-19 pulmonary infection included immunohistochemical probes to detect phosphorylated p-STAT3 (Tyr 705), as part of the interleukin (IL)-6 pathway; cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes, Programmed Death (PD)-1 receptor+ lymphoid cells, CD56+ NK lymphoid cells, CD163+ (M2 polarized monocytes/macrophages), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression as part of the host response to interaction with the COVID-19 virus. RESULTS: Representative sections of the COVID-19 victim's lung showed: nuclear expression of p-STAT3 (Tyr 705) in many of the alveolar pneumocytes and in occasional endothelial cells; COX-2 expression in the alveolar pneumocytes; a relative paucity of CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes; absence of CD56+ NK lymphoid cells; abundance of intra-alveolar and alveolar interstitial CD163+ macrophages/monocytes; PD-L1 expression on occasional macrophages, focally on collections of alveolar pneumocytes, and on cells in the alveolar interstitium; and rare PD-1+ lymphocytes in similar regions as CD8+ lymphocytes. CONCLUSION: Morphoproteomics and microanatomical features coincide with the etiopathogenic features of pulmonary coronavirus infection and the host response.

RESULTS: 113 COVID-19 survivors were included (mild/moderate 47, severe/critical 66). We confirmed several comorbidities as risk factors for severe/critical disease. Severe/critical disease was associated with impaired pulmonary function, i.e. diffusing capacity (DLCO) %-predicted, reduced 6-MWD, and exercise-induced oxygen desaturation. After adjustment for potential confounding by age, sex, and BMI, patients after severe/critical COVID-19 had a 20.9 (95% CI 12.4-29.4, p=0.01) lower DLCO %-predicted at follow up.

Specifically, we utilize time-sensitive, representative survey evidence from eight Western democracies to examine the extent to which people (1) find it justified to condemn those who do not keep a distance to others in public and (2) blame ordinary citizens for the severity of the pandemic. The results demonstrate that physical distancing has indeed become a moral issue in most countries in the early phases of the pandemic. Furthermore, we identify the most important predictors of moralization to be age, behavioral change, social trust, and trust in the government. Except for minor differences, this pattern is observed within all countries in the sample. While moralization was high during the first wave of the pandemic, temporal analyses also indicate that moralization is lower in the second wave of the pandemic, potentially making it more difficult to engage in sufficient behavioral changes.","output":"Moralizing Physical Distancing during the COVID-19 Pandemic -- Personal Motivations Predict Moral Condemnation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is posing a great threat to global health and economy. Due to the lack of broad diagnostic setup, consistent reagent supply lines, and access to laboratory instruments and equipment, it is undoubtedly an enormous burden for developing countries to face the crisis. OBJECTIVES: To develop a cost-effective, reliable and sensitive multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 screening which would expand the testing capacities of a developing and low-income country like Bangladesh. STUDY DESIGN: Initially a singleplex and then a multiplex real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR assays were developed targeting 2 nucleocapsid genes of SARS-CoV-2, and the human RNase P gene as an internal control using laboratory-made mastermixes. Three sets of primer- probes were designed for each of the target genes and one set was optimized for the final reaction set-up. Limit of detection, cross-reactivity and reproducibility were checked in order to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the assays, and validation was done using clinical specimens. RESULTS: Clinical evaluation of the new assays using 240 nasopharyngeal swabs showed 100 % sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in human. Equal efficiency and concordant results were observed between the singleplex and multiplex approaches. Notably, the kit was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA at very low concentration upto 5 copies/reaction. CONCLUSION: This is the first locally developed multiplex rRT-PCR kit in Bangladesh providing rapid and low-cost screening of COVID-19 which would be valuable for infection prevention and clinical management in the perspective of Bangladesh.","output":"Development and performance evaluation of the first in-house multiplex rRT-PCR assay in Bangladesh for highly sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Informal workers produce economic, social, and environmental value for cities. Too often, policy elites, including those promoting sustainable cities, overlook this value, proposing formalization and relying on deficit-based framings of informal work. In this perspective piece, we bring critical research and community-produced knowledge about informal work to sustainability scholarship. We challenge the dominant, deficit-based frame of informal work, which can dispossess workers, reduce their collective power, and undercut the social and environmental value their work generates. Instead, thinking historically, relationally, and spatially clarifies the essential role of informal work for urban economies and highlights their potential for promoting sustainable cities. It also reveals how growth-oriented economies reproduce environmental destruction, income inequality, and poverty, the very conditions impelling many to informal work. Rather than formalization, we propose reparation, an ethic and practice promoting ecological regeneration, while redressing historic wrongs and redistributing resources and social power to workers and grassroots social movements.","output":"Informal Work and Sustainable Cities: From Formalization to Reparation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic raises significance for a potential influenza therapeutic compound, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), which has been extensively used in personal care products as a positively-charged quaternary ammonium antibacterial agent. CPC is currently in clinical trials to assess its effects on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) morbidity. Two published studies have provided mouse and human data indicating that CPC may alleviate influenza infection, and here we show that CPC (0.1 M, 1 h) reduces zebrafish mortality and viral load following influenza infection. However, CPC mechanisms of action upon viral-host cell interaction are currently unknown. We have utilized super-resolution fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy to probe the mode of CPC action. Reduction in density of influenza viral protein hemagglutinin (HA) clusters is known to reduce influenza infectivity: here, we show that CPC (at non-cytotoxic doses, 5C10 M) reduces HA density and number of HA molecules per cluster within the plasma membrane of NIH-3 T3 mouse fibroblasts. HA is known to colocalize with the negatively-charged mammalian lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)); here, we show that nanoscale co-localization of HA with the PIP(2)-binding Pleckstrin homology (PH) reporter in the plasma membrane is diminished by CPC. CPC also dramatically displaces the PIP(2)-binding protein myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) from the plasma membrane of rat RBL-2H3 mast cells; this disruption of PIP(2) is correlated with inhibition of mast cell degranulation. Together, these findings offer a PIP(2)-focused mechanism underlying CPC disruption of influenza and suggest potential pharmacological use of this drug as an influenza therapeutic to reduce global deaths from viral disease.","output":"Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) reduces zebrafish mortality from influenza infection: Super-resolution microscopy reveals CPC interference with multiple protein interactions with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in immune function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indonesia is prone to natural hazards, which have continued to occur even during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Cohen et al., 2020). Here, we consider what we believe to be the especially confused and confusing case of the ageing of the human immune system, commonly referred to as \\"immunosenescence\\". But what exactly is meant by this term? It has been used loosely in the literature, resulting in a certain degree of confusion as to its definition and implications. Here, we argue that only those differences in immune parameters between younger and older adults that are associated in some definitive manner with detrimental health outcomes and/or impaired survival prospects should be classed as indicators of immunosenescence in the strictest sense of the word, and that in humans we know remarkably little about their identity. Such biomarkers of immunosenescence may nonetheless indicate beneficial effects in other contexts, consistent with the notion of antagonistic pleiotropy. Identifying what could be true immunosenescence in this respect requires examining: (1) what appears to correlate with age, though generality across human populations is not yet confirmed; (2) what clearly is part of a suite of canonical changes in the immune system that happen with age; (3) which subset of those changes accelerates rather than slows aging; and (4) all changes, potentially population-specific, that accelerate agig.

In this review, we discuss physiological function of lysosomes and, more importantly, how the homeostasis of lysosomes is disrupted in several diseases, including atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune disorders, pancreatitis, lysosomal storage disorders, and malignant tumors. In atherosclerosis and Gaucher disease, dysfunction of lysosomes changes cytokine secretion from macrophages, partially through inflammasome activation. In neurodegenerative diseases, defect autophagy facilitates accumulation of toxic protein and dysfunctional organelles leading to neuron death. Lysosomal dysfunction has been demonstrated in pathology of pancreatitis. Abnormal autophagy activation or inhibition has been revealed in autoimmune disorders. In tumor microenvironment, malignant phenotypes, including tumorigenesis, growth regulation, invasion, drug resistance, and radiotherapy resistance, of tumor cells and behaviors of tumor-associated macrophages, fibroblasts, dendritic cells, and T cells are also mediated by lysosomes. Based on these findings, a series of therapeutic methods targeting lysosomal proteins and processes have been developed from bench to bedside.

Subjects and Methods: Data on confirmed cases and number of deaths due to coronavirus infection were retrieved from the WHO as on 30 March 2020, and examined for the various income level countries, per the World Bank criteria. The CFR was calculated country-wise and estimated for the various groups such as low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income, and the data was analyzed. RESULTS: The overall CFR for the high income countries was 5.0%, compared with a CFR of 2.8% for low-income countries. The upper-middle-income countries showed a CFR of 4.3%, while the lower-middle-income countries stood at 3.7%. The results from our study predict that the maximum CFR in high-income countries will be contained at approximately 5% (95% CI). The CFR for the low, lower-middle, and upper-middle-income countries will range between 2.8 and 4.3% (95% CI).

The Weight Achievement and Intensive Treatment (Why WAIT) program is a 12-week multidisciplinary weight management program that has been implemented in real-world clinical practice since 2005 and has shown long-term maintenance of weight reduction for 5 and 10 years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the program went virtual using telemedicine and mobile health applications. AIMS: This retrospective pilot study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a virtual model of an already established and successful in-person program for diabetes and weight management since 2005. METHODS: We evaluated 38 patients with diabetes and obesity enrolled in the Why WAIT program between February 2019 and December 2020. Sixteen participants were enrolled in virtual program (VP) and were compared with 22 participants who completed the latest two physical programs (PPs) before COVID-19. We evaluated changes in body weight, A1C, blood pressure (BP), and lipid profile after 12 weeks of ILI. RESULTS: Body weight decreased by ?7.4  3.6 kg from baseline in VP compared with ?6.8  3.5 kg in PP (p = 0.6 between groups). A1C decreased by ?1.03%  1.1% from baseline in VP, and by ?1.0%  1.2% in PP (p = 0.9 between groups).

Such molecules are being prepared for therapeutic use as broad-spectrum pharmacological agents.

The aim of the current study was to assess whether the discontinuation from a systematic intradialytic exercise training program will affect aspects of health-related QoL and functional capacity in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Seventeen hemodialysis patients (12 Males/5 Females, age 60.8  13.6 year) participated in this study. Patients were assessed for functional capacity using various functional capacity tests while QoL, daily sleepiness, sleep quality, depression and fatigue were assessed using validated questionnaires at the end of a 12-month aerobic exercise program and after 12 months of detraining. RESULTS: The detraining significantly reduced patients' QoL score by 20% (P = 0.01). More affected were aspects related to the physical component summary of the QoL (P < 0.001) rather than those related to the mental one (P = 0.096). In addition, the performance in the functional capacity tests was reduced (P < 0.05), while sleep quality (P = 0.020) and daily sleepiness scores (P = 0.006) were significantly worse after the detraining period.

Due to the dynamic development of infections and the time lag between when patients are infected and when a proportion of them enters an intensive care unit (ICU), the need for future intensive care can easily be underestimated. To infer future ICU load from reported infections, we suggest a simple statistical model that (1) accounts for time lags and (2) allows for making predictions depending on different future growth of infections. We have evaluated our model for three regions, namely Berlin (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), and Madrid (Spain). Before extensive containment measures made an impact, we first estimate the region-specific model parameters. Whereas for Berlin, an ICU rate of 6%, a time lag of 6 days, and an average stay of 12 days in ICU provide the best fit of the data, for Lombardy and Madrid the ICU rate was higher (18% and 15%) and the time lag (0 and 3 days) and the average stay (4 and 8 days) in ICU shorter. The region-specific models are then used to predict future ICU load assuming either a continued exponential phase with varying growth rates (0-15%) or linear growth. Thus, the model can help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU capacity. Although our predictions are based on small data sets and disregard non-stationary dynamics, our model is simple, robust, and can be used in early phases of the disease when data are scarce.","output":"Covid-19 -- A simple statistical model for predicting ICU load in early phases of the disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Doctors commonly continue to work when they are unwell.

Point-of-Care ultrasound (POCUS) scanning, becoming one of the primary determinative methods for its diagnosis and staging, requires, however, close contact of healthcare workers with patients, therefore increasing the risk of infection. This work thus proposes an autonomous robotic solution that enables POCUS scanning of COVID-19 patients' lungs for diagnosis and staging. An algorithm was developed for approximating the optimal position of an ultrasound probe on a patient from prior CT scans to reach predefined lung infiltrates. In the absence of prior CT scans, a deep learning method was developed for predicting 3D landmark positions of a human ribcage given a torso surface model. The landmarks, combined with the surface model, are subsequently used for estimating optimal ultrasound probe position on the patient for imaging infiltrates. These algorithms, combined with a force-displacement profile collection methodology, enabled the system to successfully image all points of interest in a simulated experimental setup with an average accuracy of 20.6 +/- 14.7 mm using prior CT scans, and 19.8 +/- 16.9 mm using only ribcage landmark estimation. A study on a full torso ultrasound phantom showed that autonomously acquired ultrasound images were 100% interpretable when using force feedback with prior CT and 88% with landmark estimation, compared to 75 and 58% without force feedback, respectively.

At multivariate regression analyses, in the linear model, the Med-Diet score negatively correlated with both TxB(2) (Beta = ?0.106; p = 0.009) and Pro-C3 (Beta = ?0.121; p = 0.002) and in the logistic model high adherence inversely correlated with higher TxB(2) tertiles (II tertile: OR = 0.576, p = 0.044; III tertile: OR = 0.556, p = 0.026) and Pro-C3 tertile (III tertile: OR = 0.488, p = 0.013). Low consumption of red meat inversely correlated with higher TxB(2) tertile (II tertile: OR = 0.448, p < 0.001, III tertile: OR = 0.567, p = 0.004). In conclusion, NAFLD patients with high adherence to the Med-Diet show lower PA and liver collagen deposition, suggesting a protective role of the Med-Diet against NAFLD progression and cardiovascular risk. In addition, the correlation between TxB(2) and Pro-C3 suggests a link between NAFLD severity and cardiovascular risk.","output":"High Compliance to Mediterranean Diet Associates with Lower Platelet Activation and Liver Collagen Deposition in Patients with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With crises including devastating weather and climate disasters, scientists have an important role to play in decision-making.

With the world still gripped by the coronavirus, with devastating weather and climate disasters, and with attacks on science being spread through disinformation campaigns, there has never been a greater need for scientific engagement with public policy. Leaders in the scientific community are calling for better ways to incorporate science into decision-making during periods of crisis and beyond. Despite the challenges, these leaders are cautiously optimistic that science can have a meaningful seat at the table and that it can play an integral and balanced role in decision-making for government leaders and in informing the general public. Some of the optimism stems from the promises of the Biden administration to restore scientific integrity to federal policymaking.

Along with small size vanadium complexes a vanadium-containing derivative of the peptide-like inhibitor N3 (N-[(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)carbonyl]alanyl-l-valyl-N1-((1R,2Z)-4-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-1-{[(3R)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl] methyl }but-2-enyl)-l-leucinamide) was designed from the crystal structure with PDB entry code 6LU7. On theoretical grounds our consensus docking studies evaluated the binding affinities at the hitherto known binding site of Mpro for binding vanadium complexes. The site is an evolutionarily fold unit which is structurally conserved among proteins belonging to the same enzyme class (EC 3). The highly conserved sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro has a Cys-His dyad at the catalytic site that are characteristic of metal-dependent or metal-inhibited hydrolases. Therefore, Mpro was superimposed to the human protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (hPTP1B) which is a key regulator at an early stage in the signalling cascade of the insulin hormone for glucose uptake into cells. Comparatively, the vanadium-ligand binding site of hPTP1B is located in a larger groove on the surface of Mpro. Vanadium constitutes a well-known phosphate analogue. Hence, its study offers possibilities to design promising vanadium-containing binders to SARS-CoV-2. Given the favourable physicochemical properties of vanadium nuclei, such organic vanadium complexes could become drugs not only for pharmacotherapy but also diagnostic tools for early infection detection in patients. This work presents the in silico design of a potential lead vanadium compound. It was tested along with 20 other vanadium-containing complexes from the literature in a virtual screening test by docking against the inhibition of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Are vanadium complexes druggable against the main protease mpro of sars-cov-2? - a computational approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"3a is an accessory protein from SARS coronavirus that is known to play a significant role in the proliferation of the virus by forming tetrameric ion channels. Although the monomeric units are known to consist of three transmembrane (TM) domains, there are no solved structures available for the complete monomer. The present study proposes a structural model for the transmembrane region of the monomer by employing our previously tested approach, which predicts potential orientations of TM -helices by minimizing the unfavorable contact surfaces between the different TM domains. The best model structure comprising all three -helices has been subjected to MD simulations to examine its quality. The TM bundle was found to form a compact and stable structure with significant intermolecular interactions. The structural features of the proposed model of 3a account for observations from previous experimental investigations on the activity of the protein. Further analysis indicates that residues from the TM2 and TM3 domains are likely to line the pore of the ion channel, which is in good agreement with a recent experimental study. In the absence of an experimental structure for the protein, the proposed structure can serve as a useful model for inferring structure-function relationships about the protein.

Using this test, we observed a similar mean magnitude of T cell responses between the vaccinees and SARS-CoV-2 convalescents 3 months after vaccination or virus priming. However, a wide heterogeneity of the magnitude of spike-specific T cell responses characterized the individual responses, irrespective of the time of analysis. The magnitude of these spike-specific T cell responses cannot be predicted from the neutralizing antibody levels.

In an effort to control COVID-19 transmission in the UK, schools were closed on 23 March 2020. With social distancing in place, Primary Schools were partially re-opened on 1 June 2020, with plans to fully re-open in September 2020. The impact of social distancing and risk mitigation measures on childrens contact patterns is not known. Methods We conducted a structured expert elicitation of a sample of Primary Headteachers to quantify contact patterns within schools in pre-COVID-19 times and how these patterns were expected to change upon re-opening. Point estimates with uncertainty were determined by a formal performance-based algorithm. Additionally, we surveyed school Headteachers about risk mitigation strategies and their anticipated effectiveness. Results Expert elicitation provides estimates of contact patterns that are consistent with contact surveys. We report mean number of contacts per day for four cohorts within schools along with a range at 90% confidence for the variations of contacts among individuals. Prior to lockdown, we estimate that, mean numbers per day, younger children (Reception and Year 1) made 15 contacts [range 8..35] within school, older children (Year 6) 18 contacts [range 5..55], teaching staff 25 contacts [range 4..55) and non-classroom staff 11 contacts [range 2..27]. Compared to pre-COVID times, after schools re-opened the mean number of contacts were reduced by about 53% for young children, about 62% for older children, about 60% for classroom staff and about 64% for other staff. Contacts between teaching and non-teaching staff reduced by 80%, which is consistent with other independent estimates. The distributions of contacts per person are asymmetric indicating a heavy tail of individuals with high contact numbers. Conclusions We interpret the reduction in childrens contacts as a consequence of efforts to reduce mixing with interventions such as forming groups of children (bubbles) who are organized to learn together to limit contacts. Distributions of contacts for children and adults can be used to inform COVID-19 transmission modelling. Our findings suggest that while official DfE guidelines form the basis for risk mitigation in schools, individual schools have adopted their own bespoke strategies, often going beyond the guidelines.","output":"A novel approach for evaluating contact patterns and risk mitigation strategies for COVID-19 in English Primary Schools with application of Structured Expert Judgement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated policy effects on global tourism performance.

The objective of this study was to describe the sensitivity of case ascertainment and the completeness of person-level data received by CDC through national COVID-19 case surveillance. METHODS: We compared case and death counts from case surveillance data with aggregate counts received by CDC during April 5-September 30, 2020. We analyzed case surveillance data to describe geographic and temporal trends in data completeness for selected variables, including demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, and outcomes. RESULTS: As of November 18, 2020, national COVID-19 case surveillance data received by CDC during April 5-September 30, 2020, included 4 990 629 cases and 141 935 deaths, representing 72.7% of the volume of cases (n = 6 863 251) and 71.8% of the volume of deaths (n = 197 756) in aggregate counts. Nationally, completeness in case surveillance records was highest for age (99.9%) and sex (98.8%). Data on race/ethnicity were complete for 56.9% of cases; completeness varied by region.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no head-to-head comparison of this has been performed so far.Methods: In a screening setting for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients, 496 patients were tested using RT-PCR as well as a single AGT.

We aimed to assess the ability of transcriptomic biomarkers to identify naturally acquired respiratory viral infection before typical symptoms are present. METHODS: In this index-cluster study, we prospectively recruited a cohort of undergraduate students (aged 18C25 years) at Duke University (Durham, NC, USA) over a period of 5 academic years. To identify index cases, we monitored students for the entire academic year, for the presence and severity of eight symptoms of respiratory tract infection using a daily web-based survey, with symptoms rated on a scale of 0C4. Index cases were defined as individuals who reported a 6-point increase in cumulative daily symptom score. Suspected index cases were visited by study staff to confirm the presence of reported symptoms of illness and to collect biospecimen samples. We then identified clusters of close contacts of index cases (ie, individuals who lived in close proximity to index cases, close friends, and partners) who were presumed to be at increased risk of developing symptomatic respiratory tract infection while under observation. We monitored each close contact for 5 days for symptoms and viral shedding and measured transcriptomic responses at each timepoint each day using a blood-based 36-gene RT-PCR assay. FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2009, and April 10, 2015, we enrolled 1465 participants. Of 264 index cases with respiratory tract infection symptoms, 150 (57%) had a viral cause confirmed by RT-PCR. Of their 555 close contacts, 106 (19%) developed symptomatic respiratory tract infection with a proven viral cause during the observation window, of whom 60 (57%) had the same virus as their associated index case. Nine viruses were detected in total. The transcriptomic assay accurately predicted viral infection at the time of maximum symptom severity (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 094 [95% CI 092C096]), as well as at 1 day (087 [95% CI 084C090]), 2 days (085 [082C088]), and 3 days (074 [071C077]) before peak illness, when symptoms were minimal or absent and 22 (62%) of 35 individuals, 25 (69%) of 36 individuals, and 24 (82%) of 29 individuals, respectively, had no detectable viral shedding. INTERPRETATION: Transcriptional biomarkers accurately predict and diagnose infection across diverse viral causes and stages of disease and thus might prove useful for guiding the administration of early effective therapy, quarantine decisions, and other clinical and public health interventions in the setting of endemic and pandemic infectious diseases.

Then, the actual data for each country were fitted to a regression model utilizing the excel solver software to assess the current and future trajectory of novel COVID-19 and its impact. In addition, the data were fitted using the SusceptibleCInfectedCRecovered (SIR) Model. The Group A trajectory showed an S shape trend that suited a logistic function with r(2) > 0.97, which is an indication of the outbreak control. The SIR models for the countries in this group showed that they passed the expected 99% end of pandemic dates. Group B, however, exhibited a continuous increase of the total COVID-19 new cases, that best suited an exponential growth model with r(2) > 0.97, which meant that the outbreak is still uncontrolled. The SIR models for the countries in this group showed that they are still relatively far away from reaching the expected 97% end of pandemic dates.

Formidable challenges limit precautionary measures which were instituted by the government to curb the pandemic. Insufficient COVID-19 testing laboratories, limited medical and personal protective equipment, and an inadequate number of health workers leave the country ill-equipped in the fight against the pandemic. Lack of assistance from the government to those who lost their jobs due to lockdown forced these individuals to go outside to find provisions, thus increasing the spread of the virus. Moreover, the fragile healthcare system is overburdened by civil conflicts and other epidemics and endemics amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The conflicts have led to thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of displacements and deprived many people of basic health services. The 11th outbreak of Ebola has been increasing at an alarming pace, and it is expected to soar because of a shortfall of funds and insufficient numbers of health workers. The DRC with the cooperation of regional powers needs to address these challenges in a manner similar to that used in the previous Ebola epidemics. Moreover, the government should have a balance in shifting the available resources between COVID-19 and other diseases.

It is critically important to understand the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of COVID-19 vaccines among IC populations as recommendations are updated over time in response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. AREAS COVERED: A targeted literature review was conducted to identify real-world studies that assessed COVID-19 VE in IC populations between December 2020 and September 2021. A total of 10 studies from four countries were identified and summarized in this review. EXPERT OPINION: VE of the widely available COVID-19 vaccines, including BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen), and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford/AstraZeneca), ranged from 64% to 90% against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 73% to 84% against symptomatic illness, 70% to 100% against severe illness, and 63% to 100% against COVID-19-related hospitalization among the fully vaccinated IC populations included in the studies. COVID-19 VE for most outcomes in the IC populations included in these studies were lower than in the general populations. These findings provide preliminary evidence that the IC population requires greater protective measures to prevent COVID-19 infection and associated illness, hence should be prioritized while implementing recommendations of additional COVID-19 vaccine doses.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness among immunocompromised populations: a targeted literature review of real-world studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this consensus statement, we provide updated recommendations on multiple sclerosis (MS) management during the COVID-19 crisis and the post-pandemic period applicable to neurology services around the world.

However, to date, their replication mechanisms and zoonotic potential have not been explored in detail. The NS3/4A serine protease of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is critical for cleavage of the viral polyprotein. It also cleaves the cellular innate immune adaptor MAVS, thus decreasing interferon (IFN) production and contributing to HCV persistence in the human host. To investigate the conservation of fundamental aspects of the hepaciviral life cycle, we explored if MAVS cleavage and suppression of innate immune signaling represent a common mechanism employed across different clades of the genus Hepacivirus to enhance viral replication. To estimate the zoonotic potential of these nonhuman hepaciviruses, we assessed if their NS3/4A proteases were capable of cleaving human MAVS. NS3/4A proteases of viruses infecting colobus monkeys, rodents, horses, and cows cleaved the MAVS proteins of their cognate hosts and interfered with the ability of MAVS to induce the IFN- promoter. All NS3/4A proteases from nonhuman viruses readily cleaved human MAVS. Thus, NS3/4A-dependent cleavage of MAVS is a conserved replication strategy across multiple clades within the genus Hepacivirus Human MAVS is susceptible to cleavage by these nonhuman viral proteases, indicating that it does not pose a barrier for zoonotic transmission of these viruses to humans. IMPORTANCE Virus infection is recognized by cellular sensor proteins triggering innate immune signaling and antiviral defenses. While viruses have evolved strategies to thwart these antiviral programs in their cognate host species, these evasion mechanisms are often ineffective in a novel host, thus limiting viral transmission across species. HCV, the best-characterized member of the genus Hepacivirus within the family Flaviviridae, uses its NS3/4A protease to disrupt innate immune signaling by cleaving the cellular adaptor protein MAVS. Recently, a large number of HCV-related viruses have been discovered in various animal species, including wild, livestock, and companion animals. We show that the NS3/4A proteases of these hepaciviruses from different animals and representing various clades of the genus cleave their cognate host MAVS proteins in addition to human MAVS. Therefore, cleavage of MAVS is a common strategy of hepaciviruses, and human MAVS is likely unable to limit replication of these nonhuman viruses upon zoonotic exposure.","output":"Hepacivirus NS3/4A Proteases Interfere with MAVS Signaling in both Their Cognate Animal Hosts and Humans: Implications for Zoonotic Transmission."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has created a significant change in the demand and buying behavior of consumers.

Recombinant uricase is increasingly being used to treat refractory gout; however, the immunogenicity of uricase-based therapies has limited the use of these biologic therapies. Antidrug antibodies against biologic therapies, including uricase and PEGylated uricase, can lead to loss of urate-lowering response, increased risk of infusion reactions, and subsequent treatment failure. However, co-therapy with an immunomodulator can attenuate antidrug antibody development, potentially increasing the likelihood of sustained urate lowering, therapy course completion, and successful treatment outcomes.

However, concerns have been raised regarding the pandemics impact and associated containment measures (e.g. curfew, lockdown) on non-COVID-19-related acute medical diseases. Objectives: To investigate changes in the incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the period prior to the pandemic and reference periods in previous years. Methods: In this single-center study, we explored all diagnostic imaging tests performed for suspected PE between week 1-17 of the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Incidence of PE (i.e. primary outcome) was analyzed. Secondary outcomes included number of imaging tests for suspected PE. Results: Compared to week 1-11, 2020, an abrupt decline in PE diagnosis (mean weekly rate: 5.2 [95%CI: 3.8-6.6] vs. 1.8 [0.0-3.6]) and imaging tests (32.5 [27.5-37.6] vs. 17.3 [11.6-23.1]) was observed from week 12, with beginning of the containment measures and public lockdown in Austria. Compared to week 12-17 of 2018 and 2019, PE incidence and imaging tests were similarly decreased from 5.3 [3.6-7.1] to 1.8 [0.0-3.6] and 31.5 [27.1-35.9] to 17.3 [11.6-23.1]), respectively. The median (IQR) sPESI score of PE patients during the pandemic was higher than in all other PE patients (3 [1-3] vs. 1 [0-2]; p=0.002).

All patients were followed for 11228 days after the second dose. At the end of follow-up we measured humoral response to SARS-CoV2 by assessing total antibody levels to the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV2 spike (S) protein using anti-RBD immunoassay. Anti-S antibody serum levels 250 BAU/mL were considered protective. At the same time, cellular response was measured by the IFN- response to S-peptide stimulation of recipient T lymphocyte populations. Protective cellular response was defined as more than 0,3% of IFN- responsive T cells. Results Of 54 recipients, 44 (81%) were male with a mean age of 638 years and a mean time from transplantation of 6.64.0 years.

Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and the World Health Organization's Global COVID-19 Database were searched up to August 23, 2020 with no restrictions on study design, language, or geographical, following an a priori protocol (https://osf.io/4dxms/). Data were synthesized using descriptive statistics from the peer-reviewed literature and the National Quality Forum's (NQF) framework for telemental health. Sentiment analysis was also used to gauge patient and healthcare provider opinion toward telemental health. Results: After screening, we identified 196 articles, predominantly from high-income countries (36.22%). Most articles were classified as commentaries (51.53%) and discussed telemental health from a management standpoint (86.22%). Conditions commonly treated with telemental health were depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. Where data were available, most articles described telemental health in a home-based setting (use of telemental health at home by patients).

All efforts to contain the pathogenesis either using inhibitory drugs or vaccines largelyremained futile due to a lack of better understanding of the genomic feature of this virus. In thepresent study, we compared the 2019-nCoV with other coronaviruses, which indicated that batSARS like coronavirus could be a probable ancestor of the novel coronavirus. The proteinsequence similarity of pangolin-hCoV and bat-hCoV with human coronavirus was higher ascompared to their nucleotide similarity denoting the occurrence of more synonymous mutationsin the genome. Phylogenetic and alignment analysis of 591 novel coronaviruses of differentclades from Group I to Group V revealed several mutations and concomitant amino acidchanges. Detailed investigation on nucleotide substitution unfolded 100 substitutions in thecoding region of which 43 were synonymous and 57 were of non-synonymous type. The nonsynonymous substitutions resulting into 57 amino acid changes were found to be distributed overdifferent hCoV proteins with maximum on spike protein. An important di-amino acid change RGto KR was observed in ORF9 protein. Additionally, several interesting features of the novelcoronavirus genome have been highlighted in respect to various other human infecting viruseswhich may explain extreme pathogenicity, infectivity and simultaneously the reason behindfailure of the antiviral therapies. SUMMARY: This study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV2 isolates to understand discrete mutations that are occurring between patient samples. The analysis unravel various amino acid mutations in the viral proteins which may provide an explanation for varying treatment efficacies of different inhibitory drugs and a future direction towards a combinatorial treatment therapies based on the kind of mutation in the viral genome.","output":"Investigating the genomic landscape of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to identify non-synonymous mutations for use in diagnosis and drug design."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herein, we report the synthesis of novel selenocyanates and assessment of their effect on the oxidative challenge elicited by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in cultured mouse neurons.

Catalytic microtubes play simultaneous roles of the oxygen bubble producing microreactors and oxygen bubble-driven micropumps. An autonomous pumping of peroxide fuel takes place through the microtubes by the recoiling microbubbles. Due to optimal reactionCdiffusion processes, gas supersaturation, leading to favorable bubble nucleation conditions, strain-engineered catalytic microtubes with longer length produce oxygen microbubbles at concentrations of hydrogen peroxide in approximately 1000 lower in comparison to shorter tubes. Dynamic regimes of tubular nanomembrane-based oxygen microbubble generators reveal that this depends on microtubes aspect ratio, hydrogen peroxide fuel concentration and fuel compositions. Different dynamic regimes exist, which produce specific bubble frequencies, bubble size and various amounts of oxygen. In this study, the rolled-up Ti/Cr/Pd microtubes integrated on silicon substrate are used to study oxygen evolution in different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and surfactants. Addition of Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactants leads to a decrease of bubble diameter and an increase of frequencies of bubble recoil. Moreover, an increase of temperature (from 10 to 35 C) leads to higher frequencies of oxygen bubbles and larger total volumes of produced oxygen.","output":"Parameters Optimization of Catalytic Tubular Nanomembrane-Based Oxygen Microbubble Generator"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gaseous emission, particulate emission, biological molecules and other harmful substances discharge into the atmosphere from dumpsite environment.

Mixed findings largely dependent on the age of the examined cohorts have been reported during the preclinical, asymptomatic disease stage. In the present study, our aim was to examine the association of midlife dementia risk with brain macrostructural alterations. METHODS: Structural 3T MRI scans were acquired for 647 cognitively normal middle-aged (40-59 years old) participants in the PREVENT-Dementia study. Cortical thickness, volumes of subcortical structures, the hippocampus and hippocampal subfields were quantified using Freesurfer version 7.1. The clarity of the hippocampal molecular layer was evaluated based on T2-weighted hippocampal scans. Associations of structural measures with apolipoprotein ?4 (APOE4) genotype and dementia family history (FHD), were investigated using linear regression. Correlations between the CAIDE dementia risk score (incorporating information about blood pressure, cholesterol, physical activity, body mass index, education, age and sex) and structural measures were further investigated. RESULTS: A higher CAIDE score was associated with thinner cortex and a larger hippocampal fissure. APOE4 genotype was associated with reduced molecular layer clarity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a higher CAIDE score is associated with widespread cortical thinning. Conversely, APOE4 carriers and participants with FHD do not demonstrate prominent macrostructural alterations at this age range.

The effects of work-related stress can be distinguished in those that affect workers (e.g., depression and anxiety) and those that affect the company (e.g., absenteeism and productivity). It is possible to distinguish two types of prevention interventions. Individual interventions aim at promoting coping and individual resilience strategies with the aim of modifying cognitive assessments of the potential stressor, thus reducing its negative impact on health. Mindfulness techniques have been found to be effective stress management tools that are also useful in dealing with stressful events in the workplace. Organizational interventions modify the risk factors connected to the context and content of the work. It was found that a restorative workplace (i.e., with natural elements) reduces stress and fatigue, improving work performance. Furthermore, practicing mindfulness in nature helps to improve the feeling of wellbeing and to relieve stress.

Methods A total of 272 healthcare workers were initially evaluated for long-term vaccine safety and immunogenicity. We further established a vaccinee panel to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity against variants of concern (VOCs), including the Omicron variants, using a live virus microneutralization assay. Findings Two-dose vaccination induced robust anti-spike antibodies and neutralization titers (NTs) against the ancestral strain WK-521, whereas NTs against VOCs were significantly lower. Within 93C247 days of the second vaccine dose, NTs against Omicron were completely abolished in up to 80% of individuals in the vaccinee panel. Booster dose induced a robust increase in anti-spike antibodies and NTs against the WK-521, Delta, and Omicron variants. There were no significant differences in the neutralization ability of sera from boosted individuals among the Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2. Boosting increased the breadth of humoral immunity and cross-reactivity with Omicron without changes in cytokine signatures and adverse event rate.

The simultaneous infection of a single individual by two distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages may impact COVID-19 disease progression and provides a window of opportunity for viral recombination and the emergence of new lineages with differential phenotype. Several hundred SARS-CoV-2 lineages are currently well phylogenetically defined, but two main factors have precluded major coinfection/codetection and recombination analysis thus far: (i) the low diversity of SARS-CoV-2 lineages during the first year of the pandemic, which limited the identification of lineage defining mutations necessary to distinguish coinfecting/recombining viral lineages; and the (ii) limited availability of raw sequencing data where abundance and distribution of intrasample/intrahost variability can be accessed. Here, we assembled a large sequencing dataset from Brazilian samples covering a period of 18 May 2020 to 30 April 2021 and probed it for unexpected patterns of high intrasample/intrahost variability.

PATIENTS: Consecutive COVID-19 patients supported in the ICU during the first pandemic wave. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory values, and outcome data were retrieved after ethical approval and data-sharing agreements. Descriptive statistics were performed to investigate country-related practice variation. From March 2, 2020, to August 12, 2020, 551 patients were admitted. Mean age was 65.4  11.2 years, and 29% were female. At admission, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores were 15.0  5.5, 16.8  5.5, and 15.8  5.3 (p = 0.002), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were 4.4  2.7, 7.4  2.2, and 7.7  3.2 (p < 0.001) in the Belgian, Dutch, and German parts of Euregio, respectively.

The hypothesis was that older age, greater body mass index (BMI), and female sex would lead to inferior outcomes. Study Design Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods Patients were selected by combining 5 randomized controlled trials from 2 different centers in Sweden. Functional outcomes were assessed using validated heel-rise tests (height, number of repetitions, total work, and concentric power) for muscular endurance and strength, and the relationship between injured and uninjured legs was calculated as the limb symmetry index (LSI). Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the ATRS. All outcomes were collected at the 1-year follow-up. Independent predictors included were patient sex, smoking, BMI, age, and surgical versus nonsurgical treatment. Results Of the 391 included patients, 307 (79%) were treated surgically. The LSI of heel-rise height at the 1-year follow-up decreased by approximately 4% for every 10-year increment in age (beta, -3.94 [95% CI, -6.19 to -1.69]; P = .0006). In addition, every 10-year increment in age resulted in a 1.79-fold increase in the odds of being in the lowest 10% of the LSI of heel-rise height. Moreover, a nonsignificant superior LSI of heel-rise height was found in patients treated surgically compared with nonsurgical treatment (beta, -4.49 [95% CI, -9.14 to 0.16]; P = .058). No significant predictor was related to the ATRS. Smoking, patient sex, and BMI did not significantly affect the 1-year results for the LSI of the heel-rise tests.

In South Africa, more than eight million adults are considered functionally illiterate and cognitive evaluation using standard scales is inaccurate. Other countries have developed adapted MMSE scales for their local purposes. AIM: The first aim of this study was to develop a South African Brief Cognitive Score (SA BCS) for use in minimally literate or illiterate individuals. The second aim was to test this SA BCS against the original Folstein MMSE in patients with memory problems. SETTING: The study was conducted in Tshilamba, Tshiombo, Tshifudi, Dzimauli and Pile in Venda as well as Rethabiseng and Zithobeni in Bronkhorstspruit for the illiterate study group, and Steve Biko Academic Hospital for the literate study groups. METHODS: The SA BCS was developed considering our local requirements and substituting questions needing literacy with items that did not. Both the original Folstein MMSE and the SA BCS were administered to groups of literate and illiterate normal individuals. Thereafter, the tests were repeated in groups of literate and illiterate patients with cognitive decline. RESULTS: Firstly, 33 illiterate and 31 literate subjects were assessed. The average original Folstein score was 29.29/30 for the literate subjects, and for the SA BCS 29.80. For the illiterate subjects, the average score for the original Folstein MMSE was 21.24/30 and for the SA BCS 27.45. KruskallCWallis equality of population rank test confirmed a significant improvement in the scores of the SA BCS in the illiterate group when compared to the original Folstein (p = 0.0001). In the second part of the study, 20 literate and 20 illiterate patients were assessed as before. In the literate group, the average original Folstein MMSE score was 20.5, while the average score for the South African BCS was 22.5. In the illiterate group, the average Folstein MMSE was 18.9; and the average score in the South African BCS was 22.8. The KruskalCWallis equality of population rank test showed a significant difference (p = 0.008) between the scores of the illiterate versus literate patients when the Folstein MMSE was used to assess cognition. With the SA BCS, no significant difference was found between the groups (p = 0.79). CONCLUSION: The SA BCS appears to have potential to be a more reliable scale when assessing cognition in illiterate or minimally literate subjects when compared to the original Folstein MMSE.","output":"Developing and testing a South African Brief Cognitive Score in literate and illiterate people of mixed language groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the COVID-19 pandemic forced millions of people to stay home and minimize their social contacts, newspaper reports worldwide raised concerns as they reported an increasing rate of intimate partner violence (IPV). One link of the measures enforced to control the pandemic to IPV might be a possible side effect of those measures, namely social and geographical isolation. As there was no scientific data investigating the association of IPV and social and geographical isolation in the context of epidemics or pandemics at the time of conducting this rapid review, we aimed at investigating a broader range of contexts of social as well as geographical isolation and its association with IPV to draw conclusions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science (core collection). A research strategy was developed and observational studies were included if they considered men and/or women, estimates of social and geographical isolation, and IPV as a primary outcome. Of the 526 identified studies, 11 were included in this review. The included studies involved 15,695 women and were conducted in the USA, Sweden, Ethiopia, Egypt, Spain, and Turkey. Indicators of social isolation such as lack of social, emotional, or informational support or the frequency and quality of social contacts were narratively assessed. Geographical isolation was primarily assessed by physical distance to the next town or support service. Both social and geographic isolation were found to be associated with an increased risk of IPV. Recommendations made by the individual studies include the following: (a) improving access to social networks outside the victims' own group, (b) improving their economic circumstances, (c) asserting the responsibility for those in contact with the victims, and (d) increasing the focus on access to preventive services and programs need to be taken into account. Therefore, considering the particular infrastructure and legislation of the countries affected by the pandemic, policies need to ensure constant access to shelters and other help services and increase awareness for IPV in the society. In addition, future studies are warranted to assess prevalence rates and risk factors of IPV during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Rapid Review on the Associations of Social and Geographical Isolation and Intimate Partner Violence: Implications for the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has revealed that science needs to learn how to better deal with the irreducible uncertainty that comes with global systemic risks as well as with the social responsibility of science towards the public good.

Hospital systems require rapid adaptation to respond to the increased demand for airway management while ensuring high quality patient care and provider safety. There is limited literature detailing successful system-level approaches to adapt to the surge of COVID-19 patients requiring airway management. METHODS: A deliberate system-level approach was used to expand a preexisting airway response service. Through a needs analysis (taking into account both existing resources and anticipated demands), we established priorities and solutions for the airway management challenges encountered during the pandemic. RESULTS: During our COVID-19 surge (March 10, 2020, through May 26, 2020), there were 619 airway consults, and the COVID airway response team (CART) performed 341 intubations. Despite a 4-fold increase in intubations during the surge, there was no increase in cardiac arrests or surgical airways and no documented COVID-19 infections among the CART. CONCLUSIONS: Our system-level approach successfully met the sudden escalation in demand in airway management incurred by the COVID-19 surge.

These relations were fully explained by health/safety risk tendency. Deviousness (aspect of Machiavellianism) contributed to unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 independently of risk-taking tendencies. Furthermore, selection of particular vaccine was not associated with dark traits, but those who selected all vaccines (both EU-approved and non-approved) had higher scores on social risks compared to those who selected only non-approved vaccines.

Nitric oxide (NO), is a small signal molecule that impacts pleiotropic functions in human physiology, which can be involved in the significant effects of COVID-19 infection. NO is a neurotransmitter involved in the neural olfactory processes in the central nervous system, and some infected patients have reported anosmia as a symptom. Additionally, NO is a well-known vasodilator, important coagulation mediator, anti-microbial effector and inhibitor of SARS-CoV replication. Exhaled NO is strongly related to the type-2 inflammatory response found in asthma, which has been suggested to be protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several reports indicate that the use of inhaled NO has been an effective therapy during this pandemic since the ventilation-perfusion ratio in COVID-19 patients improved afterwards and they did not require mechanical ventilation.

In particular, in order to properly interpret the available data, it has become clear that one must go beyond most classic epidemiological models and consider models that, like the recently proposed SIDARTHE, offer a richer description of the stages of infection. The problem of learning the parameters of these models is of crucial importance especially when assuming that they are time-variant, which further enriches their effectiveness. In this paper we propose a general approach for learning time-variant parameters of dynamic compartmental models from epidemic data. We formulate the problem in terms of a functional risk that depends on the learning variables through the solutions of a dynamic system. The resulting variational problem is then solved by using a gradient flow on a suitable, regularized functional. We forecast the epidemic evolution in Italy and France.

This results in overall poorer population health for minoritized people. In 2020, Black and Hispanic/Latinx communities throughout the United States, including the state of Illinois, experienced disproportionately high rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Public health officials in Illinois implemented targeted programs at state and local levels to increase intervention access and reduce disparities. METHODS: To quantify how disparities in COVID outcomes evolved through the epidemic, data on SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests, COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19 deaths were obtained from the Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System for the period from March 1 to December 31, 2020. Relative risks of COVID-19 cases and deaths were calculated for Black and Hispanic/Latinx vs. White residents, stratified by age group and epidemic interval. Deaths attributable to racial/ethnic disparities in incidence and case fatality were estimated with counterfactual simulations. RESULTS: Disparities in case and death rates became less drastic after May 2020, but did not disappear, and were more pronounced at younger ages. From March to May of 2020, the risk of a COVID-19 case for Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations was more than twice that of Whites across all age groups. The relative risk of COVID-19 death reached above 10 for Black and Hispanic/Latinx individuals under 50 years of age compared to age-matched Whites in the early epidemic. In all Illinois counties, relative risk of a COVID-19 case was the same or significantly increased for minoritized populations compared to the White population. 79.3% and 86.7% of disparities in deaths among Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations, respectively, were attributable to differences in age-adjusted incidence compared to White populations rather than differences in case fatality ratios. CONCLUSIONS: Racial and ethnic disparities in the COVID-19 pandemic are products of society, not biology. Considering age and geography in addition to race/ethnicity can help to identify the structural factors driving poorer outcomes for certain groups. Studies and policies aimed at reducing inequalities in disease exposure will reduce disparities in mortality more than those focused on drivers of case fatality.","output":"Structural racism and COVID-19 response: Higher risk of exposure drives disparate COVID-19 deaths among Black and Hispanic/Latinx residents of Illinois, USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Severity scoring is a key step in managing patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. However, manual quantitative analysis by radiologists is a time-consuming task, while qualitative evaluation may be fast but highly subjective. This study aims to develop artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods to quantify disease severity and predict COVID-19 patient outcome. METHODS: We develop an AI-based framework that employs deep neural networks to efficiently segment lung lobes and pulmonary opacities. The volume ratio of pulmonary opacities inside each lung lobe gives the severity scores of the lobes, which are then used to predict ICU admission and mortality with three different machine learning methods. The developed methods were evaluated on datasets from two hospitals (site A: Firoozgar Hospital, Iran, 105 patients; site B: Massachusetts General Hospital, USA, 88 patients). RESULTS: AI-based severity scores are strongly associated with those evaluated by radiologists (Spearmans rank correlation 0.837, [Formula: see text] ). Using AI-based scores produced significantly higher ([Formula: see text] ) area under the ROC curve (AUC) values. The developed AI method achieved the best performance of AUC = 0.813 (95% CI [0.729, 0.886]) in predicting ICU admission and AUC = 0.741 (95% CI [0.640, 0.837]) in mortality estimation on the two datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate severity scores can be obtained using the developed AI methods over chest CT images.

Female nurses were the most exposed to burnout (OR=2,47; 95%CI=1,33-4,60; P=0,004), emotional exhaustion (OR=1,89; 95% CI=1,03-3,48; P=0,041), and depersonalization (OR=1,91; 95% CI=1,03-3,53; P=0,039). Determinants of burnout differed between sexes, and some paradoxical associations were detected: the score of job demands was a protective factor in females for burnout, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization, resilience was a risk factor for males. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that the stressors in male and female HCWs tended to be associated with burnout differently. Both sexes showed alarming burnout levels, even if the weights of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization acted in different ways between the sexes. The revealed paradoxical effects in this study could reflect the studys cross-sectional nature, highlighting that more resilient and empathic individuals were more consciously overwhelmed by the challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, thus reporting higher scores of emotional exhaustion and burnout. Future in-depth and longitudinal analyses are recommended to further explore sex-related differences in burnout among HCWs.","output":"Burnout syndrome and its determinants among healthcare workers during the first wave of the Covid-19 outbreak in Italy: a cross-sectional study to identify sex-related differences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genomic signal processing (GSP) methods which convert DNA data to numerical values have recently been proposed, which would offer the opportunity of employing existing digital signal processing methods for genomic data.

This paper investigates the nature of digital phenotyping in relation to its alleged promise. Unlike most of the literature to date on philosophy and digital phenotyping, which has focused on its ethical aspects, this paper focuses on its epistemic and methodological aspects. The paper advances a tetra-taxonomy involving four scenario types in which knowledge may be acquired from human digitypes by digital phenotyping. These scenarios comprise two causal relations and a correlative and constitutive relation that can exist between information generated by digital systems/devices on the one hand and psychological or behavioral phenomena on the other. The paper describes several modes of inference involved in deriving knowledge within these scenarios. After this epistemic mapping, the paper analyzes the possible knowledge potential and limitations of digital phenotyping. It finds that digital phenotyping holds promise of delivering insight into conditions and states as well producing potentially new psychological categories. It also argues that care must be taken that digital phenotyping does not make unwarranted conclusions and is aware of potentially distorting effects in digital sensing and measurement. If digital phenotyping is to truly revolutionize knowledge of human life, it must deliver on a range of fronts, including making accurate forecasts and diagnoses of states and behaviors, providing causal explanations of these phenomena, and revealing important constituents of human conditions, psychology, and experience.","output":"Digital Phenotyping: an Epistemic and Methodological Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first description of a new form of neutrophil cell death distinct from that of apoptosis or necrosis was discovered in 2004 and coined neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) or NETosis.

Although these dynamics are routinely explored independently, the relationships among them and how their interactions facilitate or constrain adaptation to climate change are poorly understood. In migratory species, advancing phenology may impose selection on morphological traits to increase migration speed. Advancing spring phenology might also expose species to cooler temperatures during the breeding season, potentially mitigating the effect of a warming global environment on body size. We use a dataset of birds that died after colliding with buildings in Chicago, IL to test whether changes in migration phenology are related to documented declines in body size and increases in wing length in 52 North American migratory bird species between 1978 and 2016. For each species, we estimate temporal trends in morphology and changes in the timing of migration. We then test for associations between species-specific rates of phenological and morphological changes while assessing the potential effects of migratory distance and breeding latitude. We show that spring migration through Chicago has advanced while the timing of fall migration has broadened as a result of early fall migrants advancing their migrations and late migrants delaying their migrations. Within species, we found that longer wing length was linked to earlier spring migration within years. However, we found no evidence that rates of phenological change across years, or migratory distance and breeding latitude, are predictive of rates of concurrent changes in morphological traits. These findings suggest that biotic responses to climate change are highly multidimensional and the extent to which those responses interact and influence adaptation to climate change requires careful examination.","output":"Widespread shifts in bird migration phenology are decoupled from parallel shifts in morphology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a publicly funded healthcare system, no evidence of survival disparities across socioeconomic classes among patients with pulmonary hypertension was observed, underscoring the importance of eliminating financial barriers to medical care and treatment https://bit.ly/2Eb1ju2.","output":"Socioeconomic status and survival in patients with pulmonary hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The research-activists network Collective Action on Real Food analyzed alternative food supply initiatives formed in response and/or expanded due to the pandemic in Brazil and identified more than 260 examples.

While social behaviors have many benefits for group-living animals, they also play a role in disease transmission. This is especially true in primate species, like bonobos, who have complex social dynamics, which can facilitate disease transmission. Bonobos are also more susceptible to human disease variants due to their close genetic relatedness and are therefore at higher risk of infection in captivity due to closer proximity to humans. Therefore, investigation whether an individuals characteristics, like sex, age, or social-network position increase disease risk provides information that can be used for future management decisions to improve general animal welfare. To do so, we monitored the occurrence of respiratory disease symptoms during one winter season in a relatively large group of 20 zoo-housed bonobos. We found that individuals that were more central in the social network had higher chances of contracting respiratory disease and that males were more likely to get infected than females. These results indicate that for bonobos, social behavior and sex influence the risk of contracting respiratory disease, two factors that can be taken into account when managing fission-fusion dynamics during disease outbreaks in this zoo-housed species. ABSTRACT: Infectious diseases can be considered a threat to animal welfare and are commonly spread through both direct and indirect social interactions with conspecifics. This is especially true for species with complex social lives, like primates. While several studies have investigated the impact of sociality on disease risk in primates, only a handful have focused on respiratory disease, despite it being a major cause of morbidity and mortality in both wild and captive populations and thus an important threat to primate welfare. Therefore, we examined the role of social-network position on the occurrence of respiratory disease symptoms during one winter season in a relatively large group of 20 zoo-housed bonobos with managed fission-fusion dynamics. We found that within the proximity network, symptoms were more likely to occur in individuals with higher betweenness centrality, which are individuals that form bridges between different parts of the network. Symptoms were also more likely to occur in males than in females, independent of their social-network position. Taken together, these results highlight a combined role of close proximity and sex in increased risk of attracting respiratory disease, two factors that can be taken into account for further welfare management of the species.","output":"Respiratory Disease Risk of Zoo-Housed Bonobos Is Associated with Sex and Betweenness Centrality in the Proximity Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for use in children in many nations.

Anticoagulation (AC) has been proposed for high-risk patients, even without confirmed thromboembolism. However, benefits and risks of AC are not well assessed due to insufficient clinical data. We performed a retrospective analysis of outcomes from AC in a large population of COVID-19 patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 1189 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 15 and May 15, 2020, with primary outcomes of mortality, invasive mechanical ventilation, and major bleeding. Patients who received therapeutic AC for known indications were excluded. Propensity score matching of baseline characteristics and admission parameters was performed to minimize bias between cohorts. Results: The analysis cohort included 973 patients. Forty-four patients who received therapeutic AC for confirmed thromboembolic events and atrial fibrillation were excluded. After propensity score matching, 133 patients received empiric therapeutic AC while 215 received low dose prophylactic AC. Overall, there was no difference in the rate of invasive mechanical ventilation (73.7% versus 65.6%, p = 0.133) or mortality (60.2% versus 60.9%, p = 0.885). However, among patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, empiric therapeutic AC was an independent predictor of lower mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.476, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.345-0.657, p < 0.001) with longer median survival (14 days vs 8 days, p < 0.001), but these associations were not observed in the overall cohort ( p = 0.063). Additionally, no significant difference in mortality was found between patients receiving empiric therapeutic AC versus prophylactic AC in various subgroups with different D-dimer level cutoffs. Patients who received therapeutic AC showed a higher incidence of major bleeding (13.8% vs 3.9%, p < 0.001).

When scores fell below a prespecified threshold, functional information was obtained through proxy interview. RESULTS Compared with control, the intensive lifestyle intervention induced and maintained marked differences in weight loss and self-reported physical activity throughout follow-up. At an average (range) of 11.4 (9.5-13.5) years after enrollment, when participants' mean age was 69.6 (54.9-87.2) years, the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment and probable dementia was 6.4% and 1.8%, respectively, in the intervention group, compared with 6.6% and 1.8%, respectively, in the control group (p = 0.93).

METHODS: Retrospective review of P jirovecii PCR, C(T) values and clinical data from 18 months in a multihospital academic health system. The diagnostic performance of PCR with respect to pathology and correlation of C(T) with severity were examined. RESULTS: Ninety-nine of 1006 (9.8%) assays from 786 patients in 919 encounters were positive. Among 91 (9.9%) encounters in which P jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) was treated, 41 (45%) were influenced by positive PCR. Negative PCR influenced discontinuation of therapy in 35 cases. Sensitivity and specificity of PCR were 93% (95% CI, 68%C100%) and 94% (95% CI, 91%C96%) with respect to pathology.

We conducted a serosurvey on 1078 workers from 17 worksites in Klang Valley and Perak between July and September 2021. We tested them for SARSCoV2 specific antibodies using Ecotest, a lateral flow immunoassay. The ability of antibody testing to detect prior infection depends on the assay and seroreversion. We therefore adjusted the prevalence estimates to correct for potential misclassification bias due to the use of LFIA and seroreversion using test sensitivity and specificity results estimated from an independent validation study. The mean age of the workers was 32 years, 89 percent were male and migrant workers comprised 81 percent of all subjects, 59 percent the subjects were from Klang valley. 33 percent of workers had prior PCR confirmed Covid19 infections. We estimated 82.2 percent of workers had been infected by Covid19 by September 2021. Prevalence was 99.9 percent among migrant workers and 12.1 percent among local workers. Klang Valley, the most industrialized region in Malaysia where most migrant workers are found, had 100 percent prevalence, giving an infection to case ratio of about 3. Our seroprevalence results show that the incidence of Covid19 is extremely high among migrant workers in Malaysia, consistent with findings from other countries such as Kuwait and Singapore which also hosted large number of migrant workers.","output":"Sero-Prevalence of Covid-19 among workers in Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has devastating effects on the population worldwide. Given this scenario, the extent of the impact of the disease on more vulnerable individuals, such as pregnant women, is of great concern. Although pregnancy may be a risk factor in respiratory virus infections, there are no considerable differences regarding COVID-19 severity observed between pregnant and nonpregnant women. In these circumstances, an emergent concern is the possibility of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric harm for the offspring of infected mothers. Currently, there is no stronger evidence indicating vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, the exacerbated inflammatory response observed in the disease could lead to several impairments in the offspring's brain. Furthermore, in the face of historical knowledge on possible long-term consequences for the progeny's brain after infection by viruses, we must consider that this might be another deleterious facet of COVID-19. In light of neuroimmune interactions at the maternal-fetal interface, we review here the possible harmful outcomes to the offspring brains of mothers infected by SARS-CoV-2.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Pregnant Women: Neuroimmune-Endocrine Changes at the Maternal-Fetal Interface"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic wreaked havoc across the globe, we have witnessed substantial mis- and disinformation regarding various aspects of the disease. We conducted a cross-sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire for the general public (recruited via social media) and healthcare workers (recruited via email) from the State of Qatar, and the Middle East and North Africa region to understand the knowledge of and anxiety levels around COVID-19 (April-June 2020) during the early stage of the pandemic. The final dataset used for the analysis comprised of 1658 questionnaires (53.0% of 3129 received questionnaires; 1337 [80.6%] from the general public survey and 321 [19.4%] from the healthcare survey). Knowledge about COVID-19 was significantly different across the two survey populations, with a much higher proportion of healthcare workers possessing better COVID-19 knowledge than the general public (62.9% vs. 30.0%, p < 0.0001). A reverse effect was observed for anxiety, with a higher proportion of very anxious (or really frightened) respondents among the general public compared to healthcare workers (27.5% vs. 11.5%, p < 0.0001). A higher proportion of the general public tended to overestimate their chance of dying if they become ill with COVID-19, with 251 (18.7%) reporting the chance of dying (once COVID-19 positive) to be &#8805;25% versus 19 (5.9%) of healthcare workers (p < 0.0001). Good knowledge about COVID-19 was associated with low levels of anxiety. Panic and unfounded anxiety, as well as casual and carefree attitudes, can propel risk taking and mistake-making, thereby increasing vulnerability. It is important that governments, public health agencies, healthcare workers, and civil society organizations keep themselves updated regarding scientific developments and that they relay messages to the community in an honest, transparent, unbiased, and timely manner.","output":"Knowledge and Anxiety about COVID-19 in the State of Qatar, and the Middle East and North Africa Region-A Cross Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surgical management of head and neck melanoma starts from the primary biopsy of the cutaneous site by a narrow excision with a 1 to 3 mm margins.

Prior to the pandemic, the Virginia Fresh Match (VFM) Nutrition Incentive Network partnered with food retail outlets to provide Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants point-of-purchase incentives (e.g., Double Up Food Bucks, SNAP Match), which function as matching discounts on fresh fruits and vegetables (F/V). These can enable participants to increase their purchasing power and potentially reduce food insecurity. In response to COVID-19, VFM removed the limit on incentive discounts (previously $101) to further incentivize the purchase of fresh F/V by SNAP participants. This study sought to characterize the purchasing patterns of SNAP participants at a food co-operative (co-op) partnered with VFM before and during the Virginia stay-at-home order. A total of 654 transactions at the co-op were included. Independent t-tests were utilized to determine differences before and during the order. The results indicated a significant increase in the mean incentive discount received during the order (pre-shutdown=$3.95, inter-shutdown=$5.01, p=0.035);however, simultaneously there was a decrease in the mean number of fresh F/V purchased (pre-shutdown=3.08, inter-shutdown=2.39, p=0.015).

The World Health Organization has consistently supported breastfeeding from the beginning of the pandemic. However, recommendations from obstetrical and gynaecological societies within individual countries have varied in their alignment with this guidance, resulting in inconsistent recommendations. It is unknown how breastfeeding guidelines, maternal breastfeeding experiences, and breastfeeding initiation and duration compared across five Western countries. The current study is comprised of two parts, each with a different objective. Part One objective: to review pandemic-related changes in professional society guidelines on breastfeeding support in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States; and Part Two objective: to conduct a narrative review to summarize the evidence of how the pandemic has changed breastfeeding initiation, duration, and mothers breastfeeding experiences during the pandemic in these five countries and provide recommendations for clinical lactation support. METHODS: We searched for indicators that are impactful on breastfeeding outcomes: skin-to-skin contact, rooming in, direct breastfeeding and breast washing, in the five countries mentioned above and compared these to the recommendations from the World Health Organization. Next, we conducted a narrative review of the literature from these five countries to explore how the pandemic altered breastfeeding outcomes and used this information to provide suggestions for clinical practice moving forward. RESULTS: Recommendations on the four practices above differed by country and were not always in alignment with the World Health Organization recommendations. Mother-infant separation after birth in the United States was associated with a lower prevalence of breastfeeding initiation and duration. While some mothers reported positive breastfeeding experiences during the pandemic, many mothers indicated negative experiences related to decreased social and professional support. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic can inform practice recommendations and can be viewed as an opportunity to permanently modify existing methods to support breastfeeding families. The use of virtual care increased during the pandemic and should continue with specific considerations for prioritizing in-person care. This will help to provide more timely and accessible support for breastfeeding mothers.","output":"A review of the disruption of breastfeeding supports in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in five Western countries and applications for clinical practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interferon (IFN) is crucial for initiating the innate immune response and for the generation of the adaptive response.

In this study, we compared the capacity of porcine IFN-alpha, -beta and -gamma, or a combination of them, to protect IBRS-2 cells (porcine kidney cells) from infection with pseudorabies virus (PRV). The results demonstrated that porcine IFN-beta (PoIFN-beta) was the most efficient of the three IFNs in conferring resistance PRV infection; 100 U/mL PoIFN-beta inhibited PRV plaque formation 5.3-fold. Compared with PoIFN-beta, porcine IFN-gamma (PoIFN-gamma) was less capable of inhibiting PRV plaque formation (3.3-fold inhibition). Porcine IFN-alpha (PoIFN-alpha) had the least capability of the three PoIFNs, and inhibited PRV plaque formation only 1.26-fold. The inhibitory capacity increased to only 2.3-fold with a treatment of 12,800 U/mL PoIFN-alpha. A combination of PoIFN-gamma and PoIFN-alpha or PoIFN-beta inhibited PRV plaque formation 12.8-fold or 100-fold, respectively. Treatment of IBRS-2 cells with PoIFN-alpha/beta and PoIFN-gamma inhibited PRV replication 29- or 146-fold. Additionally, real-time PCR analyses of the PRV immediate early (IE) gene revealed that IE mRNA expression was profoundly decreased in cells stimulated with PoIFN-alpha/beta and PoIFN-gamma (23.8-133.0-fold) compared with vehicle-treated cells.

Myriad hyptheses are proposed for the outbreak. We recently reported uncontrolled diabetes and inappropriate steroid therapy as significant risk factors for the outbreak. However, Mucorales contamination of hospital environment was not studied. We, therefore, planned this multi-centre study across India to determine possible Mucorales contamination of hospital environment during the outbreak. METHODS: Eleven hospitals from four zones of India representing high to low incidence for mucormycosis cases were included in the study. Samples from a variety of equipment used by the patients and ambient air were collected during May 19, 2021 through August 25, 2021. RESULTS: None of the hospital equipment sampled was contaminated with Mucorales. However, Mucorales were isolated from 11.1% air-conditioning vents and 1.7% of patients used masks. Other fungi were isolated from 18% hospital equipment and surfaces, and 8.1% used masks. Mucorales grew from 21.7% indoor and 53.8% outdoor air samples. Spore counts of Mucorales in air were significantly higher in the hospitals of North and South zones compared to West and East zones (P< 0.0001). Among Mucorales isolated from the environment Rhizopus spp. were the commonest genus. CONCLUSION: C We found contamination of air-conditioning vents and hospital air by Mucorales.

Design Retrospective cohort study using electronic medical record data. Primary outcome was interval between referral to MIGS and date of surgery. Setting Tertiary-level MIGS division in the southeast US. Patients or Participants Historical cohort undergoing surgery with MIGS 2014-2016 (n=377) and cohort in 2020 referred during the pandemic (n=191). Interventions Laparoscopic hysterectomy, myomectomy, adnexal surgery, or excision of endometriosis. Measurements and Main Results Patient demographics (race, age, marital status, language, insurance, and socioeconomic factors) were evaluated for significant associations with surgical delay. Patients with fibroids and abnormal uterine bleeding had a shorter interval to surgery (median 95 days, range 66-133) compared to patients with chronic pelvic pain (median 127 days, range 73-274). Our model adjusting for surgical indication revealed that single patients were 2.13 times as likely to wait >90 days (95% CI 1.35-3.36) compared to partnered patients prior to the pandemic. Additionally, those in the lowest quartile of median household income (<$42,572 vs > $75,020; OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.32, 4.46) and those from zip codes with the highest proportion of population in poverty ( 0.20 vs <0.07; OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.04, 3.6) were more likely to wait > 90 days. However, all of these differences disappeared during the pandemic. There were no differences in time to surgery by race, ethnicity, language, population density, markers of education by zip code, or insurance before or during the pandemic. Conclusion Historically, race and socioeconomic factors are associated with decreased access to MIGS and vulnerable populations were disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, we found decreased time to surgery at our institution, and previous socioeconomic disparities associated with scheduling delays were improved during the pandemic, suggesting improved equitable access to tertiary-level MIGS.","output":"Patient Characteristics Associated with Delays to Benign Gynecologic Surgery: Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study presents survey results of the public's willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 during an early phase of the pandemic and examines factors that could influence vaccine acceptance based on a between-subjects design.

Home-based options have been proposed and were found noninferior to center-based rehabilitation; however, there is a lack of home-based programs, and more understanding is needed. We aimed to test the feasibility, uptake, and adherence to a home-based program for COPD rehabilitation with health coaching. METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial with a wait-list controlled design to evaluate the effects of a home-based program with health coaching on breathlessness in subjects with moderate to severe COPD unable to attend the regular pulmonary rehabilitation program. The 8-week intervention consisted of video-guided exercises to be done 6 times a week and captured with a computer tablet. Health coaching was done weekly over the telephone to review subject activity and symptoms and to provide an opportunity for the subject to define their weekly goals. The primary outcomes were uptake, adherence, and Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) Dyspnea Domain. Secondary outcomes were self-management abilities and CRQ Emotions-Mastery-Fatigue. RESULTS: 154 subjects with moderate to severe COPD were randomized. Subject adherence was 86% to the proposed 6-times a week exercise routine.

The patients were divided into three groups according to surgery technique (suture, mesh and laparoscopic repair). Early and long-term follow-up results including hospital stay, postoperative general and wound complications, recurrence rate and postoperative patient complaints were reviewed. Risk factors for recurrence were also analyzed. Results One hundred and forty-six patients were operated on using suture repair, 52 using open mesh and 18 using laparoscopic repair technique. 77.8% of patients underwent long-term follow-up. The postoperative wound complication rate and long-term postoperative complaints were significantly higher in the open mesh repair group. The overall hernia recurrence rate was 13.1%.

DESIGN Pragmatic, unblinded, randomized controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02787499). SETTING Ambulatory HIV clinics in the public sector in Uganda and South Africa. PATIENTS Adults receiving first-line antiretroviral therapy with a recent HIV RNA viral load of 1000 copies/mL or higher. INTERVENTION Participants were randomly assigned to receive standard of care (SOC), including adherence counseling sessions and repeated viral load testing, or immediate GRT. MEASUREMENTS The primary outcome of interest was achievement of an HIV RNA viral load below 200 copies/mL 9 months after enrollment. RESULTS The trial enrolled 840 persons, divided equally between countries. Approximately half (51%) were women. Most (72%) were receiving a regimen of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz at enrollment. The rate of virologic suppression did not differ 9 months after enrollment between the GRT group (63% [263 of 417]) and SOC group (61% [256 of 423]; odds ratio [OR], 1.11 [95% CI, 0.83 to 1.49]; P = 0.46).

This includes individuals of advanced age and those with obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. Inflammation resolution is strongly dependent on lipid mediators, the specialized pro-resolution mediators (SPMs). &#969;-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (&#969;-3 PUFAs) are precursors of very potent SPMs, including resolvins, protectins, and maresins. Additionally, they are associated with a less aggressive inflammatory initiation, after competing with &#969;-6 fatty acids for eicosanoid synthesis. Therefore, it makes sense to consider the use of &#969;-3 PUFAs for clinical management of COVID-19 patients. &#969;-3 PUFAs may be given by oral, enteral, or parenteral routes; however, the parenteral route favors faster incorporation into plasma phospholipids, blood cells, and tissues. Here, we discuss these aspects to propose the parenteral infusion of &#969;-3 PUFAs as adjuvant immunopharmacotherapy for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","output":"Parenteral fish oil: An adjuvant pharmacotherapy for coronavirus disease 2019?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The U.S. air transportation network (ATN) is critical to the mobility and the functioning of the United States. It is thus necessary to ensure that it is well-connected, efficient, robust, and secure. Despite extensive research on its topology, the temporal evolution of the networks robustness remains largely unexplored. In the present paper, a methodology is proposed to identify long-term trends in the evolution of the networks topology and robustness over time. The study of the U.S. domestic ATNs robustness was performed based on annual flight data from 1996 to 2016 and network analytics were used to examine the effects of restructuring that followed the 9/11 events. Centrality measures were computed and a node deletion method was applied to assess the networks tolerance to a targeted attack scenario. The outcome of this study indicated that the 9/11 terrorist attacks triggered vast restructuring of the network, in terms of efficiency and security. Air traffic expanded, as new airports and air routes were introduced, allowing the network to recover rapidly and become more efficient. Security concerns resulted in significant improvement of the networks robustness. Since 2001, the global traffic and topological properties of the U.S. ATN have displayed continuous growth, due to the networks expansion. On the other hand, the results suggest that although the systems ability to sustain its operational level under extreme circumstances has lately improved, its tolerance to targeted attacks has deteriorated. The presented methodology has shown its potential to be applied on different network levels or different transportation networks, in order to provide a general perspective of the systems vulnerabilities.","output":"A study of the U.S. domestic air transportation network: temporal evolution of network topology and robustness from 2001 to 2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We investigated the COVID19-related psychological impact on healthcare workers in Italy and in Italian-speaking regions of Switzerland, three weeks after its outbreak. All professional groups of public hospitals in Italy and Switzerland were asked to complete a 38 questions online survey investigating demographic, marital and working status, presence of stress symptoms and need for psychological support. RESULTS: Within 38 h a total of 3,038 responses were collected. The subgroup analysis identified specific categories at risk according to age, type of work and region of origin. Critical care workers, in particular females, reported an increased number of working hours, decline in confidence in the future, presence of stress symptoms and need for psychological support. Respondents reporting stress symptoms and those with children declared a higher need for psychological support. CONCLUSIONS: The large number of participants in such a short time indicates for a high interest on topic among health-care workers.

Furthermore, people may have opted against HIV testing during this period to avoid COVID-19 exposure. We investigated the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV testing and the number of reported HIV cases in Japan. METHODS: We analyzed quarterly HIV/AIDS-related data from 2015 to the second quarter of 2020 using an anomaly detection approach. The data included the number of consultations, the number of HIV tests performed by public health centers or municipalities, and the number of newly reported HIV cases with and without an AIDS diagnosis. We further performed the same analysis for 2 subgroups: men who have sex with men (MSM) and non-Japanese persons. RESULTS: The number of HIV tests (9,584 vs. 35,908 in the year-before period) and consultations (11,689 vs. 32,565) performed by public health centers significantly declined in the second quarter of 2020, whereas the proportion of new HIV cases with an AIDS diagnosis (36.2% vs. 26.4%) significantly increased after removing the trend and seasonality effects. HIV cases without an AIDS diagnosis decreased (166 vs. 217), but the reduction was not significant. We confirmed similar trends for the men who have sex with men and non-Japanese subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the current HIV testing system in Japan seems to have missed more cases of HIV before developing AIDS.

The study sample consisted of 2,230 participants (1,287 females and 943 males). The exposure variables collected in adolescence included self-reported physical activity, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and whole grain bread and insomnia, and psychological distress in young adulthood was used as an outcome variable. The relationship between lifestyle behaviours in adolescence and psychological distress in young adulthood was examined using multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for gender, age and psychological distress in adolescence and educational level in young adulthood. RESULTS: An increased odds of psychological distress was shown among young adults who reported low levels of physical activity (OR: 1.44, 95 % CI: 1.10-2.89), high consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (OR: 1.49, 95 % CI: 1.12-1.98), low consumption of whole grain bread (OR: 1.35, 95 % CI: 1.04-1.77) and insomnia (OR: 1.69, 95 % CI: 1.23-2.33) in adolescence.

Thiel cadavers are suitable for laparoscopy, but there are few data about the use of embalmed (Tutsch method) and slightly embalmed (Thiel method) cadavers in procedures of Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES), which are usually developed and learned on swine models and fresh frozen cadavers. The aim of this study was thus to assess the use of these cadavers for NOTES approaches. METHODS The following surgical procedures were evaluated: transanal total mesorectal excision (four cadavers: one Tutsch, two Thiel, one fresh frozen), transanal ileorectal bypass (five cadavers: one Tutsch, three Thiel, one fresh frozen), and transvaginal appendectomy (two Tutsch cadaver). RESULTS The Thiel method ensured tissue flexibility and consistency suitable for performing the above surgical procedures with good results and without complications, with only a small increase in rigidity with respect to fresh specimens. Cadavers embalmed with higher formalin concentrations (Tutsch method) were more difficult to use, due to high tissue rigidity and resistance of the abdominal wall to pneumoperitoneum, although NOTES accesses were possible. CONCLUSIONS Thiel cadavers are suitable for transanal/transrectal and transvaginal NOTES approaches, for training surgical residents/specialists and also for surgical research. In minimally invasive surgery (and particularly in NOTES), integration between cadaver (fresh frozen and/or Thiel) and animal models would represent the gold standard, allowing guaranteed knowledge of and respect for human surgical anatomy and correct management of surgery on living subjects.

This study investigated how the COVID-19 pandemic setting affected heatstroke-related ambulance dispatches (HSAD). Daily HSAD data and relevant weather parameters from June to September from 2016 to 2020 of 47 prefectures in Japan were obtained from the Fire and Disaster Management Agency (FDMA) database. A binary variable representing COVID-19 impact was created, whereby years 2016 to 2019 were coded as 0, while 2020 as 1. We employed a two-stage analysis in elucidating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on HSAD. Firstly, we regressed HSAD with the COVID-19 binary variable after adjusting for relevant covariates to obtain prefecture-specific effect estimates. Prefecture-specific estimates were subsequently pooled via random effects meta-analysis in generating the pooled estimate. Pooled Relative Risk (RR) of HSAD during the COVID-19 pandemic was 0.78 (95% Confidential Interval [CI], 0.75-0.82). We found an overall statistically significant decrease in HSAD risk during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Specifically, the decrease in the risk of HSAD may be linked to the COVID-19 precautionary measures such as stay-home request and availability of alternative consultation services, which may have decreased the direct exposure of the population to extreme heat.","output":"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on heatstroke-related ambulance dispatch in the 47 prefectures of Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) are introduced by the semantic web community as small-sized user-centric knowledge graphs (KGs).

RESULTS: 15.4 % of the samples (n = 428) reported at least one comorbidity. There were 2011 symptomatic cases (72.4 %), being the most common reported symptom cough (57.2 %, n = 1586). Respiratory distress was present in 21.4 % of patients (n = 595), and 435 patients (15.6 %) required hospital admission. We observed that patients with no prior medical history harbored higher RNA copies than patients with comorbidities (p = 0.02). No significant differences in RNA copies were observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (p = 0.82). Strong correlations were detected between Ct values and the presence of odynophagia (p = 0.03), diarrhea (p = 0.04), and headache (p = 0.0008).

The bacterial RhlE-like DEAD-box RNA helicases are among the least well studied of these enzymes. They are widespread especially among Proteobacteria, whose genomes often encode multiple homologs. The significance of the expansion and diversification of RhlE-like proteins for bacterial fitness has not yet been established. Here, we study the two RhlE homologs present in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We show that, in the course of evolution, RhlE1 and RhlE2 have diverged in their biological functions, molecular partners and RNA-dependent enzymatic activities. Whereas RhlE1 is mainly needed for growth in the cold, RhlE2 also acts as global post-transcriptional regulator, affecting the level of hundreds of cellular transcripts indispensable for both environmental adaptation and virulence. The global impact of RhlE2 is mediated by its unique C-terminal extension, which supports the RNA unwinding activity of the N-terminal domain as well as an RNA-dependent interaction with the RNase E endonuclease and the cellular RNA degradation machinery.

I begin by examining two extremes of supporting or chastising the use of medical humor. I look at these views through the lenses of popular theories of humor to help explain their theoretical bases. In this second section, I explain the emotional aspect of humor as an embodied and embedded transformation of the world. This clarifies the role that humor plays in our daily lives, as well as why the ethical or unethical nature of its use is dependent on context. Third, I address the potential problems in the relationship between humor and clinical sympathy, and how this further affects the relationship between medical professionals and their patients. I conclude by arguing that humor can conflict with clinical sympathy, but this need not be the case. If medical professionals actively engage with clinical sympathy and focus on using humor in a way that is respectful towards their patients, then humor can continue to be a positive force in their lives while still providing the best care for their patients.","output":"Humor and sympathy in medical practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article discusses planning for April cover of the periodical to reflect the feeling of hope that's emerged with the increasing availability of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S.","output":"On the Cover"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose unprecedented challenges to worldwide health. While vaccines are effective, supplemental strategies to mitigate the spread and severity of COVID-19 are urgently needed. Emerging evidence suggests susceptibility to infections, including respiratory tract infections, may be reduced by probiotic interventions. Therefore, probiotics may be a low-risk, widely implementable modality to mitigate risk of COVID-19 disease, particularly in areas with low vaccine availability and/or uptake. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial across the United States testing the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) as post-COVID-19-exposure prophylaxis. We enrolled individuals > 1 year of age with a household contact with a recent ([] 7 days) diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants were randomized to receive daily LGG or placebo for 28 days. Stool was collected to evaluate the microbiome. The primary outcome was development of symptoms of illness compatible with COVID-19 within 28 days. Findings: We enrolled 182 COVID-19-exposed participants. Intention-to-treat analysis showed that participants randomized to LGG were less likely to develop symptoms versus those randomized to placebo (26.4% vs. 42.9%, p=0.02). Further, LGG was associated with a statistically significant reduction in COVID-19 diagnosis (log rank p=0.049) via time-to-event analysis. Overall incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis was not significantly different between LGG (8.8%) and placebo (15.4%) (p=0.17). LGG was well-tolerated with no increased side effects versus placebo. Interpretation: These findings suggest that LGG probiotic may protect against the development of COVID-19 infection and symptoms when used as post-exposure prophylaxis within 7 days after exposure. Funding: This work was supported by a grant from the Duke Microbiome Center to A.D.S. and P.E.W. and private philanthropic donations to A.D.S.

To further elucidate specific interactions between human respiratory viruses and important host factors in airway epithelium, it is important to make hAEC cultures amenable to genetic modification. However, the short and finite lifespan of primary cells in cell culture creates a bottleneck for the genetic modification of these cultures. In the current study, we show that the incorporation of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (Y-27632) during cell propagation extends the life span of primary human cells in vitro and thereby facilitates the incorporation of lentivirus-based expression systems. Using fluorescent reporters for FACS-based sorting, we generated homogenously fluorescent hAEC cultures that differentiate normally after lentiviral transduction. As proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that host gene expression can be modulated post-differentiation via inducible short hairpin (sh)RNA-mediated knockdown. Importantly, functional characterization of these transgenic hAEC cultures with exogenous poly(I:C), as a proxy for virus infection, demonstrates that such modifications do not influence the host innate immune response. Moreover, the propagation kinetics of both human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were not affected. Combined, these results validate our newly established protocol for the genetic modification of hAEC cultures thereby unlocking a unique potential for detailed molecular characterization of virus C host interactions in human respiratory epithelium.","output":"Establishment of primary transgenic human airway epithelial cell cultures to study respiratory virus C host interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Flavonoids have been shown to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, antibacterial and antiviral efficacy.

The five important targets chosen were the main protease (Mpro), Spike receptor binding domain (Spike-RBD), RNA - dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp or Nsp12), non-structural protein 15 (Nsp15) of SARS-CoV-2 and the host angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) spike-RBD binding domain. The compounds were initially docked at the selected sites and further evaluated for binding free energy using the molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) method. The three compounds with the best binding scores were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The compound, tribuloside, had a high average binding free energy of -86.99 and -88.98 kcal/mol for Mpro and Nsp12, respectively. The compound, legalon, had an average binding free energy of -59.02 kcal/mol at the ACE2 spike-RBD binding site. The compound, isosilybin, had an average free binding energy of -63.06 kcal/mol for the Spike-RBD protein.

Methods: This study evaluated the association of underlying CVD with disease progression in patients with mild COVID-19. The primary outcome was the need to be transferred to intensive care due to disease progression. The patients were divided with and without CVD as well as stable and intensive care groups. Results: Of 332 patients with mild COVID-19, median age was 51 years (IQR, 40-59 years), and 200 (61.2%) were female. Of 48 (14.5%) patients with CVD, 23 (47.9%) progressed to severe disease status and required intensive care. Compared with patients without CVD, patients with CVD were older, and more likely to have fatigue, chest tightness, and myalgia. The rate of requiring intensive care was significantly higher among patients with CVD than in patients without CVD (47.92% vs. 12.4%; P<0.001). In subgroup analysis, rate of requiring intensive care was also higher among patients with either hypertension or coronary heart disease than in patients without hypertension or coronary heart disease. The multivariable regression model showed CVD served as an independent risk factor for intensive care (Odd ratio [OR], 2.652 [95% CI, 1.019-6.899]) after adjustment for various cofounders.

The current COVID-19 pandemic has left the world in a unique state of crisis. The aim of this analysis was to explore whether Google searches can be used to retrospectively retrace the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany and to detect local outbreaks by reflecting public interest in the virus. METHODS: Google Trends was used to explore the relative search volume (RSV) related to \\"coronavirus\\" from January 2020 to July 2020 in Germany. The RSV ranging between 0-100 was compared to new SARS-CoV-2 infections per day on a national level and to the cumulative infection numbers on a state level, as well as to important infectiological and political events. RESULTS: The most striking search peaks occurred after the first reported SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany (January 27), during a major local outbreak in Heinsberg (February 25), after school closings (March 13) and the largest peak after nationwide contact restrictions (March 22) were announced. On a state level, peaks in RSV were observed after the first reported infection in each respective state. In addition, a higher RSV was recorded in states with higher numbers of infections (r=0,6, p=0,014) such as in Bavaria (RSV=96, 391 infections/100,000 inhabitants) and Baden-Wrttemberg (RSV=98, 340 infections/100,000 inhabitants). The lowest RSV (n=83) and lowest number of infections (50 infections/100,000 inhabitants) was observed in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Since the end of May, SARS-CoV-2 related RSV remained at low level even when numbers of infections were temporarily rising due to local outbreaks such as the outbreak in Gtersloh, North Rhine-Westphalia. CONCLUSION: RSV related to \\"coronavirus\\" precisely reflected public interest during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. As public interest has strongly declined, information distribution regarding the newest developments over the entire course of the pandemic will be a major public health challenge.

Die aktuelle COVID-19 Pandemie hat die ganze Welt in einen einmaligen Ausnahmezustand versetzt. Ziel dieser Studie war es zu untersuchen ob das Pandemiegeschehen in Deutschland anhand von Google Suchanfragen retrospektiv rekonstruiert werden kann und ob lokale Ausbrche mithilfe von Google Daten detektiert werden k?nnen. METHODIK: Das relative Google Suchvolumen (RSV) zum Thema \\"Coronavirus\\" wurde fr den Zeitraum von Januar bis Juli 2020 mit Google Trends analysiert. Das RSV, das zwischen 0 und 100 betragen kann, wurde auf Bundesebene mit den t?glich neu gemeldeten SARS-CoV-2 Infektionszahlen und auf L?nderebene mit den kumulativen Infektionszahlen pro Bundesland sowie wichtigen infektiologischen und politischen Ereignissen verglichen. ERGEBNISSE: H?chstwerte im Google Suchvolumen nach der ersten gemeldeten SARS-CoV-2-Infektion in Deutschland (27. Januar), w?hrend des lokalen Ausbruchs in Heinsberg (25. Februar), nach den Schulschlie?ungen (13. M?rz) sowie, der absolute H?chstwert, nach Verkndung der bundesweiten Kontaktbeschr?nkungen (22. M?rz) verzeichnet worden. Auf Bundesl?nderebene wurde immer dann ein Anstieg im Suchvolumen beobachtet, wenn die erste SARS-CoV-2 Infektion im jeweiligen Bundesland gemeldet wurde. Zudem wurde ein h?heres RSV in Bundesl?ndern mit mehr gemeldeten SARS-CoV-2-Infektionen registriert (r=0,6, p=0,014), wie z. B. in Bayern (RSV=96, 391 Infektionen/100 000 Einwohner) und Baden-Wrttemberg (RSV=98, 340 Infektionen/100 000 Einwohner).

Globalization has eroded the boundary between public and private health and between domestic and global health governance. In addition, the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003 focused global attention on China's public health. As a rising power with the largest population on earth, China is expected by the international community to play a better and more active role in health management. Since the turn of this century, China has increasingly embraced multilateralism in health governance. This paper argues that China's multilateral cooperation is driven by both necessity and conscious design. International concerns about good governance and its aspiration to become a 'responsible' state have exerted a normative effect on China to change tack. Its interactions with United Nations agencies have triggered a learning process for China to securitize the spread of infectious diseases as a security threat. Conversely, China has utilized multilateralism to gain access to international resources and technical assistance. It is still a matter of debate whether China's cooperative engagement with global health governance can endure, because of the persistent problems of withholding information on disease outbreaks and because of its insistence on the Westphalian notion of sovereignty.","output":"China engages global health governance: processes and dilemmas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Guided by a rigorous mathematical result, we have earlier introduced a numerical algorithm, which using as input the cumulative number of deaths caused by COVID-19, can estimate the effect of easing of the lockdown conditions.

After supplementing the Greek data for deaths with the data for the number of individuals reported to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, we estimated the effect on deaths and infections in the case that the easing of the lockdown measures is different for these two subpopulations. We found that if the lockdown measures are partially eased only for the young subpopulation, then the effect on deaths and infections is small. However, if the easing is substantial for the older population, this effect may be catastrophic.","output":"Easing COVID-19 lockdown measures while protecting the older restricts the deaths to the level of the full lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract As a complementary approach to two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), multi-dimensional chromatography separation methods have been widely applied in all kinds of biological sample investigations. Multi-dimensional liquid chromatography (MDLC) coupled with bio-mass spectrometry (MS) is playing important roles in proteome research due to its high speed, high resolution and high sensitivity. Proteome analysis strategies mainly include bottom-up and top-down approaches which carry out biological sample separation based on peptide and protein levels, respectively. Electrophoretic methods combined with liquid chromatography like IEF-HPLC and HPLC-SDS-PAGE have been successful applied for protein separations. As for MDLC strategy, ion-exchange chromatography (IEX) together with reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) is still a most widely used chromatography in proteome analysis, other chromatographic methods are also frequently used in protein pre-fractionations, while affinity chromatography is usually adopted for specific functional protein analysis. Recent MDLC technologies and applications to variety of proteome analysis have been achieved great development. A digest peptide-based approach as so-called bottom-up and intact protein-based approach top-down analysis of proteome samples were briefly reviewed in this paper.

The low figure of merit (FoM) of the LSPR and high-concentration AuNP requirement restrict their limit of detection (LOD), which is approximately ng to g mL(?1) in antibody detection if there is no other signal or analyte amplification. Improvements in sensitivity have been slow in recent for a long time, and pushing the boundary of the current LOD is a great challenge of current LSPR immunoassays in biosensing. RESULTS: In this work, we developed spectral image contrast-based flow digital nanoplasmon-metry (Flow DiNM) to push the LOD boundary. Comparing the scattering image brightness of AuNPs in two neighboring wavelength bands near the LSPR peak, the peak shift signal is strongly amplified and quickly detected. Introducing digital analysis, the Flow DiNM provides an ultrahigh signal-to-noise ratio and has a lower sample volume requirement. Compared to the conventional analog LSPR immunoassay, Flow DiNM for anti-BSA detection in pure samples has an LOD as low as 1 pg mL(?1) within only a 15-min detection time and 500 L sample volume. Antibody assays against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in artificial saliva that contained various proteins were also conducted to validate the detection of Flow DiNM in complicated samples. Flow DiNM shows significant discrimination in detection with an LOD of 10 pg mL(?1) and a broad dynamic detection range of five orders of magnitude. CONCLUSION: Together with the quick readout time and simple operation, this work clearly demonstrated the high sensitivity and selectivity of the developed Flow DiNM in rapid antibody detection. Spectral image contrast and digital analysis further provide a new generation of LSPR immunoassay with AuNPs.

This is particularly important in the case of a rapidly changing injury landscape due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the 1996 Global Burden of Disease study the disability adjusted life year (DALY) is widely used to assess the burden of injury. The DALY is a population health metric that expresses health loss due mortality, morbidity and disability into a single number. This allows comparisons of distinct health outcomes across subgroups of a population and over time. In addition, cost-of-illness studies can be used to assess the societal burden of injury. Cost-of-illness studies may vary with regards to the time horizon that is used as well as the cost components, which may include intramural and extramural costs as well as productivity loss due work absenteeism due to injury. Essential for the calculation of injury DALYs and cost-of-illness is relevant data on the occurrence of injury, injury deaths, data on exposure to risk factors for injuries, health care consumption and return to work.

Results show that planning pedagogy needs to maintain problem-based methodologies, that existing platforms should be designed to better emulate the studio atmosphere, and that inviting guest speakers online is a practice that will remain post-pandemic.","output":"Distance Teaching Urban Design and Planning Studio Courses during the Pandemic: Challenges and Lessons Learnt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Few and small studies have described the management of immunomodulant/immunosuppressive therapies or phototherapy in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic. METHODS: A national registry, named DA\\\\COVID\\\\19 and involving 35 Italian dermatology units, was established in order to evaluate the impact of COVID\\\\19 pandemic on the management of adult AD patients treated with systemic immunomodulant/immunosuppressive medications or phototherapy. Demographic and clinical data were obtained at different timepoints by teledermatology during COVID\\\\19 pandemic, when regular visits were not allowed due to sanitary restrictions. Disease severity was assessed by both physician\\\\ and patient\\\\reported assessment scores evaluating itch intensity, sleep disturbances, and AD severity. RESULTS: A total of 1831 patients were included, with 1580/1831 (86.3%) continuing therapy during pandemic. Most patients were treated with dupilumab (86.1%, 1576/1831) that was interrupted in only 9.9% (156/1576) of cases, while systemic immunosuppressive compounds were more frequently withdrawn. Treatment interruption was due to decision of the patient, general practitioner, or dermatologist in 39.9% (114/286), 5.6% (16/286), and 30.1% (86/286) of cases, respectively. Fear of increased susceptibility to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection (24.8%, 71/286) was one of the main causes of interruption. Sixteen patients (0.9%) resulted positive to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection; 3 of them (0.2%) were hospitalized but no cases of COVID\\\\related death occurred.

In theory, we refer to the Schumpeterian perspective of creative destruction. In the empirical analysis, survey data on 500 transport companies randomly selected from the database were used. We estimated partial proportional odds models to show the factors responsible for the enterprises' vulnerability and resilience to unforeseen shock. The perspective refers to the total sample size and the division into two subgroups: micro and small and medium enterprises. To justify the results, we calculated a set of statistical indicators and tests. These models enable separating enterprises according to the vulnerability level. Transport enterprises occurred significantly vulnerable to the COVID-19 crisis, particularly the demand shock. The only factor that influenced resilience was the decrease in fuel prices, which allowed a cost reduction. The crisis showed that government aid was helpful in the short run, particularly for micro and small enterprises. The medium-sized enterprises were more resilient than micro and small ones. We formulated several recommendations to help transport enterprises to adjust in the medium term.","output":"Vulnerability and resilience of the road transport industry in Poland to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a nationally representative survey of parents beliefs and self\\\\reported behaviors regarding childhood vaccinations.

Patients and Methods We identified patients (18 years) who completed a clinically indicated exercise stress test between 01 January 2016 and 29 February 2020 and had a test for SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test) between 29 February 2020 and 31 May 2020. Maximal exercise capacity was quantified in metabolic equivalents of task (METs). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the likelihood that hospitalization secondary to COVID-19 is related to peak METs, with adjustment for 13 covariates previously identified as associated with higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Results We identified 246 patients (age= 5912 years; 42% male; 75% black race) who had an exercise test and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among these, 89 (36%) were hospitalized. Peak METs were significantly lower (P <.001) among patients who were hospitalized (6.72.8) compared to those not hospitalized (8.02.4). Peak METs were inversely associated with the likelihood of hospitalization in unadjusted (OR= 0.83, 95% CI= 0.74, 0.92) and adjusted models (OR= 0.87, 95% CI= 0.76, 0.99). Conclusion Maximal exercise capacity is independently and inversely associated with the likelihood of hospitalization due to COVID-19. These data further support the important relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and health outcomes. Future studies are needed to determine if improving maximal exercise capacity is associated with lower risk of complications due to viral infections, such as COVID-19.","output":"Maximal Exercise Capacity is Inversely Related to Hospitalization Secondary to Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increasing emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious public health issue. Increasing the awareness of the general public about appropriate antibiotic use is a key factor for combating this issue. Several public media campaigns worldwide have been launched; however, such campaigns can be costly and the outcomes are variable and difficult to assess. Social media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, are now frequently utilized to address health-related issues. In many geographical locations, such as the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) States (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain), these platforms are becoming increasingly popular. The socioeconomic status of the GCC states and their reliable communication and networking infrastructure has allowed the penetration and scalability of these platforms in the region. This might explain why the Saudi Ministry of Health is using social media platforms alongside various other media platforms in a large-scale public awareness campaign to educate at-risk communities about the recently emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in a representative population-based cohort in Iquitos, one of the regions with the highest mortality rates from COVID-19 in Peru, where a devastating number of cases occurred in March, 2020. METHODS: We did a population-based study of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Iquitos at two timepoints: July 13-18, 2020 (baseline), and Aug 13-18, 2020 (1-month follow-up). We obtained a geographically stratified representative sample of the city population using the 2017 census data, which was updated on Jan 20, 2020. We included people who were inhabitants of Iquitos since COVID-19 was identified in Peru (March 6, 2020) or earlier. We excluded people living in institutions, people receiving any pharmacological treatment for COVID-19, people with any contraindication for phlebotomy, and health workers or individuals living with an active health worker. We tested each participant for IgG and IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test (Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech, China). We used survey analysis methods to estimate seroprevalence accounting for the sampling design effect and test performance characteristics. FINDINGS: We identified 726 eligible individuals and enrolled a total of 716 participants (99%), distributed across 40 strata (four districts, two sexes, and five age groups). We excluded ten individuals who: did not have consent from a parent or legal representative (n=3), had moved to Iquitos after March 6, 2020 (n=3), were in transit (n=2), or had respiratory symptoms (n=1). After adjusting for the study sampling effects and sensitivity and specificity of the test, we estimated a seroprevalence of 70% (95% CI 67-73) at baseline and 66% (95% CI 62-70) at 1 month of follow-up, with a test-retest positivity of 65% (95% CI 61-68), and an incidence of new exposures of 2% (95% CI 1-3). We observed significant differences in the seroprevalence between age groups, with participants aged 18-29 years having lower seroprevalence than those aged younger than 12 years (prevalence ratio 085 [95% CI 073-098]; p=0029). INTERPRETATION: After the first epidemic peak, Iquitos had one of the highest rates of seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies worldwide. Nevertheless, the city experienced a second wave starting in January, 2021, probably due to the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 P1 variant, which has shown higher transmissibility and reinfection rates.

This virus attacks the cells by binding to the transmembrane angiotensin I converting enzyme 2. In this study, we experimented a food supplement containing alpha-cyclodextrin and hydroxytyrosol for the improvement of the defenses against the SARS-CoV-2. Hydroxytyrosol has anti-viral properties and is able to reduce the serum lipids in mice. &#945;-cyclodextrin has the ability to deplete sphingolipids and phospholipids from the cellular membranes. The aim of the present preliminary open non-controlled interventional study was to evaluate the efficacy of alpha-cyclodextrin and hydroxytyrosol in improving defenses against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Fifty healthy volunteers at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from Northern Cyprus and six positive individuals for SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled in this study. The in silico prediction was performed using D3DOCKING to evaluate the interactions of hydroxytyrosol and alpha-cyclodextrin with proteins involved in the SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis. RESULTS: The 50 volunteers did not become positive in 15 days for SARS-CoV-2 after the administration of the compound for two weeks, despite they were at higher risk of infection than the general population. Interestingly, in the cohort of six positive patients, two patients were administered the spray and became negative after five days, despite the viral load was higher in the treated subjects than the untreated patients who became negative after ten days. In addition, we identified possible interactions among hydroxytyrosol and alpha-cyclodextrin with the protein Spike and the human proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2. CONCLUSIONS: We reported on the results of the possible role of alpha-cyclodextrin and hydroxytyrosol in improving defenses against SARS-CoV-2. The next step will be the administration of the compound to a larger cohort in a controlled study to confirm the reduction of the infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the treated subjects.","output":"A pilot study on the preventative potential of alpha-cyclodextrin and hydroxytyrosol against SARS-CoV-2 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Aim of this systematic review is to investigate the available evidence describing neonatal outcomes in newborns who have SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to guide prevention of COVID-19 in newborns.

Anthropometric indices like body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) have long been utilized to screen hypertension; in contrast, other evidence indicates the superior utility of waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) to screen hypertension. There are inconclusive results from different studies done in different settings regarding the best screening index for hypertension. In addition, there is a paucity of information on the evaluation of anthropometric indices for screening hypertension in the study area. Therefore, this study evaluates the utility of anthropometric indices for screening hypertension among Mizan Tepi University employees, southwestern Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among Mizan Tepi University employees. A gender-based stratified simple random sampling technique was used to select 585 employees. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between anthropometric indices and hypertension. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was employed to evaluate anthropometric indices for screening hypertension, and optimal cutoff points were also developed based on Youden index (sensitivity + specificity C 1) and presented with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV). RESULTS: The overall prevalence of hypertension was 20.9%, which was 22.5% in males and 18.7% in females. Among males, WHtR, WHR, and BMI were significantly associated with hypertension, while, in females, only BMI was associated with hypertension. WHtR had a higher screening ability for hypertension followed by WC in both sexes. For males, the cutoff point for WHR, WC, BMI, and WHtR for screening hypertension was 0.897, 85.17cm, 24.6kg/m(2), and 0.51, respectively. In females, the cutoff point developed for screening hypertension for WHR, WC, BMI, and WHtR were 0.92, 85.67cm, 24.8kg/m(2), and 0.52, respectively. CONCLUSION: The waist-to-height ratio was found to be the best obesity index to screen hypertension than BMI, WC, and WHR.

First studies indicate altered lymphocyte counts and function. However, interactions of pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms remain elusive. In the current study we characterized the immune responses in patients suffering from severe COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective study in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed COVID-19 between March 14(th) and May 28(th) 2020 (n = 39). Longitudinal data were collected within routine clinical care, including flow-cytometry of lymphocyte subsets, cytokine analysis and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15).

RESULTS: All patients suffered from severe ARDS, 30.8% died. Interleukin (IL)-6 was massively elevated at every time-point. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was concomitantly upregulated with IL-6. The cellular response was characterized by lymphocytopenia with low counts of CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) and na?ve T helper cells. CD8+ T and NK cells recovered after 8 to 14 days. The B cell system was largely unimpeded. This coincided with a slight increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-RBD immunoglobulin (Ig) G and a decrease in anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-RBD IgM. GDF-15 levels were elevated throughout ICU treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Massively elevated levels of IL-6 and a delayed cytotoxic immune defense characterized severe COVID-19-induced ARDS.

METHODS: In this multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 1C2a trial, we randomly assigned healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 55 years (cohort 1) and those 65 years of age or older (cohort 3) to receive the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine at a dose of 510(10) viral particles (low dose) or 110(11) viral particles (high dose) per milliliter or placebo in a single-dose or two-dose schedule. Longer-term data comparing a single-dose regimen with a two-dose regimen are being collected in cohort 2; those results are not reported here. The primary end points were the safety and reactogenicity of each dose schedule. RESULTS: After the administration of the first vaccine dose in 805 participants in cohorts 1 and 3 and after the second dose in cohort 1, the most frequent solicited adverse events were fatigue, headache, myalgia, and injection-site pain. The most frequent systemic adverse event was fever. Systemic adverse events were less common in cohort 3 than in cohort 1 and in those who received the low vaccine dose than in those who received the high dose. Reactogenicity was lower after the second dose. Neutralizing-antibody titers against wild-type virus were detected in 90% or more of all participants on day 29 after the first vaccine dose (geometric mean titer [GMT], 224 to 354), regardless of vaccine dose or age group, and reached 100% by day 57 with a further increase in titers (GMT, 288 to 488) in cohort 1a. Titers remained stable until at least day 71. A second dose provided an increase in the titer by a factor of 2.6 to 2.9 (GMT, 827 to 1266). Spike-binding antibody responses were similar to neutralizing-antibody responses. On day 14, CD4+ T-cell responses were detected in 76 to 83% of the participants in cohort 1 and in 60 to 67% of those in cohort 3, with a clear skewing toward type 1 helper T cells. CD8+ T-cell responses were robust overall but lower in cohort 3. CONCLUSIONS: The safety and immunogenicity profiles of Ad26.COV2.S support further development of this vaccine candidate.

The COVID-19 outbreak has posed a serious challenge for many commercial establishments, including the retails, which have struggled to adapt to new working dynamics. Retails have been forced to adjust their service guidelines to comply with biosecurity protocols, ensuring to observe governmental and public health policies. A significant change for the retail market has been the capacity restrictions to ensure social distancing, i.e., a limitation on the number of customers simultaneously shopping in the store. Such a constraint has an impact on the throughput that can be achieved by a retail. This article assesses the impact of the capacity restriction measures on an Amazon Go-like retail performance through a throughput analysis under COVID-19-related capacity restrictions. For the assessment, we first retrieved real data from a retail located in Cartagena, Colombia. Two scenarios were considered: i) low demand and ii) high demand. Further, we built an Amazon Go-like, two-queue, M/M/c/K retail model with a CONWIP (Constant Work-In-Process) approach, considering biosecurity-based capacity restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The R package queueing was used to set up the model, and an algorithm was created to go over each sampling period and find the hourly optimum capacity and throughput under the dynamic conditions of both scenarios (low and high demand). Results from the performance analysis show that, for some operational conditions, the optimum maximum throughput is achieved with capacities below the biosecurity-based capacity, while for some other operational conditions the maximum throughput cannot be achieved with the restrictions, as the optimum capacity lies beyond the biosecurity-based capacity. These results suggest that the maximum capacity definition should not be static.

In this report, our aim was to assess the associations of the PCT level with DIC and the severity of COVID-19 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this cross-sectional, retrospective study, 71 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 (21 with DIC and 50 without DIC) were enrolled in the study. The PCT level was obtained from hospital records. RESULTS The PCT level was significantly higher in the patients with DIC than in those without DIC [1.9 (0.6-14.5) vs. 0.3 (0.2-0.4) (ng/mL), p<0.01]. The PCT level showed a positive and significant correlation with DIC (r=0.382, p=0.001) and was an independent predictor of DIC in patients with severe COVID-19 (OR: 6.685, CI: 1.857-24.063, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS In summary, the PCT level was increased in severe COVID-19 patients with DIC compared with those without DIC. An increased PCT level might suggest the presence of DIC and may help in predicting COVID-19 severity.","output":"Procalcitonin is a predictor of disseminated intravascular coagulation in patients with fatal COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There has been increased telemedicine use secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study was to assess patient/parent satisfaction with their telemedicine experience, gauge provider perspective on telemedicine for the management of pediatric colorectal disease and evaluate the quality of telemedicine care being provided. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed at a single institution from March 2020-February 2021. Patients who completed a patient/parent telemedicine survey after a telemedicine appointment and nurse practitioners/surgeons who completed a provider telemedicine survey were included. Patient and provider characteristics and responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Differences between the levels of provider confidence to provide telemedicine care were analyzed using Pearson's chi-square test. RESULTS: 118 patients/parents completed the survey. The median age of patients was 7 years. Most patients were male (59%) and White (73%). The most common diagnosis was anorectal malformation (49%). 71% of parents felt the telemedicine visit was as effective or better than an in-person visit and over 70% said they prefer a telemedicine visit to an in-person visit. Ten surgeons and 8 nurse practitioners completed the provider survey. 28% had previous telemedicine experience and 94% planned to continue offering telemedicine appointments. Providers felt significantly more confident performing clinical duties via video telemedicine compared to telephone telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine is a useful adjunct or alternative in pediatric surgery for complex patients who require multidisciplinary care.

In this work, we use magnetic-based localization. As Earths geomagnetic field is stable in time and is not affected by nonmagnetic materials, such as a large number of people in the robots surroundings, magnetic-based localization is ideal for service robotics in supermarkets, hotels, etc. A common approach for magnetic-based localization is to first create a magnetic map of the environment where the robot will be deployed. For this, magnetic samples acquired a priori are used. To generate this map, the collected data is interpolated by training a Gaussian Process Regression model. Gaussian processes are nonparametric, data-drive models, where the most important design choice is the selection of an adequate kernel function. These models are flexible and generate mean predictions as well as the confidence of those predictions, making them ideal for their use in probabilistic approaches. However, their computational and memory cost scales poorly when large datasets are used for training, making their use in large-scale environments challenging. The purpose of this study is to: (i) enable magnetic-based localization on large-scale environments by using a sparse representation of Gaussian processes, (ii) test the effect of several kernel functions on robot localization, and (iii) evaluate the accuracy of the approach experimentally on different large-scale environments.","output":"Development of Magnetic-Based Navigation by Constructing Maps Using Machine Learning for Autonomous Mobile Robots in Real Environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Investigating the viability of alternative food networks (AFNs) is more important than before because of the disruptions in global supply chains and evolving resident composition in different regions In this regard, this paper reports on findings of a project aimed at identifying factors influencing support for local, sustainable food production, and distribution systems In the first phase, local residents and international students in Cape Breton, Canada, were surveyed prior to the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to assess their attitudes and values relative to shopping at farmers markets and buying local In the second phase, mid-pandemic, text mining of Twitter data was used to gauge sentiments related to these same activities The results of our explanatory analysis suggest that the top two factors influencing decisions to buy local farm products were food attributes and supporting community economic development In contrast to previous studies, we included an alternate sample group, namely, international students, and explored the relevance of the social aspect of buying local, e g , meeting the farmer Among our findings from the application of a logistics regression model to our survey data (N = 125) is the suggestion that the senior non-international student residents of the Cape Breton Island were more probable to be in the category of consumers whose perception of an authentic buy-local experience was limited to distribution channels that allowed for the social aspect of buying local, e g , meeting the farmer","output":"Explanatory Analysis of Factors Influencing the Support for Sustainable Food Production and Distribution Systems: Results from a Rural Canadian Community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Switching from conventional strain-specific vaccines to multi-strain or multi-species universal vaccines is both justified and scientifically merited.

METHODS This was a prospective, longitudinal observational study. Adult patients with HNC undergoing RT between March 2017 and August 2018 were recruited. Patients' body compositions were evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and dietary intake was recorded by 24-hour dietary recall at three time points, including baseline (T1), mid-treatment (T2) and post-treatment (T3). Patients were divided into low, middle and high energy intake groups based on the average daily energy intake (DEI). Changes in body weight (BW), fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM) and skeletal muscle mass (SMM) among these three groups were compared. RESULTS From T1 to T3, the median loss of patients' BW, FM, FFM and SMM was 4.60, 1.90, 2.60 and 1.50 kg, respectively. The loss of BW was more dramatic from T2 to T3 than that from T1 to T2. BW loss was mainly contributed by SMM loss from T1 to T2 and by FM loss from T2 to T3. Meanwhile, patients' dietary intake reduced during treatment. High DEI group had a significantly attenuated loss of patients' BW, FFM, SMM and FM compared with the low DEI group.

METHODS a multicenter, prospective, observational study including twelve Argentinian ICUs was conducted between March and October 2020. Inclusion criteria were: adult patients older than 18 years who were admitted to the ICU with a COVID-19 diagnosis were included. Clinical data included comorbidities scores, and nutritional screening tools such as the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), the Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS) 2002, and the modified NUTRIC score (mNUTRIC SCORE) were used. In addition, clinical outcomes including overall mortality, mechanical ventilation (MV) days, and ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS) were recorded. RESULTS a total of 285 ICU patients met our inclusion criteria. Mean age was 61.24 (SD = 14.6) years; APACHE-II, 14.2 (SD = 6.6); Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), 2.3 (SD = 2.3). Most patients were admitted from the emergency room to the ICU. Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes were the most common comorbidities.

BACKGROUND: Violence against nurses is a common problem that persists worldwide. DESIGN: This was a descriptive cross\\\\sectional study. METHODS: An online questionnaire form and the Nursing Professional Commitment Scale were used to collect the data. The study was carried out online during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic between OctoberCDecember 2020. A total of 263 nurses agreed to participate in the study. The STROBE checklist was followed for observational studies. RESULTS: During the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, 8.4% of the nurses stated that they were exposed to physical violence, 57.8% to verbal violence, 0.8% to sexual violence and 61.6% to mobbing. 52.1% of the nurses stated that they thought of quitting the profession during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. The mean total Nursing Professional Commitment Scale score was 71.33  15.05. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that nurses' exposure to physical, verbal and sexual violence during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic decreased compared to before the pandemic. Nurses' exposure to mobbing during the pandemic was found to increase. A statistically significant difference was found between the status of the nurses' exposure to physical violence, verbal violence, and mobbing, working hours, number of patients given care, and their thoughts of quitting the profession. It was found that the status of exposure to physical violence, thinking of quitting the profession and working hours decreased professional commitment. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: In the light of these results, it is recommended that measures to prevent violence should be addressed in a multifaceted way. In managing the pandemic process, the decisions and practices should not be left to the managers' initiative to prevent mobbing.

Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a key transcription factor activated in response to virus infection and is largely responsible for establishing an antiviral state in the infected host. Studies in Irf3-/- mice have demonstrated the absence of IRF3 imparts a high degree of susceptibility to a wide range of viral infections. Virus infection causes the activation of IRF3 to transcribe type-I interferon (e.g., IFN?), which is responsible for inducing the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which act at specific stages to limit virus replication. In addition to its transcriptional function, IRF3 is also activated to trigger apoptosis of virus-infected cells, as a mechanism to restrict virus spread within the host, in a pathway called RIG-I-like receptor-induced IRF3 mediated pathway of apoptosis (RIPA). These dual functions of IRF3 work in concert to mediate protective immunity against virus infection. These two pathways are activated differentially by the posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of IRF3. Moreover, PTMs regulate not only IRF3 activation and function, but also protein stability. Consequently, many viruses utilize viral proteins or hijack cellular enzymes to inhibit IRF3 functions. This review will describe the PTMs that regulate IRF3's RIPA and transcriptional activities and use coronavirus as a model virus capable of antagonizing IRF3-mediated innate immune responses. A thorough understanding of the cellular control of IRF3 and the mechanisms that viruses use to subvert this system is critical for developing novel therapies for virus-induced pathologies.","output":"Transcriptional and Non-Transcriptional Activation, Posttranslational Modifications, and Antiviral Functions of Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 and Viral Antagonism by the SARS-Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The launch of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) in February 2014 capped over a decade of global efforts to develop new approaches to emerging and reemerging infectious diseases-part of the growing recognition that disease events, whether natural, accidental, or intentional, threaten not just public health, but national, regional, and global security interests.

Although ethical recommendations have been published, strategies for dealing with overcapacity of critical care resources have so far not been addressed. OBJECTIVES: Assess expert opinion for allocation preferences regarding the growing imbalance between supply and demand for medical resources. DESIGN: A 10-item questionnaire was developed and sent to the most prominent members of the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC). SETTING: Survey via a web-based platform. PATIENTS: Respondents were members of the National Anaesthesiologists Societies Committee and Council Members of the ESAIC; 74 of 80 (92.5%), responded to the survey. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Responses were analysed thematically. The majority of respondents (83.8%), indicated that resources for COVID-19 were available at the time of the survey. Of the representatives of the ESAIC governing bodies, 58.9% favoured an allocation of excess critical care capacity: 69% wished to make them available to supraregional patients, whereas 30.9% preferred to keep the resources available for the local population. Regarding the type of distribution of resources, 35.3% preferred to make critical care available, 32.4% favoured the allocation of medical equipment and 32.4% wished to support both options. The majority (59.5%) supported the implementation of a central European institution to manage such resource allocation. CONCLUSION: Experts in critical care support the allocation of resources from centres with overcapacity. The results indicate the need for centrally administered allocation mechanisms that are not based on ethically disputable triage systems. It seems, therefore, that there is wide acceptance and solidarity among the European anaesthesiological community that local medical and human pressure should be relieved during a pandemic by implementing national and international re-allocation strategies among healthcare providers and healthcare systems.","output":"Treating patients across European Union borders: An international survey in light of the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective. This research aimed to determine the in-patient expenditure of COVID-19 adult patient s and their out-of-pocket (OOP) payments at the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH) after the new PhilHealth case rate coverage was instituted last 15 April 2020. It also intended to present the preliminary data on the expenses incurred by COVID patients during the initial phase of the pandemic in the country. Methods. This study was a retrospective chart review of admitted COVID-19 patients aged 19 years old and above from 15 April to 14 August 2020 at UP-PGH that availed of PhilHealth COVID-19 case rate benefits package (C19C1-C4). Data were analyzed to extract overall expenses, out-of-pocket (OOP) charges, cost centers utilization, and other hospitalization expenditure sources. Results. Of the 691 COVID-19 patients included during the study period, 55.72% were male, mostly belonging to the 61-70 age range with a median age of 58. The average in-hospital stay was 14.20 days, and 76.99% were under charity services, with the moderate (42.84%) and mild (25.33%) pneumonia cases accounting for 68.17% of the admissions. Total hospital expenses clustered around Php51,000 to 200,000 (~USD 1,041 to 4,156), most spending between Php101,000 to 150,000 (~USD 2,078 to 3,118). The top three cost centers and expenditure sources were pharmacies, personal protective equipment (PPE) usage, and laboratory. The average OOP payment for patients less than 60 years old was higher, ranging from Php 25,899 to Php 44,428.63 (USD 538 to USD 924.44) compared to patients older than 60 (Php4,005.60 to Php 32,920.20 ~ USD 83.35 to 684.98). The most OOP charges were for the age group 19-30, amounting to Php 44,428.63 (USD 924.44). Conclusion. Preliminary findings of this study gave an actual representation of the expenses of COVID-19 patients, which can guide future utilization of the national health insurance during unexpected pandemics. Early price regulation of new therapeutic interventions, diagnostic tests, and medical supplies, e.g., PPEs, disinfectants, air filters, are measures that can be implemented. ? 2021 University of the Philippines Manila.

The objectives of this scoping review were to systematically map the research on strategies aiming to prevent chronic opioid use in these populations and to identify knowledge gaps in this area. METHODS This scoping review is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) Checklist. We searched seven databases and websites of relevant organizations. Selected studies and guidelines were published between January 2008 and September 2021. Preventive strategies were categorized as: system-based, pharmacological, educational, multimodal, and others. We summarized findings using measures of central tendency and frequency along with p-values. We also reported the level of evidence and the strength of recommendations presented in clinical guidelines. RESULTS A total of 391 studies met the inclusion criteria after initial screening from which 66 studies and 20 guidelines were selected. Studies mainly focused on orthopaedic surgery (62,1%), trauma (30.3%) and spine surgery (7.6%). Among system-based strategies, hospital-based individualized opioid tapering protocols, and regulation initiatives limiting the prescription of opioids were associated with statistically significant decreases in morphine equivalent doses (MEDs) at 1 to 3 months following trauma and orthopaedic surgery. Among pharmacological strategies, only the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and beta blockers led to a significant reduction in MEDs up to 12 months after orthopaedic surgery. Most studies on educational strategies, multimodal strategies and psychological strategies were associated with significant reductions in MEDs beyond 1 month. The majority of recommendations from clinical practice guidelines were of low level of evidence. CONCLUSIONS This scoping review advances knowledge on existing strategies to prevent long-term opioid use in trauma and orthopaedic surgery patients. We observed that system-based, educational, multimodal and psychological strategies are the most promising. Future research should focus on determining which strategies should be implemented particularly in trauma patients at high risk for long-term use, testing those that can promote a judicious prescription of opioids while preventing an illicit use, and evaluating their effects on relevant patient-reported and social outcomes.","output":"Strategies aimed at preventing long-term opioid use in trauma and orthopaedic surgery: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study analyzed the spread and decay durations of the COVID-19 pandemic in different prefectures of Japan. During the pandemic, affordable healthcare was widely available in Japan and the medical system did not suffer a collapse, making accurate comparisons between prefectures possible. For the 16 prefectures included in this study that had daily maximum confirmed cases exceeding ten, the number of daily confirmed cases follow bell-shape or log-normal distribution in most prefectures. A good correlation was observed between the spread and decay durations. However, some exceptions were observed in areas where travelers returned from foreign countries, which were defined as the origins of infection clusters. Excluding these prefectures, the population density was shown to be a major factor, affecting the spread and decay patterns, with R(2) = 0.39 (p < 0.05) and 0.42 (p < 0.05), respectively, approximately corresponding to social distancing. The maximum absolute humidity was found to affect the decay duration normalized by the population density (R(2) > 0.36, p < 0.05). Our findings indicate that the estimated pandemic spread duration, based on the multivariate analysis of maximum absolute humidity, ambient temperature, and population density (adjusted R(2) = 0.53, p-value < 0.05), could prove useful for intervention planning during potential future pandemics, including a second COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"Influence of Absolute Humidity, Temperature and Population Density on COVID-19 Spread and Decay Durations: Multi-Prefecture Study in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We investigated impacts of COVID-19 on cardiac rehabilitation (CR) delivery around the globe, including virtual delivery, as well as effects on providers and patients. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a piloted survey was administered to CR programs globally via REDCap from April to June 2020. The 50 members of the International Council of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (ICCPR) and personal contacts facilitated program identification. Results: Overall, 1062 (18.3% program response rate) responses were received from 70/111 (63.1% country response rate) countries in the world with existent CR programs. Of these, 367 (49.1%) programs reported they had stopped CR delivery, and 203 (27.1%) stopped temporarily (mean = 8.3  2.8 weeks). Alternative models were delivered in 322 (39.7%) programs, primarily through low-tech modes (n = 226,19.3%). Furthermore, 353 (30.2%) respondents were re-deployed, and 276 (37.3%) felt the need to work due to fear of losing their job, despite the perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 (mean = 30.0%  27.4/100). Also, 266 (22.5%) reported anxiety, 241(20.4%) were concerned about exposing their family, 113 (9.7%) reported increased workload to transition to remote delivery, and 105 (9.0%) were juggling caregiving responsibilities during business hours. Patients were often contacting staff regarding grocery shopping for heart-healthy foods (n = 333, 28.4%), how to use technology to interact with the program (n = 329, 27.9%), having to stop their exercise because they have no place to exercise (n = 303, 25.7%), and their risk of death from COVID-19 due to pre-existing cardiovascular disease (n = 249, 21.2%). Respondents perceived staff (n = 488, 41.3%) and patient (n = 453, 38.6%) personal protective equipment, as well as COVID-19 screening (n = 414, 35.2%), and testing (n = 411, 35.0%) as paramount to in-person service resumption. Conclusion: Given the estimated number of CR programs globally, these results suggest approximately 4400 CR programs globally have ceased or temporarily stopped service delivery. Those that remain open are implementing new technologies to ensure their patients receive CR safely, despite the challenges. Highlights: - COVID-19 has impacted cardiac rehabilitation (CR) delivery around the globe.- In this cross-sectional study, a survey was completed by 1062 (18.3%) CR programs from 70 (63.1%) countries.- The pandemic has resulted in at least temporary cessation of ~75% of CR programs, with others ceasing initiation of new patients, reducing components delivered, and/or changing of mode delivery with little opportunity for planning and training.- There is also significant psychosocial and economic impact on CR providers.- Alternative CR model (e.g., home-based, virtual) reimbursement advocacy is needed, to ensure safe, accessible secondary prevention delivery.","output":"Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Cardiac Rehabilitation Delivery around the World"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), a leading cause of mortality, mainly affects children in developing countries.

ObjectiveTo describe the clinical practice experience using telemedicine towards COVID-19 and the respective clinical outcomes. MethodsWe performed a pilot open-label non-randomized, controlled clinical trial. The patients were divided into four groups, according severity of symptoms: (1) asymptomatic, (2) mild symptoms, (3) moderate symptoms and (4) severe symptoms, and were followed up for five days, counted from the beginning of the symptoms. A drug intervention was performed in group 3, for which the protocol followed as suggested by the International Pulmonology Societys consensus for adults with moderate symptoms: first day (attack phase) hydroxychloroquine sulfate 400 mg 12/12h; second to fifth day (maintenance phase) 200 mg (half pill) 12/12h. The medication was associated with azithromycin 500mg once a day for five days. For children with moderate symptoms were used: hydroxychloroquine sulfate 6.5 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours in the first day and 3.25 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours from day 2 to 5. The therapeutic response was telemonitored. Group 4 patients were directly oriented to seek hospital care. During the use of the drugs, the patients were telemonitored daily. ResultsOne hundred eighty-seven patients were seen with mean age of 37,6 years ({+/-}15,6). The most frequent symptom was cough (57,6%), followed by malaise (60,3%), fever (41,1%), headache (56,0%), muscle pain (51,1%). Of all the patients that sought telemedicine service in our center, 23% were asymptomatic despite contact with people with probable diagnostic of COVID-19; 29,4% reported mild symptoms, 43,9% moderate symptoms, and 3,7% severe symptoms. It was possible to observe in patients treated their symptoms of COVID-19 (group 3) with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for five days, presented statistically better improvement of the symptoms when compared to those that did not follow the protocol (p = 0.039).

The PFNA cluster, consisting of five core genes, pkb2, fn3, aaa-atp, duf58, tgm, has been found in all gut-dwelling autochthonous bifidobacterial species of humans. The sensory region of the species-specific serine-threonine protein kinase (PKB2), the transmembrane region of the microbial transglutaminase (TGM), and the type-III fibronectin domain-containing protein (FN3) encoded by the I gene imply that the PFNA cluster might be implicated in the interaction between bacteria and the host immune system. Moreover, the FN3 protein encoded by one of the genes making up the PFNA cluster, contains domains and motifs of cytokine receptors capable of selectively binding TNF-. The PFNA cluster could play an important role for sensing signals of the immune system.

COVID-19 survivors often experience psychiatric sequelae, with depressive psychopathology as the leading cause for needing psychiatric intervention [1]. Depressive cognitive distortion is a core feature of major depression, fostering the experience of negative emotions and hampering recovery [2]. Moreover, cognitive biases are well-documented in patients with inflammatory diseases and associated depressive symptomatology [3]. Considering both the high prevalence of clinical depression among COVID-19 survivors and the critical role of cognitive distortions in depression, we consider of crucial importance to investigate cognitive processing biases in COVID-19 survivors. Methods. We studied 729 participants, divided in three groups: (1) 362 COVID-19 survivors;(2) 73 inpatients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD);(3) 294 healthy participants (HC). Severity of depression was self-rated on the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS). Neuropsychological bias toward emotional stimuli and the general negative outlook on the self were tested in a self-description task [4], during which subjects were asked to self-attribute or refuse positive and negative morally tuned adjectives, and latencies and frequencies of attribution were recorded. Depressive dysfunctional attitudes in causal attribution and interpretation of hypothetical events were measured on the Cognition Questionnaire (CQ). We performed homogeneity of slope or separate slopes analysis when appropriate in the context of Generalized linear model (GLMZ), with an identity link function. Likelihood ratio test was computed as a measure of significance for tested effects and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was obtained as goodness of fit measure [5]. Results. 22.4% COVID survivors self-rated their depressive symptoms above the clinical threshold. Bias in speed of information processing significantly predicts self-description in all groups (COVID depressed: Wald W2=19.81;COVID non depressed: W2=15.48;MD: W2=13.65;HC: W2=33.54;all p<0.001). Information processing bias and frequencies of attribution of morally negative elements strongly predicted the severity of self-rated depressive psychopathology (ZSDS scores) (Processing bias: LR 2=40.99, p<0.0001;Frequencies: LR 2=127.89, p<0.0001). Additionally, the cognitive distortion in causal attribution and interpretation of hypothetical events (CQ scores) in depressed post-COVID patients showed intermediate levels of severity in all dimensions between non-depressed post-COVID patients, and MDD (post-hoc Fisher's least significance test: p<0.05 at all comparisons). Moreover, the CQ total score significantly influenced the ZSDS scores (2=84.60, p<0.0001). Interestingly, homogeneity of slope analysis revealed regression slopes were parallel in COVID-depressed and hospitalized MD patient groups in all models, yielding no significant group interaction. Finally, bias in information processing and negative self-description both predicted CQ scores (Latencies ratio: 2=3.91, p=0.0479;Frequencies: 2=42.96, p<0.0001). Conclusions. The breadth of moral self-reproach and the severity of cognitive distortion in evaluating events showed the same association with severity of depression in MDD and in post-COVID depressed patients, distributing along a gradient of severity, thus suggesting that these individual features of depressive cognitive distortion are shared in these conditions and should be addressed as treatment targets in depressed COVID-19 survivors.

CASE PRESENTATION An active male in his nineties with a high level of function, despite several severe chronic diseases, was admitted to Oslo University Hospital after two days of fatigue, fever, dyspnoea and dry cough. He scored qSOFA 1 of 3 points due to high respiratory rate, and SIRS 2 of 4 points due to high respiratory rate and fever of 39.4o C. PCR for influenza virus was negative and he received benzylpenicillin for pneumonia. The chest X-ray taken initially showed no lung affection. On day 5 after symptom debut he was tested for COVID-19 which was positive. He had not been travelling to high-risk areas or been exposed to any known confirmed COVID-19 patients. On the same day, a chest CT scan was performed that showed ground-glass opacities. In subsequent days the patient's health rapidly deteriorated. He developed irreversible respiratory failure with hypoxia without hypercapnia despite substantial oxygen support. Chest X-ray taken on disease day 7 showed progression of consolidations. The patient died 9 days after symptom debut. INTERPRETATION This case illustrates a severe course of COVID-19 with fatal outcome. The patient was also one of the earliest admitted with COVID-19 in a Norwegian hospital and marked a new phase of the epidemic, as he had not been travelling to high-risk areas or been exposed to any confirmed COVID-19 patients.","output":"A man in his nineties with fever and dry cough."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, cyber attacks have been sophisticated and cause serious damages. As one of the solutions for mitigating the damages, the network separation and fine granularity of access controls are effective against attacks. However, the COVID-19 changes human work style, and telecommuting comes to be generally. It may give many chances to attackers for invading the organization's internal network by infecting user's vulnerable home terminals, which are out of control by the organization. To ensure the security of organizations, we propose a dynamic access control system based on the situations of users. The system evaluates communications based on the user's risk and the importance of resources in destination terminals. When a user connects to the organization network from the outside, the system dynamically changes the access controls according to the evaluation results. The such situation requires stricter access controls than usual ones. For example, the communication by the high-risk user and the communication to servers storing important resources are restricted. By applying such dynamic access controls, the system enables us to ensure our network security with maintaining the convenience of users telecommuting.","output":"A Dynamic Access Control System based on Situations of Users"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To Track the source of the infection through an investigation of a clustering of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), and provide scientific basis and Strategy for the effective control of the aggregated epidemic situation of COVID-19.

Clear cut guidelines like ones for trauma surgery and arthroplasty do not exist and the published literature is limited to case reports with a few society guidelines. Given this lack of consensus, we conducted a modified Delphi questionnaire of international experts to provide recommendations on this topic. METHODS: The consensus statements were generated using an anonymised 3 round modified Delphi questionnaire, sent to an international panel of 38 knee surgeons, with an 80% agreement being set as the limit for consensus. The responses were analysed using descriptive statistics with measures like mode, median and box plots. Feedback was provided to all panelists based on responses from the previous rounds to help generate the consensus. RESULTS: Six consensus statements were generated after the three rounds of Delphi. Patient factors, prolonged surgery duration and family history of thrombogenic events emerged as the main points to be taken into consideration for prophylaxis. CONCLUSION: It was established through this study, that there exists a select group of patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery that justify the usage of VTE prophylaxis. The expert responses to most of the questions in different scenarios favoured usage of VTE prophylaxis based on patient factors like advanced age, past history of VTE, smoking, oral contraceptive use etc. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V.

However, data from European centres are scarce. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to characterise the gastrointestinal manifestations of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their disease course. METHODS: Patients admitted at our centre between March and April 2020 with diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. Asymptomatic patients or those without symptom information were excluded. Clinical features, laboratory data and disease severity (mechanical ventilation, intensive care admission or death) were analysed. RESULTS: Two-hundred one patients were included (median age 71 years; 56.2% male). Digestive symptoms were reported by 60 (29.9%) patients during the disease course, being part of the disease presentation in 34 (16.9%). The most frequent were diarrhoea in 36 patients (17.9%). Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms were younger (P = 0.032), had higher haemoglobin levels (P = 0.002) and lower C-reactive protein (P = 0.045) and potassium levels (P = 0.004). Patients with digestive symptoms had less severe disease (28.3 vs. 44.0%; P = 0.038). Regarding liver damage, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was elevated in 65.2% of patients and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in 62.7%, but these patients did not present a more severe disease (elevated AST P = 0.062; elevated ALT P = 0.276). CONCLUSION: A significant portion of COVID-19 patients have digestive symptoms, mostly at presentation.

The emergence of multi-drug-resistant Shigella isolates and the lack of availability of Shigella vaccines have led to the pertinence in the efforts made for the development of new therapeutic strategies against shigellosis. Consequently, designing small-interfering RNA (siRNA) candidates against such infectious agents represents a novel approach to propose new therapeutic candidates to curb the rampant rise of anti-microbial resistance in such pathogens. In this study, we analyzed 264 conserved sequences from 15 different conserved virulence genes of Shigella sp., through extensive rational validation using a plethora of first-generation and second-generation computational algorithms for siRNA designing. Fifty-eight siRNA candidates were obtained by using the first-generation algorithms, out of which only 38 siRNA candidates complied with the second-generation rules of siRNA designing. Further computational validation showed that 16 siRNA candidates were found to have a substantial functional efficiency, out of which 11 siRNA candidates were found to be non-immunogenic. Finally, three siRNA candidates exhibited a sterically feasible three-dimensional structure as exhibited by parameters of nucleic acid geometry such as: the probability of wrong sugar puckers, bad backbone confirmations, bad bonds, and bad angles being within the accepted threshold for stable tertiary structure. Although the findings of our study require further wet-lab validation and optimization for therapeutic use in the treatment of shigellosis, the computationally validated siRNA candidates are expected to suppress the expression of the virulence genes, namely: IpgD (siRNA 9) and OspB (siRNA 15 and siRNA 17) and thus act as a prospective tool in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway.

Children are among the most vulnerable populations due to high ventilation rates, small peripheral airways and developing respiratory and immunological systems. To assess the current knowledge among Italian pediatric pulmonologists on the potential effects of CC on pediatric respiratory allergic diseases, a national survey was launched online from February 2020 to February 2021. The members of the Italian Pediatric Respiratory Society (SIMRI) were contacted by email and 117 questionnaires were returned (response rate 16.4%). 72.6% of respondents were females, 53.8% were academic pediatricians, 42.7% had been working >10 years. Most of the participants were aware of the potential health effects of CC and stated that they had noticed an increase in the incidence (90.6%) and severity (67.5%) of allergic respiratory diseases among their patients. About 61% and 41% of participants respectively felt that there had been an increase in the number of children sensitized to pollen and molds. When applying latent class analysis to identify the features characterizing participants with greater awareness and knowledge of CC-related health effects, two classes were identified: almost 60% of the participants were labelled as \\"poor knowledge\\" and those with greater awareness were older, had longer work experience, and were those using the Internet to gather information about CC.

The data series used are for the UK from 23 March 2020 to 31 December 2020 and for Spain from 14 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. This research adopted the Augmented DickeyCFuller (ADF) test for a stationarity check of the data series, the Johansen cointegration test for determining cointegration among variables, and the vector error correction model (VEC) Granger causality test for directional cause and effect between exogenous and endogenous variables. The VEC model shows a bidirectional relationship between CO(2) emissions and lockdown and a unidirectional relationship with newly confirmed cases and deaths for the UK. The results of Spain confirmed the unidirectional relationship of CO(2) emissions, lockdown, new confirmed cases, and deaths. The Granger causality test reconfirms the relationship of variables except for newly confirmed deaths for the UK and newly confirmed cases for Spain. Conclusively, the pandemic breakout reduced the emission of CO(2). The directional relation of variables supported the short-run relationship of CO(2) emissions with newly confirmed cases and deaths, while a long- and short-run relationship was shown with lockdown.

Over the last two decades, MERS, Ebola, and other emerging infectious diseases each posed unique challenges for applying quarantine ethics lessons learned from the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 outbreak. In an increasingly interdependent and connected global world, the use of quarantine to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19, similarly poses new and unexpected ethical challenges. In this essay, we look beyond standard debates about the ethics of quarantine and state power to explore a key quarantine principle, Reciprocity, and how it is being negotiated by healthcare workers, volunteers, and citizens in the context of the Wuhan, China, quarantine. We analyze Reciprocity through the lens of two Wuhan case studies: (1) healthcare workers, particularly nurses, who are simultaneously essential workers and quarantined citizens, asked by their hospital administration to shave their heads because adequate PPE was not available, and (2) citizen-to-citizen mutual aid societies attempting to fill gaps in essential supplies left unfilled by the state. We analyze social media and video-blogs from Wuhan, on the platforms of Douyin and Sina Weibo, to understand how people define and respond to ethical and legal obligations in the wake of COVID-19. It is no surprise that quarantine principles from the 2003 SARS outbreak are inadequate for COVID-19 and that both infectious disease outbreak responses and ethics must adapt to the virtual age.

Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug's safety profile. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 M) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 M) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.

Bibliographies of included articles were also searched to identify additional relevant studies. STUDY SELECTION: English-language systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized trials, observational studies, and nonhuman data were reviewed, with a focus on the most recent randomized control trial evidence.

DATA SYNTHESIS: Temperature management is common in critically ill patients, and multiple large trials have been conducted to elucidate temperature targets, management strategies, and timing. The strongest data concerning the use of therapeutic hypothermia exist in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, and recent trials suggest that appropriate postarrest temperature targets between 33C and 37.5C are reasonable. Targeted temperature management in other critical illnesses, including acute stroke, traumatic brain injury, and sepsis, has not shown benefit in large clinical trials. Likewise, trials of pharmacologic antipyretic therapy have not demonstrated improved outcomes, although national guidelines do recommend treatment of fever in patients with stroke and traumatic brain injury based on observational evidence associating fever with worse outcomes.

The internet has become an important source of health information for consumers and their families. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to rate the quality of websites with psychosis-related information (to provide clinicians with a basis for recommending material to guide clinical decision-making with consumers and their families), using a validated instrument as well as a purpose-developed checklist, and consider improvement in quality over a 4-year period. METHODS: Two measures of website quality were used: the DISCERN scale and the Psychosis Website Quality Checklist (PWQC). Terms related to psychosis, including psychotic, psychosis, schizophrenia, delusion, and hallucination, were entered into Google, and the first 25 results were analyzed. In total, 6 raters with varying health professional backgrounds were used to evaluate the websites across two time points: January-March 2014 and January-March 2018. RESULTS: Of the 25 websites rated, only the 6 highest ranked websites achieved a DISCERN score, indicating that they were of good quality (51-62 out of a possible 75), while the mean score of the websites (mean 43.96, SD 12.08) indicated an overall fair quality. The PWQC revealed that websites scored highly on availability and usability (mean 16.82, SD 3.96) but poorly on credibility (mean 20.99, SD 6.68), currency (mean 5.16, SD 2.62), and breadth and accuracy (mean 77.87, SD 23.20). Most sites lacked information about early intervention, recreational drug use and suicide risk, with little change in content over time. Stating an editorial or review process on the website (found in 56% of websites) was significantly associated with a higher quality score on both scales (the DISCERN scale, P=.002; the PWQC, P=.006). CONCLUSIONS: The information on the internet available for clinicians to recommend to people affected by psychosis tended to be of fair quality. While higher-quality websites exist, it is generally not easy way to assess this on face value. Evidence of an editorial or review process was one indicator of website quality. While sites generally provided basic clinical information, most lacked material addressing weighing up risks and benefits of medication and alternatives, the role of coercive treatment and other more contentious issues. Insufficient emphasis is placed on detailed information on early intervention and importance of lifestyle modifications or how families and friends can contribute. These are likely to be the very answers that consumers and carers are seeking and this gap contributes to unmet needs among this group. We suggest that clinicians should be aware of what is available and where there are gaps.","output":"The Quality of Internet Websites for People Experiencing Psychosis: Pilot Expert Assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created challenges and opportunities for research. This is especially true for research on essential workers, such as hospital nurses. In adaptation to the pandemic, the current study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a fully remote study to collect data on psychological and behavioral measures such as daily stress and sleep, utilizing ecological momentary assessments (EMA) and sleep actigraphy. Our remote study protocol was conducted through a web platform that provided detailed video and written instructions regarding the study and facilitated virtual onboarding meetings with participants. Outpatient day shift nurses (n=86) responded to a background survey, 84 of whom completed 14 days of EMA and sleep actigraphy. Feasibility was assessed by compliance rates to the 14-day study protocol. Acceptability was assessed by analyzing qualitative feedback provided during onboarding meetings (n=82). The compliance rates of EMA (91.8%) and actigraphy (97.9%) were high. The EMA compliance was higher than that from a pre-COVID, non-remote study of inpatient day shift nurses from the same hospital (86.6%, p=.030). Themes from content analysis were mostly positive with 51.2% reporting easy, clear, simple onboarding process and 16.3% reporting helpful website. Only six participants provided solely negative feedback (e.g., communication problems or technical difficulties/preferences). Our remote study protocol was feasible and well-accepted by nurses. A similar methodology could be used in studies on broader healthcare workers and those caring for aging populations to better understand their unique challenges and develop effective strategies to help them, both during and after the pandemic.","output":"Making the Most of Adversity: A Fully Remote Ecological Momentary Assessment and Actigraphy Study of Hospital Nurses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Object: Our aim is to evaluate the elevation of pancreatic enzymes in COVID-19 patients and their relationship with severity of COVID-19. Method: In this study, 1378 patients with COVID-19 infection were included. Relation of elevated amylase and lipase levels and co-morbid conditions with the severity of COVID-19 were checked. The effect of hemodynamic parameters and organ failures on pancreatic enzymes and their relations with prognosis were statistically analyzed. Results: There were 678 (%49,2) female patients and 700 (50,8%) male patients. Of all patients, 687 (49,9%) had mild, 691 (50,1%) severe COVID-19 infections. Elevated amylase levels were detected in 23% of patients (n:316). 19% (261) of them had a slight (1-3 times) increase in amylase levels, while 4% (55) had a more than 3 times increase in amylase than normal. Only 6% of patients with elevated amylase leves had the acute pancreatitis according to Atlanta criteria. According to univariate and multivariate analyses, elevated amylase levels was found statistically related with severity of COVID-19 (OR:4,37-p <0,001).

MLHO is an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline that implements iterative sequential representation mining and feature and model selection to predict health outcomes. MLHO's architecture enables a parallel and outcome-oriented calibration, in which different statistical learning algorithms and vectors of features are simultaneously tested and leveraged to improve prediction of health outcomes. Using clinical data from a large cohort of over 14,000 patients, we modeled the four adverse outcomes utilizing about 600 features representing patients' before-COVID health records. Overall, the best predictions were obtained from extreme and gradient boosting models. The median AUC ROC for mortality prediction was 0.91, while the prediction performance ranged between 0.79 and 0.83 for ICU, hospitalization, and ventilation. We broadly describe the clusters of features that were utilized in modeling and their relative influence on predicting each outcome. As COVID-19 cases are re-surging in the U.S. and around the world, a Machine Learning pipeline like MLHO is crucial to improve our readiness for confronting the potential future waves of COVID-19, as well as other novel infectious diseases that may emerge in the near future.","output":"Individualized Prediction of COVID-19 Adverse outcomes with MLHO"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective patientCprovider communication is a cornerstone of patient-centered care.

However, studies have shown that vaccine hesitancy remains a significant problem especially in patients with chronic diseases, in part because of a lack of data regarding vaccine safety in these special populations. With this in mind, we investigated rates of vaccine-related side effects and disease flares in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods: We conducted an online survey of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) who were vaccinated from January 23 to October 15, 2021 with COVID-19 vaccines approved in Europe. We collected data regarding patient demographics, disease type, treatment and activity at the time of vaccination, patient-reported systemic side effects, and rates of disease flares and outcomes within 15 days of both vaccine doses. Results: A total of 329 (179 M, 150 F) patients participated in the survey, 162 with CD and 167 with UC. Mean age was 47.1 years (range 19-80). Patients were vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech (46.8%), Moderna (51.7%) or Oxford/AstraZeneca (1.5%). Three patients received only one dose because of recent prior infection, and one patient received a single dose dose due to infection before vaccine cycle completion. At the time of vaccination most patients (63.8%) reported disease remission, 22.8%= mild activity, 12.8%= moderate, 0.6%= severe. Mesalazine monotherapy was reported in 174 patients, 89 were on biologics, 8 were on azathioprine, and 58 were not undergoing treatment at the time of vaccination. Nineteen were on concomitant corticosteroid treatment. After the first dose, the most common side effects were mild: fatigue (38.6%), arthromyalgia (16.7%), headache (14.3%), fever (6.7%) and nausea (1.8%). Side effects after the second dose were more frequent but similar in nature (fatigue= 54.8%, fever= 34.8%, arthromyalgia= 31.7%, headache= 22.8%, nausea= 2.5%). Fourteen patients (4.3%) reported disease flare after the first dose and 26 patients (8%) after the second dose. Characteristiscs of these patients are summarized in Table 1. Most flares were self-limiting and did not require modification in treatment. In the five cases where treatment modification was required, two already had moderate/severe disease at the time of vaccination, one had suspended biologic treatment, and two patients had autonomously suspended maintenance therapy. Conclusion: Disease flares are infrequent and generally self-limiting after COVID-19 vaccination in patients with IBD. Other side effects are mild and comparable to the general population.

However, most nanosystems have been designed using a bottom-up approach, in which the basic components of the nanovector become assembled to achieve complex and specific behaviors. Despite the fine control of formulative conditions, the complexity of these systems often results cumbersome and difficult to scale-up. Recently, biomimetic materials emerged as a complementary or alternative design approach through a top-down strategy, using cell-derived materials as building blocks to formulate innovative nanovectors. The use of cell membranes as nanoparticle coatings endows nanomaterials with the biological identity and some of the functions of the cells they are derived from. In this review, we discuss some of the latest examples of membrane coated and membrane-derived biomimetic nanomaterials and underline the common general functions offered by the biomaterials used. From these examples, we suggest a systematic classification of these biomimetic materials based on their biological sources and formulation techniques, with their respective advantages and disadvantages, and summarize the current technologies used for membranes isolation and integration on nanovectors.

Recent evidence indicates that obesity and metabolic disease can also influence the immune system1-7, although the mechanisms and effects on immunotherapy outcomes remain largely unknown. Here, using two models of atopic dermatitis, we show that lean and obese mice mount markedly different immune responses. Obesity converted the classical type 2 T helper (TH2)-predominant disease associated with atopic dermatitis to a more severe disease with prominent TH17 inflammation. We also observed divergent responses to biologic therapies targeting TH2 cytokines, which robustly protected lean mice but exacerbated disease in obese mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with genome-wide binding analyses revealed decreased activity of nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR) in TH2 cells from obese mice relative to lean mice. Conditional ablation of PPAR in T cells revealed that PPAR is required to focus the in vivo TH response towards a TH2-predominant state and prevent aberrant non-TH2 inflammation. Treatment of obese mice with a small-molecule PPAR agonist limited development of TH17 pathology and unlocked therapeutic responsiveness to targeted anti-TH2 biologic therapies.

Due to veterinary and public health significance, these HPAIVs, as well as low pathogenicity (LP) H5-subtype AIVs having a propensity to mutate into HP viruses, are under epidemiologic surveillance and must be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Our previous work provided a unique panel of 6 different monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against H5 hemagglutinin (HA), which meets the demand for high-specificity tools for monitoring AIV infection and vaccination in poultry. In this study, we selected one of these mAbs to develop an epitope-blocking (EB) ELISA for detecting H5 subtype-specific antibodies in chicken sera (H5 EB-ELISA). METHODS: In the H5 EB-ELISA, H5 HA protein produced in a baculovirus-expression vector system was employed as a coating antigen, and the G-7-27-18 mAb was employed as a blocking antibody. The performance characteristics of the assay were evaluated by testing 358 sera from nonimmunized chickens and chickens immunized with AIVs of the H1CH16 subtypes or recombinant H5 HA antigen to obtain the reference and experimental antisera, respectively. The samples were classified as anti-H5 HA positive or negative based on the results of the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, the gold standard in subtype-specific serodiagnosis. RESULTS: The H5 EB-ELISA correctly discriminated between the anti-H5 HA negative sera, including those against the non-H5 subtype AIVs, and sera positive for antibodies against the various-origin H5 HAs. Preliminary validation showed 100% analytical and 97.6% diagnostic specificities of the assay and 98.0% and 99.1% diagnostic sensitivities when applied to detect the anti-H5 HA antibodies in the reference and experimental antisera, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The H5 EB-ELISA performed well in terms of diagnostic estimates. Thus, further optimization and validation work using a larger set of chicken sera and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis are warranted. Moreover, the present assay provides a valuable basis for developing multispecies screening tests for birds or diagnostic tests for humans.

The clinical presentation and laboratory parameters of febrile patients with a travel history to an endemic region were studied, and the role of the laboratory in the diagnosis was affirmed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Febrile patients presenting with clinical features defining dengue with a history of travel to an endemic area constituted the study group. Serum samples were tested for dengue-specific NS1 antigen and IgM, IgG antibodies. The demographic data were retrieved from the hospital information system. A hematological and biochemical workup was done and the results analyzed using percentage, proportion, mean, and median. RESULTS: Out of 189 febrile patients, 58 were reactive to serological tests for dengue, with 47 (81%) males. The presenting features were chills and rigors, myalgia, cough, sweating, and vomiting. Thrombocytopenia (74.35%), lymphopenia (52.94%), and leucopenia (47.05%) were present in early disease, with AST >34 IU/L in 58.97% of the patients. The NS1 antigen was detectable between three and seven days of fever and the IgM antibodies after five days. The positivities to only NS1, both NS1 and IgM, and IgM alone were 60.34, 27.58, and 10.34%, respectively, and the median duration of fever was five, seven, and ten days, respectively. One case of dengue hemorrhagic fever and one of probable secondary dengue infection with detectable IgG were encountered. CONCLUSION: Dengue fever remains unsuspected in febrile cases in non-endemic regions. History of travel is an essential criterion to suspect dengue.

On reflection of clinical practice during this time, it was noted by the ICU team that the majority of ventilated patients appeared to have lost weight during their stay. Unfortunately, there was no ability to weigh patients during the pandemic, so this weight loss was a subjective observation. Regardless, this observation lead the ICU dietitian to retrospectively audit prescribed versus delivered feed. It was found that only 10% of admissions received the prescribed daily volume of feed within the first 7 days of admission. A further 6% of admissions were within 10% of achieving daily prescribed target volumes. The main reasons for this were proning patients, high gastric residual volumes and the overwhelming nature of the pandemic. Three areas of practice have been highlighted that will improve feed delivery should a second wave occur. 1. A nasojejunal team comprising 20 members of the ICU multidiciplinary team will be established to insert bedside nasojejunal tubes in all ICU patients on admission. 2.

While most GIS work on Covid-19 testing coverage and access has used census tract or ZIP code aggregated data, this manuscript is unique in that it uses individual level demographics and exact addresses to calculate distances actually traveled by patients. METHODS: We used testing data recorded for 9721 patients at 20 sites operating in May-June 2020. The dataset includes detailed age, race and ethnicity, and testing results as well as the exact address of each individual. Using GIS, we estimated changes in testing coverage for minority neighborhoods and calculated the actual distance covered by individuals. Logistic regression and multivariate linear regression were used to identify socio-demographic variables associated with distance travelled to and used of nearest testing site. We used a secondary dataset from drive-through sites to evaluate change in coverage at the census tract level for the metropolitan area. RESULTS: Walk-up sites significantly increased testing availability in New Orleans, and specifically in minority neighborhoods. Both African Americans and Asians were more likely (14.7 and 53.0%) to be tested at the nearest walk-up site. They also covered shorter distances to get tested. Being elderly was also significantly and positively associated with testing at the nearest site. Hispanics, however, were not associated with increased proximity to and use of nearest sites, and they traveled an additional 0.745 km to get tested. Individuals who tested positive also travelled significantly longer distances to obtain a test. CONCLUSIONS: Walk-up sites increased testing availability for some vulnerable populations who took advantage of the sites' proximity, although inequalities appear at the metropolitan scale. As cities are planning community vaccination campaigns, mobile, walk-up sites appear to improve both coverage and accessibility for hard-to-reach populations. With adequate technical (vaccine dose refrigeration) and messaging (addressing reticence to immunization) adaptations, they could constitute a key complementary approach to health facility points of delivery.","output":"Is Covid-19 community level testing effective in reaching at-risk populations?

METHODS AND RESULTS We examined the records of 650 consecutive patients who underwent CTO percutaneous coronary intervention between 2011 and 2014 at 6 experienced centers in the United States. Six hundred and fifty-seven lesions were classified as easy (J-CTO=0), intermediate (J-CTO=1), difficult (J-CTO=2), and very difficult (J-CTO3). The impact of the J-CTO score on technical success and procedure time was evaluated with univariable logistic and linear regression, respectively. The performance of the logistic regression model was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic and receiver operator characteristic curves. Antegrade wiring techniques were used more frequently in easy lesions (97%) than very difficult lesions (58%), whereas the retrograde approach became more frequent with increased lesion difficulty (41% for very difficult lesions versus 13% for easy lesions). The logistic regression model for technical success demonstrated satisfactory calibration and discrimination (P for Hosmer-Lemeshow =0.743 and area under curve =0.705). The J-CTO score was associated with a 2-fold increase in the odds of technical failure (odds ratio 2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.52-2.80, P<0.001). Procedure time increased by 20 minutes for every 1-point increase of the J-CTO score (regression coefficient 22.33, 95% confidence interval 17.45-27.22, P<0.001).

Their colectomies showed severe ulcerative colitis; one demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 by NGS but a negative ISH. Another had an ischemic colon resected as a complication of the COVID-19 course; however, both ISH and NGS were negative. A fourth had a normal-appearing terminal ileum but positive ISH and NGS. The fifth patient had ileal ulcers with SARS-CoV-2 negativity by both modalities. The remaining 20 patients had positive nasopharyngeal tests an average of 53 days prior to procedure. None of their samples demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 ISH positivity, but one was positive on NGS despite a negative nasopharyngeal test. CONCLUSIONS: -Gastrointestinal findings from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients ranged from normal with virus detected by ISH and NGS, to bowel ischemia secondary to systemic viral effects, without evidence of virus in the tissue. No distinct histologic finding was identified in those with gastrointestinal tissue specimens demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 positivity in this cohort.","output":"Gastrointestinal Pathology in Samples from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Positive Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and NF-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway regulate many cellular processes and are essential for immune cells function Their activity is controlled by dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) A comprehensive analysis of publicly available gene expression data sets of human airway epithelial cells (AECs) infected with SARS-CoV-2 identified DUSP1 and DUSP5 among the lowest induced transcripts within these pathways These proteins are known to downregulate MAPK and NF-kappaB pathways;and their lower expression was associated with increased activity of MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling and enhanced expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha Infection with other coronaviruses did not have a similar effect on these genes Interestingly, treatment with chloroquine and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs counteracted the SARS-CoV-2 induced reduction of DUSP1 and DUSP5 genes expression Therapeutically, impeding this evasion mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 may help control the exaggerated activation of these immune regulatory pathways during a COVID-19 infection","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Switches 'on' MAPK and NFkappaB Signaling via the Reduction of Nuclear DUSP1 and DUSP5 Expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The results of chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention (CTO-PCI) trials are inconclusive. Therefore, we studied whether CTO-PCI leads to improvement of clinical endpoints and patient symptoms when combining all available randomised data. METHODS AND RESULTS This meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO prior to starting. We performed a literature search and identified all randomised trials comparing CTO-PCI to optimal medical therapy alone (OMT). A total of five trials were included, comprising 1790 CTO patients, of whom 964 were randomised to PCI and 826 to OMT. The all-cause mortality was comparable between groups at 1?year [risk ratio (RR) 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-5.80, p = 0.40] and at 4?year follow-up (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.38-3.40, p = 0.81). There was no difference in the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) between groups at 1 year (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.36-1.33, p = 0.27) and at 4 years (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.60-1.22, p = 0.38). Left ventricular function and volumes at follow-up were comparable between groups. However, the PCI group had fewer target lesion revascularisations (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15-0.52, p < 0.001) and was more frequently free of angina at 1?year follow-up (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.50-0.84, p = 0.001), although the scores on the subscales of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire were comparable. CONCLUSION In conclusion, in this meta-analysis of 1790 CTO patients, CTO-PCI did not lead to an improvement in survival or in MACE as reported at long-term follow-up of up to 4 years, or to improvement of left ventricular function. However, CTO-PCI resulted in less angina and fewer target lesion revascularisations compared to OMT.","output":"Percutaneous coronary intervention versus medical therapy for chronic total coronary occlusions: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Many scientific studies provide evidence of mask wearing as an effective strategy to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus. However, US citizens do not adhere to this prevention practice universally. Although past studies have shown disparities in mask wearing by age, gender, ethnicity, and location, the literature lacks a work that uses large-scale national survey data to understand the mask-wearing resistors' characteristics and demographics. This study's purpose is to fill this gap. Methods: We obtained this study's data from the COVID-19 Impact Survey, a nationally representative survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. This survey aims at generating national and regional statistics by surveying representative regional and national samples in three time periods: April 20-26, 2020, May 4-10, 2020, and June 1-8, 2020. Data for our analysis are from the public-use files of these three waves. We performed logistic regressions to estimate the adjusted risk ratio (ARR) of not wearing masks for several personal characteristics and demographics. Results: Our results suggest that younger (average ARR = 1.66) and lower-income (average ARR = 1.51) adults are more likely not to wear a face mask to prevent the coronavirus spread. On the other hand, unhealthy (average ARR = 0.81), female (average ARR = 0.68), and minority (average ARR = 0.65) adults are less likely not to wear a mask. Furthermore, residents in the Northeast region (average ARR = 0.34) and urban residents (average ARR = 0.54) are less likely not to wear a face mask.

Initial Imaging with USS of neck and FNAC or core biopsy has been established to have a high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, CT neck and thorax and MRI scan of the primary tumour are recommended as part of staging scans. Information from this work up guides the MDT and patients towards a tailored management plan. We aimed to compare preoperative imaging work up and TNM staging with post-operative histopathology. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 48 patients who underwent resection and selective neck dissection from January 2020 to August 2021, assessing their initial work up and its adherence to current guidelines. We also evaluated its correlation to final histopathology. Results: 100% compliance was noted with USS and FNAC, 94% compliance with CT and MRI and 96% had incisional biopsy. USS showed a 80 % specificity and a 55% sensitivity. CT had a specificity of 62.5% and sensitivity of 75%. MRI specificity was 58.8% and sensitivity 73.6%. Conclusions: Our results compare favourably to other published data on imaging correlation to histopathology in head and neck oncology.

In a large cohort study Dengvaxia was found to partially protect children who had prior dengue virus (DENV) infections but sensitized seronegative children to breakthrough DENV disease of enhanced severity. In 2019, the European Medicines Agency and the US FDA issued licenses that reconciled safety issues by restricting vaccine to individuals with prior dengue infections. Using revised Dengvaxia efficacy and safety data we sought to estimate hospitalized and severe dengue cases among the more than 800,000 9 year-old children vaccinated in the Philippines.

Assisting these children through a program of enhanced surveillance leading to improved care deserves widespread support. Clinical responses observed during breakthrough dengue infections in vaccinated individuals counsel prudence in design of vaccine policies. Recommendations concerning continued use of this dengue vaccine are: (1) obtain a better definition of vaccine efficacy and safety through enhanced phase 4 surveillance, (2) obtain a valid, accessible, sensitive, specific and affordable serological test that identifies past wild-type dengue virus infection and (3) clarify safety and efficacy of Dengvaxia in flavivirus immunes.

University students were difficult groups to manage of infection control measures. They often had overconfidence to their health, ineffective personal hygiene, and active social activities. Their misperceptions and inappropriate preventive behaviors increase the infection risks to university and community. Understanding university students perceptions of airborne infection management will contribute to the establishment of relevant policies and health education programs. METHOD: This study explored subjective perceptions of airborne infection among university students in South Korea using Q-methodology. Forty university students representing different majors ranked a set of 33 statements reflecting their perceptions of airborne infection. They sorted the statements into a distribution on seven scales ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Collected data were analyzed by the PC-QUANL program. The subjective perception types were extracted by using the principal component analysis. RESULTS: Four type are derived regardingperception of airborne infection: Type I (Government responsibility), Type II (Personal responsibility in self-management), Type III (Strict external management) and Type IV (Comprehensive countermeasures management). Thesefour types accounted for 45.6% of the total variance, and the individual contributions of Types I, II, III, and IV were 27.7, 7.6, 6.2, and 4.1%, respectively.

Currently, there is no approved treatment or vaccine available against it. The current study aimed to cover the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains reported from all over the world and to design a broad-spectrum multi-epitope vaccine using an immunoinformatics approach. Methods: For this purpose, all available complete genomes were retrieved from GISAID and NGDC followed by genome multiple alignments to develop a global consensus sequence to compare with the reference genome. Fortunately, comparative genomics and phylogeny revealed a significantly high level of conservation between the viral strains. All the Open Reading Frames (ORFs) of the reference sequence NC_045512.2 were subjected to epitope mapping using CTLpred and HLApred, respectively. The predicted CTL epitopes were then screened for antigenicity, immunogenicity and strong binding affinity with HLA superfamily alleles. HTL predicted epitopes were screened for antigenicity, interferon induction potential, overlapping B cell epitopes and strong HLA DR binding potential. The shortlisted epitopes were arranged into two multi-epitope sequences, Cov-I-Vac and Cov-II-Vac, and molecular docking was performed with Toll-Like Receptor 8 (TLR8). Results: The designed multi-epitopes were found to be antigenic and non-allergenic. Both multi-epitopes were stable and predicted to be soluble in an Escherichia coli expression system. The molecular docking with TLR8 also demonstrated that they have a strong binding affinity and immunogenic potential.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency and correlates of ST in patients receiving DES, specifically examining the impact of risk factors modifiable by physician and patient behavior. METHODS AND RESULTS Assessment of Dual Anti-platelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents (ADAPT-DES) was a multicenter, prospective study in patients undergoing successful coronary intervention with DES in whom routine platelet reactivity testing was performed. Definite or probable ST occurred in 92 (1.1%) of 8582 patients within 2 years. Independent baseline correlates of ST included presentation with an acute coronary syndrome (hazard ratio [HR]=1.81, P=0.01), insulin-treated diabetes mellitus (HR=1.91, P=0.02), previous myocardial infarction (HR=1.75, P=0.02), and peripheral arterial disease (HR=2.01, P=0.01). Independent treatment-related correlates included use of early generation DES (HR=1.75, P=0.02), no procedural intravascular ultrasound guidance (HR=1.75, P=0.04), and premature discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy (HR=2.67, P=0.003); high platelet reactivity on clopidogrel trended as a correlate of ST (HR=1.49, P=0.08). The 2-year risk of ST ranged from 0.3% to 10.0% when 0 to 3 modifiable risk factors were present. CONCLUSIONS After successful DES implantation, ST occurred within 2 years in 1.1% of patients and was strongly associated with fixed and modifiable risk factors. The frequency of ST may be reduced with intravascular ultrasound -guided stenting, assiduous adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy, and adequate P2Y12 platelet receptor inhibition.

Specifically, beheading shrimp exhibited much more stable characteristics than intact shrimp samples during both chilled and frozen storage. The enzyme activity results suggested that cold temperature and storage induced the release of cathepsin B from the lysosomes to the mitochondria, sarcoplasm, and myofibrils in the muscle tissues. Furthermore, SDS-PAGE and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that beheading the shrimp greatly inhibited the dissociation of shrimp muscle proteins during storage.

This systematic review and meta-analysis of either published or preprint observational or interventional studies were conducted to assess the cure rate, duration of hospital stay, radiological progression, clinical worsening, need for mechanical ventilation, the occurrence of side effects, and mortality. A search of the online database through June 2020 was performed and examined the reference lists of pertinent articles for in-vivo studies only. Pooled relative risks (RRs), standard mean, of 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with the random-effects model. Results: The duration of hospital stay was shorter in the standard care in comparison with HCQ group, the standard mean of hospital stay was 0.57, 95% CI, and 0.20-0.94. Overall virological cure, or more specifically at day 4, 10, and 14 among patients exposed to HCQ did not differ significantly from the standard care [(RR=0.92, 95% CI 0.78-1.15), (RR=1.11, 95% CI 0.74-1.65), (RR=1.21, 95%CI 0.70-2.01), and (RR=0.98, 95% CI, 0.76-1.27)] respectively.

The need for mechanical ventilation (MV) was not significant between the HCQ group and the standard care (RR= 1.5, 95%CI 0.78-2.89). Side effects were more reported in the HCQ group than the standard care (RR=3.14, 95% CI 1.58- 6.24). Mortality among HCQ was not affected by receiving HCQ (RR=3.14, 95% CI 1.58-6.24), meta-regression analysis revealed that country is a strong predictor of mortality. The duration of hospital stay among the HCQ and AZM didn not differ significantly from the standard care (standard mean= 0.77, 95% CI 0.46-1.08).

In the context of contact restrictions, feelings of isolation and loneliness are more prevalent and the regulation of these negative emotions to maintain a positive well-being challenges adolescents. This is especially the case for those individuals who might have a high need to belong and difficulties in emotional competences. The difficult social situation during contact restrictions, more time for online communication and maladaptive emotion regulation might lead to aggressive communication patterns in the form of cyberbullying perpetration. In an online study with N = 205 adolescents aged 14C19 (M = 15.83, SD = 1.44; 57% girls), we assessed the frequency of online and offline contacts, need to belong, emotion regulation problems, feelings of loneliness, and cyberbullying perpetration as predictors of adolescents well-being. In particular, we explored whether cyberbullying perpetration might function as a maladaptive strategy to deal with feelings of loneliness and therefore predicts well-being. This effect was expected to be stronger for those with a higher need to belong and with higher emotion regulation problems. Results of a hierarchical regression analysis revealed that well-being was significantly predicted by less emotion regulation difficulties, less feeling isolated and more cyberbullying perpetration. We also tested whether the need to belong or emotion regulation problems moderated the association between cyberbullying and well-being. While the results for emotion regulation problems were not significant, the moderation effect for the need to belong was significant: For students with a high need to belong, well-being was more strongly related to cyberbullying perpetration than for students with a medium need to belong. For students with a low need to belong, cyberbullying was not significantly associated with well-being. That cyberbullying perpetration predicted well-being positively is rather surprising in the light of previous research showing negative psychosocial outcomes also for cyberbullying perpetrators. The moderation analysis provides a hint at underlying processes: In times of distance learning and contact restrictions, cyberbullying may be a way of coming into contact with others and to regulate loneliness maladaptively.","output":"Can Acting Out Online Improve Adolescents Well-Being During Contact Restrictions?

We conclude their randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial presents statistical evidence, at 99% confidence level, that the treatment of Covid-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine is effective in reducing the appearance of symptoms if used before or right after exposure to the virus. For 0 to 2 days after exposure to virus, the estimated relative reduction in symptomatic outcomes is 72% after 0 days, 48.9% after 1 day and 29.3% after 2 days. For 3 days after exposure, the estimated relative reduction is 15.7% but results are not statistically conclusive and for 4 or more days after exposure there is no statistical evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective in reducing the appearance of symptoms. Our results show that the time elapsed between infection and the beginning of treatment is crucial for the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment to Covid-19.","output":"Efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine as Prophylaxis for Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the feasibility of transanal single port surgery in 15 consecutive patients. BACKGROUND The current method of choice for local resection of rectal tumors is transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), a complex and expensive technique. Single access surgery is easy, relatively cheap, and more broadly applied in laparoscopy. Evidence regarding transanal use of single access ports is scarce. METHODS Consecutive patients with a rectal lesion otherwise eligible for TEM were operated using the Single Site Laparoscopic Access System (SSL) and standard laparoscopic instrumentation. Patient, lesion and procedure characteristics, hospitalization length, and peroperative and postoperative complications were recorded. RESULTS Fifteen patients were planned for single port transanal surgery. In 2 patients (13.3%), intrarectal retractor expansion failed, and conversion to conventional TEM was necessary. The remaining 13 patients were successfully operated. Rectal lesions (mean diameter 36 mm, standard deviation 25 mm, mean distance from the dentate line 6 cm [4.5]) included adenoma in 7 patients, T1 adenocarcinoma in 1, T2 adenocarcinoma in 3, carcinoid in 1, and fibrosis only in 1 (after prior polypectomy). All patients were operated in lithotomy position. Resections were en bloc, full thickness, and had complete margins. Resection specimens measured 65 (35)  52 (24) mm. Twelve rectal defects were sutured. One peroperative pneumoscrotum occurred. Mean operating time was 57 (39) minutes. One patient presented with postoperative hemorrhage, treated conservatively (postoperative morbidity rate 7.7%). Mean hospitalization lasted 2.5 days (2.7).

Such schemes are very important in identifying viruses, especially in view of spreading pandemics. The method is based on genetic code rules and the open reading frame (ORF). Data from the respiratory-related coronaviruses are collected and features are extracted based on reoccurring nucleobase 3-tuples in the RNA. Our methodology is simply based on counting nucleobase triplets, normalizing the count to the length of the sequence, and applying principal component analysis (PCA) techniques. The triplet counting can be further used for classification purposes. DNA sequences from the herpes virus family can be considered as the first step towards a complete and accurate classification including more complex factors, such as mutations. The proposed classification scheme is simply based on counting biological information. It can serve as the first fast detection method, widely accessible and portable to a variety of distinct architectures for fast and on-the-fly detection. We provide an approach that can be further optimized and combined with supervised techniques to allow for more accurate detection and read out of the exact virus type or sequence.

We investigated the relationship between US nursing home-associated COVID-19 infection rates and county-level and nursing home attributes. METHODS: We constructed panel data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) minimum dataset, CMS nursing home data, 2010 US Census data, 5-year (2012-2016) American Community Survey estimates, and county COVID-19 infection rates. We analyzed COVID-19 data from June 1, 2020, through January 31, 2021, during 7 five-week periods. We used a maximum likelihood estimator, including an autoregressive term, to estimate effects and changes over time. We performed 3 model forms (basic, partial, and full) for analysis. RESULTS: Nursing homes with nursing (0.005) and staff (0.002) shortages had high COVID-19 infection rates, and locally owned (-0.007) or state-owned (-0.025) and nonprofit (-0.011) agencies had lower COVID-19 infection rates than privately owned agencies. County-level COVID-19 infection rates corresponded with COVID-19 infection rates in nursing homes. Racial and ethnic minority groups had high nursing home-associated COVID-19 infection rates early in the study. High median annual personal income (-0.002) at the county level correlated with lower nursing home-associated COVID-19 infection rates. CONCLUSIONS: Communities with low rates of nursing home infections had access to more resources (eg, financial resources, staffing) and likely had better mitigation efforts in place earlier in the pandemic than nursing homes that had access to few resources and poor mitigation efforts.

Subsequently, high-quality, on-line, personalized educational content and services are also essential to serve this high demand for learning content. Open Educational Resources (OERs) have high potential to contribute to the mitigation of these problems, as they are available in a wide range of learning and occupational contexts globally. However, their applicability has been limited, due to low metadata quality and complex quality control. These issues resulted in a lack of personalised OER functions, like recommendation and search. Therefore, we suggest a novel, personalised OER recommendation method to match skill development targets with open learning content. This is done by: 1) using an OER quality prediction model based on metadata, OER properties, and content; 2) supporting learners to set individual skill targets based on actual labour market information, and 3) building a personalized OER recommender to help learners to master their skill targets.

OBJECTIVES The authors evaluated parent-observed symptoms of anxiety in preschool children with harmful oral habits during the curfew period in Turkey. MATERIAL AND METHODS The authors prepared a questionnaire with Google Forms that was distributed through social media applications (e.g., WhatsApp) to 405 parents recruited via snowball sampling. To measure children's symptoms and levels of anxiety, the Spence Preschool Anxiety Scale (SPAS) was used. Harmful oral habits that might develop in children during the curfew were investigated. RESULTS Separation anxiety and physical injury anxiety were reported by the parents more frequently than general anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Also, the presence of tantrums (p = 0.010), crying attacks (p = 0.010) and aggression (p = 0.010) were reported by the parents in these children. It was observed that the habits of finger sucking (p = 0.010), nail biting (p = 0.040) and lip biting (p = 0.010) that were present before the curfew decreased significantly after the curfew.

Further, intra-assay and inter-assay precision as well as the limit-of-detection (lod) were defined with quantified target RNA and DNA. The Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-Cov-2 Assay was used as gold standard. Results: Concordance between the ARIES assay and the Cepheid assay was 100% for strongly positive samples and for negative samples, respectively. For weakly positive samples as confirmed applying the Cepheid assay, a relevant minority of 4 out of 15 samples (26.7%) went undetected by the ARIES assay.

About two decades ago, these cells were shown to play relevant roles in the therapy of numerous diseases, dependent on their immune regulation and their release of cytokines and growth factors, with ensuing activation of favorable enzymes and processes. Such discovery induced great increase of their investigation. Soon thereafter, however, it became clear that therapeutic actions of MSCs are risky, accompanied by serious drawbacks and defects. MSC therapy has been therefore reduced to a few diseases, replaced for the others by their extracellular vesicles, the MSC-EVs. The latter vesicles recapitulate most therapeutic actions of MSCs, with equal or even better efficacies and without the serious drawbacks of the parent cells. In addition, MSC-EVs are characterized by many advantages, among which are their heterogeneities dependent on the stromas of origin, the alleviation of cell aging, the regulation of immune responses and inflammation. Here we illustrate the MSC-EV therapeutic effects, largely mediated by specific miRNAs, covering various diseases and pathological processes occurring in the bones, heart and vessels, kidney, and brain. MSC-EVs operate also on the development of cancers and on COVID-19, where they alleviate the organ lesions induced by the virus. Therapy by MSC-EVs can be improved by combination of their innate potential to engineering processes inducing precise targeting and transfer of drugs.

Furthermore, we hypothesize that early treatment with hydroxychloroquine sulphate is associated with more rapid resolve of clinical symptoms as assessed by the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), decreased admission rate to intensive care units and mortality, and improvement in protein biomarker profiles (C-reactive protein, markers of renal and hepatic injury, and established cardiac biomarkers like cardiac troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide). TRIAL DESIGN: The study is a two-arm, open label, pragmatic randomised controlled group sequential adaptive trial designed to assess the effect on viral loads and clinical outcome of hydroxychloroquine sulphate therapy in addition to standard care compared to standard care alone in patients with established Covid-19. By utilizing resources already paid for by the hospitals (physicians and nurses in daily clinical practice), this pragmatic trial can include a larger number of patients over a short period of time and at a lower cost than studies utilizing traditional randomized controlled trial designs with an external study organization. The pragmatic approach will enable swift initiation of randomisation and allocation to treatment.

METHODS: Observational population-based study with longitudinal follow-up in patients with COPD identified in a primary care electronic medical records database in Catalonia, covering 80% of the general population. The aims were to characterize COPD patients who initiated TT and to describe treatment pathways before and after TT initiation. Time to and probability of step down or complete discontinuation of TT was described using restricted mean survival time and Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: A total of 34,018 COPD patients initiated TT during the study period. Of them, 23,867 (70.1%) were GOLD A/B. 18,453 (54.2%) were non-exacerbators, 9931 (29.2%) infrequent exacerbators, 5634 (16.5%) frequent exacerbators and 1923 (5.6%) had asthma-COPD overlap. Drugs most frequently used prior to initiation of TT were long-acting antimuscarinics (22.5%) and combination of long-acting beta2 agonists/inhaled corticosteroids (15.2%). A total of 11,666 (34.3%) stepped down and 1091 (3.2%) discontinued TT during follow-up. Step down following TT was more likely in patients with severe COPD, especially during the first year; however, discontinuation was more common among patients with mild COPD. CONCLUSION: Most patients initiating treatment with TT were non exacerbators and continued on the same treatment over time regardless severity of disease. Stepping down was more frequent in severe patients, while discontinuation was more common among mild patients.

In this context, we propose a coded content placement in a cluster-centric cellular network, which is integrated with the Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) approach to mitigate the inter-cell interference in edge areas. Then, we compute, experimentally, the number of coded contents to be stored in each caching node to increase the cache-hit-ratio, Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), and cache diversity and decrease the usersaccess delay and cache redundancy for different content popularity profiles. Capitalizing on clustering, our second objective is to assign the best caching node to indoor/outdoor users for managing their requests. In this regard, we define the movement speed of ground users as the decision metric of the transmission scheme for serving outdoor usersrequests to avoid frequent handovers between FAPs and increase the battery life of UAVs. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed CCUF implementation increases the cache-hit-ratio, SINR, and cache diversity and decrease the usersaccess delay, cache redundancy and UAVsenergy consumption.

Objectives: To identify priority areas for AI and PC in Ontario, Canada. Methods: A collaborative consultation event engaged multiple stakeholders in a nominal group technique process to generate, discuss, and rank ideas for how AI can support Ontario PC. Results: The consultation process produced nine ranked priorities: 1) preventative care and risk profiling, 2) patient self-management of condition(s), 3) management and synthesis of information, 4) improved communication between PC and AI stakeholders, 5) data sharing and interoperability, 6-tie) clinical decision support, 6-tie) administrative staff support, 8) practitioner clerical and routine task support, and 9) increased mental health care capacity and support. Themes emerging from small group discussions about barriers, implementation issues, and resources needed to support the priorities included: equity and the digital divide; system capacity and culture; data availability and quality; legal and ethical issues; user-centered design; patient-centredness; and proper evaluation of AI-driven tool implementation. Discussion: Findings provide guidance for future work on AI and PC. There are immediate opportunities to use existing resources to develop and test AI for priority areas at the patient, provider, and system level. For larger-scale, sustainable innovations, there is a need for longer-term projects that lay foundations around data and interdisciplinary work.

Amid this global emergency, human civilization is under enormous strain since no proper therapeutic method is discovered yet. A wave of research effort has been put towards the invention of therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19. Contrarily, the spread of this fatal virus has already infected millions of people and claimed many lives all over the world. Computational biology can attempt to understand the protein-protein interactions between the viral protein and host protein. Therefore potential viral-host protein interactions can be identified which is known as crucial information towards the discovery of drugs. In this paper, we have presented an approach for predicting novel interactions from maximal biclusters. Additionally, the predicted interactions are verified from biological perspectives.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on a extend literature review on CSR, BT and BL studies, the authors evaluate the impact of those construct on SMEs performance in an emerging market. The paper follows a quantitative approach. In total, 247 responses were collected from 300 samples. The Smart Partial Least Squares SEM (version) was used to analyze the data of the SMEs of Vietnam in the year 2020. Findings: The findings revealed significant and positive relationships among the variables in the model, such as CSR and firm performance (FP), CSR and BT, CSR and BL, as well as the mediating effect of BT and BL between CSR and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: First, the sample was composed of small business from different segments, thus the respondents' perspective about CSR can differ according the impact of the business on society. Therefore, future studies could address businesses from a single segment to get a deeper understanding of their knowledge and involvement with CSR. Second, a cross-cultural study in emerging countries can be a rich venue for future research. Third, this study was developed through a quantitative approach;thus, the future research can apply qualitative approach or mixed methods to extend the study findings. Practical implications: Managerial level of firm should prioritize noneconomic-related CSR;however, those will ultimately drive financial indicators of FP. The result is reasonable because firm simultaneously keeps committed with its stakeholders by delivering the committed qualification, transparency in operation and consistency in communication, environment respect, employee development and social welfare integrated directly into business activities. Those will result in creating love, trust and admiration from stakeholder, customers for brand and firms will get their engagement and support in many ways. This implication suggests that firm should incorporate CSR strategy into their core business activities and practice properly toward its stakeholders. Social implications: This study contributes to the CSR literature in emerging context by shedding light on the roles of CSR in FP with the mediation roles of BT and BL. Most CSR studies focused on Western context as developed economy, thus less attention has been paid for emerging economy. While there is increasing interest CSR in Vietnam, traditional culture and its distinctive economic and political structure has had a great influence on CSR in Vietnam. Thus, this study is important and meaningful for business practitioners, investors, shareholders and policymakers toward sustainable development for firms and Vietnam as a whole. Originality/value: To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first study that explores the mediating role of BT and BL between CSR and FP for SMEs. The findings of this study may be of great implications to entrepreneurs, top management with respect to strategic perspectives to drive their businesses and to improve their FP in a sustainable direction in contexts of emerging markets. In addition, this finding may be of great interest to motive SMEs' managers to engage with CSR actions where those businesses are situated during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. By that understanding, Government may consider for policy reforms/innovation/groundbreaking to leverage businesses to promote their strengths toward sustainable development in the new economic settings.

The aim of the study is to research the actions of the economic ability of the government as an independent factor of production in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to the unfolding of the process of zombie-ing the economy. The research uses the methods of deduction and induction, analysis and synthesis, analogy and abstraction. The special functions of the government are considered within the context of the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic;particularly, we refer to the recognition of the fifth factor of production of the economic ability of the government. The main features of this atypical crisis are characterized. It is shown that the process of deglobalization during the COVID-19 pandemic characterizes the deglobalization of the economic ability of the government and that this process is temporary, since overcoming the global phenomenon of the pandemic and the economic crisis caused by it requires exclusively global efforts and measures. Particular attention is focused on the financial support of the economy from the economic ability of the government within the context of this economic crisis. The conclusion is that this support contributes to the process of zombie-ing the economy which took on a global character during the global financial and economic crisis of 2007-2009 and continued after its completion. Zombie-ing the economy is the result of a conflict between the political interests of the government and its economic ability when the latter is not able to overcome the barrier created by the former. A solution to this problem is possible through changes in bankruptcy legislation when its main principle of avoiding the unwanted bankruptcy of firms will be replaced by the principle of liquidation of unviable firms. Such a change in bankruptcy legislation can be implemented only during the economic upswing. ?

OSA refers to the concurrent deterioration of bone (osteopenia/osteoporosis), muscle (sarcopenia) and adipose tissue expansion. It portrays the most advanced stage in a continuum of body composition disorders. Although OSA has been widely studied involving the populations of different backgrounds, its prevalence is hard to collate because different methodologies and criteria were used for its diagnosis. Another critical health aspect is the presence of low-grade chronic inflammation (LGCI) which contributes to OSA and vice versa. Nutrition is important in the prevention and management of both OSA and LGCI. Although micronutrients act in numerous metabolic and physiological processes, their roles here are presented in relation to OSA (and its components) and LGCI in general and relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. These include calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium and vitamins D and K; their interactions, physiological ratios and synergism/antagonism are discussed as well. In conclusion, calcium, magnesium and vitamin D have a profound impact on OSA and its components, and the latter two also on LGCI. Potassium and vitamin K are vital in bone, muscle functioning and possibly adipose tissue modification. Both, but particularly vitamin D, surfaced as important modulators of immune system with application in COVID-19 infections. While both phosphorus and sodium have important roles in bone, muscle and can impact adiposity, due to their abundance in food, their intake should be curbed to prevent possible damaging effects.","output":"Osteosarcopenic adiposity syndrome update and the role of associated minerals and vitamins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The measurement of food insecurity is essential to monitor the prevalence, risk factors, consequences and effects of food insecurity and the interventions and policies implemented to tackle it.

In this study, we aimed to assess the incidence and impact of COVID-19 on in-hospital clinical outcome of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients managed with PPCI. This observational retrospective study was conducted on consecutive STEMI patients who presented to the International Cardiac Center (ICC) hospital, Alexandria, Egypt between 1 February and 31 October 2020. A group of STEMI patients presented during the same period in 2019 was also assessed (control group) and data was used for comparison. The inclusion criteria were established diagnosis of STEMI requiring PPCI.A total of 634 patients were included in the study. During the COVID-19 period, the number of PPCI procedures was reduced by 25.7% compared with previous year (mean 30.0  4.01 vs. 40.4  5.3 case/month) and the time from first medical contact to Needle (FMC-to-N) was longer (125.0  53.6 vs. 52.6  22.8 min, p = 0.001). Also, during COVID-19, the in-hospital mortality was higher (7.4 vs. 4.6%, p = 0.036) as was the incidence of re-infarction (12.2 vs. 7.7%, p = 0.041) and the need for revascularization (15.9 vs. 10.7%, p = 0.046). The incidence of heart failure, stroke, and bleeding was not different between groups, but hospital stay was longer during COVID-19 (6.85  4.22 vs. 3.5  2.3 day, p = 0.0025).

Accordingly, establishing additional vaccine platforms remains vital to tackle SARS- CoV-2 and any future variants that may arise.

Whereas MVA is growth-restricted in mammalian cells, the v-NY strain is replication-competent. We demonstrate that both candidate recombinant vaccines induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies in C57BL/6 mice vaccinated according to prime-boost regimens. Furthermore, our vaccination regimens generated TH1-biased immune responses in mice. Most importantly, prime-boost vaccination of a Syrian hamster infection model with MVA-S and v-NY-S protected the hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting that these two vaccines are promising candidates for future development.

In many Western Countries, the populous has not embraced public health advice which has resulted in a resurgence of the COVID-19 virus. In the United States, there is an absence of a coordinated Federal response. Instead, frontline workers and average citizens are having to cope with extensive mixed messaging regarding mask usage and social distancing from the highest levels of government. This has resulted in the United States not being able to achieve a low level of infection since the pandemic began. In addition, many citizens hold a profound belief that individual freedoms must be preserved, even at the expense of public health; and view the wearing of masks as renouncing this right. These engrained political beliefs can be traced back to the late 1800s. The response of the United States has also been hampered by a highly cost-efficient healthcare system, which does not provide universal care and has a just-in-time supply chain, with far too few supplies in reserve. This efficiency prevented a rapid scaling up of the healthcare response, which resulted in severe deficiencies in available personal protective equipment (PPE) and healthcare staff. To compound issues many healthcare staff are not provided an economic or healthcare safety net. Other frontline workers, such as those who work in transportation and food services, are working under even greater adversities. Many of these workers are from diverse backgrounds, who, along with their families, are at even greater risk for COVID-19. This vulnerable population of frontline workers are faced with a choice of going to work with inadequate PPE or placing food on their families' table.

However, with explicit FD devices being placed in patient-specific aneurysm model, the computational domain must be resolved around the thin stent wires, leading to high computational cost in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Classic homogeneous porous medium (PM) methods cannot accurately predict the post-stenting aneurysmal flow field due to the inhomogeneous FD wire distributions on anatomic arteries. We propose a novel approach that models the FD flow modification as a thin inhomogeneous porous medium (iPM). It improves over classic PM approaches in that, first, FD is treated as a screen, which is more accurate than the classic Darcy-Forchheimer relation based on 3D PM. second, the pressure drop is calculated using local FD geometric parameters across an inhomogeneous PM, which is more realistic. To test its accuracy and speed, we applied the iPM technique to simulate the post stenting flow field in three patient-specific aneurysms and compared the results against CFD simulations with explicit FD devices. The iPM CFD ran 500% faster than the explicit CFD while achieving 94%-99% accuracy.

Twenty fecal samples (10/pack) were collected using a sampling protocol, based on the combining data from radio-collared wolves with geographic information system (GIS) analysis, allowing to mark off the home range of packs and to recover group-specific and high-quality specimens. Virological screening against the most prevalent canine viruses (protoparvovirus, distemper virus, adenoviruses, and coronaviruses) was carried out by molecular methods, while parasites were detected by means of copromicroscopic and molecular analysis. Canine parvovirus type 2b (CPV-2b) is the most prevalent virus in both packs (7/20), followed by canine adenovirus type 2 (CAdV-2), while no sequences of canine distemper virus and coronaviruses were detected. The sequence analysis of the viruses demonstrated the domestic origin of the infection, highlighting the importance of vaccination of local dogs in order to reduce the risk of exposure of wildlife to these pathogens.

Its management is still a very challenging task. The purpose of this study was to analyse the risk factors affecting the outcome in a high-volume trauma centre and the efficacy of a specialised trauma team in level 1 trauma centres. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2012, data of all patients admitted to the accident and emergency (A&E) department were prospectively collected at the German Trauma Registry (GTR) and thereafter retrospectively analysed. Patients with chest trauma, an Injury Severity Score (ISS)  18 and an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) > 2 in more than one body region were included. Patients were divided into two groups: group I included patients presenting with thoracic trauma between January 2003 and December 2007. The results of this group were compared with the results of another group (group II) in a later 5-year period (Jan. 2008CDec. 2012). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, and differences with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There were 630 patients (56%) with thoracic trauma. A total of 540 patients (48%) had associated extrathoracic injuries. Group I consisted of 285 patients (197 male, mean age 46 years). Group II consisted of 345 patients (251 male, mean age 49 years). Overall 90-day mortality was 17% (n = 48) in group I vs. 9% (n = 31) in group II (p = 0.024). Complication rates were higher in group I (p = 0.019). Higher Injury Severity Scores (ISSs) and higher Abbreviated Injury Acale (AIS) scores in the thoracic region yielded a higher rate of mortality (p < 0.0001). Young patients (< 40 years) were frequently exposed to severe thoracic injury but showed lower mortality rates (p = 0.014). Patients with severe lung contusions (n = 94) (15%) had higher morbidity and mortality (p < 0.001). Twenty-three (8%) patients underwent emergency thoracotomy in group I vs. 14 patients (4%) in group II (p = 0.041). Organ replacement procedures were needed in 18% of patients in group I vs. 31% of patients in group II (p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of severe lung contusion, a higher ISS and AIS(thoracic) score and advanced age are independent risk factors that are directly related to a higher mortality rate. Management of blunt chest trauma with corrective chest tube insertion, optimal pain control and chest physiotherapy results in good outcomes in the majority of patients.

Methods: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of COVID-19 vaccine in Kenya from a societal perspective over a 1.5-year time frame. An age-structured transmission model assumed at least 80% of the population to have prior natural immunity when an immune escape variant was introduced. We examine the effect of slow (18 months) or rapid (6 months) vaccine roll-out with vaccine coverage of 30%, 50% or 70% of the adult (> 18 years) population prioritizing roll-out in over 50-year olds (80% uptake in all scenarios). Cost data were obtained from primary analyses. We assumed vaccine procurement at $7 per dose and vaccine delivery costs of $3.90-$6.11 per dose. The cost-effectiveness threshold was USD 919. Findings: Slow roll-out at 30% coverage largely targets over 50-year-olds and resulted in 54% fewer deaths (8,132(7,914 to 8,373)) than no vaccination and was cost-saving (ICER=US$-1,343 (-1,345 to -1,341) per DALY averted).

Methods: In our randomized controlled trial, patients who met the ACR criteria for Knee OA were randomized to either a Tai Chi or Wellness Education group and attended 12 weeks of biweekly remote sessions. Semi-structured interviews were audio and videotaped via Zoom or telephone and ranged from 15-20 minutes in length. Interview questions were designed to ensure the exploration of key themes and were tailored for each intervention. Eleven key themes, including perceived benefits, social interaction and engagement, remote administration, and COVID-19 related experiences were identified and analyzed. Results: Thirty-two patients completed interviews. The mean participant age was 66 years, with 65% female. Consensus suggested remote delivery of the intervention was a well-adapted remedy for Knee OA. Specifically, the Tai Chi group reported pain reduction, improved walking ability;the Wellness group incorporated improved knowledge of healthy living skills into their daily routines. Both groups found therapeutic value in the interventions, such as direct benefits of Tai Chi, and indirect benefits of social interaction during an isolating time. Participants also reported enhanced ability to manage stress surrounding the pandemic. Most interviewees expressed general satisfaction. Several key barriers to treating Knee OA were identified, such as difficulty tailoring instructions to individual patients and providing direct feedback. Conclusions: This study confirmed the feasibility of a remote-delivered behavioral intervention for Knee OA during the pandemic. Despite the challenges of this novel experience, the perceived intervention benefits are comparable to those found in prior, in-person studies.

Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with functional independence defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-2 at day 90, and secondary injury volumes: Edema volume in follow-up imaging measured using quantitative net water uptake (NWU), and the rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH). A total of 219 patients were included and 128 (58%) patients received bridging IVT before thrombectomy. The proportion of patients with functional independence was 28% for patients with bridging IVT, and 34% for patients with direct thrombectomy (p = 0.35). The rate of sICH was significantly higher after bridging IVT (20% versus 7.7%, p = 0.01). Multivariable logistic and linear regression analysis confirmed the independent association of bridging IVT with sICH (aOR: 2.78, 95% CI: 1.02-7.56, p = 0.046), and edema volume (aOR: 8.70, 95% CI: 2.57-14.85, p = 0.006). Bridging IVT was associated with increased edema volume and risk for sICH as secondary injury volumes. The results of this study encourage direct EVT approaches, particularly in patients with higher likelihood of successful EVT.","output":"Effect of Intravenous Alteplase on Functional Outcome and Secondary Injury Volumes in Stroke Patients with Complete Endovascular Recanalization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Around the world, policymakers and news reports have warned that domestic violence (DV) could increase as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant restrictions on individual mobility and commercial activity.

Since morbid curiosity has previously been associated with horror media use during the COVID-19 pandemic, we also tested whether trait morbid curiosity was associated with pandemic preparedness and psychological resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that fans of horror films exhibited greater resilience during the pandemic and that fans of prepper genres (alien-invasion, apocalyptic, and zombie films) exhibited both greater resilience and preparedness. We also found that trait morbid curiosity was associated with positive resilience and interest in pandemic films during the pandemic.

We also describe techniques that help overcome difficulties involved in this procedure. DESIGN Retrospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). SETTING University medical center. PATIENTS Two hundred thirty-four patients underwent LESS-TLH for benign uterine disease and cervical disease between September 2011 and February 2015. Thirty-seven patients (15.8%) were excluded from analysis. One hundred ninety-seven patients were divided into 2 groups according to the total operative time (median, 150 minutes): <150 minutes (n = 93) and 150 minutes (n = 104). INTERVENTIONS LESS-TLH was performed using anterior, lateral, and posterolateral colpotomy techniques, and knife-in-bag morcellation was used for specimen extraction. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patient characteristics, except for body mass index (BMI) and age, were generally similar in the 2 groups. Age, BMI, adhesiolysis, time to completion of colpotomy, stump repair time, specimen extraction time, blood loss, and weight of the uterus showed statistically significant differences between the 2 groups. Clinical factors that affected operative time were adhesiolysis of the posterior uterus (p = .010), time to completion of colpotomy (>65 minutes; p = .000), specimen extraction time (>34.4 minutes; p = .000), and weight of the uterus (>270 g; p = .015). Conversion to additional port laparoscopy occurred in 14 patients (5.98%). Conversion to laparotomy occurred in 1 patient (.43%). The surgical complication rates were 3.2% (3 patients) in the <150 minutes group and 3.8% (4 patients) in the 150 minutes group. No urologic injuries occurred in either group. One postoperative ileus occurred in the 150 minutes group; it was relieved by conservative treatment. CONCLUSION Time to completion of colpotomy was influenced by adhesiolysis of the posterior uterus and specimen extraction time by weight of the uterus. Alternative methods for decreasing the time required to extract a large uterus and for approaching posterior adhesion of the uterus are needed for LESS-TLH.","output":"Laparoendoscopic Single-Site Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy: Clinical Factors that Affect Operative Times and Techniques to Overcome Difficulties."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection spread worldwide. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to identify the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with severe incidence of SARS -CoV-2 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All adult patients (median [IQR] age, 52 [37-58] years) consecutively admitted to the Dabieshan Medical Center from January 30, 2020 to February 11, 2020 were collected and reviewed. Only patients diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization interim guidance were included in this retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Twenty-five patients (23.1%) developed severe disease, and of those 12 patients (48%) died. Advanced age, comorbidities (most commonly hypertension), higher blood leukocyte count, neutrophil count, higher C-reactive protein level, D-dimer level, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were associated with greater risk of COVID-19, and so were lower lymphocyte count and albumin level. Multivariable regress ion showed increasing odds of severe COVID-19 associated with higher SOFA score (odds ratio [OR], 2.45; 95% CI, 1.302-4.608; P = 0.005), and lymphocyte count less than 0.8  109/l (OR, 9.017; 95% CI, 2.808-28.857; P <0.001) on admission.

Donor-derived cell-free DNA (-cfDNA), which can be quantified, for example, through next-generation sequencing, droplet digital PCR and quantitative PCR, is a candidate biomarker with great potential for enabling comprehensive monitoring of allograft injury. -cfDNA has a favourable overall diagnostic performance for the detection of rejection and its high negative predictive value might be especially useful for avoiding unnecessary biopsies. Elevated -cfDNA levels have been shown to be detectable before graft injury can be clinically identified using current diagnostic methods. Moreover, -cfDNA falls rapidly to baseline levels after successful treatment for rejection owing to its short half-life. -cfDNA can detect graft injury caused by immune activation owing to insufficient immunosuppression and might therefore also help guide immunosuppression dosing. The fractional abundance of -cfDNA can be affected by changes in the recipient cfDNA (for example, due to infection or physical exercise) but the use of absolute quantification of -cfDNA overcomes this limitation.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify potential FDA approved drugs that can be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment using an in-silico analysis. METHODS: In this study, virtual screening of selected FDA approved drugs was performed by targeting the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 and the key molecules involved in the 'Cytokine storm' in COVID-19 patients. Based on our preliminary screening supported by extensive literature search, we selected FDA approved drugs to target the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and the key players of cytokine storm, TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and IL-1?. These compounds were examined based on systematic docking studies and further validated using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanic/generalized/Born/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/G/P/BSA) free energy calculations. RESULTS: Based on the findings, Rifampicin and Letermovir appeared as the most promising drug showing a very good binding affinity with the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and IL-1?.

METHODS: The sEHR was reviewed by medical students and subsequently discussed with a supervising physician using an online meeting system. In the e-PBL, medical students reviewed the simulated patients and discussed on the LMS. For the online-VMI, a faculty member acted as an outpatient and a student acted as the doctor. Small groups of students discussed the clinical reasoning process using the online meeting system. A mixed-method design was implemented. Medical students self-assessed their clinical competence before and after the online-sCP. They answered questionnaires and participated in semi-structured focus group interviews (FGIs) regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the practice. RESULTS: Forty-three students completed the online-sCP during May and June 2020. All students indicated significant improvement in all aspects of self-evaluation of clinical performance after the online-sCP. Students using sEHR reported significant improvement in writing daily medical records and medical summaries. Students using e-PBL and online-VMI reported significant improvement in medical interviews and counseling. Students also indicated CCs as more useful for learning associated with medical interviews, physical examinations, and humanistic qualities like professionalism than the online-sCP.

The similarity objective, however, is not sufficient in applications where a fair-representation of the groups in terms of protected attributes like gender or race, is required for each cluster. Moreover, in many applications, to make the clusters useful for the end-user, a balanced cardinality among the clusters is required. Our motivation comes from the education domain where studies indicate that students might learn better in diverse student groups and of course groups of similar cardinality are more practical e.g., for group assignments. To this end, we introduce the fair-capacitated clustering problem that partitions the data into clusters of similar instances while ensuring cluster fairness and balancing cluster cardinalities. We propose a two-step solution to the problem: i) we rely on fairlets to generate minimal sets that satisfy the fair constraint and ii) we propose two approaches, namely hierarchical clustering and partitioning-based clustering, to obtain the fair-capacitated clustering. The hierarchical approach embeds the additional cardinality requirements during the merging step while the partitioning-based one alters the assignment step using a knapsack problem formulation to satisfy the additional requirements.

BACKGROUND: Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, shifting to virtual learning that implies utilizing the information and communication technologies (ICTs) is urgent. Technostress is a problem commonly arising in the virtual working environments and it occurs due to misfitting and maladaptation between the individual and the changeable requirements of ICTs. METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted in medicine and nursing colleges of 5 Egyptian universities and included both staff members and students. The data were collected through personal interviews, from January to May 2021. All the participants took a four-part questionnaire that asked about personal and demographic data, technostress creators, job or study, and technical characteristics and technostress outcomes (burnout, strain, and work engagement). Furthermore, participants' blood cortisol and co-enzyme Q10 (CoQ10) levels were tested in a random sample of the students and medical staff. RESULTS: A total of 3,582 respondents participated in the study, 1,056 staff members and 2,526 students where 33.3% of the staff members and 7.6% of students reported high technostress. Among staff members, total technostress score significantly predicted Cortisol level ( = 2.98, CI 95%: 0.13-5.83), CoQ10( = ?6.54, CI 95%: [(?8.52)C(?4.56), strain ( = 1.20, CI 95%: 0.93C1.47), burnout ( = 0.73, CI 95%: 0.48C0.97) and engagement ( = ?0.44, CI 95%: [(?0.77)C(?0.11)]) whereas among students, total technostress score significantly predicted cortisol level ( = 6.64, CI 95%: 2.78C10.49), strain ( = 1.25, CI 95%: 0.72C1.77), and burnout ( = 0.70, CI 95%: 0.37C1.04). Among staff members and students, technology characteristics were significantly positive predictors to technostress while job characteristics were significantly negative predictors to technostress. CONCLUSION: The Egyptian medical staff members and students reported moderate-to-high technostress which was associated with high burnout, strain, and cortisol level; moreover, high technostress was associated with low-work engagement and low CoQ10 enzyme. This study highlighted the need to establish psychological support programs for staff members and students during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Technostress Creators and Outcomes Among Egyptian Medical Staff and Students: A Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study of Remote Working Environment During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Several studies highlighted that sleepiness affects driving abilities. In particular, road traffic injuries due to excessive daytime sleepiness are about 10C20%. Considering that aging is related to substantial sleep changes and the number of older adults with driving license is increasing, the current review aims to summarize recent studies on this issue. Further, we intend to provide insights for future research. Methods: From the 717 records screened, ten articles were selected and systematically reviewed. Results: Among the selected articles, (a) five studies investigated sleepiness only by self-reported standardized measures; (b) two studies assessed sleepiness also using a behavioral task; (c) three studies obtained objective measures by electroencephalographic recordings. Conclusions: The available literature on the topic reports several limitations. Overall, many findings converge in evidencing that older drivers are less vulnerable to sleep loss and sleepiness-related driving impairments than young adults. These discrepancies in sleepiness vulnerability between age groups may be ascribed to differences in subjects lifestyles. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that older adults self-regulate their driving and avoid specific dangerous situations. We believe that an easy protocol to objectively evaluate the vigilance level in elderly and young adults is required, and further studies are needed.","output":"Age-Related Effect of Sleepiness on Driving Performance: A Systematic-Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Buprenorphine-based medication-assisted treatment (B-MAT) is a powerful, concrete intervention that can be provided by nurse practitioners (NPs) to reduce opioid-related overdoses in patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). However, multiple barriers exist to provide and access this therapy. LOCAL PROBLEM: A rural Midwestern county struggled with increasing OUD and scant access to B-MAT. A nurse-led, community clinic had the potential to expand access to treatment but no support structure to provide it. METHODS: In this quality improvement project, a one-group posttest-only design was used to assess treatment access, care quality, and patient characteristics. INTERVENTIONS: An evidence-based, nurse led weekly B-MAT clinic using a low-threshold, chronic-care model for treatment of OUD. RESULTS: The B-MAT clinic expanded county-wide access by 34% over seven months. A total of 23 patients were seen with 21 eligible for treatment with B-MAT. All nine patients with at least 90-day continuous treatment were retained in the program. Three quarters of patients had at least 30 days of active buprenorphine-naloxone coverage and 17% of all patients were lost to follow up. There were no induction-related adverse events, no fatalities, and one nonfatal overdose. In a chart review, 85% of patients met at least six of eight quality criteria. CONCLUSIONS: This low-barrier approach to OUD expanded access to treatment and demonstrated a model stable enough to continue delivering care throughout the first 5 months of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. NPs in primary care settings can effectively provide B-MAT in a low-threshold, office-based setting.","output":"Implementation of office-based buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess the diagnostic accuracy of rapid point-of-care tests for diagnosis of current SARS-CoV-2 infections in children under real-life conditions. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database for Systematic Reviews, INAHTA HTA database, preprint servers (via Europe PMC), ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP from 1 January 2020 to 7 May 2021; NICE Evidence Search, NICE Guidance, FIND Website from 1 January 2020 to 24 May 2021. REVIEW METHODS: Diagnostic cross-sectional or cohort studies were eligible for inclusion if they had paediatric study participants and compared rapid point-of care tests for diagnosing current SARS-CoV-2 infections with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as the reference standard. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess the risk of bias and the applicability of the included studies. Bivariate meta-analyses with random effects were performed. Variability was assessed by subgroup analyses. RESULTS: 17 studies with a total of 6355 paediatric study participants were included. All studies compared antigen tests against RT-PCR. Overall, studies evaluated eight antigen tests from six different brands. Only one study was at low risk of bias. The pooled overall diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in paediatric populations was 64.2% (95% CI 57.4% to 70.5%) and 99.1% (95% CI 98.2% to 99.5%), respectively. In symptomatic children, the pooled diagnostic sensitivity was 71.8% (95% CI 63.6% to 78.8%) and the pooled diagnostic specificity was 98.7% (95% CI 96.6% to 99.5%). The pooled diagnostic sensitivity in asymptomatic children was 56.2% (95% CI 47.6% to 64.4%) and the pooled diagnostic specificity was 98.6% (95% CI 97.3% to 99.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The performance of current antigen tests in paediatric populations under real-life conditions varies broadly. Relevant data were only identified for very few antigen tests on the market, and the risk of bias was mostly unclear due to poor reporting. Additionally, the most common uses of these tests in children (eg, self-testing in schools or parents testing their toddlers before kindergarten) have not been addressed in clinical performance studies yet. The observed low diagnostic sensitivity may impact the planned purpose of the broad implementation of testing programmes.

We developed a simple, inexpensive module that connects touchless dispensers of alcohol sanitiser (TDAS) to the automatic doors of a paediatric ICU, and assessed the impact of this intervention on HH compliance of hospital staff and visitors. A prospective observational study was conducted over a 3-week period prior to the intervention, followed by a 4-week period post intervention. HH performance was monitored by a research assistant whose office location enabled direct and video-assisted observation of the ICU entrance. A total of 609 entries to the ICU was recorded. Overall HH performance was 46.9% (92/196) before and 98.5% (406/413) after the intervention. Our findings suggest that HH performance on entering an ICU can be improved via a mechanism that makes operation of an automatic door dependent on use of a TDAS system, and thus contribute to infection control.","output":"Perform hand hygiene and the doors will open C the effectiveness of new system implementation on paediatric intensive care unit visitors handwashing compliance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Presently, Indian sectors are manifesting a higher level of interdependency and making the economy more vulnerable to human-caused and natural disasters. COVID-19 pandemic creates a devastating effect on the world economy. The Indian economy was expected to lose around ? 32,000 crores every day during the first 21 days of complete lockdown. This motivates to conduct the research on how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the port logistics sector and how the effects of COVID-19 on port logistics propagate to other sectors owing to its interconnectedness and affect the economy of the country. Design/methodology/approach: The purpose of the study is analyze how perturbation in one sector can affect the system of interdependent sectors and it is done with interdependency analysis. It uses Wassily Leontiefs inoperability input-output model (IIM) and interval programming (IP) to develop a framework. IP is used to address situations where assumptions are not valid because of uncertainties associated with disruptive events. Findings: The model helps in describing how the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in port logistics can propagate owing to the interconnectedness across other sectors. The model uses the latest five-year data available on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development database. It uses metrics like inoperability and economic loss to study the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic on various sectors. This study also presents the ranking of the affected sectors based on their inoperability and economic loss Research limitations/implications: In the future study, other techniques like dynamic evolution, multiplex network analysis, analytical hierarchy process, pinch analysis, stochastic evolution and pinch graph could be integrated with input-output (I-O) modelling. Integrated stochastic evolution with an I-O model allows capturing the likelihood of the events;it includes probability distributions instead of point estimates for scenario parameters. Methods like dynamic evolution and multiplex network analysis can be introduced in future work to shed lights on interdependency among the sector, which could potentially provide additional insights for transport policy formulations. Originality/value: This study discusses the theory, methodology and application of the IIM-IP model in the domain of port logistics. The developed IIM-IP model helps decision-makers to manage risk in port logistics. Firstly, it studies how different sectors are interconnected with each other. Secondly, it helps in identifying the most vulnerable sectors based on economic loss and inoperability. Thirdly, it provides the ranking of the sectors based on their economic losses. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"A scenario-based interval-input output model to analyze the risk of COVID-19 pandemic in port logistics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic risk factors for developing severe COVID-19 symptoms.

It is of considerable significance to utilize a new generation of information technology to improve the artificial intelligence level of respiratory disease diagnosis. Methods: Based on the semi-structured data of Chinese Electronic Medical Records (CEMRs) from the China Hospital Pharmacovigilance System, this paper proposed a bi-level artificial intelligence model for the risk classification of acute respiratory diseases. It includes two levels. The first level is a dedicated design of the BiLSTM+Dilated Convolution+3D Attention+CRF deep learning model that is used for Chinese Clinical Named Entity Recognition (CCNER) to extract valuable information from the unstructured data in the CEMRs. Incorporating the transfer learning and semi-supervised learning technique into the proposed deep learning model achieves higher accuracy and efficiency in the CCNER task than the popular Bert+BiLSTM+CRF approach. Combining the extracted entity data with other structured data in the CEMRs, the second level is a customized XGBoost to realize the risk classification of acute respiratory diseases. Results: The empirical study shows that the proposed model could provide practical technical support for improving diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion: Our study provides a proof-of-concept for implementing a hybrid artificial intelligence-based system as a tool to aid clinicians in tackling CEMR data and enhancing the diagnostic evaluation under diagnostic uncertainty.","output":"Bi-level artificial intelligence model for risk classification of acute respiratory diseases based on Chinese clinical data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Depression is one of the most common mental health problems in Pakistani women, with prevalence rates estimated to be above 30%.

METHODS Data were obtained from the prospectively-defined Fight Retinal Blindness! registry. Treatment interval at 2 years was stratified based on the mean treatment interval over the three visits prior to and including the 2-year visit. Rates of non-persistence to follow-up were assessed from 2 to 5 years. RESULTS Data from 1538 eyes were included. The overall rate of non-persistence was 51% at 5 years. Patients on longer treatment intervals (12-weeks) at 2 years were found to be less persistent to long-term follow-up. These eyes were found to have fewer active disease visits in the first 2 years (40%) than eyes treated at 4-weekly intervals (66%, p < 0.001). In the multivariable analysis, better vision at 2 years was associated with a lower risk of non-persistence (hazards ratio [HR] [95% CI]: 0.95 [0.93, 0.97], P < 0.001), while longer treatment intervals (HR [95% CI]: 1.31 [0.95, 1.8] and 1.54 [1.15, 2.06] for 12-week and > 12-week intervals vs. 4-week intervals, respectively, P = 0.002) and older patients (HR [95% CI]: 1.03 [1.02, 1.04], p < 0.001) were at higher risk of non-persistence.

Although COVID-19 is diagnosed with a nasopharyngeal swab, detection of pulmonary involvement is crucial for safe patient discharge. Computed tomography (CT) is currently the gold standard. To treat paucisymptomatic patients, we have implemented a \\"fast track\\" pathway in our emergency department, using LUS as a valid alternative. Minimal data is available in the literature about interobserver reliability and the level of expertise needed to perform a reliable examination. Our aim was to assess these. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-center prospective study. We enrolled 96 patients. 12 lung areas were explored in each patient with a semiquantitative assessment of pulmonary aeration loss in order to obtain the LUS score. Scans were performed by two different operators, an expert and a novice, who were blinded to their colleague's results. RESULTS: 96 patients were enrolled. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) showed excellent agreement between the expert and the novice operator (ICC 0.975; 0.962-0.983); demographic features (age, sex, and chronic pulmonary disease) did not influence the reproducibility of the method. The ICC was 0.973 (0.950-0.986) in males, 0.976 (0.959-0.986) in females; 0.965 (0.940-0.980) in younger patients (&#8804;a46 yrs), and 0.973 (0.952-0.985) in older (>a46 yrs) patients.

Although structural competency has become an increasingly accepted framework for training and teaching, it usually has not addressed nursing students and has not included marginalized patients as trainers. METHOD This article analyzes a structural competency training model for nursing students that includes five components: Theory, Observations, Learning from patients, Engagement, and Research (the TOLERance model). RESULTS The TOLERance model increases the understanding of the interrelation between the individual clinical level and the sociopolitical structural level. It encourages nursing students to actively engage in social, political, and policy issues that affect their patients' health and to advocate for policy change. CONCLUSION The moral and professional commitment of nurses to their patients demands that they do not ignore the structural forces that are detrimental to their patients' health.

Lung ultrasound is more sensitive than chest radiography in detecting viral pneumonitis and preferred over computed tomography for reasons including its portability, reduced healthcare worker exposure and repeatability. The main lung ultrasound findings in COVID-19 patients are interstitial syndrome, irregular pleural line and subpleural consolidations. Consolidations are most likely found in critical patients in need of ventilatory support. Hence, lung ultrasound may be used to timely triage patients who may have evolving pneumonitis. Other respiratory pathology that may be detected by lung ultrasound includes pulmonary oedema, pneumothorax, consolidation and large effusion. A key barrier to incorporate lung ultrasound in the assessment of COVID-19 patients is adequate decontamination of ultrasound equipment to avoid viral spread.

The latest can be easily used as an indicator of treatment efficiency in the field. The effects of heat treatment and pH on the survival of SARS-CoV-2 and somatic coliphages were investigated in simple media. The T90 value (time required for a 90% reduction in the virus or a 1  log10 decline) at 50 C was about 4 min for infectious SARS-CoV-2, and around 133 min for infectious somatic coliphages, with no decrease in SARS-CoV-2 genome. For infectious SARS-CoV-2, a slight decrease (<1 log10 unit) was observed at pH 9 or 10 for 10 min; the decrease was over 5 log10 units at pH 11. However, both SARS-CoV-2 genome and infectious somatic coliphages decreased by less than 1 log10 unit at pH 12. All thermal or pH-based treatments that can remove or significantly reduce infectious somatic coliphages (>4 log10) can be considered efficient treatments for infectious SARS-CoV-2.

A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17), an ectodomain sheddase, is a key component of ACE2 modulation and plays a complex role in inflammation and immunosurveillance. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: Much remains unknown regarding the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19, including how the virus affects ADAM17 expression, activity, and regulation. SEARCH STRATEGY: Three electronic databases (MEDLINE through PubMed, Embase through Ovid, and Google Scholar) were searched to identify articles relevant to ADAM17 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 and 2. Relevant articles published from January 1, 2005, to April 30, 2020, were selected, and reference lists were screened and cross-referenced. We also searched preprint studies on medRxiv and bioRxiv given the rapidly evolving data on COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2. THERAPEUTIC OPINION: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to an increase in ADAM17 sheddase activity contributing to an exuberant macrophage-predominant inflammatory response and diminished immunosurveillance capacity for viral clearance. Emerging data suggest severe lung injury in COVID-19 is associated with higher levels of TNF- and IL-6, T-cell lymphopenia and exhaustion, hypercoagulability, and a macrophage-predominant immune response. This clinical picture is consistent with dysregulation of many of the molecular pathways in which ADAM17 participates.

We evaluate these claims by examining racial and ethnic differences in the likelihood of work-related exposure to COVID-19. We extend previous studies by considering 12 racial and ethnic groups and five types of potential occupational exposure to the virus: exposure to infection, physical proximity to others, face-to-face discussions, interactions with external customers and the public, and working indoors. Most importantly, we stratify our results by occupational status, defined as the proportion of workers within each occupation with some college education. This measure serves as a proxy for whether workplaces and workers employ significant COVID-19-related risk reduction strategies. We use the 2018 American Community Survey to identify recent workers by occupation, and link 409 occupations to information on work context from the Occupational Information Network to identify potential COVID-related risk factors. We then examine the racial/ethnic distribution of all frontline workers and frontline workers at highest potential risk of COVID-19, by occupational status and by sex. The results indicate that, contrary to expectation, White frontline workers are often overrepresented in high-risk jobs while Black and Latino frontline workers are generally underrepresented in these jobs. However, disaggregation of the results by occupational status shows that, in contrast to Whites and several Asian groups, Latino and Black frontline workers are overrepresented in lower status occupations overall and in lower status occupations associated with high risk, and are thus less likely to have adequate COVID-19 protections. Our findings suggest that greater work exposures likely contribute to a higher prevalence of COVID-19 among Latino and Black adults and underscore the need for measures to reduce potential exposure for workers in low status occupations and for the development of programs outside the workplace.","output":"Racial and Ethnic Differentials in COVID-19-Related Job Exposures by Occupational Status in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The last five years has seen a sharp rise in anti-science rhetoric in the United States, especially from the political far right, mostly focused on vaccines and, of late, anti-COVID-19 prevention approaches.

Here we set out to improve the effectiveness of peptide-based cancer vaccine design by implementing a unique approach to target peptide antigens to the cross-presentation pathway within dendritic cells. We demonstrate that the addition of a short cell penetrating peptide sequence to the vaccine construct enhances the efficiency of our vaccine and improves outcomes in both a viral and a cancer model. Our findings provide a simple strategy that may enhance the effectiveness of peptide-based cancer vaccines and the priming of anti-tumor immunity. ABSTRACT: Cross-presenting dendritic cells (DC) offer an attractive target for vaccination due to their unique ability to process exogenous antigens for presentation on MHC class I molecules. Recent reports have established that these DC express unique surface receptors and play a critical role in the initiation of anti-tumor immunity, opening the way for the development of vaccination strategies specifically targeting these cells. This study investigated whether targeting cross-presenting DC by two complementary mechanisms could improve vaccine effectiveness, in both a viral setting and in a murine melanoma model. Our novel vaccine construct contained the XCL1 ligand, to target uptake to XCR1(+) cross-presenting DC, and a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) with endosomal escape properties, to enhance antigen delivery into the cross-presentation pathway. Using a prime-boost regimen, we demonstrated robust expansion of antigen-specific T cells following vaccination with our CPP-linked peptide vaccine and protective immunity against HSV-1 skin infection, where vaccine epitopes were natively expressed by the virus. Additionally, our novel vaccination strategy slowed tumor outgrowth in a B16 murine melanoma model, compared to adjuvant only controls, suggesting antigen-specific anti-tumor immunity was generated following vaccination. These findings suggest that novel strategies to target the antigen cross-presentation pathway in DC may be beneficial for the generation of anti-tumor immunity.","output":"Targeting Cross-Presentation as a Route to Improve the Efficiency of Peptide-Based Cancer Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Durch den Einsatz von IuK-Technologien und durch das Verknpfen von Daten kann eine Smart City in ihrer Effizienz optimiert werden.

Four week post-training, a SIT session and TT were also performed. Change in neuromuscular function was assessed from resting twitches, quadriceps maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force, and potentiated twitch force (Q tw). RESULTS Study-1 showed that SIT did not elicit significant neuromuscular adaptations. Study-2 showed that N-3 PUFA supplementation had no significant effect on neuromuscular adaptations. Training caused lower MVC force [mean  SD; N-3 PUFA -9  11%, placebo -9  13% (p < 0.05 time)] and Q tw peripheral fatigue [N-3 PUFA -10  19%, placebo -14  13% (p < 0.05 time)].

While fast isolation of suspected cases plays an essential role to avoid disease outbreaks, significant rates of asymptomatic cases have recently been described. After detecting an outbreak in one of our HD clinics, wide SARS-CoV-2 screening and segregation of confirmed cases were performed. METHODS: The entire clinic population, 192 patients, underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction . We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression to define variables involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection in our dialysis unit. Later, we analysed differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. RESULTS: In total, 22 symptomatic and 14 of the 170 asymptomatic patients had a SARS-CoV-2-positive result. Living in a nursing home/homeless [odds ratio (OR) 3.54; P = 0.026], having been admitted to the reference hospital within the previous 2 weeks (OR 5.19; P = 0.002) and sharing health-care transportation with future symptomatic (OR 3.33; P = 0.013) and asymptomatic (OR 4.73; P = 0.002) positive patients were independent risk factors for a positive test.

In this study, we aimed to assess the validity and quality of this care system in building connections between NPHWs and specialists in Pakistan and the UK. METHODS: A NPHW in Pakistan used the app on a series of referrals and sent the app-generated summary by email to a neurologist in the UK, who replied and suggested possible management.

Overexpression of TRAF6 enhanced proliferation and migration, and TRAF6 knockdown reversed this phenomenon in gastric cancer cells. Moreover, TRAF6 may inhibit differentiation and promote stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Transcriptome profiles revealed 701 differentially expressed genes in the wild-type group and the TRAF6 knockout group. Potential molecules associated with cell proliferation and migration were identified, including MAPK, FOXO, and IL-17. In conclusion, TRAF6 is a significant factor promoting proliferation and migration in gastric cancer cells and may provide a new target for the accurate treatment of gastric cancer.","output":"TRAF6 Promotes Gastric Cancer Cell Self-Renewal, Proliferation, and Migration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

PURPOSE: Results of the 2020 ASHP national survey of pharmacy practice in hospital settings are presented. METHODS: Pharmacy directors at 1,437 general and children's medical/surgical hospitals in the United States were surveyed using a mixed-mode method of contact by email and mail. Survey completion was online. IQVIA supplied data on hospital characteristics; the survey sample was drawn from the IMS hospital database. RESULTS: The response rate was 18.7%. Almost all hospitals (92.5%) have a method for pharmacists to review medication orders on demand. Most hospitals (74.5%) use automated dispensing cabinets (ADCs) as their primary method for drug distribution. A third of hospitals use barcodes to verify doses during dispensing in the pharmacy and to verify ingredients when intravenous medications are compounded. More than 80% scan barcodes when restocking ADCs. Sterile workflow management technology is used in 21.3% of hospitals. Almost three-quarters of hospitals outsource some sterile preparations. Pharmacists can independently prescribe in 21.1% of hospitals. Pharmacist practice in ambulatory clinics in 46.2% of health systems and provide telepharmacy services in 28.4% of health systems. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists continue their responsibility in their traditional role in preparation and dispensing of medications. They have successfully employed technology to improve safety and efficiency in performance of these duties and have employed emerging technologies to improve the safety, timeliness, and efficiency of the administration of drugs to patients. As pharmacists continue to expand their role to all aspects of medication use, new opportunities highlighted in ASHP's Practice Advancement Initiative 2030 have been identified.","output":"ASHP national survey of pharmacy practice in hospital settings: Dispensing and administration-2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Saudi Anesthesia Society (SAS) has developed interim guidelines on perioperative care of COVID-19 patients who undergo surgery and anesthesia.[1] Patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 might be scheduled for emergency thoracic procedures either during the acute or convalescence phases of the disease.

For this, we mainly consider AI-driven tools that employ two different types of image data, namely chest Computed Tomography (CT) and X-ray. We elaborate on their strengths and weaknesses by taking the following important factors into account: i) dataset size; ii) model fitting criteria (over-fitting and under-fitting); iii) transfer learning in the deep learning era; and iv) data augmentation. Medical imaging tools do not explicitly analyze model fitting. Also, using transfer learning, with fewer data, one could possibly build Covid-19 deep learning model but they are limited to education and training. We observe that, in both image modalities, neither the dataset size nor does data augmentation work well for Covid-19 screening purposes because a large dataset does not guarantee all possible Covid-19 manifestations and data augmentation does not create new Covid-19 cases.","output":"Covid-19 Imaging Tools: How Big Data is Big?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gastrointestinal manifestations may accompany the respiratory symptoms of COVID-19. Abdominal pain (AP) without nausea and vomiting is one of the most common. To date, its role and prognostic value in patients with COVID-19 is still debated. Therefore, we performed a retrospective analysis of 2184 individuals admitted to hospital due to COVID-19. We divided the patients into four groups according to presented symptoms: dyspnea, n = 871 (39.9%); AP, n = 97 (4.4%); AP with dyspnea together, n = 50 (2.3%); and patients without dyspnea and AP, n = 1166 (53.4%). The patients with AP showed tendency to be younger than these with dyspnea, but without AP (63.0 [38.0C70.0] vs. 65.0 [52.0C74.0] years, p = 0.061), and they were more often females as compared to patients with dyspnea (57.7% vs. 44.6%, p = 0.013, for females).

Despite the recent proliferation of many efficient virus discovery methods, careful selection of a combination of methods is important to demonstrate a novel virus, its clinical associations, and its relevance in a timely manner. The identification of a patient or an outbreak with distinctive clinical features and negative routine microbiological workup is often the starting point for virus hunting. This review appraises the roles of culture, electron microscopy, and nucleic acid detectionCbased methods in optimizing virus discovery. Cell culture is generally slow but may yield viable virus. Although the choice of cell line often involves trial and error, it may be guided by the clinical syndrome. Electron microscopy is insensitive but fast, and may provide morphological clues to choice of cell line or consensus primers for nucleic acid detection. Consensus primer PCR can be used to detect viruses that are closely related to known virus families. Random primer amplification and high-throughput sequencing can catch any virus genome but cannot yield an infectious virion for testing Koch postulates.

However, the lack of convincing evidence from most informative biomarkers of severe lung dysfunction (SLD-CF) has hampered the formulation of a conclusive, targeted diagnosis of CF. The aim of this study was to determine whether SLD-CF is related to the high concentration of sputum inflammatory mediators and the presence of biofilm-forming bacterial strains. Forty-one patients with advanced CF lung disease were studied. The severity of pulmonary dysfunction was defined by FEV1 <40%. CRP and NLR (Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio) were examined as representative blood-based markers of inflammation. Expectorated sputum was collected and analysed for cytokines and neutrophil-derived defence proteins. Isolated sputum bacteria were identified and their biofilm forming capacity was determined. There was no association between FEV1% and total number of sputum bacteria. However, in the high-biofilm forming group the median FEV1 was <40%. Importantly, high density of sputum bacteria was associated with increased concentration of neutrophil elastase and IL-8 and low concentration of IL-6 and IL-10. The low concentration of sputum IL-6 is unique for CF and distinct from that observed in other chronic pulmonary inflammatory diseases. These findings strongly suggest that expectorated sputum is an informative source of pulmonary biomarkers representative for advanced CF and may replace more invasive BAL analysis to monitor the disease. We recommend to use of the following inflammatory biomarkers: blood CRP, NLR and sputum elastase, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10.","output":"Chronic bacterial pulmonary infections in advanced cystic fibrosis differently affect the level of sputum neutrophil elastase, IL-8 and IL-6."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction La premire vague dinfection COVID a entra?n une fermeture brutale des consultations de patients suivis pour des pathologies chroniques dont le VIH.

Sept patients ont t exclus de lanalyse car elite controller, dbut de traitement ou dcouverte rcente. Sur les 293 patients analyss, 31 % recevaient des anti-intgrases, 33 % des inhibiteurs non-nuclosidiques et 20 % des inhibiteurs de protase, 20 % recevaient une bithrapie, et 40 % des patients avaient une charge virale indtectable depuis plus de 10 ans, le reste depuis en moyenne 4 ans.

STUDY DESIGN: Cadaveric simulation. SETTING: Surgical simulation laboratory. METHODS: An optical particle size spectrometer was used to quantify 1- to 10-m aerosols 30 cm from mastoid cortex drilling. Two barrier drapes were evaluated: OtoTent1, a drape sheet affixed to the microscope; OtoTent2, a custom-structured drape that enclosed the surgical field with specialized ports. RESULTS: Mastoid drilling without a barrier drape, with or without an aerosol-scavenging second suction, generated large amounts of 1- to 10-m particulate. Drilling under OtoTent1 generated a high density of particles when compared with baseline environmental levels (P < .001, U = 107). By contrast, when drilling was conducted under OtoTent2, mean particle density remained at baseline. Adding a second suction inside OtoTent1 or OtoTent2 kept particle density at baseline levels. Significant aerosols were released upon removal of OtoTent1 or OtoTent2 despite a 60-second pause before drape removal after drilling (P < .001, U = 0, n = 10, 12; P < .001, U = 2, n = 12, 12, respectively). However, particle density did not increase above baseline when a second suction and a pause before removal were both employed. CONCLUSIONS: Mastoidectomy without a barrier, even when a second suction was added, generated substantial 1- to 10-m aerosols. During drilling, large amounts of aerosols above baseline levels were detected with OtoTent1 but not OtoTent2. For both drapes, a second suction was an effective mitigation strategy during drilling. Last, the combination of a second suction and a pause before removal prevented aerosol escape during the removal of either drape.","output":"Aerosol Dispersion During Mastoidectomy and Custom Mitigation Strategies for Otologic Surgery in the COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this fifth phase of development, the contents of the Spanish Asthma Management Guidelines (GEMA), which include versions 5.0 and 5.1, have undergone a thorough review.

Many scholars have studied the institutional management of these incidents, but a qualitative study of stakeholders perspectives on vaccine hesitancy in China is missing. To address this lacuna, we conducted in-depth interviews and collected online data to explore diverse stakeholders narratives on vaccine hesitance. Our analysis shows the different perspectives of medical experts, journalists, parents, and self-defined vaccination victims on vaccination and vaccination hesitance. Medical experts generally consider vaccines, despite some flaws, as safe, and they consider most vaccine safety incidents to be related to coupling symptoms, not to vaccinations. Some parents agree with medical experts, but most do not trust vaccine safety and do not want to put their children at risk. Media professionals, online medical experts, and doctors who do not need to align with the political goal of maintaining a high vaccination rate are less positive about vaccination and consider vaccine hesitance a failure of expertClay communication in China. Our analysis exhibits the tensions of medical expert and lay perspectives on vaccine hesitance, and suggests that vaccination experts see like a state, which is a finding consistent with other studies that have identified the over-politicization of expertClay communication in Chinese public discourse.

As these viruses approach the epithelial surfaces from the apical side, it is not surprising that coronavirus cell receptors are exposed primarily on the apical domain of polarized epithelial cells. With respect to release, all possibilities appear to occur. Thus, most coronaviruses exit through the apical surface, several through the basolateral one, although the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus appears to use both sides.

There have been a percentage of poor results due to reappearance, persistence or appearance of new symptoms. Reinterventions of the hiatus are more complicated and are not always accompanied by a satisfactory clinical response. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the long-term results of a series of 20 patients reintervened by laparoscopy and their quality of life. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 20 patients operated on between February 1998 and December 2008 after previous surgery for the hiatus. The mean age of the patients was 56 (19-77) years. A total of 18 patients had been operated on due to GORD or POHH and 2 due to achalasia. They were followed up until December 2008 and a quality of life GIQLI test was performed. RESULTS Of the 20 patients, 13 were operated on by laparoscopy and 7 by laparotomy. The mean pre-operative time was 74 (1-24) months. The reintervention was for GORD and HH in 12 (63%); dysphagia in 4 (21%) and POHH (3). Conversion was 10% and the operating time was 180 (105-300)min. The procedures were: pillar closure and re-Nissen (10), re-Nissen (2), Toupet (2), Collis (1), mesh removal (1), re-myotomy (2), and pexy (1). There was 16% morbidity and no mortality. After a follow up of 68 (1-116) months, 14 patients were symptom-free. The GIQLI score was 106 (97-124), which was less than standard (125).

As information emerges regarding the impact of lockdown measures and changes to clinical practice worldwide; there is no comparative information emerging from the United Kingdom with regard to major trauma. METHODS: This observational study from a UK Major Trauma Centre matched a cohort of patients admitted during a 10-week period of the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic (09/03/2020C18/05/2020) to a historical cohort of patients admitted during a similar time period in 2019 (11/03/2019C20/05/2019). Differences in demographics, Clinical Frailty Scale, SARS-CoV-2 status, mechanism of injury and injury severity were compared using Fishers exact and Chi-squared tests. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses examined the associated factors that predicted 30-days mortality. RESULTS: A total of 642 patients were included, with 405 in the 2019 and 237 in the 2020 cohorts, respectively. 4/237(1.69%) of patients in the 2020 cohort tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. There was a 41.5% decrease in the number of trauma admissions in 2020. This cohort was older (median 46 vs 40 years), had more comorbidities and were frail (p < 0.0015). There was a significant difference in mechanism of injury with a decrease in vehicle related trauma, but an increase in falls. There was a twofold increased risk of mortality in the 2020 cohort which in adjusted multivariable models, was explained by injury severity and frailty. A positive SARS-CoV-2 status was not significantly associated with increased mortality when adjusted for other variables.

At the onset of the pandemic, occupational therapy practitioners (OTPs) needed to continue delivering care to clients without being in-person. Many OT practitioners pivoted rapidly to telehealth, in many instances, with very little training. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to describe the use of telehealth in occupational therapy during the early stages of the pandemic, and to explore how participants traversed the barriers. The perceived benefits and barriers to success with rapid telehealth adoption as experienced by OTPs, along with the specific strategies used to promote favorable outcomes may inform ongoing successful telehealth use in occupational therapy. METHOD This study used a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design. Data was collected from September to December 2020 with an electronic survey. RESULTS A total of 193 OTPs completed the survey, representing the delivery of OT services in 13 countries. Three main barriers to the use of telehealth were availability of materials, mastery of technology, and collaboration with caregivers/e-helpers. These barriers were negatively and significantly correlated with the participants' confidence level in the use of telehealth. Participants overcame barriers by independently obtaining telehealth training, including training within one's organization, support from social media, self-directed learning, and paid online telehealth webinars. CONCLUSION Employers and educators can remove barriers to telehealth use by OTPs by providing a variety of learning opportunities and supports to enhance practitioners' confidence, thus increasing the likelihood of continued use of telehealth as a powerful and gap-bridging delivery model in occupational therapy.","output":"Toward successful future use of telehealth in occupational therapy practice: What the COVID-19 rapid shift revealed."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we explore potential challenges of online learning activity in Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya at the beginning of Covid-19 outbreak We start our exploration from performance phase to self-reflective phase according to Zimmerman's learning phase There are three challenge that could be defined from the exploration First challenge is about how to cultivates ask-for-help culture for students so that students could understand their learning resources well Second challenge is about how to cultivate learning journey sharing so that students could have a lot of exposure to learning resources that easier to understand Third challenge is about how to cultivate self-reflective habit for students so that the students could have awareness to improve their learning method and get better learning outcome ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Exploring challenges of online learning activity in politeknik elektronika negeri surabaya at the beginning of covid-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: In this study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of ozone therapy, which is one of the integrative medicine applications that has been used safely for many years, on the prevalence of mortality in patients receiving COVID\\\\19 treatment. METHODS: This was a prospective, controlled study conducted on patients with COVID\\\\19 who were hospitalised. In this study, 55 patients were included. The patients were divided into two groups as the ozone and control group. Ozone therapy (major autohemotherapy) was applied to 37 patients who were being treated with the appropriate COVID\\\\19 treatment protocol determined by the infectious diseases committee of our hospital. The ozone treatment protocol consisted of seven sessions (one session per day) of intravenous ozone administration, applied in a volume of 100 mL and a concentration of 30 g/mL. Only the conventional COVID\\\\19 treatment protocol was applied to 18 patients in the control group. Clinical follow\\\\up was performed until the discharge of the patients from the hospital with successful treatment or until the mortality occurred. Factors affecting mortality were analysed using univariate regression analysis. RESULTS: Intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalisation was required in 6 of the 37 patients who were treated with ozone (16.2%), while 4 of 18 patients in the control group required ICU treatment (22.2%) (P = .713). When the mortality rates between the two groups were compared, mortality was lower in the ozone group (P = .032). As a result of univariate logistic regression analysis performed to investigate the factors affecting mortality, treatment with ozone therapy was determined as a risk factor for mortality.

Myocarditis is a rare but potentially serious complication of other viral infections with variable recovery, and is, in some cases, associated with long-term cardiac remodeling and functional impairment. Aim: To assess myocardial injury in patients who recently recovered from an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection with advanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). Methods: In total, 32 patients with persistent cardiac symptoms after a COVID-19 infection, 22 patients with acute classic myocarditis not related to COVID-19, and 16 healthy volunteers were included in this study and underwent a comprehensive baseline CMR scan. Of these, 10 patients post COVID-19 and 13 with non-COVID-19 myocarditis underwent a follow-up scan. In 10 of the post-COVID-19 and 15 of the non-COVID-19 patients with myocarditis endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) with histological, immunohistological, and molecular analysis was performed. Results: In total, 10 (31%) patients with COVID-19 showed evidence of myocardial injury, eight (25%) presented with myocardial oedema, eight (25%) exhibited global or regional systolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and nine (28%) exhibited impaired right ventricular (RV) function. However, only three (9%) of COVID-19 patients fulfilled updated CMRCLake Louise criteria (LLC) for acute myocarditis. Regarding EMB, none of the COVID-19 patients but 87% of the non-COVID-19 patients with myocarditis presented histological findings in keeping with acute or chronic inflammation. COVID-19 patients with severe disease on the WHO scale presented with reduced biventricular longitudinal function, increased RV mass, and longer native T1 times compared with those with only mild or moderate disease. Conclusions: In our cohort, CMR and EMB findings revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with relatively mild but variable cardiac involvement.

Those studies were completed in standard temperature (ST), which commonly is 70-72F (21-22C) for in vivo murine research based on laboratory animal care and use guidelines. Previous work from the Repasky lab (Kokulus, 2013), which we have validated (Gaymon, 2020), demonstrates that ST housing results in chronic cold stress and immune suppression mediated by an increase in norepinrephrine (NE) levels, leading to increased tumor aggressiveness. Based on these findings, we investigated the effects of social isolation on BALB/cJ-4T1-luc and C57BL/6J/E0771 tumor progression and metastasis in thermoneutral housing conditions (84-85F). Mice were first acclimatized to thermoneutral temperature and/or isolation for two weeks in cages that were unilaterally draped to provide physical and visual isolation. In BALB/cJ mice, 4T1-luc tumors were significantly larger in isolated mice compared to group-housed (GH) mice at day 18 (p<.0001). Statistically larger tumors were observed in isolated mice compared to GH mice through day 24 and final tumor masses were Salso significantly different (p=.004). Spleen masses were not statistically different. In C57BL/6J mice, E0771 tumors were significantly larger in isolates at Day 25 (p=.002). Final tumor masses were statistically (p=.002) different while no difference in spleen sizes were observed. Data on metastasis will be presented at the meeting. We hypothesized that social isolation may perturb immune function and next investigated the growth of 4T1-luc xenograft tumors in NSG mice. 4T1-luc/NSG tumor progression and metastasis data will also be presented at the meeting. We conclude that syngeneic breast tumor growth in immunocompetent BALB/cJ and C57BL/6J mice demonstrates that social isolation is a bona fide stress with sufficient influence to exacerbate breast cancer growth. These data are potentially clinically important due the known relationship of social support to survivorship outcomes in patients and the high-risk of depression and isolation in patients following breast cancer diagnosis.

The estimated structural equation model explained approximately 40% of the total variance in attitudes toward COVID-19 protocols and adherence. As expected, high internality was associated with stronger adherence, whereas luck was associated with weaker adherence. Comparative optimism was more strongly associated with adherence than fatalism, and somewhat unexpectedly comparative optimism was associated with stronger adherence. Analyses of direct and indirect effects suggested that fatalism was mainly mediated through attitudes, whereas comparative optimism had both direct and mediated effects.

Six databases were searched for qualitative studies describing young participants (<25 years, previously or currently above a healthy weight) experiences of weight management for >6 months following intentional weight loss. A thematic synthesis was undertaken. Themes were interpreted using the Socio-ecological Model. Factors supporting attempts to maintain weight loss included having clear motivation for change; developing personal skills to manage the challenges of change; family support/dynamics that encourage healthy lifestyles; and health-promoting cultures in schools/workplaces, communities, and the broader living environment. Conversely, ambivalence, difficulty coping with changes, peer pressure, challenging family dynamics, limited professional support, and unhealthy living environments were barriers to maintaining behavior change. These facilitators and barriers at each level of the Socio-ecological Model informed a model of weight loss maintenance for children and young people. Supporting children, young people, and families to develop the skills to manage the individual, social, and environmental challenges that shape attempts of long-term weight management will help to support their ability to manage their weight long term.","output":"Understanding children and young people's experiences pursuing weight loss maintenance using the Socio-ecological Model: A qualitative systematic literature review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rintatolimod is a selective TLR3 agonist, which has demonstrated clinical activity for ME/CFS in Phase II and Phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-site clinical trials. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A hypothesis-based post-hoc analysis of the Intent to Treat (ITT) population diagnosed with ME/CFS from 12 independent clinical sites of a Phase III trial was performed to evaluate the effect of rintatolimod therapy based on disease duration. The clinical activity of rintatolimod was evaluated by exercise treadmill tolerance (ETT) using a modified Bruce protocol. The ITT population (n = 208) was divided into two subsets of symptom duration. Patients with symptom duration of 2-8 years were identified as the Target Subset (n = 75); the remainder (<2 year plus >8 year) were identified as the Non-Target Subset (n = 133). Placebo-adjusted percentage improvements in exercise duration and the vertical rise for the Target Subset (n = 75) were more than twice that of the ITT population. The Non-Target Subset (n = 133) failed to show any clinically significant ETT response to rintatolimod when compared to placebo. Within the Target Subset, 51.2% of rintatolimod-treated patients improved their exercise duration by &#8805;25% (p = 0.003) despite reduced statistical power from division of the original ITT population into two subsets. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Analysis of ETT from a Phase III trial has identified within the ITT population, a subset of ME/CFS patients with &#8805;2 fold increased exercise response to rintatolimod. Substantial improvement in physical performance was seen for the majority (51.2%) of these severely debilitated patients who improved exercise duration by &#8805;25%. This magnitude of exercise improvement was associated with clinically significant enhancements in quality of life. The data indicate that ME/CFS patients have a relatively short disease duration window (<8 years) to expect a significant response to rintatolimod under the dosing conditions utilized in this Phase III clinical trial. These results may have direct relevance to the cognitive impairment and fatigue being experienced by patients clinically recovered from COVID-19 and free of detectable SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: Self-reported data from a migraine tracking smartphone application, Migraine Buddy, were used. Data were collected from users who reported at least one attack in the Jan, Feb, Mar and Apr of 2018, 2019 and 2020. In addition, a survey was conducted to evaluate the impact of COVID\\\\19 on migraine management. RESULTS: On average, data from 124,717 users per month (mean age 36.3  10.9 years and 89% female) were collected. Overall, the mean frequency of migraine headache was higher in 2020 than in 2019 and higher in 2019 than in 2018. The four commonest headache triggers in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were stress in 39.7, 38.4 and 36.1%, lack of sleep in 25, 25 and 22.8%, neck pain, 20, 20.4 and 19.3 and anxiety in 19, 18.4 and 18.4% of participants, respectively. 1689 users participated in the survey and they reported that they preferred face-to-face (54.29%) to telehealth (11.9%) consultations. CONCLUSION: An increase in migraine frequency from 2018 to 2020 was reported by the users of the mobile phone. This could reflect a real increase or change in reporting habits. Stress, lack of sleep, neck pain and anxiety were the commonest attack triggers. The frequency of these triggers decreased slightly in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018.

The participants were 401 undergraduate students, predominantly females, ranging in age from 17 to 70 years. Participants completed a battery of questionnaires that evaluated their attachment tendencies, olfactory ability and experiences in romantic relationships. Results indicated that attachment insecurity, across both attachment anxiety and avoidance, was associated with decreased olfactory functioning for females. These findings provide preliminary evidence that olfaction is related to romantic relationship maintenance and suggests that body odors could be fundamental for evoking the attachment system.

This study aimed to analyze the changing patterns and the tempogeographic features of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in China, to provide further evidence for real-time responses. METHODS: Daily data on COVID-19 cases between 31 December 2019 and 26 February 2020 were collected and analyzed for Hubei and non-Hubei regions in China. Observed trends for new and cumulative cases were analyzed through joinpoint regression analysis. Spatial analysis was applied to show the geographic distribution and changing patterns of the epidemic. RESULTS: By 26 February 2020, 78a? 630 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in China. In Hubei, an increasing trend (slopea? =a? 221) was observed for new cases between 24 January and 7 February 2020, after which a decline commenced (slopea? =a? -868). However, as the diagnosis criteria changed, a sudden increase (slopea? =a? 5530) was observed on 12 February, which sharply decreased afterward (slopea? =a? -4898). In non-Hubei regions, the number of new cases increased from 20 January to 3 February and started to decline afterward (slopea? =a? -53). The spatial analysis identified Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Changsha, Nanchang, Wenzhou, Shanghai, Xinyang, Jining, and Beijing as the hotspots outside of Hubei Province in China. CONCLUSIONS: The joinpoint regression analysis indicated that the epidemic might be under control in China, especially for regions outside of Hubei Province.

The aim of this study was to evaluate chest X-ray and chest CT findings in children with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Chest X-ray findings of 59 pediatric patients and chest CT findings of 22 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: COVID-19 pneumonia was most commonly observed unilaterally and in lower zones of lungs in chest X-ray examinations. Bilateral and multifocal involvement (55%) was the most observed involvement in the CT examinations, as well as, single lesion and single lobe (27%) involvement were also detected. Pure ground-glass appearance was observed in 41%, ground-glass appearance and consolidation together was in 36%. While peripheral and central co-distribution of the lesions (55%) were frequently observed, the involvement of the lower lobes (69%) was significant. In four cases,the coexistence of multiple rounded multifocal ground-glass appearance and rounded consolidation were observed. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pneumonia imaging findings may differ in the pediatric population from adults. In diagnosis, chest X-ray should be preferred, CT should be requested if there is a pathologic finding on radiography that merits further evaluation and if clinically indicated.

RESULTS: We received a total of 723 responses; of these, 69% had downloaded the app and 31% had not. The respondents' reasons for not downloading the app were grouped under four topics: lack of perceived risk of COVID-19/lack of perceived need and privacy issues; phone-related issues; tracking and misuse of data; and trust, security and credibility. Among the 472 people who downloaded the app and provided text amenable to text mining, the two topics most commonly listed were: to assist with contact tracing; and to return to normal. CONCLUSIONS: This survey of a regional population found that lack of perceived need, concerns around privacy and technical difficulties were the major barriers to users downloading the application. Implications for public health: Health promotion campaigns aimed at increasing the uptake of the COVIDSafe app should focus on promoting how the app will assist with contact tracing to help return to 'normal'.

Here, we examined antibody and memory B cell responses in a cohort of individuals sampled longitudinally for ~9C10 months after the primary 2-dose mRNA vaccine series, as well as for ~3 months after a 3(rd) mRNA vaccine dose. Notably, antibody decay slowed significantly between 6- and 9-months post-primary vaccination, essentially stabilizing at the time of the 3(rd) dose. Antibody quality also continued to improve for at least 9 months after primary 2-dose vaccination. Spike? and RBD-specific memory B cells were stable through 9 months post-vaccination with no evidence of decline over time, and ~40C50% of RBD-specific memory B cells were capable of simultaneously recognizing the Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants. Omicron-binding memory B cells induced by the first 2 doses of mRNA vaccine were boosted significantly by a 3rd dose and the magnitude of this boosting was similar to memory B cells specific for other variants. Pre-3(rd) dose memory B cell frequencies correlated with the increase in neutralizing antibody titers after the 3(rd) dose. In contrast, pre-3(rd) dose antibody titers inversely correlated with the fold-change of antibody boosting, suggesting that high levels of circulating antibodies may limit reactivation of immunological memory and constrain further antibody boosting by mRNA vaccines. These data provide a deeper understanding of how the quantity and quality of antibody and memory B cell responses change over time and number of antigen exposures.

It has many pharmacological actions, such as antibacterial, hypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory, and so on. However, due to the low lipophilicity of berberine, it is difficult to penetrate the bacterial cell membrane and also difficult to be absorbed orally and usually needs a relatively high dose to achieve the ideal effect. The purpose of this study is to transform the structure of berberine in order to improve the bioavailability of berberine and reduce the dosage. Moreover, we introduce a pharmacophore named Canagliflozin, a hypoglycemic drug (which was also found to have potential anti-bacterial activity) into BBR to see whether this new compound has more existed activities. We at first connected berberine with Canagliflozin, to form a new compound (BC) and see whether BC has synergic effects. We use microbroth dilution method to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of BC, determine the bacterial growth with the enzyme labeling instrument, observe the formation of bacterial biofilm with crystal violet staining method, observe the bacterial morphology with field emission scanning electron microscope, and determine the intracellular protein with SDS-PAGE. The above indicators reflect the damage of BC to bacteria. New compound BC was successfully obtained by chemical synthesis. The minimal inhibitory concentration of compound BC on three bacteria was significantly better than that of berberine and canagliflozin alone and the combination of berberine and canagliflozin. Moreover, compound BC has obvious destructive effect on bacterial morphology and biofilm, and the compound also has destructive effect on intracellular proteins. Therefore, new compound BC has broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and the inhibitory effect of BC might play a role by destroying the integrity of biofilm and the intracellular protein of bacteria.

We sought to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in the overall screening for acute stroke utilizing a commercial clinical artificial intelligence platform. METHODS: Data were derived from the Viz Platform, an artificial intelligence application designed to optimize the workflow of patients with acute stroke. Neuroimaging data on suspected patients with stroke across 97 hospitals in 20 US states were collected in real time and retrospectively analyzed with the number of patients undergoing imaging screening serving as a surrogate for the amount of stroke care. The main outcome measures were the number of computed tomography (CT) angiography, CT perfusion, large vessel occlusions (defined according to the automated software detection), and severe strokes on CT perfusion (defined as those with hypoperfusion volumes >70 mL) normalized as number of patients per day per hospital. Data from the prepandemic (November 4, 2019 to February 29, 2020) and pandemic (March 1 to May 10, 2020) periods were compared at national and state levels. Correlations were made between the inter-period changes in imaging screening, stroke hospitalizations, and thrombectomy procedures using state-specific sampling. RESULTS: A total of 23 223 patients were included. The incidence of large vessel occlusion on CT angiography and severe strokes on CT perfusion were 11.2% (n=2602) and 14.7% (n=1229/8328), respectively. There were significant declines in the overall number of CT angiographies (?22.8%; 1.39C1.07 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001) and CT perfusion (?26.1%; 0.50C0.37 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001) as well as in the incidence of large vessel occlusion (?17.1%; 0.15C0.13 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001) and severe strokes on CT perfusion (?16.7%; 0.12C0.10 patients/day per hospital, P<0.005).

We find that depressive symptoms are higher for those who have been persistently over-indebted, followed by those who transit from moderate to high debt levels. We also find that those who transition from over-indebtedness to moderate debt levels have no additional depressive symptoms compared to those with trajectories of moderate debt throughout (never over-indebted). This suggests that the debt-related contribution to depressive symptoms vanishes as debt levels fall. The association between debt and depressive symptoms seems to be driven by non-mortgage debt -primarily consumer credit- or late mortgage payments; secured debt (secured by collateral) per se is not associated with depressive symptoms.

The latter suggests that ferritin could be a further pathogenic mediator in enhancing the inflammatory process, stimulating inflammatory pathways, and thus perpetuating a vicious pathogenic loop. Considering its activity as an immune activator, a therapeutic approach targeting ferritin may be also postulated in these diseases. Considering these observations, high ferritin levels characterize severe COVID-19 and other diseases included in the hyperferritinemic syndrome.
