In bronchiectasis patients (n = 30, 23 females, 66 years), lung function testing, disease severity [FEV(1), age, colonization, radiological extension, dyspnea (FACED), exacerbation (EFACED)] and dyspnea scores, exacerbation numbers and hospitalizations, body composition, sputum microbiology, and blood analytical biomarkers were determined at baseline and after a one-year follow-up. Compared to baseline (n = 27, three patients dropped out), in bronchiectasis patients, a significant increase in FACED and EFACED scores, number of exacerbations, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was observed, while FEV(1), ceruloplasmin, IgE, IgG, IgG aspergillus, IgM, and IgA significantly decreased. Patients presenting colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) remained unchanged (27%) during follow-up. In bronchiectasis patients, FEV(1) declined only after a one-year follow-up along with increased exacerbation numbers and disease severity scores, but not hospitalizations.

However, with this self-learning strategy, there is a lack of direct supervision from experts and residents risk understudying for this high-stakes exam. Our objective is to determine study goals for effective self-guided practice for the FLS manual skills tasks that will result in passing the examination. METHODS FLS manual skills data for all PGY-5 residents during 2009-2010 was supplied by the FLS administrative office. Descriptive statistics were performed, and data were regrouped by the pass/fail results of the exam. The minimum practice time requirement for passing each manual skills task is reported in order to guide practice. RESULTS 1,047 proctored FLS exams were completed by 2009-2010 residents. Mean task time achieved by all residents was 84  31 s for peg transfer, 139  54 s for pattern cut, 78  29 s for endoloop, 158  66 s for extracorporeal suturing, and 168  77 s for intracorporeal suturing. In the pass group (n = 988), mean time to complete each task was 80 s for peg transfer, 134 s for pattern cut, 75 s for endoloop, 148 s for extracorporeal suturing, and 160 s for intracorporeal suturing. Calculations suggest a self-study goal for each task of 53 s for peg transfer, 50 s for pattern cut, 87 s for endoloop, 99 s for extracorporeal suturing, and 96 s for intracorporeal suturing. If a resident can reliably achieve these results during self-study, they have an 84% chance of passing the exam. CONCLUSIONS Residents preparing to take the FLS exam can refer to data presented in this study to set practice goals. Referring to these data-based practice goals will help residents to improve their chances of passing this high-stakes exam.","output":"Data-based self-study guidelines for the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery examination."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Flow diversion with the Pipeline embolization device is a well-established method of intracranial aneurysm treatment. However, deployment of the first-generation device (Pipeline Classic) can be technically challenging. The Pipeline Flex contains the same flow-diverting stent with a modified delivery system. OBJECTIVE To compare procedural outcomes between the first-generation device (Pipeline Classic) and the Pipeline Flex. METHODS Thirty-eight of the first 40 consecutive patients who underwent intracranial aneurysm treatment with the Pipeline Flex and 58 of the most recent 60 consecutive patients who underwent treatment with the Pipeline Classic at our institution were evaluated. Patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, technical procedural details, and early outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS The two groups were comparable for age, gender, and location of target aneurysms. Use of Pipeline Flex decreased procedure time by 44.2 min (p0.001) and fluoroscopy time by 22.0 min (p=0.001) compared with the Pipeline Classic. Similarly, radiation exposure was less in the Flex group with a mean difference of 3473.5 Gy cm2 (p=0.002), while contrast usage was decreased with a mean difference of 22.3 mL (p=0.007). These differences remained significant in multivariate regression analysis. Finally, the rate of device deployment failure was lower in the Flex group (7.1%) than in the Classic group (23.9%) (p=0.034). CONCLUSIONS Use of Pipeline Flex significantly reduces the total procedure and fluoroscopy time, contrast usage, patient radiation exposure, and proportion of recaptured devices in comparison with the Pipeline Classic, probably owing to an enhanced delivery system that allows for more reliable and controlled deployment.","output":"Use of Pipeline Flex is associated with reduced fluoroscopy time, procedure time, and technical failure compared with the first-generation Pipeline embolization device."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Physicians have had to perform numerous extubation procedures during the prolonged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic. Future pandemics caused by unknown pathogen may also present a risk of exposure to infectious droplets and aerosols. AIM: This study evaluated the ability of a newly developed aerosol barrier, Extubation-Aerosol (EA)-Shield to provide maximum protection from aerosol exposure during extubation via an aerosolised particle count and high-quality visualisation assessments. METHODS: We employed a cough model having parameters similar to humans and used micron oil aerosol as well as titanium dioxide as aerosol tracers. Aerosol barrier techniques employing a face mask (group M) and EA-Shield (group H) were compared. FINDINGS: The primary outcome was the difference in the number of particles contacting the physicians face before and after extubation. The maximum distances of aerosol dispersal after extubation were measured as the secondary outcomes. All aerosolised particles of the two tracers were significantly smaller in group H than in group M (p < 0.05). In addition, the sagittal and axial maximum distances and sagittal areas of aerosol dispersal for 3, 5, and 10 s after extubation were significantly smaller in group H than in group M (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This model indicates that EA-Shield could be highly effective in reducing aerosol exposure during extubation.

Aim of this study is to assess gastrointestinal and liver related predictive factors for SARS-CoV-2 associated risk of hospitalization. MethodsData collection was based on questionnaire from the COVID-19 outpatient test center and from the emergency department at the University hospital in combination with data from internal hospital information system and from the mobile application used for telemedicine follow-up of patients. For statistical analysis SARS-CoV-2 negative patients were considered as controls to three different SARS-CoV-2 positive patient groups (divided based on severity of the disease). ResultsTotal of 710 patients were enrolled in the study. Presence of diarrhea and nausea was significantly higher in emergency department group than in the COVID-19 outpatient test center. Among liver enzymes only aspartate transaminase (AST) has been significantly elevated in the hospitalized group compared to patients discharged home. Based on random forest algorithm, AST has been identified as the most important predictor followed by age or diabetes mellitus. Diarrhea and bloating have also predictive importance although much lower than AST. ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 positivity is connected with isolated AST elevation and the level is linked with the severity of the disease.

Crucially, personal moral norms are important predictors of moral behaviour. Given the longevity of the pandemic, studying its impact on affect, satisfaction and internal drive of (non\\\\)donors during COVID\\\\19 and if personal moral norms are affected is paramount. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study relies on longitudinal data, consisting of six waves carried out biweekly. Our panel is representative for the German population, capturing changes in affect, satisfaction, internal drive and personal moral norms. We compare the emotional state and personal moral norms of (non\\\\)donors in the pandemic to pre\\\\pandemic phase. Moreover, we analyse changes in emotional state and personal moral norms during the pandemic and investigate the role of emotional state on personal moral norms. RESULTS: Firstly, our results show that personal moral norms of (non\\\\)donors drop compared to pre\\\\pandemic. Within pandemic, personal moral norms of active donors are not further altered. Secondly, we find significant changes of emotional state in the pandemic compared to pre\\\\pandemic phase, for example individuals feel more optimistic, but less satisfied and less energetic. Thirdly, we find that feeling more grateful increases personal moral norms of non\\\\donors.

Our objective was to model the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak progression in Italian regions vs. Lombardy to assess the epidemic's progression. Our setting was Italy, and especially Lombardy, which is experiencing a heavy burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The peak of new daily cases of the epidemic has been reached on the 29th, while was delayed in Central and Southern Italian regions compared to Northern ones. In our models, we estimated the basic reproduction number (R0), which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection, both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period and also by using day-by-day assessments based on single observations. We used the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading of the pandemic in Italy. The two methods provide an agreement of values, although the first method based on exponential fit should provide a better estimation, being computed on the entire time series. Taking into account the growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period, each infected person in Lombardy has involved 4 other people (3.6 based on data of April 23rd) compared to a value of R0 = 2.68, as reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan. According to our model, Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Marche will reach an R0 value of up to 3.5. The R0 was 3.11 for Lazio and 3.14 for the Campania region, where the latter showed the highest value among the Southern Italian regions, followed by Apulia (3.11), Sicily (2.99), Abruzzo (3.0), Calabria (2.84), Basilicata (2.66), and Molise (2.6). The R0 value is decreased in Lombardy and the Northern regions, while it is increased in Central and Southern regions. The expected peak of the SEIR model is set at the end of March, at a national level, with Southern Italian regions reaching the peak in the first days of April. Regarding the strengths and limitations of this study, our model is based on assumptions that might not exactly correspond to the evolution of the epidemic.

Subject and Methods: We analyzed three historical telemedicine cases (varying regarding time and place) and extracted their success factors and barriers as well as assessed their maturity by using the Telemedicine Community Readiness Model (TCRM). Evidence-based categories of success factors and barriers as well as the TCRM's dimensions were used as deductive categories to analyze the study material's content. Results: The analysis showed that the readiness for telemedicine is higher when the technology is the only option to access health care services.

Without this personal protective equipment, healthcare providers, essential workers, and the general public are exposed to the risk of infection. In light of the aforementioned, it is critical to balance the supply and demand for masks. COVID-19 will also ensure that masks are always considered as an essential commodity in future pandemic preparedness. Moreover, billions of facemasks are produced from petrochemicals derived raw materials, which are non-degradable upon disposal after their single use, thus causing environmental pollution and damage. The sustainable way forward is to utilise raw materials that are side-stream products of local industries to develop facemasks having equal or better efficiency than the conventional ones. In this regard, wheat gluten biopolymer, which is a by-product or co-product of cereal industries, can be electrospun into nanofibre membranes and subsequently carbonised at over 700 C to form a network structure, which can simultaneously act as the filter media and reinforcement for gluten-based masks. In parallel, the same gluten material can be processed into cohesive thin films using plasticiser and hot press. Additionally, lanosol, a naturally-occurring substance, imparts fire (V-0 rating in vertical burn test), and microbe resistance in gluten plastics. Thus, thin films of flexible gluten with very low amounts of lanosol (<10 wt%) can be bonded together with the carbonised mat and shaped by thermoforming to create the facemasks. The carbon mat acting as the filter can be attached to the masks through adapters that can also be made from injection moulded gluten.

We propose to call ethics based on non-maleficence, beneficence, autonomy, and justice C the values upon which, according to Pellegrino and Thomasma, the others are grounded and that physicians and ethicists use to resolve ethical dilemmas C neo-Hippocratic. The neo- prefix is justified by the adjunct of a distributive dimension (justice) to traditional Hippocratic ethics. CONCLUSION: Ethical codes ought to be constantly updated. The above values do not escape the rule. We have formulated them to feed discussions in health services and medical associations. Not only are these values fragmentary and in progress, but they have no universal ambition: they are applicable to the dilemmas of modern Western medicine only, not Ayurvedic or Shamanic medicine, because each professional culture has its own philosophical rationale. Efforts to combine clinical and public health ethics whilst resolving medical dilemmas can reasonably be expected to call upon the physicians professional identity because they are intellectual challenges to be associated with case management.","output":"In defence of a single body of clinical and public health, medical ethics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals with Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21) display hyperactivation of interferon (IFN) signaling and chronic inflammation, which could potentially be explained by the extra copy of four IFN receptor (IFNR) genes encoded on chromosome 21. However, the clinical effects of IFN hyperactivity in DS remain undefined. Here, we report that a commonly used mouse model of DS overexpresses IFNR genes and shows hypersensitivity to IFN ligands in diverse immune cell types. When treated repeatedly with a TLR3 agonist to induce chronic inflammation, these animals overexpress key IFN-stimulated genes, induce cytokine production, exhibit liver pathology, and undergo rapid weight loss. Importantly, the lethal immune hypersensitivity and cytokine production and the ensuing pathology are ameliorated by JAK1 inhibition. These results indicate that individuals with DS may experience harmful hyperinflammation upon IFN-inducing immune stimuli, as observed during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, pointing to JAK1 inhibition as a strategy to restore immune homeostasis in DS.","output":"JAK1 Inhibition Blocks Lethal Immune Hypersensitivity in a Mouse Model of Down Syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is the first report of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) as a complication of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

We determined the appropriate use of PPC to preclude subsequent small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) retention. METHODS This prospective multicenter study consecutively enrolled patients indicated for SBCE with suspected or established small bowel stenosis. Excretion of an intact PPC or its radiologic visualization in the large bowel was considered GI patency. Primary and secondary study endpoints were SBCE retention rates in patients with confirmed patency and identification of factors associated with patency and SBCE retention, respectively. RESULTS Of 1,096 patients enrolled in the study, patency was confirmed in 976 (89.1%). PPC excretion occurred in 579 patients. Of the remaining 517 patients, patency was confirmed using imaging modalities in 401 (77.5%). SBCE retention occurred in five (0.51%) of 963 patients who underwent SBCE: 1.0% in established Crohn's disease (CD) patients, 0% in suspected CD, 0% in tumors, and 1.6% in patients with obscure GI bleeding, for which PPC localization had been radiographically misinterpreted. The non-confirmation of patency was associated with established CD, stenosis identified using imaging modalities, abdominal fullness, serum albumin levels <4.0 g/dL, and previous small bowel obstruction (adjusted odds ratios: 4.21, 2.60, 2.47, 2.12, and 2.00; 95% confidence intervals: 2.62-6.78, 1.62-4.17, 1.43-4.27, 1.32-3.40, and 1.15-3.47, respectively).

While challenges associated with the COVID-19 trial landscape have been discussed previously, no comprehensive reviews have been conducted to assess the reporting, design, and data sharing practices of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). PURPOSE: The purpose of this review was to gain insight into the current landscape of reporting, methodological design, and data sharing practices for COVID-19 RCTs. DATA SOURCES: We conducted three searches to identify registered clinical trials, peer-reviewed publications, and pre-print publications. STUDY SELECTION: After screening eight major trial registries and 7844 records, we identified 178 registered trials and 38 publications describing 35 trials, including 25 peer-reviewed publications and 13 pre-prints. DATA EXTRACTION: Trial ID, registry, location, population, intervention, control, study design, recruitment target, actual recruitment, outcomes, data sharing statement, and time of data sharing were extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 178 registered trials, 112 (62.92%) were in hospital settings, median planned recruitment was 100 participants (IQR: 60, 168), and the majority (na?=a?166, 93.26%) did not report results in their respective registries. Of 35 published trials, 31 (88.57%) were in hospital settings, median actual recruitment was 86 participants (IQR: 55.5, 218), ten (28.57%) did not reach recruitment targets, and 27 trials (77.14%) reported plans to share data.

Social isolation also increased astrocyte density, reduced astrocyte size with shorter branches, and reduced morphological complexity in the hippocampus. Dihydromyricetin, a flavonoid that we previously demonstrated to have anxiolytic properties, improved memory/cognition and restored astrocyte plasticity in these mice.

Under the circumstances created during lockdown period, children are deprived from the social interaction and companionship; because of which, they are susceptible to psychiatric disorders. Therefore, in this study, efforts were to understand the impacts of lockdown on the mental status of the children of India and their specific causes. STUDY DESIGN: It is a questionnaire-based study. METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was prepared, and 400 parents from four districts of Punjab, India, namely, Ludhiana, Sahibzada Ajit Singh (SAS) Nagar, Sangrur and Ferozepur, were telephonically interviewed. Further, the information collected from the interviews was statistically analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. RESULTS: Findings from this study revealed that 73.15% and 51.25% of the children were having signs of increased irritation and anger, respectively; 18.7% and 17.6% of the parents also mentioned the symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively, among their children, which were also augmented by the changes in their diet, sleep, weight and more usage of the electronic equipment. Children (~76.3%) persistently urge to go outdoors and play with their friends; therefore, they could lag in social development. Further, observations from Pearson's correlation revealed that during lockdown, children's mental health is significantly related to the area of their house, number of children in the family, qualification of their mother and socio-economic status of their family. CONCLUSIONS: This study made it evident that the mental health of the children residing in Punjab, India, was compromised during the lockdown period induced by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, a generation of effective producers of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins became an urgent task. Its resolving contributes to the study of functional SarS-CoV-2 properties, as well as will allow developing the domestic COVID-19 vaccine in Ukraine, thus playing an important strategic role in tackling the pandemics. The aim of the study was to generate prokaryotic and eukaryotic producers of recombinant SarS-CoV-2 proteins and to isolate nucleocapsid (N) protein, receptor-binding do-main (RBD) of spike (S) protein, as well as RBD fused to the carrier C diphtheria toxoid CRM197. For this purpose, appropriate genetic constructs, in particular, replication deficient recombinant AdvC5-based adenoviral vectors expressing the SarS-CoV-2 proteins and CRM197-fused conjugate were created through methods of molecular biology and genetic engineering. Restriction analysis and/or dna sequencing confirmed that we created the correct constructs. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography was used to purify the recombinant proteins. Compliance of their properties was confirmed by the results from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, immunoenzymatic assay and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. As a result, we generated E. coli Rosetta (de3) bacterial strain and HEK293 cell line producing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins and CRM197-based fusion. In addition, pure N protein, RBD of S protein and RBD-crm197 fusion protein were isolated. The obtained recombinant SarS-CoV-2 proteins can be used to study immunogenic and antigenic properties of the SarS-CoV-2 proteins.

Furthermore, HCPs motivations behind vaccine acceptance are associated with their likelihood of recommending vaccines to their patients. Understanding these motivations in the context of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign may aid in the development of interventions that improve pediatric practitioners vaccine confidence and prescription. We aimed at studying the motivations affecting COVID-19 vaccination behavior among a sample of vaccinated Italian HCPs working in pediatric settings. A sample (n = 162) of HCPs completed an online self-reported survey exploring motivations behind getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Emotions of HCPs at the moment of COVID-19 vaccination injection were also recorded to collect data about the main feelings connected to the vaccination decision-making process. Data were collected between 19 March 2021 and 21 April 2021. The most effective motivational incentives were the beliefs that vaccination helped protect vulnerable members of the community (97.5% agreement), could protect ones own health (93.7%), health authorities could be trusted (58.7%), and the vaccine had been rigorously tested (53.8%). Actual personal exposure to COVID was less important (reported importance agreement 16C24%), and the influence of news and social media was still lower (4C6%). Differences between physicians and other HCPs ratings were also found. Finally, emotional status at vaccination showed high ratings for positive emotions surrounding the vaccination act. This study provided additional evidence about the multifaceted motivations behind COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and showed the potential of understanding the psychosocial roots of vaccine behaviors for shaping public communication campaigns.

First, an objective function in upper-level planning was used to improve logistics enterprise profits and reduce the total carbon emissions of the freight system. Then, a generalized cost function for the freight transportation mode was designed to quantify the market competition among different transportation modes, and a user equilibrium assignment model was established to obtain the results of cargo flow assignment in lower-level planning. To solve the model, a sensitivity analysis algorithm was designed, and a logistics network example was used to verify the effectiveness of the model. The experimental results show that reasonable freight price adjustment can effectively increase enterprise profits and reduce the total carbon emissions of the freight system.

We performed a review to compare indications and outcomes of EMLP in an early cohort of publications (1990-2008) versus a contemporary cohort (2009-2016) and compare outcomes associated with follow-up 2 years versus <2 years. DATA SOURCES PubMed, SCOPUS and Cochrane databases. REVIEW METHODS An English-language search of the PubMed and Ovid databases was conducted to identify publications from 1990 to 2016 reporting clinical outcomes of EMLP. Meta-analysis was performed using Statistical Analysis System 9.4. RESULTS A total of 1,205 patients were abstracted from 29 articles with a mean follow-up of 29.1  10.3 months. The overall rate of significant or complete symptom improvement was 86.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 84.2%-88.7%). The overall patency rate was 90.7% (95% CI: 89.1%-92.3%), with a revision rate of 12.6% (95% CI: 10.6%-14.3%). Compared to the early cohort, patients in the contemporary cohort underwent EMLP more often for tumors (P < .001), had higher rates of complete or significant symptom improvement (90.0% vs. 82.6 %, P < .001); and trended toward greater patency rates (92.1% vs. 88.6%, P = .052). Compared to the short-term follow-up cohort, the long-term cohort showed no differences in symptom improvement or patency, but the revision rate was higher (14.5% vs. 9.2%, P = .016). CONCLUSIONS In the last decade, EMLP has been performed more frequently for tumors. Recent studies have demonstrated improved symptom outcomes and a trend toward improved patency rates. The revision rate increased significantly when follow-up exceeded 2 years.

One fetal exposure linked with poor health outcomes is chorioamnionitis, which impacts up to 25-40% of preterm births. Severe chorioamnionitis with prematurity is associated with significantly increased risk of pulmonary disease and secondary infections in childhood, suggesting that fetal inflammation may significantly alter developmental ontogeny of the lung. To test this hypothesis, we used intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) to generate experimental chorioamnionitis in prenatal Rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), a model which shares critical structural and temporal aspects of human lung development. Inflammatory injury directly disrupts the developing gas exchange surface of the primate lung, with extensive damage to alveolar structure, particularly the close association and coordinated differentiation of alveolar type 1 pneumocytes and specialized alveolar capillary endothelium. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis defined a multicellular alveolar signaling niche driving alveologenesis which was extensively disrupted by perinatal inflammation, leading to loss of gas exchange surface and alveolar simplification similar to that found in chronic lung disease of newborns. Blockade of IL1 and TNF ameliorated endotoxin-induced inflammatory lung injury by blunting stromal response to inflammation and modulating innate immune activation in myeloid cells, restoring structural integrity and key signaling networks in the developing alveolus. These data provide new insight into the pathophysiology of developmental lung injury and suggest that modulating inflammation is a promising therapeutic approach to prevent fetal consequences of chorioamnionitis.","output":"Inflammatory blockade prevents injury to the developing pulmonary gas exchange surface in preterm primates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of an effective vaccine to control the global coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus- 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of utmost importance.

Household quarantine in second degree contacts (Hh-Q2) outside the case household has so far only been addressed by modellers. In the literature there is no publication based on field data. Methods In a retrospective cohort study on real field data from a county health department (CHD), all PCR-confirmed cases and related contact persons put into quarantine were analysed. Hh-Q2 was used in our CHD from the onset of the pandemic. Results From 9 March to 8 December 2020, 353 PCR-confirmed cases were registered in the CHD Ploen, Northern Germany: 225 (63.7%) primary, 107 (30.3%) secondary and 21 (5.9%) tertiary cases. The 107 secondary cases resulted out of 470 (22.8%) close or 1contacts and 21 tertiary cases out of 179 (11.7%) indirect or 2contacts put into quarantine. The efficacy of Hh-Q2 was 51.5% (11.7%/22.8%) of that of quarantine in 1contacts;16.4% of all converted cases in quarantined persons were ascertained by Hh-Q2. One in ten 1contacts in households with tertiary cases remained asymptomatic. Conclusion The impact of Hh-Q2 in preventing further spread of SARS-CoV2 was considerable. With 51% of the conversion rate in 2contacts compared to 1contacts, the efficacy of Hh-Q2 is substantial. Hh-Q2 should definitely be used routinely to control the spread of SARS-CoV2 more efficiently and national authorities should include it in their guidelines.","output":"Household quarantine of second degree contacts is an effective non-pharmaceutical intervention to prevent tertiary cases in the current SARS-CoV pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Turnip crinkle virus contains a T-shaped, ribosome-binding, translation enhancer (TSS) in its 3UTR that serves as a hub for interactions throughout the region. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) causes the TSS/surrounding region to undergo a conformational shift postulated to inhibit translation. Using optical tweezers (OT) and steered molecular dynamic simulations (SMD), we found that the unusual stability of pseudoknotted element H4a/(3) required five upstream adenylates, and H4a/(3) was necessary for cooperative association of two other hairpins (H5/H4b) in Mg(2+). SMD recapitulated the TSS unfolding order in the absence of Mg(2+), showed dependence of the resistance to pulling on the 3D orientation and gave structural insights into the measured contour lengths of the TSS structure elements. Adenylate mutations eliminated one-site RdRp binding to the 3UTR, suggesting that RdRp binding to the adenylates disrupts H4a/(3), leading to loss of H5/H4b interaction and promoting a conformational switch interrupting translation and promoting replication.

Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used as a method for analysis. RESULTS: Four themes emerged in the analysis: pandemic anxiety, organizational lack of readiness for change, impact on interpersonal relationships, and commitment to service. Young doctors experienced psychological distress, and emotional vulnerability due to the challenges and concerns faced by them in the wake of COVID-19. Shortage and excessive reuse of personal protective equipment, direct exposure to the disease, concern for personal safety, fear and apprehension of being a probable disease carrier for families, physical distancing from loved ones, long working hours, and increased organizational responsibility altered the quality of life for doctors working frontline toward pandemic in COVID wards. Doctors who received appreciation and support by families reported improved filial bonds. CONCLUSION: The adverse effect on psychological health, personal and social life, and increased professional demands have been some of the major challenges and threats faced by young doctors working frontline toward the pandemic.

SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, an airway disease that can be severe and fatal in a percentage of cases. Patients with severe COVID-19 can develop extrapulmonary lesions, with renal, hepatic, cardiac, neurological, and tissue involvement that can cause further severe complications. On December 21, 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) authorized the marketing of the first COVID-19 vaccine. However, several randomized trials are ongoing to find effective, safe, and widely available treatments. The most severe stages of COVID-19 infection are characterized by a multi-system inflammatory state induced by a cytokine storm causing multi-organ injury. Epidemiologic evidence has shown that glucocorticoids (GCs), particularly dexamethasone, are used in severe, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with good therapeutic benefit. COVID-19 can also damage the endothelial system, causing microcirculatory disturbances and consequently leading to functional organ disorders. The combination of endothelial dysfunction with a generalized inflammatory state may contribute to the general pro-coagulative state described in patients with COVID-19 with increased risk of venous and arterial occlusions. The aim of this article is to describe the therapeutic utility of GCs in stabilizing the vascular endothelial barrier in COVID-19 infection. Indeed, we believe that the stabilization of the endothelial barrier and the anti-inflammatory effect of GCs could be the main effect underlying the therapeutic efficacy in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Efficacy of synthetic glucocorticoids in COVID-19 endothelites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we assess the price reaction, performance and volatility timing of European investment funds during the outbreak of Covid-19.

As the case count amongst children is low, there is need to report COVID-19 in children to better understand the virus and the disease. Cases In Malaysia, until end of February 2020, there were four COVID-19 paediatric cases with ages ranging from 20 months to 11 years. All four cases were likely to have contracted the virus in China. The children had no symptoms or mild flu-like illness. The cases were managed symptomatically. None required antiviral therapy. Discussion There were 2 major issues regarding the care of infected children. Firstly, the quarantine of an infected child with a parent who tested negative was an ethical dilemma. Secondly, oropharyngeal and nasal swabs in children were at risk of false negative results. These issues have implications for infection control. Consequently, there is a need for clearer guidelines for child quarantine and testing methods in the management of COVID-19 in children.","output":"COVID-19: Four Paediatric Cases in Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Objectif: Analyse de limpact du premier mois de confinement li  lpidmie SARS-CoV-2 sur lactivit de consultation des otorhinolaryngologistes libraux de l?le de La Runion.

METHODS: 216 PCPs who were a registered member of either the National University Polyclinics, National University Health System Primary Care Network or College of Family Physicians Singapore, participated in this online cross-sectional study. The data collection period lasted from 6th March 2020 to 29th March 2020. RESULTS: A final sample of 172 questionnaires were analysed. Private PCPs tended to be older and more experienced. Perceived COVID-19 exposure and overall preparedness was high in both groups. More private PCPs perceived their exposure risk as unacceptable, aOR = 3.96 (1.07, 14.62); that they should not be caring for COVID-19 patients, aOR = 3.55 (1.23, 10.24); and perceived more stigma against their loved ones, aOR = 4.27 (1.74, 10.44).

Recent study showed that dexamethasone can reduce COVID-19 deaths by up to one third in critically ill patients. The aim of this article is to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 can attack the adrenal cortex to aggravate the relative adrenal insufficiency. Methods: We summarized the clinical features of COVID-19 reported in currently available observational studies. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was examined in human adrenal glands by immunohistochemical staining. We retrospectively analyzed serum cortisol levels in critically ill patients with or without COVID-19. Results: High percentage of critically ill patients with SARS-COV-2 infection in the study were treated with vasopressors. ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 serine protease were colocalized in adrenocortical cells in zona fasciculata and zona reticularis. We collected plasma cortisol concentrations in nine critically ill patients with COVID-19.

As many comorbidities are common in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), we sought to investigate the effects of comorbidities in these patients on infection severity. AIM: To evaluate association between individual comorbidities and COVID-19 infection severity among patients with IBD. METHODS: Data were obtained from SECURE-IBD, an international registry created to evaluate COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IBD. We used multivariable regression to analyze associations between eleven non-IBD comorbidities and a composite primary outcome of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death. Comorbidities were first modeled individually, adjusting for potential confounders. Next, to determine the independent effect of comorbidities, we fit a model including all comorbidities as covariates. RESULTS: We analyzed 2,035 patients from 58 countries (mean age 42.7 years, 50.6% male). A total of 538 patients (26.4%) experienced severe COVID-19. All comorbidities but a history of stroke and obesity were associated with severe infection in our initial analysis, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.9 to 3.7. In a model including all comorbidities significantly associated with the composite outcome in the initial analysis, as well as other confounders, most comorbidities remained significant, with the highest risk in chronic kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

As the differential of unilateral axillary adenopathy includes breast malignancy, it is crucial to both thoroughly evaluate the breast for primary malignancy and to elicit history of recent vaccination.

Short-term follow-up for unilateral axillary adenopathy in the setting of recent COVID-19 vaccination is an appropriate recommendation, in lieu of immediately performing potentially unnecessary and costly axillary lymph node biopsies.","output":"Unilateral axillary Adenopathy in the setting of COVID-19 vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of information and aommunication technology (ICT), as well as the situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have encouraged the adoption of nonconventional schemes of work based on virtuality. In this context, leadership becomes one of the main challenges to organizations and teams. The purpose of this paper is to identify the key factors related to virtual leadership and to propose a scheme for analysing and managing teams in virtuality. After a systematic literature review, the main results suggest that leadership in virtual environments should be considered as a shared phenomenon and that the key factors with the greatest impact on virtual leadrrship are communication, trust, and team cohesion. The paper highlights and characteriss these factors, a well as the actions that should be taken to manage them. As a major contribution, a four-phrase scheme is proposed for the analysis and management of leadership in vituality.

Few data are available in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study of COVID-19 patients at 11 dialysis centres in two distinct districts of France to examine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in this population, and to determine risk factors of disease severity (defined as a composite outcome including intensive care unit admission or death) and mortality. RESULTS: Among the 2336 patients enrolled, 5.5% had confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Of the 122 patients with a follow-up superior to 28 days, 37% reached the composite outcome and 28% died. Multivariate analysis showed that oxygen therapy on diagnosis and a decrease in lymphocyte count were independent risk factors associated with disease severity and with mortality. Chronic use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (18% of patients) was associated with a protective effect on mortality. Treatment with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine (AZT/HCQ) (46% of patients) were not associated with the composite outcome and with death in univariate and multivariate analyses.

In computer science, this represents a typical problem of machine learning over incomplete or limited data in early epidemic Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC) simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction of fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.","output":"Composite Monte Carlo decision making under high uncertainty of novel coronavirus epidemic using hybridized deep learning and fuzzy rule induction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is increasing evidence that patients with Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) present with neurological and psychiatric symptoms.

The proposed method alleviates the challenge of obtaining large amounts of labeled mammogram training data by utilizing a large number of cancer cell line microscopic images as an intermediate domain of learning between the natural domain (ImageNet) and medical domain (mammography). Moreover, our method does not utilize patch separation (to segment the region of interest before classification), which renders it computationally simple and fast compared to previous studies. The findings of this study are of crucial importance in the early diagnosis of breast cancer in young women with dense breasts because mammography does not provide reliable diagnosis in such cases. ABSTRACT: Despite great achievements in classifying mammographic breast-mass images via deep-learning (DL), obtaining large amounts of training data and ensuring generalizations across different datasets with robust and well-optimized algorithms remain a challenge. ImageNet-based transfer learning (TL) and patch classifiers have been utilized to address these challenges. However, researchers have been unable to achieve the desired performance for DL to be used as a standalone tool. In this study, we propose a novel multi-stage TL from ImageNet and cancer cell line image pre-trained models to classify mammographic breast masses as either benign or malignant. We trained our model on three public datasets: Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM), INbreast, and Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS). In addition, a mixed dataset of the images from these three datasets was used to train the model. We obtained an average five-fold cross validation AUC of 1, 0.9994, 0.9993, and 0.9998 for DDSM, INbreast, MIAS, and mixed datasets, respectively. Moreover, the observed performance improvement using our method against the patch-based method was statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.0029. Furthermore, our patchless approach performed better than patch- and whole image-based methods, improving test accuracy by 8% (91.41% vs. 99.34%), tested on the INbreast dataset. The proposed method is of significant importance in solving the need for a large training dataset as well as reducing the computational burden in training and implementing the mammography-based deep-learning models for early diagnosis of breast cancer.","output":"Patchless Multi-Stage Transfer Learning for Improved Mammographic Breast Mass Classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare quantifiable radiologic findings and their dynamic change throughout the clinical course of common and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to provide valuable evidence for radiologic classification of the two types of this disease. METHODS: 112 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Volumetric percentage of infection and density of the lung were measured by a computer-aided software. Clinical parameters were recorded to reflect disease progression. Baseline data and dynamic change were compared between two groups and a decision-tree algorithm was developed to determine the cut-off value for classification. RESULTS: 93 patients were finally included and were divided into common group (n = 76) and severe group (n = 17) based on current criteria. Compared with common patients, severe patients experienced shorter advanced stage, peak time and plateau, but longer absorption stage. The dynamic change of volume and density coincided with the clinical course. The interquartile range of volumetric percentage of the two groups were 1.0C7.2% and 11.4C31.2%, respectively. Baseline volumetric percentage of infection was significantly higher in severe group, and the cut-off value of it was 10.10%. CONCLUSIONS: Volumetric percentage between severe and common patients was significantly different. Because serial CT scans are systemically performed in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, this quantitative analysis can simultaneously provide valuable information for physicians to evaluate their clinical course and classify common and severe patients accurately.","output":"Quantitative analysis based on chest CT classifies common and severe patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 C which causes COVID-19 C has rapidly reached pandemic proportions, causing widespread morbidity and mortality It has had a major impact on society in general, and in medicine and health in particular Although primarily a potentially fatal respiratory pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, can be neurotropic Its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is expressed in endothelial cells in the brain and can be induced in neural cells COVID-19 is therefore of high relevance to neurological disease Indeed, various neurological manifestations are increasingly being reported On the other hand, COVID-19 has a major impact on people with certain neurological diseases Patients with neuroimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis or myasthenia gravis who are on immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatments may be more susceptible to infection or have a more severe disease due to a blunted immune response Patients with many neurological disorders may be at risk of severe COVID-19 infection, due to immobility, frailty, disability, diminished respiratory capacity or cognitive dysfunction Disease-specific patient organisations and neurological societies have been prompt in providing advice and generating guidelines for various neurological conditions Local, national and international registers are being created and will be essential in monitoring the disease and its outcomes New knowledge about COVID-19, including issues of relevance to neurology, is generated daily This review presents some succinct background information on coronaviruses and its neuro-invasive potential, the current knowledge of neurological manifestations, and the impact of COVID-19 on individuals with neurological disease Some disease-specific recommendations are briefly listed or referenced","output":"Neurological Aspects of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we aimed to examine the status of internet addiction in children and the stress factors causing it during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

METHODS A total of 1,145 participants responded to an online survey conducted between 7 March and 21 April 2020. We collected demographic information and asked participants to report which of 17 behaviour changes they had undertaken because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Regression analyses were performed to predict the number of behavioural changes (preventive, avoidant, and total) as a function of demographics. Finally, we sought to identify predictors of persons who declared that they had not undertaken any of these measures following the outbreak. RESULTS Most participants (97%) reported at least one behavioural change on account of the pandemic, with changes increasing with the number of local COVID-19 cases (P<0.001). Additionally, women and those who were younger adopted more preventive behaviours (gender: P<0.001; age: P=0.001). Women were more likely to increase handwashing frequency, and younger individuals were more likely to wear face masks prior to legislation. Finally, women and those who were married adopted more avoidant behaviours (gender: P<0.001; marital status: P<0.001), with both groups avoiding crowded areas and staying home more than usual.

Pathogenesis and subsequent spread of infection requires replication of the viral genome and expression of structural and non-structural proteins of the virus. Generally, viruses use transcription and translation machinery of the host cell to achieve this objective. The viral genome encodes transcriptional regulators that alter the expression of viral and host genes by manipulating initiation and termination steps of transcription. The regulation of the initiation step is often through interactions of viral factors with gene specific factors as well as general transcription factors (GTFs). Among the GTFs, TFIIB (Transcription Factor IIB) is a frequent target during viral pathogenesis. TFIIB is utilized by a plethora of viruses including human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus, vaccinia virus, Thogoto virus, hepatitis virus, Epstein-Barr virus and gammaherpesviruses to alter gene expression. A number of viral transcriptional regulators exhibit a direct interaction with host TFIIB in order to accomplish expression of their genes and to repress host transcription. Some viruses have evolved proteins with a three-dimensional structure very similar to TFIIB, demonstrating the importance of TFIIB for viral persistence. Upon viral infection, host transcription is selectively altered with viral transcription benefitting.

The people responsible for the person in quarantine can then connect via nRF Connect or a similar central application to acquire an accurate picture of the persons condition. This experiment included an Arduino Nano BLE 33 Sense which contains several other sensors like a 9-axis IMU, several types of temperature, and ambient and other sensors equipped. This device successfully managed to measure wrist temperature at all states, ranging from 32 C initially to 39 C, providing better battery autonomy than other similar devices, lasting over 12 h, with fast charging capabilities (500 mA), and utilizing the BLE 5.0 protocol for data wireless data transmission and low power consumption. Furthermore, a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was employed to classify whether the user is feverish while considering the physical activity status. The results obtained from the 1D CNN illustrated the manner in which it can be leveraged to acquire insight regarding the health of the users in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Wearable Device for Observation of Physical Activity with the Purpose of Patient Monitoring Due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) remain a common problem, which suggests that standard decontamination procedures are insufficient. Thus, new methods of decontamination are needed in hospitals. Methods: We assessed the effectiveness of a no-touch automated disinfection (NTD) system in the decontamination of 50 surfaces in 10 hospital rooms. Contamination of surfaces was assessed with a microbiological assay and an ATP bioluminescence assay. Unacceptable contamination was defined as > 100 colony forming units/100 cm(2) in the microbiological assay, and as  250 relative light units in the ATP assay. Results: When measured with the microbiological assay, 11 of 50 surfaces had unacceptable contamination before NTD, and none of the surfaces had unacceptable contamination after NTD (p < 0.001). On the ATP bioluminescence assay, NTD decreased the number of surfaces with unacceptable contamination from 28 to 13, but this effect was non-significant (p = 0.176). On the microbiological assay taken before NTD, the greatest contamination exceeded the acceptable level by more than 11-fold (lamp holder, 1150 CFU/100 cm(2)). On the ATP bioluminescence assay taken before NTD, the greatest contamination exceeded the acceptable level by more than 43-fold (Ambu bag, 10,874 RLU). Conclusion: NTD effectively reduced microbiological contamination in all hospital rooms. However, when measured with the ATP bioluminescence assay, the reduction of contamination was not significant.","output":"No-Touch Automated Disinfection System for Decontamination of Surfaces in Hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Natural disasters can have devastating and long-lasting effects on a community's emotional well-being. These effects may be distributed unequally, affecting some communities more profoundly and possibly over longer time periods than others. Here, we analyze the effects of four major US hurricanes, namely, Irma, Harvey, Florence, and Dorian on the emotional well-being of the affected communities and regions. We show that a community's emotional response to a hurricane event can be measured from the content of social media that its population posted before, during, and after the hurricane. For each hurricane making landfall in the US, we observe a significant decrease in sentiment in the affected areas before and during the hurricane followed by a rapid return to pre-hurricane baseline, often within 1-2 weeks. However, some communities exhibit markedly different rates of decline and return to previous equilibrium levels. This points towards the possibility of measuring the emotional resilience of communities from the dynamics of their online emotional response.","output":"Quantifying societal emotional resilience to natural disasters from geo-located social media content"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused a global disruption to higher education, especially in engineering education, where many teaching and learning activities are difficult or impossible to conduct online. This study examines the changes in the students experiences of this disruption using a 26-item process-oriented course experience questionnaire (CEQ) that was already in use in the Faculty of Engineering at Lund University (LTH), rather than a newly created pandemic questionnaire. This allowed results from spring 2020 to be compared with corresponding data for 2017C2019. Overall, the students expressed lower satisfaction with their courses, indicated they received less feedback and fewer valuable comments, and found it harder to understand the expectations and standards of work. On the positive side, students reported that assessment was less about facts and more about in-depth understanding. By gender, male students were overall more negative to the experience of online learning, whereas female students appeared better able to benefit from the shift to online learning. Our results show the great advantage of using a robust course evaluation system that focuses on students learning experience rather than satisfaction, and suggest a way of being prepared to systematically study the effects of possible future disruptions to higher education.

To investigate the dynamics of this outbreak, we consider a deterministic compartmental model (SEIR model) with an additional parameter to simulate the restrictions. In general, as a consequence of easing restrictions, we obtain scenarios characterized by high spikes of infections indicating significant acceleration of the spreading disease. Finally, we show how such undesirable scenarios could be avoided by a control strategy of successive partial easing restrictions, namely, we tailor a successive sequence of the additional parameter to prevent spikes in phases of low rate of transmissibility.","output":"Dynamics of epidemics: Impact of easing restrictions and control of infection spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) circulate endemically in human populations, often with seasonal variation We describe the long-term patterns of paediatric disease associated with three of these viruses, HCoV-NL63, OC43 and 229E, in coastal Kenya Methods: Continuous surveillance of pneumonia admissions was conducted at the Kilifcounty hospital (KCH) located in the northern coastal region of Kenya Children aged 5 years admitted to KCH with clinically defined syndromic severe or very severe pneumonia were recruited Respiratory samples were taken and tested for 15 virus targets, using real-time polymerase chain reaction Unadjusted odds ratios were used to estimate the association between demographic and clinical characteristics and HCoV positivity Results: From 2007 to 2019, we observed 11,445 pneumonia admissions, of which 314 (3 9%) tested positive for at least one HCoV type There were 129 (41 1%) OC43, 99 (31 5%) 229E, 74 (23 6%) NL63 positive cases and 12 (3 8%) cases of HCoV to HCoV coinfection Among HCoV positive cases, 47% (n=147) were coinfected with other respiratory virus pathogens The majority of HCoV cases were among children aged 1 year (66%, n=208), though there was no age-dependence in the proportion testing positive HCoV-OC43 was predominant of the three HCoV types throughout the surveillance period Evidence for seasonality was not identified Conclusions: Overall, 4% of paediatric pneumonia admissions were associated with three endemic HCoVs, with a high proportion of cases co-occurring with another respiratory virus, with no clear seasonal pattern, and with the age-distribution of cases following that of pneumonia admissions (i e highest in infants) These observations suggest, at most, a small severe disease contribution of endemic HCoVs in this tropical setting and offer insight into the potential future burden and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2","output":"Surveillance of endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, OC43 and 229E) associated with pneumonia in Kilifi, Kenya [version 1;peer review: awaiting peer review]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to characterize global sagittal alignment in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) with normal kyphosis (NTK, kyphosis > 10) and with thoracic hypokyphosis (THK, kyphosis < 10), before and after posterior spinal fusion, and compare them with asymptomatic controls. 27 AIS girls and young adults with right thoracic curves were included (seventeen with age  18 years, then age > 21).

In this article, we report our technique and experience. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE With supine positioning, an umbilical trocar and three 5-mm trocars are positioned across the epigastrium. The gastrocolic ligament is opened completely and the stomach is retracted superiorly. A vessel-sealing electrosurgical device is used to dissect along the inferior margin of the pancreas. Dissection proceeds proximally or distally, depending on the location of the pathology. The proximal pancreatic duct is oversewn or stapled closed. The distal pancreas is mobilized from the splenic vessels. If the vessels cannot be mobilized from the pancreas, they are divided and a laparoscopic splenectomy is performed. The specimen is removed through the umbilical trocar by using a retrieval bag. Drains are placed prior to closure. CASE EXPERIENCE: We report 4 cases: 2 with pseudopapillary tumors and 2 with traumatic injuries. One patient was male; the mean age was 13.0 +/- 1.4 years. Two spleens were removed due to pathology. Mean operative time was 256 +/- 46.6 minutes, with no open conversion or mortality. Patients initiated oral intake 2.0 +/- 1.4 days postoperatively. Hospital stay was 6.2 +/- 3.9 days. One patient required 15 days of total parenteral nutrition to resolve a pancreatic fistula. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic pancreatic resection in children is feasible, safe, and leads to rapid recovery without significant morbidity. The spleen can often be spared, minimizing the risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis.

Through eight electronic journal database, 9 articles met our inclusion Participants, Intervention, Control, Outcomes, and Study Design (PICOS) criteria based on medical symptoms, interventions, and improvements. In general, interventions included hand hygiene, mask use, health education such as cough etiquette, hand washing and sanitizer methods. In addition, exercise and meditation were performed to improve immunity. As a result, the number of incidents and absences related to respiratory infections were reduced, the frequency and method of handwashing improved, and there were also positive effects in knowledge, attitude/perception, and performance. We concluded that it is necessary to create an environment and systematic support so that organizations or governments can determine healthy behavior at the same time as an individual approach. Furthermore, the follow-up for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions and the monitoring period should be included during the study, consequently resulting in having an opportunity to continuously remind people about health behavior.

Silicosis increases their risk of tuberculosis (TB), exacerbated by the HIV epidemic. Work-related factors are likely to increase transmission, severity, and post infection sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Understanding these relationships is important to control the impact of the epidemic. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among mineworkers exceed the population rates in the provinces in which those mines are located. Migrant work, living in crowded hostels, working in narrow poorly ventilated shafts mainly underground constitute important factors that increase transmission risk. Mineworkers continue to experience high levels of silica exposure. The prevalences of silicosis, HIV and pulmonary TB, remain high. Interstitial lung disease, pulmonary TB, and HIV have all been associated with poorer outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Mineworkers with post infection respiratory sequelae are likely to lose their jobs or lose income, due to the physically demanding nature of underground minework. SUMMARY: Further research into the unique work-related risk factors in mining that influence the COVID-19 epidemic is crucial for optimizing current interventions. Reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission, health monitoring of infected and vulnerable workers, and following up of postinfection outcomes is essential to protect the respiratory health of miners.","output":"COVID-19: a new burden of respiratory disease among South African miners?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present research investigated a backfiring effect of social interaction on well-being and general confidence in Western populations during the COVID-19 pandemic period.

The purpose of this study is to assess trends in discharge destination, length of stay (LOS), reoperations, and readmissions following THA. METHODS: Patients undergoing primary THA were identified using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Current Procedural Terminology codes in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) and Humana claims databases. Discharge destinations were assessed and categorized as home or not home. Trends in discharge destination, LOS, readmissions, reoperation, and comorbidity burden were assessed. RESULTS: In ACS NSQIP, 155,637 patients underwent THA and the percentage of patients discharging home increased from 72.2% in 2011 to 87.0% in 2017 (P < .0001). In Humana, 84,832 THA patients were identified, with an increase in home discharge from 56.6% to 72.8% (P < .0001). LOS decreased and proportion of patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists score &#8805;3 or Charlson Comorbidity Index &#8805;2 increased significantly for both home and nonhome going patients. Patients discharged home had a decrease in readmissions in both databases. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing THA more often discharged home and had shorter hospital LOS with lower readmission rates, despite an increasingly comorbid patient population. It is likely these changes in disposition and LOS have resulted in significant cost savings for both payers and hospitals. The efforts necessary to maintain improvements should be considered when changes to reimbursement are being evaluated. ACS NSQIP hospitals had a larger proportion of patients discharged home and the source of data used to benchmark hospitals should be considered as findings may differ.","output":"Home Discharge Has Increased After Total Hip Arthroplasty, However Rates Vary Between Large Databases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three mechanisms have been proposed to account for COVID-19 associated olfactory dysfunction; obstruction of the olfactory cleft; epithelial injury and infection of the sustentacular supporting cells, which are known to express ACE2, or injury to the olfactory bulb due to axonal transport through olfactory sensory neurones. The absence of ACE2 expression by olfactory sensory neurones has led to the neurotropic potential of COVID-19 to be discounted. While an accumulating body of evidence supports olfactory epithelial injury as an important mechanism, this does not account for all the features of olfactory dysfunction seen in COVID-19; for example the duration of loss in some patients, evidence of changes within the olfactory bulb on MRI imaging, identification of viral particles within the olfactory bulb in post-mortem specimens and the inverse association between severity of COVID-19 and the prevalence of olfactory loss. The recent identification of a second route of viral entry mediated by NRP1 addresses many of these inconsistencies. Expression by the olfactory sensory neurones and their progenitor cells may facilitate direct injury and axonal transport to the olfactory bulb as well as a mechanism for delayed or absent recovery. Expression by regulatory T cells may play a central role in the cytokine storm. Variability in expression by age, race or gender may explain differing morbidity of infection and inverse association between anosmia and severity; in the case of higher expression there may be a higher risk of olfactory function but greater activation of regulatory T cells that may suppress the cytokine storm.","output":"More that ACE2?

This unprecedented change to undergraduate education saw institutions adopting multiple online teaching modalities and instructional platforms. We sought to understand students experiences with and perspectives on those methods of remote instruction in order to inform pedagogical decisions during the current pandemic and in future development of online courses and virtual learning experiences. Our survey gathered quantitative and qualitative data regarding students experiences with synchronous and asynchronous methods of remote learning and specific pedagogical techniques associated with each. A total of 4,789 undergraduate participants representing institutions across 95 countries were recruited via Instagram. We find that most students prefer synchronous online classes, and students whose primary mode of remote instruction has been synchronous report being more engaged and motivated. Our qualitative data show that students miss the social aspects of learning on campus, and it is possible that synchronous learning helps to mitigate some feelings of isolation. Students whose synchronous classes include active-learning techniques (which are inherently more social) report significantly higher levels of engagement, motivation, enjoyment, and satisfaction with instruction. Respondents recommendations for changes emphasize increased engagement, interaction, and student participation. We conclude that active-learning methods, which are known to increase motivation, engagement, and learning in traditional classrooms, also have a positive impact in the remote-learning environment.

Diagnostic strategies available to identify or rule out current infection, or to identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immune response have become available, to reduce household and community transmission. We highlight a Cochrane review, published in September 2020, on the assessment of diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests to determine current SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: the authors of the Cochrane review searched multiple electronic databases for studies, which assessed SARS-CoV-2 infection with a diagnostic test. Eligible participants for the review included people with suspected current SARS-CoV-2 infection, known to have, or not to have COVID-19 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection. Results: the authors included 18 studies of point-of-care tests conducted in various parts of the world, with none from Africa. The review shows that there is considerable variability in sensitivity and specificity of the antigen tests. The review also shows that molecular tests had less variability in sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: the review suggests that the current evidence is not strong enough to determine the usefulness of point-of-care tests in all settings. However, the benefits are likely to be more noticeable in countries, like Africa where community transmission is high.

A nationally representative online and telephone survey conducted in 12-26 October on the Social Research Centre's Life in AustraliaTM panel (aged &#8805; 18 y, 78.8% response, N = 3043) asked about access, visitation, and felt benefits from green and/or blue spaces. Increasing financial difficulty was associated with less time in and fewer visits to green and/or blue spaces, as well as fewer different types visited. Financial difficulty was also associated with feelings that visits to green and/or blue space had less benefit for maintaining social connection. Working from home was associated with more frequent and longer visitation to green and/or blue spaces, as well as discovery of ones previously unvisited. Working from home was also associated with increased levels of exercise and respite resulting from visits to green and/or blue spaces. Residents of Melbourne, a city of 4.9 million who were in 'lockdown' at the time of the survey, appeared more likely to benefit from visits to green and/or blue spaces than residents of Sydney, Australia's largest city at 5.2 million, who were not in lockdown. Residents of Melbourne compared with Sydney reported consistently increased visitation of, discovery of, and greater levels of various felt benefits derived from green and/or blue spaces, including more respite, connection, and exercise. Comparatively shorter distances to preferred green and/or blue spaces and closure of alternative settings at the time of the survey completion in Melbourne compared with Sydney may provide partial explanation, though more acute responses to experiencing green and/or blue spaces within highly cognitively demanding antecedent conditions posed by lockdown are also plausible and warrant further investigation with other health indicators. These results were robust to adjustment for a range of covariates including preferences for natural settings, which were consistently associated with greater levels of green and/or blue space visitation and felt benefits. Collectively, these results indicate that parallel efforts to generate (or renew) felt connection to natural settings, to increase working from home opportunities, and to mitigate financial difficulties may be important to help maximize the population health benefits of urban planning strategies intended to improve the availability of, and to reduce inequities in access to, green and blue spaces.

It is becoming the most commonly recognized cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in under-five mortality in recent years. This study was done to determine the prevalence and determinants of Campylobacter infection among under-fives with acute watery diarrhea. METHODS: This institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted at governmental and private health institutions in Hawassa city. All outpatient under-five children who met the inclusion criteria from April 2021 to August 2021 were enrolled in this study. Demographic and clinical data were obtained using a standardized data collection tool. Stool samples were collected from each participant with a sterile container and inoculated on a campylobacter agar media. The isolates were identified by using biochemical tests and a disc diffusion technique was performed to determine the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the isolates. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 21. Descriptive and Logistic regression analysis was applied to determine the determinants of Campylobacter infection. P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 235 under-five children were enrolled in this study with a 100% response rate. Of these 130 (55.3%) and 105(44.7%) were males and females respectively with the age range of 2 months to 60 months with the mean age of 25 months.

The associations of socio-demographic, environmental, and behavioral factors were compared and consumption of unpasteurized milk, the presence of domestic animal like the cat was significantly associated. CONCLUSION: Campylobacter infection showed a comparatively low prevalence in under-fives with acute watery diarrhea. In this study contact with cats, consumption of unpasteurized milk were associated with Campylobacter infection.

METHOD: This is a retrospective review of actions to limit Covid-19 spread and their impact on surgical activity in a Swiss tertiary referral center. Data on patient care, human resources and hospital logistics were collected. Impact on surgical activity was measured by comparing 6-week periods before and after the first measures were taken. RESULTS: After the first Swiss Covid-19 case appeared on February 25, progressively restrictive measures were taken over a period of 23 days. Covid-19 positive inpatients increased from 5 to 131, and ICU patients from 2 to 31, between days 10 and 30, respectively, without ever overloading resources.

Previous studies have demonstrated that serum albumin levels were abnormally low in COVID-19 patients and might be used as a prognosis biomarker. Supplemental albumin has been used as an experimental therapeutic method. However, dynamic evaluation of albumin in patients with COVID-19 was limited and whether serum albumin could predict the prognosis of these patients is unknown. METHODS: We enrolled 79 COVID-19 patients in the present study and reviewed electronic medical laboratory records. Data was processed using SPSS software (Version 20.0) and correlation analysis was performed between serum albumin and other clinical and laboratory findings. RESULTS: Serum albumin levels were gradually decreased both in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients. Moreover, 17.7% of the patients presented with hypoalbuminemia at least one time during 3 consecutive weekly time points. The hypoalbuminemia group displayed more severe disease and comorbidity that included fever, fatigue, headache, and dizziness on admission. Moreover, serum albumin levels were positively correlated with lymphocyte and RBC numbers, Hb and prealbumin levels as well as with total T cell numbers and the presence of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. In contrast, there was a negative correlation with C-reactive protein levels and this was an indicator of patient recovery. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that hypoalbuminemia was common in COVID-19 patients and its levels were linked to disease severity. Patients with fever, fatigue and headache or dizziness on admission were more likely to experience hypoalbuminemia. Dynamic monitoring of serum albumin is therefore necessary and should be performed during COVID-19 patient treatments as a tool for evaluating the prognosis of COVID-19 infections.","output":"Serum Albumin Levels are a Predictor of COVID-19 Patient Prognosis: Evidence from a Single Cohort in Chongqing, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: COVID-19 outbreak can impact mental health including health care workers.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes are often associated with brain insulin resistance, resulting in impaired brain-derived modulation of peripheral metabolism. So far, no pharmacological treatment for brain insulin resistance has been established. Since sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors lower glucose levels and modulate energy metabolism, we hypothesized that SGLT2 inhibition may be a pharmacological approach to reverse brain insulin resistance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 40 patients (mean  SD; age 60  9 years; BMI 31.5  3.8 kg/m2) with prediabetes were randomized to receive 25 mg empagliflozin every day or placebo. Before and after 8 weeks of treatment, brain insulin sensitivity was assessed by functional MRI combined with intranasal administration of insulin to the brain. RESULTS: We identified a significant interaction between time and treatment in the hypothalamic response to insulin. Post hoc analyses revealed that only empagliflozin-treated patients experienced increased hypothalamic insulin responsiveness. Hypothalamic insulin action significantly mediated the empagliflozin-induced decrease in fasting glucose and liver fat. CONCLUSIONS: Our results corroborate insulin resistance of the hypothalamus in humans with prediabetes. Treatment with empagliflozin for 8 weeks was able to restore hypothalamic insulin sensitivity, a favorable response that could contribute to the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. Our findings position SGLT2 inhibition as the first pharmacological approach to reverse brain insulin resistance, with potential benefits for adiposity and whole-body metabolism.","output":"Empagliflozin Improves Insulin Sensitivity of the Hypothalamus in Humans With Prediabetes: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 2 Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aimed at exploring the relationship between parenting stress and children's problematic behaviour in the families of 99 children aged 8C11 years.

WEDGE successfully recovered expression matrices, reproduced the cell-wise and gene-wise correlations, and improved the clustering of cells, performing impressively for applications with multiple cell type datasets with high dropout rates. Overall, this study demonstrates a potent approach for imputing sparse expression matrix data, and our WEDGE algorithm should help many researchers to more profitably explore the biological meanings embedded in their scRNA-seq datasets.","output":"WEDGE: imputation of gene expression values from single-cell RNA-seq datasets using biased matrix decomposition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Initially found in Hubei, Wuhan, and identified as a novel virus of the coronavirus family by the WHO, COVID-19 has spread worldwide at exponential speed, causing millions of deaths and public fear. Currently, the USA, India, Brazil, and other parts of the world are experiencing a secondary wave of COVID-19. However, the medical, mathematical, and pharmaceutical aspects of its transmission, incubation, and recovery processes are still unclear. The classical susceptibleCinfectedCrecovered model has limitations in describing the dynamic behavior of COVID-19. Hence, it is necessary to introduce a recursive, latent model to predict the number of future COVID-19 infection cases in the USA. In this article, a dynamic recursive and latent infection model (RLIM) based on the classical SEIR model is proposed to predict the number of COVID-19 infections. Given COVID-19 infection and recovery data for a certain period, the RLIM is able to fit current values and produce an optimal set of parameters with a minimum error rate according to actual reported numbers. With these optimal parameters assigned, the RLIM model then becomes able to produce predictions of infection numbers within a certain period. To locate the turning point of COVID-19 transmission, an initial value for the secondary infection rate is given to the RLIM algorithm for calculation. RLIM will then calculate the secondary infection rates of a continuous time series with an iterative search strategy to speed up the convergence of the prediction outcomes and minimize the maximum square errors. Compared with other forecast algorithms, RLIM is able to adapt the COVID-19 infection curve faster and more accurately and, more importantly, provides a way to identify the turning point in virus transmission by searching for the equilibrium between recoveries and new infections. Simulations of four US states show that with the secondary infection rate [Formula: see text] initially set to 0.5 within the selected latent period of 14 days, RLIM is able to minimize this value at 0.07 and reach an equilibrium condition. A successful forecast is generated using New York states COVID-19 transmission, in which a turning point is predicted to emerge on January 31, 2021.

As the virus continues, we face a new challenge;to discern between post COVID syndromes or COVID reinfection. We present a case with this medical dilemma. CASE PRESENTATION: 64 y/o F with Diabetes, Hypertension & history of asymptomatic COVID infection eight weeks prior to presentation with follow-up negative testing, presented with fever & SOB. She initially developed progressive dyspnea on exertion for which bronchodilators were initiated as an outpatient. She then presented to our hospital with fevers & progressive SOB. Her initial workup revealed normal blood work & inflammatory markers, however her COVID RNA test was positive with seronegative COVID antibodies. Imaging revealed increased bilateral ground-glass opacities & inter-septal thickening when compared to imaging one month prior. Her positive COVID tests were attributed to viral shedding & COVID therapy was not initiated. On hospital day 6 she began to decompensate requiring rapid escalation of oxygen supplementation to high flow nasal cannula. At this time high dose steroids were initiated as post COVID syndrome was thought to be the disease pathology. On hospital day 12 retesting revealed seroconversion of COVID antibodies. Her hospital course was complicated by severe hypoxia requiring prolonged steroid taper & oxygen supplementation. She was ultimately discharged on home oxygen with outpatient management. DISCUSSION: Complications of COVID-19 disease include reinfection & post-COVID syndrome. Reinfection was considered in this patient due to repeated negative tests & an asymptomatic period. This remains a rare phenomenon. There are only 5 reported known cases thus far. It was ruled out according to WHO guidelines, since there were <90 days between her 1st & 2nd positive tests. There was no genomic sequencing of both samples to confirm different genetic lineages. Her course was attributed to prolonged shedding of virus which can occur >3 months after infection & despite neutralizing antibodies. We believe she developed severe ARDS due to COVID pneumonitis with possible progression to ILD. Typical disease course is still unclear. There is increasing evidence of fibrotic-like changes in the lung in high rate of patients for up to 6 months. Reversibility of these findings is unknown. Post-mortem evaluation of lung tissue reveals diffuse alveolar damage from chronic inflammation. Obesity, ARDS, prolonged hospitalization & NIMV are reported risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows the importance of considering COVID reinfection in patients with atypical presentation. It is imperative that we differentiate between viral shedding & reinfection in patients with post-acute COVID symptoms. Both presentations may be similar, therefore it is pivotal that we continue to investigate these two-potentially fatal COVID related processes.

Some cancer cells, however, develop escape mechanisms to evade detection and destruction. One of these mechanisms is the expression of cell surface proteins which allow the cancer cell to bind to proteins on T cells called checkpoints to switch off and effectively evade T-cell-mediated destruction. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are antibodies that block the binding of cancer cell proteins to T-cell checkpoints, preventing the T-cell response from being turned off by cancer cells and enabling killer T cells to attack. In other words, ICIs restore innate antitumor immunity, as opposed to traditional chemotherapies that directly kill cancer cells. Given their relatively excellent risk-benefit ratio when compared to other forms of cancer treatment modalities, ICIs are now becoming ubiquitous and have revolutionized the treatment of many types of cancer. Indeed, the prognosis of some patients is so much improved that the threshold for admission for intensive care should be adjusted accordingly. Nevertheless, by modulating immune checkpoint activity, ICIs can disrupt the intricate homeostasis between inhibition and stimulation of immune response, leading to decreased immune self-tolerance and, ultimately, autoimmune complications. These immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) may virtually affect all body systems. Multiple IRAEs are common and may range from mild to life-threatening. Management requires a multidisciplinary approach and consists mainly of immunosuppression, cessation or postponement of ICI treatment, and supportive therapy, which may require surgical intervention and/or intensive care.

Serological assays demonstrated that 98% of sera (69/70) collected from Egyptian fruit bats (n = 37) and straw-colored fruit bats (n = 33) had neutralizing antibodies against PRV. Genetic analyses revealed that all 10 genome segments of Nachunsulwe-57 were closely related to a bat-derived Kasama strain found in Uganda. Nachunsulwe-57 showed less efficiency in viral growth and lower pathogenicity in mice than another PRV strain, Miyazaki-Bali/2007, isolated from a patient. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of Egyptian fruit bats and straw-colored fruit bats were found to be seropositive to PRV in Zambia. Importantly, a new PRV strain (Nachunsulwe-57) was isolated from an Egyptian fruit bat in Zambia, which had relatively weak pathogenicity in mice. Taken together, our findings provide new epidemiological insights about PRV infection in bats and indicate the first isolation of an PRV strain that may have low pathogenicity to humans.","output":"Attenuated infection by a Pteropine orthoreovirus isolated from an Egyptian fruit bat in Zambia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CASE REPORT - INTRODUCTION: Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, children and adolescents have been at minimal risk of admission to hospital and intensive care from SARS-COV2 and exhibited a different phenotype of critical illness to adults. We present a 9-year-old Caucasian boy who, early in the pandemic, became PCR positive and was admitted to paediatric intensive care (PICU) with an adult phenotype of hyperinflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has trisomy 21 and last year was admitted to PICU with ARDS and macrophage activation syndrome. We share how this early case influenced our thinking and subsequent management of cases thought to have PIMS-TS. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: He presented to a district hospital on March 31st with fever and persistent cough without respiratory or other compromise. Discharged home with oral antibiotics, he obtunded within 18 h and returned as an emergency with persistent fever, cough, and haemoptysis with Sa0(2) 77% in 15litres oxygen. Following intubation, a large pulmonary haemorrhage made ventilation difficult and three cardiac arrests occurred prior to transfer on inotropic support. On arrival, results showed Lymphocytes 1.2, Hb 104, Platelets 365, Ferritin 2059, INR 1.2, Procalcitonin (PCT) 43.84, CRP 219, CK 296, LDH 2035, Albumin 35, D-dimer 37.55. SARS-COV2 was confirmed in endotracheal secretions. All other microbiology investigations remained negative other than a scanty growth of Candida. Radiology demonstrated bilateral opacifications and pleural effusions. Blood film was consistent with the clinical picture with no signs of malignancy. Subsequent key results included cytopenia with troughs of Hb 86, Lymphocytes 0.2, Platelets 84; peak Ferritin 6283, d-dimer 50.60 and PCT >100, plateauing by day 7. He was ventilated for 23 days requiring high pressures (PIP consistently >30), nitric oxide and inotropes. There was no clinical improvement despite optimal supportive treatment, but immunomodulation was held during repeat microbiology investigation and concern for losing a fine care balance. However, when formally considering ECMO, a trial of Anakinra 4 mg/kg increasing to 8 mg/kg twice daily over 4 days (day 5C9) was commenced. The inflammatory markers had already plateaued then started to fall and there was no meaningful respiratory improvement with anakinra. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered day 9C10, but improvement in respiratory function only occurred with IV methylprednisolone 10 mg/kg/dose when (days 16C18) the team felt immunomodulation was safe and data from adult intensive care was supportive. He transferred to the ward on day 30 and discharged to his local hospital on day 83. PCR remained positive until day 32. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: As in other children with evidence of SARS-COV2, this child showed a rapid and unpredictable decline in condition, but he presented with an opportunity for prevention of the ensuing hyperinflammation. There is a need for research to identify a fingerprint of inflammation that predicts subsequent decline and the value of prompt, safe immunomodulation to distract from critical cytokine cascades. It is unclear why this boy was one of very few children to develop an adult phenotype but given an altered immune state associated with trisomy 21 and a previous episode of ARDS with hyperinflammation it would suggest that inherent Trisomy 21 genetic risk factors may be involved. He also had previously been identified to features of chronic lung disease that was a contributing factor. Successful management of this child resulted from rigorous organ support and close collaboration between consultants and junior staff in PICU, infectious diseases and rheumatology. This was the beginning of a critical relationship that allowed rapid sharing of information and concerns to maintain safety and explore differentials and treatment strategies. A decision to commence immunomodulation had to consider the fragile state of support and risk; for instance, from fluid overload, the background risk of infection and neoplasia and professionals understanding of drug safety. Anakinra was used first due to a short half-life, extensive safety data in toxic shock and routine use in rheumatology. IVIG was delayed due to fluid volume, but neither this nor anakinra had a meaningful clinical effect. The key response to steroids is like that reported in adults including the RECOVERY trial. Other learning points showed unexpected patterns and limited utility of blood investigations, as seen later in PIMS-TS. This included incongruence in peaks of ferritin and LDH and delayed recovery of cell lines except Hb which was an early signal of improvement. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: A collaborative approach across teams during the care of this patient was critical and primed relationships prior to the surge of PIMS-TS cases. The role of rheumatology has been clearly defined by its familiarity with the benefit and safety of immunomodulatory agents, which has enabled support of intensive care and infectious disease teams in their use. This patient may also have highlighted a predisposition in some cohorts to states of hyperinflammation given his previous episode last year. Is this due to his trisomy 21 and suspected immune dysregulation or other factors, as we know these patients are at an increased risk of infections and autoimmune conditions? Clinical course in children is unpredictable and frequently associated with rapid decline. Teams must remain flexible and able to respond with different treatment strategies as cases continue to evolve. Here there was an adult phenotype and supportive treatment remained key. As in adult care the benefit of steroids in ventilated patients was clear. However, ongoing research is required to examine the safety (and benefit) of early immunomodulation use when other differentials (including sepsis and malignancy) have not been fully or reliably excluded. There is an argument to use immunomodulation early in the presentation of similar patients in the future. Further molecular biological studies such as the DIAMOND study may help us identify key inflammatory pathways and subsequently screening tools to inform such initial treatment and avoid the rapid decline and hospital or PICU admission. Each immunomodulator has distinct characteristics and response to treatment is not predictable. Does this inform treatment algorithms in the absence of evidence from trials? In the absence of trials for this phenotype should treatment follow an adult based algorithm. We hope that by sharing this case it will stimulate further discussion and research to help us treat future similar patients.","output":"O16 Learning from acute COVID-19in a patient with potential immune dysregulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Arachnids are the second most successful terrestrial animal group after insects [1] and were one of the first arthropod clades to successfully invade land [2]. Fossil evidence for this transition is limited, with the majority of arachnid clades first appearing in the terrestrial fossil record. Furthermore, molecular clock dating has suggested a Cambrian-Ordovician terrestrialization event for arachnids [3], some 60 Ma before their first fossils in the Silurian, although these estimates assume that arachnids evolved from a fully aquatic ancestor. Eurypterids, the sister clade to terrestrial arachnids [4-6], are known to have undergone major macroecological shifts in transitioning from marine to freshwater environments during the Devonian [7, 8]. Discoveries of apparently subaerial eurypterid trackways [9, 10] have led to the suggestion that eurypterids were even able to venture on land and possibly breathe air [11]. However, modern horseshoe crabs undertake amphibious excursions onto land to reproduce [12], rendering trace fossil evidence alone inconclusive. Here, we present details of the respiratory organs of Adelophthalmus pyrrhae sp. nov. from the Carboniferous of Montagne Noire, France [13], revealed through micro computed tomography (-CT) imaging. Pillar-like trabeculae on the dorsal surface of each gill lamella indicate eurypterids were capable of subaerial breathing, suggesting that book gills are the direct precursors to book lungs while vascular ancillary respiratory structures known as Kiemenplatten represent novel air-breathing structures. The discovery of air-breathing structures in eurypterids indicates that characters permitting terrestrialization accrued in the arachnid stem lineage and suggests the Cambrian-Ordovician ancestor of arachnids would also have been semi-terrestrial.","output":"Air Breathing in an Exceptionally Preserved 340-Million-Year-Old Sea Scorpion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic brings to the fore strengths and weaknesses in many public policies, including higher education.

Diabetes complications severity index (DCSI) score and defined daily dose (ere used for analysis. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk of KP pneumonia by DPP4i use, with adjustments for propensity score. The Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test was used to estimate the risk of KP pneumonia for DPP4i users. RESULTS: 34774 patients were included. The incidence rate of KP pneumonia in DDP4i users was 1.51 per 1000 person-years and that for the comparison was 2.25 per 1000 person-years.

Recently, cytogenetic and molecular genetics are crucial in the management, as a consequence of their effect on AML pathogenesis, classification, risk-stratification, prognosis and treatment. METHODS: 100 Syrian adults with Normal Karyotype (NK) newly diagnosed AML patients were included in this study, all cases confirmed histologically and immunohistochemically. Patients were divided into six subgroups using flow cytometry and cytological results. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on exon 11-12 for FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), exon 12 for Nucleophosmin1 (NPM1), and exon 23 for DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) using target primers, the electropherograms were analyzed for gene mutations by comparing with the reference DNA sequence. Data were compared and aligned with different sequences using the NCBI BLAST Assembled Genomes tool. RESULTS: FLT3-ITD, NPM1 and DNMT3A were detected in 24%, 22 % and 4% patients respectively. M2 subtype had the most frequent incidence of diagnosis in AML. FLT3-ITD mutation patients had the highest mean of death cases, while the DNMT3A mutation patients had the lowest. On the other hand, the highest mean of remission was in patients with NPM1 mutation and the lowest in the carriers of the FLT3-ITD mutation. It was observed that the mean relapsed patients with FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A mutation was 3.4 and 2 months respectively, with no significant differences between (FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A) carriers and non-carriers relapsed. On the contrary, the mean relapsed for NPM1 mutation carriers was 2.4 months with significant statistical differences. The mean survival time for patients with FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutation was 5.9 months and 5.85 months respectively, with significant correlation. Between it was 5.88 months in DNMT3A patients with no significant differences. Finally, It was noted that the mean event free survival (EFS) of FLT3-ITD mutation patients was 4.818 months and the mean EFS of NPM1 mutation patients was 4.805 months, with significant statistical differences (p<0.05) between the mutation patients and non-mutated patients regarding to EFS, While this mean was not statistically significant in patients carrying DNMT3A mutation. CONCLUSION: Patients with FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations have the worst prognosis, where the presence of those mutations was significantly related to overall survival (OS) and EFS. Our study reflects that DNMT3A was not an extremely bad prognostic effect as an independent factor.

Empirical estimates from Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS), Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), and Quantile Regression (QR) model suggest that technological innovation, Human Development Index (HDI), urbanization, and trade openness significantly boost logistic performance, whereas employment and Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) fail to respond in such a desirable path. In turn, an increase in the Logistic Performance Index (LPI) is found to worsen economic growth. Finally, LPI exhibits a large positive effect on carbon emissions, which is congruent with a strand of the literature highlighting that the modern supply chain is far from being decarbonized.

Whilst many infections are asymptomatic, it is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly for immunocompromised people and for infants who are congenitally infected. A vaccine against CMV has been stated as a public health priority, but there are gaps in our understanding of CMV epidemiology. To guide potential future vaccination strategies, our aim was to examine risk factors for CMV seropositivity in young people in England. METHODS: The Health Survey for England (HSE) is an annual, cross-sectional representative survey of households in England during which data are collected through questionnaires, and blood samples are taken. We randomly selected individuals who participated in the HSE 2002, aiming for 25 participants of each sex in each single year age group from 11 to 24 years. Stored samples were tested for CMV antibodies. We undertook descriptive and regression analyses of CMV seroprevalence and risk factors for infection. RESULTS: Demographic data and serostatus were available for 732 individuals, of whom 175 (23.7%) were CMV-seropositive. CMV seroprevalence was associated with age, with 18.3% seropositive at 11C14 years compared to 28.3% at 22C24 years. CMV serostatus was also higher in people of non-white ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.47C11.14), and in adults who were seropositive for EBV (aOR 2.08 [1.06C4.09]). There was no evidence that smoking status, occupation, body mass index and region of England were associated with CMV serostatus. CONCLUSIONS: CMV seroprevalence is strongly associated with ethnicity, and modestly increases with age in 11C24-year-olds. A greater understanding of the transmission dynamics of CMV, and the impact of this on CMV-associated morbidity and mortality, is necessary to inform effective vaccination strategies when a vaccine for CMV becomes available.","output":"Factors associated with cytomegalovirus serostatus in young people in England: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To meet the needs of older adults isolated in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, we began pairing Human Services and Gerontology students with community dwelling adults 55 years of age and older, recruited through senior centers and other organizations serving older adults.

They also discussed 10 proposed competence areas for public health nursing, developed from the literature. A qualitative content analysis was conducted on the interview transcripts, followed by a synthesis of the data from the interviews and earlier developed competencies. The 10 competence areas for Norwegian public health nursing were then refined. Finally, we compared the affirmed competence areas with earlier developed cornerstones and the new educational guidelines. RESULTS The interviews revealed 10 competence areas. These 10 competence areas were synthesized with the 10 proposed competencies from literature. Ten affirmed competence areas, which mostly corresponded with the competences from literature, were developed.

There is limited information regarding postoperative surveillance and survivorship care in the Australian context. This study investigated patterns of colorectal cancer surveillance at a large tertiary institution. METHODS A retrospective review of hospital records was conducted for all patients treated with curative surgery between January 2012 and June 2017. Provision of clinical surveillance, colonoscopy, computed tomography (CT), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) within 24 months postoperatively were recorded. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to evaluate time-to-surveillance review and associated investigations. RESULTS A total of 675 patients were included in the study. Median time to first postoperative clinical review was 20 days (95% confidence interval (CI), 18-21) with only 31% of patients having their first postoperative clinic review within 2 weeks. Median time to first CEA was 100 days (95% CI, 92-109), with 47% of patients having their CEA checked within the first 3 months, increasing to 68% at 6 months. Median time to first follow-up CT scan was 262 days (95% CI, 242-278) and for colonoscopy, 560 days (95% CI, 477-625). Poor uptake of surveillance testing was more prevalent in patients from older age groups, those with multiple comorbidities, and higher stage cancers. CONCLUSION Colorectal cancer surveillance is multi-disciplinary and involves several parallel processes, many of which lead to inconsistent follow-up.

To that effect, we developed a 96-well microplate assay for the measurement of HCMV-neutralizing activity in human sera using the HCMV-permissive human cell line HEL-299 and the laboratory strain of HCMV AD169. The degree to which neutralizing antibodies diminish HCMV infection of cells in the assay is determined by quantifying the nuclei of infected cells based on expression of the 72 kDa IE1 viral protein. Nuclear IE1 is visualized using a highly sensitive immunoperoxidase staining and the stained nuclei are counted using an automated ELISPOT analyzer. The use of Half Area 96-well microplates, with wells in which the surface area of the well bottom is half the area of a standard 96-well microplate plate, improves signal detection compared with standard microplates and economizes on the usage of indicator cells, virus, and reagents. The staining process was also streamlined by using a microplate washer and data analysis was simplified and accelerated by employing a software program that automatically plots neutralization curves and determines NT(50) values using 4-PL curve fitting. The optimized assay is not only fast and convenient, but also specific, sensitive, precise and reproducible and thus has the characteristics necessary for use in measuring HCMV neutralizing activity in the sera of vaccine trial subjects such as the recipients of Vicals HCMV pDNA vaccine candidates.","output":"Novel Microneutralization Assay for HCMV Using Automated Data Collection and Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic is spreading at a fast pace around the world and has a high mortality rate. Since there is no proper treatment of COVID\\\\19 and its multiple variants, for example, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, being more infectious in nature are affecting millions of people, further complicates the detection process, so, victims are at the risk of death. However, timely and accurate diagnosis of this deadly virus can not only save the patients from life loss but can also prevent them from the complex treatment procedures. Accurate segmentation and classification of COVID\\\\19 is a tedious job due to the extensive variations in its shape and similarity with other diseases like Pneumonia. Furthermore, the existing techniques have hardly focused on the infection growth estimation over time which can assist the doctors to better analyze the condition of COVID\\\\19\\\\affected patients. In this work, we tried to overcome the shortcomings of existing studies by proposing a model capable of segmenting, classifying the COVID\\\\19 from computed tomography images, and predicting its behavior over a certain period. The framework comprises four main steps: (i) data preparation, (ii) segmentation, (iii) infection growth estimation, and (iv) classification. After performing the pre\\\\processing step, we introduced the DenseNet\\\\77 based UNET approach. Initially, the DenseNet\\\\77 is used at the Encoder module of the UNET model to calculate the deep keypoints which are later segmented to show the coronavirus region.

Contact tracing is a well-established feature of public health practice during infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics. However, the high proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission in COVID-19 means that standard contact tracing methods are too slow to stop the progression of infection through the population. To address this problem, many countries around the world have deployed or are developing mobile phone apps capable of supporting instantaneous contact tracing. Informed by the on-going mapping of 'proximity events' these apps are intended both to inform public health policy and to provide alerts to individuals who have been in contact with a person with the infection. The proposed use of mobile phone data for 'intelligent physical distancing' in such contexts raises a number of important ethical questions. In our paper, we outline some ethical considerations that need to be addressed in any deployment of this kind of approach as part of a multidimensional public health response.

However, they can only provide quality services if their work environment provides adequate conditions to support them.

This desk review explores how employment relations, and employment and working conditions may be negatively affecting the health of nurses in countries such as Brazil, Croatia, India, Ireland, Italy, Mxico, Nepal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. MAIN BODY: Nurses health is influenced by the broader social, economic, and political system and the redistribution of power relations that creates new policies regarding the labour market and the welfare state. The vulnerability faced by nurses is heightened by gender inequalities, in addition to social class, ethnicity/race (and caste), age and migrant status, that are inequality axes that explain why nurses workers, and often their families, are exposed to multiple risks and/or poorer health. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, informalization of nurses employment and working conditions were unfair and harmed their health.

We aimed to evaluate cardiovascular damage in patients with COVID-19 and determine the correlation of high-sensitivity cardiac-specific troponin T (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) with the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: We included 872 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 from February to April 2020. We tested 651 patients for high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) and 506 for NT-proBNP on admission. Cardiac injury was defined as hs-TnT> 14ng/L, the upper 99th percentile. Levels of NT-proBNP> 300 pg/mL were considered related to some extent of cardiac injury. The primary composite endpoint was 30-day mortality or mechanical ventilation (MV). RESULTS: Cardiac injury by hs-TnT was observed in 34.6% of our COVID-19 patients. Mortality or MV were higher in cardiac injury than noncardiac injury patients (39.1% vs 9.1%).

While no social strata or population has been spared, the pandemic has posed unique and poorly characterized challenges for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Given the pandemics broad effects, it is helpful to organize the risks posed to specific populations using theoretical models. These models can guide scientific inquiry, interventions, and public policy. Models also provide a visual image of the interplay of individual-, network-, community-, structural-, and pandemic-level factors that can lead to increased risks of infection and associated morbidity and mortality for individuals and populations. Such models are not unidirectional, in that actions of individuals, networks, communities and structural changes can also affect overall disease incidence and prevalence. In this commentary, we describe how the social ecological model (SEM) may be applied to describe the theoretical effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). This model can provide a necessary framework to systematically guide time-sensitive research and implementation of individual-, community-, and policy-level interventions to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with OUD.","output":"Conceptualizing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with opioid use disorder: an application of the social ecological model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The key question addressed in this Chapter is What do people need?, with people here meaning those who live with a rheumatic or musculoskeletal disease.

Upon single injection of the PAI hydrogel, MRSA-infected open wounds can be efficiently healed in only 5 days, and the healing speed is further accelerated by laser irradiation due to the dynamic interaction between iodine and polyvinyl alcohol, causing up to 29% of wound area being closed on day 1. In addition, a safe threshold temperature of skin scald (45 C) emerges for PAI hydrogels because of thermochromic properties, avoiding thermal injuries during irradiation.

Data collected through in-depth, semistructured individual interviews, conducted via Zoom, were coded using phenomenological analysis. Findings suggest a superordinate theme in which COVID-19 presents a multipronged threat to Chinese transracial adoptees. Not only are they unjustly feared and judged by others, but their physical safety and psychological well-being are in jeopardy. This overarching theme was characterized by three core themes: (a) from model minority to racial threat, (b) questioning of identity and sense of belonging, and (c) COVID-19 pandemic as evoking thoughts of adoption. Subsequently, the following eight subthemes emerged: (a) Asian Americans perceived as a racial threat, (b) ongoing denial of anti-Asian racism, (c) coping with COVID-19-related racism, (d) solidarity with the Asian community yet deidentification with Chinese identity, (e) increased sense of being a perpetual foreigner in the U.S., (f) feeling of in-betweenness amplified by sociopolitical tension, (g) increased thoughts of birth parents, and (h) feelings about past and present restrictive government policies in China.

We summarise the literature on the performance of different rapid tests for exertional desaturation and draw on this evidence base to provide guidance in the context of acute COVID-19. Main research questions 1. What exercise tests have been used to assess exertional hypoxia at home or in an ambulatory setting in the context of Covid-19 and to what extent have they been validated?2. What exercise tests have been used to assess exertional hypoxia in other lung conditions, to what extent have they been validated and what is the applicability of these studies to acute Covid-19? Method: AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE MEDLINE, Cochrane and PubMed using LitCovid, Scholar and Google databases were searched to September 2020. Studies where participants had Covid-19 or another lung disease and underwent any form of exercise test which was compared to a reference standard were eligible. Risk of bias was assessed using QUADAS 2. A protocol for the review was published on the Medrxiv database. Results: Of 47 relevant papers, 15 were empirical studies, of which 11 described an attempt to validate one or more exercise desaturation tests in lung diseases other than Covid-19. In all but one of these, methodological quality was poor or impossible to fully assess. None had been designed as a formal validation study (most used simple tests of correlation). Only one validation study (comparing a 1-minute sit-to-stand test [1MSTST] with reference to the 6-minute walk test [6MWT] in 107 patients with interstitial lung disease) contained sufficient raw data for us to calculate the sensitivity (88%), specificity (81%), and positive and negative predictive value (79% and 89% respectively) of the 1MSTST. The other 4 empirical studies included two predictive studies on patients with Covid-19, and two on HIV-positive patients with suspected pneumocystis pneumonia. We found no studies on the 40-step walk test (a less demanding test that is widely used in clinical practice to assess Covid-19 patients). Heterogeneity of study design precluded meta-analysis. Discussion: Exertional desaturation tests have not yet been validated in patients with (or suspected of having) Covid-19. A stronger evidence base exists for the diagnostic accuracy of the 1MSTST in chronic long term pulmonary disease, the relative intensity of this test may raise safety concerns in remote consultations or unstable patients.

Over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, studies focused on facemask wearing among healthcare workers but not among bank workers, who are also at risk of COVID-19. To address this gap and to consider intervention measures that encourage the wearing of facemasks, this study was conducted to identify behaviors of facemask wearing and associated factors among bank workers in Dessie City, Ethiopia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 413 bank workers who were selected using a simple random sampling technique from January 1(st) to 30(th), 2021 in Dessie City, Ethiopia. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and on-the-spot observational checklist. The collected data were checked, coded and entered to EpiData version 4.6 and exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 for data cleaning and analysis. Data were analyzed using bivariable (crude odds ratio [COR]) and multivariable (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]) logistic regression model at 95% confidence interval (CI). Variables from the bivariable analysis with a p-value <0.25 were considered for multivariable analysis. Then, variables that had a p-value <0.05 were declared as factors significantly associated with behavior of facemask wearing. MAIN FINDINGS: In this study, the behavior of facemask wearing among bank workers was 50.4% [95%CI: 45.3C55.2%] with 21.1% always wearing a facemask, 72.4% sometimes, and 6.5% never. A majority of the bank workers 350 (84.7%) had good knowledge of COVID-19 and half of them 208 (50.4%) had a positive attitude towards taking precautions against COVID-19. Just over two-thirds of the respondents 284 (68.8%) preferred to wear a non-medical mask. Two hundred fifty-five (61.7%) said wearing a facemask interfered with communication and 259 (62.7%) felt that wearing a facemask was not comfortable. Facemask-wearing behavior was significantly associated with a high level of positive attitude towards taking precautions against COVID-19 (AOR = 3.27, 95% CI: 1.75C6.11), the perception that the consequences of getting COVID-19 could be serious (AOR = 4.87, 95% CI: 2.38C9.94), the presence of chronic illness (AOR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.07C4.48), sex being female (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.06C3.32) and age being greater or equal to 35 years (AOR = 9.25, 95% CI: 4.79C17.88). CONCLUSION: The main finding of the study showed that the behavior of facemask wearing among bank workers was relatively low (50.4%) compared to other types of workers as found in other studies. To increase the behavior of facemask wearing among bank workers, health decision makers need to develop updated guidance for promotion of facemask wearing to increase the practical and appropriate use of facemasks among bank workers.

In the midst of a pandemic, the main route for detection of the virus has been conducting antigen tests for rapid results, using qRT-PCR, and conducting more accurate molecular tests, using rRT-PCR, on samples from patients. Most common treatments for those infected with COVID-19 include Remdesivir, an antiviral, dexamethasone, a steroid, and rarely, monoclonal antibody treatments.

In April 2011, nasal swabs were collected for virus isolation from pigs exhibiting influenza-like illness. Subsequent electron microscopic, biochemical, and genetic studies identified an orthomyxovirus with seven RNA segments exhibiting approximately 50% overall amino acid identity to human influenza C virus. Based on its genetic organizational similarities to influenza C viruses this virus has been provisionally designated C/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (C/OK). Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted viral proteins found that the divergence between C/OK and human influenza C viruses was similar to that observed between influenza A and B viruses. No cross reactivity was observed between C/OK and human influenza C viruses using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. Additionally, screening of pig and human serum samples found that 9.5% and 1.3%, respectively, of individuals had measurable HI antibody titers to C/OK virus. C/OK virus was able to infect both ferrets and pigs and transmit to naive animals by direct contact. Cell culture studies showed that C/OK virus displayed a broader cellular tropism than a human influenza C virus. The observed difference in cellular tropism was further supported by structural analysis showing that hemagglutinin esterase (HE) proteins between two viruses have conserved enzymatic but divergent receptor-binding sites. These results suggest that C/OK virus represents a new subtype of influenza C viruses that currently circulates in pigs that has not been recognized previously. The presence of multiple subtypes of co-circulating influenza C viruses raises the possibility of reassortment and antigenic shift as mechanisms of influenza C virus evolution.","output":"Isolation of a Novel Swine Influenza Virus from Oklahoma in 2011 Which Is Distantly Related to Human Influenza C Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research Objective Racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare have been highlighted by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services? Nursing Home COVID-19 Public File, we examined the relationship between nursing home racial/ethnic mix and COVID-19 resident mortality. Additionally, we examined the effects of resident characteristics, market resource availability, and organizational characteristics as it relates to nursing home racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 mortality. Study Design Multivariate regressions were used to model the relationship between COVID-19 deaths and the proportion of racial/ethnic minority residents (Black and Hispanic residents). Given the over-dispersion of the count dependent variable (number of COVID-19 deaths), negative binomial regressions were used. We used four nested sequential models to examine the separate contributions of facility-level resident characteristics, resource availability, and other organizational characteristics to racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 deaths. In addition, we controlled for size and interstate differences using state fixed effects. Population Studied The study sample consisted of all US nursing homes included in the CMS Nursing Home COVID-19 Public File, or 15,382 nursing homes, which mirrors the national census of facilities. Principal Findings As of October 25, 2020, high minority nursing homes reported 6.5 COVID-19 deaths as compared to 2.6 deaths for nursing homes that had no racial/ethnic minorities. After controlling for interstate differences, facility-level resident characteristics, resource availability, and organizational characteristics, high-minority nursing homes had 61% more COVID-19 deaths (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR] =?1.61;p < 0.001) as compared to nursing facilities with no minorities. Conclusions From a policy perspective, nursing homes, that serve primarily minority populations, may need additional resources, such as, funding for staffing and personal protective equipment in the face of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has sharpened the focus on healthcare disparities and societal inequalities in the delivery of long-term care. Implications for Policy or Practice This study shows the disparate effect that COVID-19 has had on nursing home mortality based on resident racial/ethnic mix. Even after controlling for interstate differences, facility-level resident characteristics, resource availability, and organizational characteristics, high-minority nursing homes had almost three times the probability of having COVID-19 deaths compared to those with no minorities. These findings highlight the existing and systemic health disparities in nursing homes and the tangible impact it has on racial/ethnic minorities. Death due to COVID-19 is greater risk for racial/ethnic minorities in nursing homes relative to White residents.

The specific vulnerability of the aged brain could derive from the impaired immune defenses, from any of the altered homeostatic mechanisms that contribute to the aging phenotype, and from particular changes in the aged brain involving neurons and glia. While neuronal modifications could contribute indirectly to the damage induced by SARS-CoV-2, glia alterations could play a more direct role, as they are involved in the immune response to viral infections. In aged patients, changes regarding glia include the accumulation of dystrophic forms, reduction of waste removal, activation of microglia and astrocytes, and immunosenescence.

In sight of this, there has been growing interest in the use of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as potential treatments. In this study, we use angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) over-expressed cell membrane chromatography (CMC) to study the interaction of CQ and HCQ with ACE2 receptor. Both CQ and HCQ were retained on the ACE2/CMC column. Then we analyzed the binding character of CQ and HCQ to ACE2 by CMC frontal analysis, ionic force investigation and competitive binding experiment. Results showed that CQ and HCQ KD values obtained from the CMC frontal analysis method were 8.22(0.61)  10-7 M and 11.70(2.44)  10-7 M. Compare to CQ, HCQ has the weaker affinity with ACE2. The action force of CQ, HCQ and ACE2 is mainly ionic force. CQ and HCQ have different degrees of competitive binding relationship with ACE2. Our study revealed the interaction of CQ and HCQ with ACE2 receptor, which provides new insights for the use of CQ and HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, this biomimetic drug screening method is expected to open the door for rapid targeting and separating bioactive ingredients active towards ACE2 receptor.","output":"Cell Membrane Chromatography for the Analysis of the Interaction Between Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine with ACE2 Receptors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since few therapeutic options are clinically accessible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), effective, safe, and globally available pharmaceuticals need to be urgently developed to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and alleviate the severity of COVID-19. In this regard, the present paper is intended to provide an extensive review of the clinical and preclinical evidence on the psychotropics' anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects, giving an insight into their potential applications for patients with a proven or high likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia. The results showed that psychotropic drugs such as melatonin, lithium carbonate, valproate, olanzapine, quetiapine, clozapine, fluoxetine, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, and cannabidiol could help lower the mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to these medications' direct immunomodulatory actions against the destructive cytokine storm, as well as other direct/indirect mechanisms (e. g., the endolysosomal pathway modulation, interactions with specific receptors, and membrane fusion), it was perceived that such drugs could effectively weaken the worsened immune response and avoid adult respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury. According to the author's analysis of the currently available evidence, there is significant support for psychotropics as complementary interventions during SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, further studies need to be carried out to assess the effects of the above psychotropic drugs in vitro and clinical settings.

Methods The online survey questionnaire was distributed to 160 nurses, doctors, medics, and specialists, and only 152 responses were filed in the Google form from healthcare workers from Jordan hospitals. The survey questions wanted answers related toestablishing job satisfaction and burnout levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire also contained questions investigating the nurses' and doctors' demographic, work-related variables, and personal experiences. Additionally, the basic needs at the workplace were investigated, and the world Health Organization-5 well-being index was established through the questionnaires. Different statistics measurements were used. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize both the background information about the healthcare providers and burnout levels. Results from the 152 healthcare professionals filed their responses, 32.6% were males, and the rest were females. Approximately48%.13% and 16% were nurses, doctors, and pharmacists. Burnout was caused by exhaustion, depression, anxiety, and overtime working time. 7% of the nurses were satisfied with the work, while 72.5% were not satisfied. Approximately 24% of the male healthcare providers demonstrated resilience in employment, while 5% of the female healthcare professionals demonstrated burnout and total withdrawal due to the scourging effects of covid-19 (Abujilban et al., 2021). The healthcare providers that received psychological support from their families seemed strong and suffered lower burnout levels. The fear of infection created anxiety that led to stress, and finally, the burnout levels shot high. Conclusions Covid -19 led to increased levels of burnout and lack of job satisfaction. The hospitals in Jordan were not prepared, and the fear of nurses and doctors getting infected created more anxiety.

In other words, the vulnerability assessment represents one of the main input elements for resilience analysis at urban scale. However, facing with a large-scale study, a building-specific assessment approach appears extremely difficult and time-consuming. In this optic, the definition of territorial-specific structural typologies and corresponding vulnerability classes represent a powerful tool for a rapid estimation of the global vulnerability of an examined area. As a matter of fact, the classification of the built heritage in a limited number of structural typologies (featuring similar characteristics) could sensibly reduce the complexity of the vulnerability assessment, hence resilience analysis, at urban scale.

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted in a PICU in Brazil. All patients aged 6 months to 18 years admitted with a diagnosis of sepsis were eligible for inclusion. Those with ferritin and C-reactive protein measured within 48 h and lactate and leukocytes within 24 h of admission were included in the prognostic performance analysis. RESULTS Of 350 eligible patients with sepsis, 294 had undergone all measurements required for analysis and were included in the study. PIM2, ferritin, lactate, and CRP had good discriminatory power for mortality, with PIM2 and ferritin being superior to CRP. The cutoff values for PIM2 (> 14%), ferritin (> 135 ng/mL), lactate (> 1.7 mmol/L), and CRP (> 6.7 mg/mL) were associated with mortality. The combination of ferritin, lactate, and CRP had a positive predictive value of 43% for mortality, similar to that of PIM2 alone (38.6%). The combined use of the three biomarkers plus PIM2 increased the positive predictive value to 76% and accuracy to 0.945. CONCLUSIONS PIM2, ferritin, lactate, and CRP alone showed good prognostic performance for mortality in pediatric patients older than 6 months with sepsis.

Problem in attendance of specialists due to geographical location is the one of the key barriers to effective functioning of MDTs. To overcome this problem, virtual MDTs involving videoconferencing or telemedicine have been proposed, but however this has been seldom used and tested. The COVID-19 pandemic forced the implementation of virtual MDTs in the Oxford sarcoma service in order to maintain normal service provision. We conducted a survey among the participants to evaluate its efficacy. METHODS: An online questionnaire comprising of 24 questions organised into 4 sections was circulated among all participants of the MDT after completion of 8 virtual MDTs. Opinions were sought comparing virtual MDTs to the conventional face-to-face MDTs on various aspects. A total of 36 responses were received and were evaluated. RESULTS: 72.8% were satisfied with the depth of discussion in virtual MDTs and 83.3% felt that the decision-making in diagnosis had not changed following the switch from face-to-face MDTs. About 86% reported to have all essential patient data was available to make decisions and 88.9% were satisfied with the time for discussion of patient issues over virtual platform. Three-fourths of the participants were satisfied (36.1% - highly satisfied; 38.9% - moderately satisfied) with virtual MDTs and 55.6% of them were happy to attend MDTs only by the virtual platform in the future. Regarding future, 77.8% of the participants opined that virtual MDTs would be the future of cancer care and an overwhelming majority (91.7%) felt that the present exercise would serve as a precursor to global MDTs involving specialists from abroad in the future.

Objective: To evaluate OCR treatment outcomes using real-world data from a diverse, community-based MS population. Methods: Adult MS patients who have been prescribed OCR were eligible. Chart reviews at OCR start date and every 6 months were done by a trained RN. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were determined on the start date and then yearly. Descriptive statistics and paired t-tests were used. Results: Of the 437 patients enrolled from March 2017 to March 2021, 73.4% were female;mean age was 51.9 (12.6) years;80.7% had RMS, 12.2% had SPMS, and 7.1% had PPMS. Median baseline EDSS [interquartile range (IQR)] was 3.0 [2.0, 4.0], 6.5 [6.0, 7.5], and 6.5 [6.0, 7.0] respectively. The RMS cohort had an annualized relapse rate (ARR) of 0.33 prior to starting OCR. Among all patients who had > 1 dose of OCR (n=407), ARR was 0.07. Median EDSS scores at 12 months were 3.0 [2.0, 4.5] (n=184) for RMS patients, 6.5 [6.5, 7.5] (n=32) for SPMS, and 6.5 [5.6, 7.5] (n=16) for PPMS. Infusion reactions occurred in 33.2% of patients during dose one, becoming less frequent with subsequent doses. Respiratory infections occurred in 40.5% of patients followed by urinary tract infections (UTI) (36.6%). Eight patients developed SARS-CoV-2 with no reported hospitalizations or deaths. Of 50 patients hospitalized, 19 had multiple hospitalizations. Over half of the hospitalizations were due to infections, and 69% (n=27) were 55 years or older. Of the 93 patients (21.3%) patients who stopped OCR, 47 patients stopped due to side effects with recurrent infections being the main reason for stopping followed by fatigue/malaise. The median time to discontinuation was 19.6 [IQR: 9.5, 30.2] months. There have been 7 deaths. Ninety-three patients who had baseline and 12 month Modified Fatigue Inventory (MFIS) had significant improvement at 12 months (mean difference -3.6 (13.9), (p=0.01).

One key theme cutting across many infodemic analyses is that it stymies users capacities to identify appropriate information and guidelines, encourages them to take inappropriate or even harmful actions, and should be managed through multiple transdisciplinary approaches. Yet, investigations demonstrating how the COVID-19 information ecosystem influences complex public decision making and behavior offline are relatively few. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether information reported through the social media channel Twitter, linked articles and websites, and selected traditional media affected the risk perception, engagement in field activities, and protective behaviors of French Red Cross (FRC) volunteers and health workers in the Paris region of France from June to October 2020. METHODS: We used a hybrid approach that blended online and offline data. We tracked daily Twitter discussions and selected traditional media in France for 7 months, qualitatively evaluating COVID-19 claims and debates about nonpharmaceutical protective measures. We conducted 24 semistructured interviews with FRC workers and volunteers. RESULTS: Social and traditional media debates about viral risks and nonpharmaceutical interventions fanned anxieties among FRC volunteers and workers. Decisions to continue conducting FRC field activities and daily protective practices were also influenced by other factors unrelated to the infodemic: familial and social obligations, gender expectations, financial pressures, FRC rules and communications, state regulations, and relationships with coworkers. Some respondents developed strategies for tuning out social and traditional media. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the information ecosystem may be just one among multiple influences on one groups offline perceptions and behavior. Measures to address users who have disengaged from online sources of health information and who rely on social relationships to obtain information are needed. Tuning out can potentially lead to less informed decision making, leading to worse health outcomes.","output":"The Impact of the Online COVID-19 Infodemic on French Red Cross Actors Field Engagement and Protective Behaviors: Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Image segmentation plays an important role in daily life. The traditional K-means image segmentation has the shortcomings of randomness and is easy to fall into local optimum, which greatly reduces the quality of segmentation. To improve these phenomena, a K-means image segmentation method based on improved manta ray foraging optimization (IMRFO) is proposed. IMRFO uses Lvy flight to improve the flexibility of individual manta rays and then puts forward a random walk learning that prevents the algorithm from falling into the local optimal state. Finally, the learning idea of particle swarm optimization is introduced to enhance the convergence accuracy of the algorithm, which effectively improves the global and local optimization ability of the algorithm simultaneously. With the probability that K-means will fall into local optimum reducing, the optimized K-means hold stronger stability.

Guanylurea often accumulates and is poorly, if at all, biodegraded in wastewater treatment plants. This study describes Pseudomonas mendocina strain GU, isolated from a municipal wastewater treatment plant, using guanylurea as its sole nitrogen source. The genome was sequenced with 36-fold coverage and mined to identify guanylurea degradation genes. The gene encoding the enzyme initiating guanylurea metabolism was expressed, and the enzyme was purified and characterized. Guanylurea hydrolase, a newly described enzyme, was shown to transform guanylurea to one equivalent (each) of ammonia and guanidine. Guanidine also supports growth as a sole nitrogen source. Cell yields from growth on limiting concentrations of guanylurea revealed that metabolism releases all four nitrogen atoms. Genes encoding complete metabolic transformation were identified bioinformatically, defining the pathway as follows: guanylurea to guanidine to carboxyguanidine to allophanate to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The first enzyme, guanylurea hydrolase, is a member of the isochorismatase-like hydrolase protein family, which includes biuret hydrolase and triuret hydrolase. Although homologs, the three enzymes show distinct substrate specificities. Pairwise sequence comparisons and the use of sequence similarity networks allowed fine structure discrimination between the three homologous enzymes and provided insights into the evolutionary origins of guanylurea hydrolase. IMPORTANCE Metformin is a pharmaceutical most prescribed for type 2 diabetes and is now being examined for potential benefits to COVID-19 patients. People taking the drug pass it largely unchanged, and it subsequently enters wastewater treatment plants. Metformin has been known to be metabolized to guanylurea. The levels of guanylurea often exceed that of metformin, leading to the former being considered a dead-end metabolite. Metformin and guanylurea are water pollutants of emerging concern, as they persist to reach nontarget aquatic life and humans, the latter if it remains in treated water. The present study has identified a Pseudomonas mendocina strain that completely degrades guanylurea. The genome was sequenced, and the genes involved in guanylurea metabolism were identified in three widely separated genomic regions. This knowledge advances the idea that guanylurea is not a dead-end product and will allow for bioinformatic identification of the relevant genes in wastewater treatment plant microbiomes and other environments subjected to metagenomic sequencing.","output":"Filling in the Gaps in Metformin Biodegradation: a New Enzyme and a Metabolic Pathway for Guanylurea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Developing an understanding of the antibody response, seroprevalence, and seroconversion from natural infection and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 will give way to a critical epidemiological tool to predict reinfection rates, identify vulnerable communities, and manage future viral outbreaks. To monitor the antibody response on a larger scale, we need an inexpensive, less invasive, and high throughput method. METHODS: Here we investigate the use of oral mucosal fluids from individuals recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection to monitor antibody response and persistence over a 12-month period. For this cohort study, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to quantify anti-Spike(S) protein IgG antibodies in participants who had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and regularly (every 2-4 weeks) provided both serum and oral fluid mucosal fluid samples for longitudinal antibody titer analysis. RESULTS: In our study cohort (n=42) with 17 males and 25 females with an average age of 45.6 +/- 19.3 years, we observed no significant change in oral mucosal fluid IgG levels across the time course of antibody monitoring. In oral mucosal fluids, all the participants who initially had detectable antibodies continued to have detectable antibodies throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results presented here, we have shown that oral mucosal fluid-based assays are an effective, less invasive tool for monitoring seroprevalence and seroconversion, which offers an alternative to serum-based assays for understanding the protective ability conferred by the adaptive immune response from viral infection and vaccination against future reinfections.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Specific IgG Antibodies Persist Over a 12-Month Period in Oral Mucosal Fluid Collected From Previously Infected Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a unique set of circumstances in which most of us are struggling with the same sort of existential questions across our unique contexts and subjective experiences.

Awareness of rare diagnoses such as this will reduce the delay to treatment. A challenge in Ireland is accessing psychiatric inpatient treatment for very young children, with specialist units in Ireland designed to better cater for young people aged 12+. Case report Michael (not his real name), age 10, was always described as a happy, calm child. He enjoyed school and loved playing outdoors. He had been progressing well with his life and neither his parents nor school had any concerns for him. Following the COVID-19 pandemic and school closures, Michael began to became more conscious of daily hygiene safety advice. However, things escalated to a very difficult level. Initially, he manifested extreme levels of anxiety with heightened levels of distress. He ran away from open doors or windows for fear he would catch the virus, insisted on changing his clothes several times per day, would become distressed if anyone touched him accidentally while he was outside and could spend hours afterwards crying and screaming. In June 2020 he showed profound refusal to engage in basic care tasks and a dramatic social withdrawal, and ultimately required admission to hospital. He refused to eat and drink, stopped washing and toileting himself, lay in bed with the covers over this head, became non-verbal and refused to engage with any conversation or games. He showed prolonged periods of screaming. Ultimately this reached a level requiring TPN and PEG feeding and a low stimulation environment. Diagnosis of pervasive refusal disorder, secondary to severe COVID-19 related anxiety was made. Discussion Pervasive refusal disorder is a rare and potentially life threatening condition in children. It is described as a profound psychological response to uncontrollable events such as grief, abuse, parental conflict and migration. In this case, it was the threat of the global pandemic. Through treatment in low stimulation environments, with consistent communication and rehabilitation and medication, followed by individual and family therapies when patients are more able, patients show a slow, but generally complete recovery. Happily for Michael, he has now recovered and returned home to his family, where he has returned to all his previous activities. Conclusion Michael and his parents have kindly agreed to allow us to tell his story, in the hope of teaching current and future psychiatrists about this rare condition. We send them our thanks and appreciation.","output":"A case of pervasive refusal syndrome related to COVID19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the development of trade liberalization, the pollutants emissions embodied in global trade are increasing. The pollution haven hypothesis caused by trade has aroused wide attention. The fragmentation of international production has reshaped trade patterns. The proportion of intermediate product trade in global trade is increasing. However, little has been done to study the pollution haven of different pollutants under different trade patterns. In this paper, major environmental pollutants CO(2) (carbon dioxide), SO(2) (sulfur dioxide), and NO(x) (nitrogen oxides) are selected as the research objects. This study investigated the global pollution haven phenomenon in 43 countries and 56 major industries from 2000 to 2014. Based on the MRIO model, the trade mode is divided into three specific patterns: final product trade, intermediate product trade in the last stage of production, and the trade related to the global value chain. The results show that trade liberalization could reduce global CO(2), SO(2), and NOx emissions, and intermediate product trade has a more significant emission reduction effect than final product trade. Trades impacts on each country are various, and the main drivers are also different. For example, the European Union avoids becoming a pollution haven mainly through the trade related to the global value chain. The suppressed emissions under this trade pattern are 71.8 Mt CO(2), 2.2 Mt SO(2), 2.2 Mt NO(x). India avoids most pollutants emissions through intermediate product trade. China has become the most serious pollution haven through final product trade.

Antibody/antigen ratio in the complexes proved to be a critical parameter in enhancing antigen presentation. Complexes in moderate antibody excess provided optimal T cell activation independently of the physical state of the complexes (precipitated by a second antibody or solubilized by complement). Complexes in extreme antibody excess, on the contrary, did not yield T cell activation although taken up by APC efficiently. The effect of antibodies at extreme excess was observed with substimulatory dose of antigen (loss of potentiation) and with optimal dose of antigen (loss of stimulation). An excess of specific polyclonal antibodies hampers proteolytic degradation of antigen in vitro, supporting the view that a similar mechanism may operate within the APC that have internalized immune complexes in extreme antibody excess.

In contrast to two intramuscular injections with an mRNA vaccine, the mucosal boost with adenoviral vectors induced high levels of IgA and tissue-resident memory T cells in the respiratory tract. Mucosal neutralization of virus variants of concern was also enhanced by the intranasal boosts. Importantly, priming with mRNA provoked a more comprehensive T cell response consisting of circulating and tissue-resident memory T cells after the boost, while a DNA priming induced mostly mucosal T cells.

However, the scarcity of training data for specific kinases makes it difficult to train effective models for predicting their phosphorylation sites. In this paper, we propose a deep transfer learning framework, PhosTransfer, for improving kinase-specific phosphorylation site prediction. It banks on the hierarchical information encoded in the kinase classification tree (KCT) which involves four levels: kinase groups, families, subfamilies and protein kinases (PKs). With PhosTransfer, predictive models associated with tree nodes at higher levels, which are trained with more sufficient training data, can be transferred and reused as feature extractors for predictive models of tree nodes at a lower level. Out results indicate that models with deep transfer learning out-performed those without transfer learning for 73 out of 79 tested PKs. The positive effect of deep transfer learning is better demonstrated in the prediction of phosphosites for kinase nodes with less training data. These improved performances are further validated and explained by the visualisation of vector representations generated from hidden layers pre-trained at different KCT levels.

RNA analysis from purified virions showed that the three defective RNAs were efficiently packaged. Virions of different densities containing either full-length or defective RNAs were sorted in sucrose gradients, indicating that defective and full-length genomes were independently encapsidated. DI-B and DI-C RNAs were amplified by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced. DI-B and DI-C genomes are formed by three and four discontinuous regions of the wild-type genome, respectively. DI-C contains 2144 nucleotides (nt) from the 5-end of the genome, two fragments of 4540 and 2531 nt mostly from gene 1b, and 493 nt from the 3 end of the genome.

This variant, termed DMS-MaPseq, allows for mapping of all RNAs in a cell at the same time. However, if an RNA adopts different structures, for example during the assembly of an RNA-protein complex, or as part of its functional cycle, then DMS-MaPseq cannot differentiate between these structures, and an ensemble average will be produced. This is especially challenging for long-lived RNAs, such as ribosomes, whose steady-state abundance far exceeds that of any assembly intermediates, rendering those inaccessible to DMS-MaPseq on total RNAs. These challenges can be overcome by purification of assembly intermediates stalled at specific assembly steps (or steps in the functional cycle), via a combination of affinity tags and mutants stalled at defined steps, and subsequent DMS probing of these intermediates. Interpretation of the differences in DMS accessibility is facilitated by additional structural information, e.g. from cryo-EM experiments, available for many functional RNAs. While this approach is generally useful for studying RNA folding or conformational changes within RNA-protein complexes, it can be particularly valuable for studying the role(s) of DEAD-box proteins, as these tend to lead to larger conformational rearrangements, often resulting from the release of an RNA-binding protein from a bound RNA. Here we provide an adaptation of the DMS-MaPseq protocol to study RNA conformational transitions during ribosome assembly, which addresses the challenges arising from the presence of many assembly intermediates, all at concentrations far below that of mature ribosomes.

The spread of pandemic influenza A (A(H1N1)pdm09) in 2009 around the globe had a huge impact on global health. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of A(H1N1)pdm09 on pediatric ARI in Vietnam. STUDY DESIGN: An ongoing population-based prospective surveillance in central Vietnam was used. All children aged <15 years residing in Nha Trang city, enrolled to the ARI surveillance in Khanh Hoa General Hospital, from February 2007 through March 2011 were studied. Clinical data and nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected. Influenza A was detected and genotyped by multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays and sequencing. RESULTS: Among enrolled 2736 hospitalized ARI cases, 354 (13%) were positive for influenza A. Genotyping results revealed that seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 (sea-H1N1) viruses were cocirculating before A(H1N1)pdm09 appeared in July 2009. The A(H1N1)pdm09 replaced the sea-H1N1 after the pandemic. The majority of influenza A cases (90%) were aged <5 years with incidence rate of 537 (387C775) per 100 000 population. Annual incidence rates of hospitalized influenza cases for pre-, initial and post-pandemic periods among children aged <5 year were 474, 452, and 387 per 100 000, respectively. Children with A(H1N1)pdm09 were elder, visited the hospital earlier, less frequently had severe signs, and were less frequently associated with viral coinfection compared with seasonal influenza cases.

Because new cases were quickly increasing, parents called for school closures. A national parent group used an online survey to collect opinions about upcoming school closings planned by the Ministry of Education. This study evaluated the results of the survey for all respondents and investigated the level of viral transmission following school closures among students in Taiwan. METHODS: An online survey titled Survey of Opinions of School Closures during the Current COVID-19 Outbreak (SOSC-COVID-19) was designed by the national parent association and then distributed to members of the community throughout Taiwan via local parent groups from May 17 to 18, 2021. The survey included an open-ended respondents' opinions about school closures. Differences among regions and socioeconomic scores (SES) were analyzed with chi-square tests. RESULTS: A total of 8,703 completed survey forms data were analyzed. Nearly all respondents (7,973, 91.6%) approved of school closures; there were no differences of opinions inside and outside municipalities or by regional SES scores. Only 8.4% of respondents were opposed to any type of school closure, believing parents should decide whether their child attended school, which also did not vary with region or SES score. Qualitative feedback from parent and teacher responders indicated students' health and economic impacts were additional concerns that influenced their choice of whether the government or parents should decide about school closures. On the afternoon of May 18, 2021, the government of Taiwan closed all schools.

Most interestingly, Siglec-1 and STAT1 in CD14+ monocytes and plasmablasts showed lower expression among severe COVID-19 cases compared to mild cases. Contrary to the baseline whole protein STAT1 expression, the phosphorylation of STAT1 was enhanced in severe COVID-19 cases, indicating a dysbalanced JAK STAT signaling that fails to induce transcription of interferon stimulated response elements (ISRE). This abnormality persisted after IFN- and IFN-{gamma} stimulation of PBMCs from patients with severe COVID-19. The data suggest impaired STAT1 transcriptional upregulation among severely infected patients which may represent a potential predictive biomarker and may allow stratification of patients for certain interferon-pathway targeted treatments.","output":"Altered increase in STAT1 expression and phosphorylation in severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The study aims to describe characteristics and clinical outcome of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection that received siltuximab according to a protocol that aimed to early block the activity of IL-6 to avoid the progression of the inflammatory flare.

In the limit of fast diffusion pathogens, the method of matched asymptotic analysis is used to reduce the coupled PDECODE model to a nonlinear system of ODEs for the average density of pathogens in the air. The reduced system of ODEs is used to derive the basic reproduction number and the final size relation for the model. Numerical simulations of the full PDECODE model and the reduced system of ODEs are used to assess the impact of human mobility, together with the diffusion of pathogens on the dynamics of the disease. Results from the two models are consistent and show that human mobility significantly affects disease dynamics.

(2) To evaluate the indirect impact of the pandemic on patients with cardiomyopathy through the Heart Hive COVID-19 study. (3) To assess the impact of the pandemic on national cardiomyopathy-related hospital admissions. METHODS: (1) 1236 patients (703 DCM, 533 HCM) in the RBHH CRC Biobank were assessed for COVID-19 infections and hospitalisations; (2) 207 subjects (131 cardiomyopathy, 76 without heart disease) in the Heart Hive COVID-19 study completed online surveys evaluating physical health, psychological well-being, and behavioural adaptations during the pandemic and (3) 11 447 cardiomyopathy-related hospital admissions across National Health Service (NHS) England were studied from NHS Digital Hospital Episode Statistics over 2019C2020. RESULTS: A comparable proportion of patients with cardiomyopathy in the RBHH CRC Biobank had tested positive for COVID-19 compared with the UK population (1.1% vs 1.6%, p=0.14), but a higher proportion of those infected were hospitalised (53.8% vs 16.5%, p=0.002). In the Heart Hive COVID-19 study, more patients with cardiomyopathy felt their physical health had deteriorated due to the pandemic than subjects without heart disease (32.3% vs 13.2%, p=0.004) despite only 4.6% of the cardiomyopathy cohort reporting COVID-19 symptoms. A 17.9% year-on-year reduction in national cardiomyopathy-related hospital admissions was observed in 2020. CONCLUSION: Patients with cardiomyopathy had similar reported rates of testing positive for COVID-19 to the background population, but those with test-proven infection were hospitalised more frequently. Deterioration in physical health amongst patients could not be explained by COVID-19 symptoms, inferring a significant contribution of the indirect consequences of the pandemic.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is the key receptor on lung epithelial cells to facilitate initial binding and infection of SARS-CoV-2. The binding to ACE2 is mediated via the spike glycoprotein present on the viral surface. Recent clinical data have demonstrated that patients with previous episodes of brain injuries are a high-risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection. An explanation for this finding is currently lacking. Sterile tissue injuries including stroke induce the release of several inflammatory mediators that might modulate the expression levels of signaling proteins in distant organs. Whether systemic inflammation following brain injury can specifically modulate ACE2 expression in different vital tissues has not been investigated. METHODS: For the induction of brain stroke, mice were subjected to a surgical procedure for transient interruption of blood flow in the middle cerebral artery for 45 min and sacrificed after 1 and 3 days for analysis of brain, lung, heart, and kidney tissues. Gene expression and protein levels of ACE2, ACE, IL-6 and IL1 were measured by quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively. The level of soluble ACE2 in plasma and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) was measured using an immunoassay. Immune cell populations in lymphoid organs were analyzed by flow cytometry. Post-stroke pneumonia in mice was examined by bacterial cultures from lung homogenates and whole blood. RESULTS: Strikingly, 1 day after surgery, we observed a substantial increase in the protein levels of ACE2 in the lungs of stroke mice compared to sham-operated mice. However, the protein levels of ACE2 were found unchanged in the heart, kidney, and brain of these animals. In addition, we found increased transcriptional levels of alveolar ACE2 after stroke. The increased expression of ACE2 was significantly associated with the severity of behavioral deficits after stroke. The higher protein levels of alveolar ACE2 persisted until 3 days of stroke. Interestingly, we found reduced levels of soluble ACE2 in plasma but not in BAL in stroke-operated mice compared to sham mice. Furthermore, stroke-induced parenchymal and systemic inflammation was evident with the increased expression of IL-6 and IL-1. Reduced numbers of T-lymphocytes were present in the blood and spleen as an indicator of sterile tissue injury-induced immunosuppression. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate specific augmented alveolar ACE2 levels and inflammation in murine lungs after experimental stroke. These pre-clinical findings suggest that patients with brain injuries may have increased binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 in their lungs which might explain why stroke is a risk factor for higher susceptibility to develop COVID-19.","output":"Stroke increases the expression of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor, in murine lungs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systolic interarm differences in blood pressure have been associated with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease.

We searched for studies recording bilateral blood pressure and outcomes, established agreements with collaborating authors, and created a single international dataset: the Inter-arm Blood Pressure Difference - Individual Participant Data (INTERPRESS-IPD) Collaboration.

Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality increased with interarm difference magnitude from a 5 mm Hg threshold (hazard ratio, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.01-1.14]).

It is believed that if a CF patient ceases treatment for 2 days, this can result in an exacerbation. One week of missed treatments can result in a hospitalization and 1 month of missed treatments can result in an earlier demise. With a global pandemic that has affected more than 9 million people, many CF clinics were required to take steps to avoid transmission of this dangerous virus. This may result in delays in delivery of timely CF care due to closure of clinics and pulmonary function testing (PFT) laboratories and limited staff allowed on site for conducting in-person visits. These measures, along with suggestions from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) to extend the social distancing longer than traditional CDC recommendations for the CF community, create an urgent need to explore novel ways to deliver safer care via new standards in chronic health conditions like CF. Especially, as these preventive strategies may be necessary for long-term maintenance, few objective alternatives exist to guide clinicians and allied health professionals in CF centers how to proceed in this new era.

Here, we interrogated antibody and antigen-specific memory B cells over time in 33 SARS-CoV-2 na?ve and 11 SARS-CoV-2 recovered subjects. SARS-CoV-2 na?ve individuals required both vaccine doses for optimal increases in antibodies, particularly for neutralizing titers against the B.1.351 variant. Memory B cells specific for full-length spike protein and the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) were also efficiently primed by mRNA vaccination and detectable in all SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects after the second vaccine dose, though the memory B cell response declined slightly with age. In SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals, antibody and memory B cell responses were significantly boosted after the first vaccine dose; however, there was no increase in circulating antibodies, neutralizing titers, or antigen-specific memory B cells after the second dose. This robust boosting after the first vaccine dose strongly correlated with levels of pre-existing memory B cells in recovered individuals, identifying a key role for memory B cells in mounting recall responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Together, our data demonstrated robust serological and cellular priming by mRNA vaccines and revealed distinct responses based on prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, whereby COVID-19 recovered subjects may only require a single vaccine dose to achieve peak antibody and memory B cell responses.

We compared the results of two methods and explored how they worked to characterize the 2018 influenza season performanceC2018 season. METHODS: Historical data from the 2005/2006 to 2016/2018 influenza season performance seasons were provided by a network of 412 primary health centers in charge of influenza like illness (ILI) sentinel surveillance. We used the WHO averages and the moving epidemic method (MEM) to evaluate the proportion of ILI visits among all outpatient consultations (ILI%) as a proxy for influenza activity. We also used the MEM method to evaluate three seasons of composite data (ILI% multiplied by percent of ILI with laboratory-confirmed influenza) as recommended by WHO. RESULTS: The WHO method estimated the seasonal ILI% threshold at 0.9%. The annual epidemic period began on average at week 46 and lasted an average of 18 weeks. The MEM model estimated the epidemic threshold (corresponding to the WHO seasonal threshold) at 1.5% of ILI visits among all outpatient consultations. The annual epidemic period began on week 49 and lasted on average 14 weeks. Intensity thresholds were similar using both methods. When using the composite measure, the MEM method showed a clearer estimate of the beginning of the influenza epidemic, which was coincident with a sharp increase in confirmed ILI cases. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the threshold methodology presented in the WHO manual is simple to implement and easy to adopt for use by the Moroccan influenza surveillance system. The MEM method is more statistically sophisticated and may allow a better detection of the start of seasonal epidemics. Incorporation of virologic data into the composite parameter as recommended by WHO has the potential to increase the accuracy of seasonal threshold estimation.","output":"Establishing seasonal and alert influenza thresholds in Morocco"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multiple early reports of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 showed that patients with chronic respiratory disease were significantly under-represented in these cohorts. We hypothesised that the widespread use of inhaled glucocorticoids among these patients was responsible for this finding, and tested if inhaled glucocorticoids would be an effective treatment for early COVID-19. METHODS: We performed an open-label, parallel-group, phase 2, randomised controlled trial (Steroids in COVID-19; STOIC) of inhaled budesonide, compared with usual care, in adults within 7 days of the onset of mild COVID-19 symptoms. The trial was done in the community in Oxfordshire, UK. Participants were randomly assigned to inhaled budsonide or usual care stratified for age (&#8804;40 years or >40 years), sex (male or female), and number of comorbidities (&#8804;1 and &#8805;2). Randomisation was done using random sequence generation in block randomisation in a 1:1 ratio. Budesonide dry powder was delivered using a turbohaler at a dose of 400 g per actuation. Participants were asked to take two inhalations twice a day until symptom resolution. The primary endpoint was COVID-19-related urgent care visit, including emergency department assessment or hospitalisation, analysed for both the per-protocol and intention-to-treat (ITT) populations. The secondary outcomes were self-reported clinical recovery (symptom resolution), viral symptoms measured using the Common Cold Questionnare (CCQ) and the InFLUenza Patient Reported Outcome Questionnaire (FLUPro), body temperature, blood oxygen saturations, and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. The trial was stopped early after independent statistical review concluded that study outcome would not change with further participant enrolment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04416399. FINDINGS: From July 16 to Dec 9, 2020, 167 participants were recruited and assessed for eligibility. 21 did not meet eligibility criteria and were excluded. 146 participants were randomly assigned-73 to usual care and 73 to budesonide. For the per-protocol population (n=139), the primary outcome occurred in ten (14%) of 70 participants in the usual care group and one (1%) of 69 participants in the budesonide group (difference in proportions 0131, 95% CI 0043 to 0218; p=0004). For the ITT population, the primary outcome occurred in 11 (15%) participants in the usual care group and two (3%) participants in the budesonide group (difference in proportions 0123, 95% CI 0033 to 0213; p=0009). The number needed to treat with inhaled budesonide to reduce COVID-19 deterioration was eight. Clinical recovery was 1 day shorter in the budesonide group compared with the usual care group (median 7 days [95% CI 6 to 9] in the budesonide group vs 8 days [7 to 11] in the usual care group; log-rank test p=0007). The mean proportion of days with a fever in the first 14 days was lower in the budesonide group (2%, SD 6) than the usual care group (8%, SD 18; Wilcoxon test p=0051) and the proportion of participants with at least 1 day of fever was lower in the budesonide group when compared with the usual care group. As-needed antipyretic medication was required for fewer proportion of days in the budesonide group compared with the usual care group (27% [IQR 0-50] vs 50% [15-71]; p=0025) Fewer participants randomly assigned to budesonide had persistent symptoms at days 14 and 28 compared with participants receiving usual care (difference in proportions 0204, 95% CI 0075 to 0334; p=0003). The mean total score change in the CCQ and FLUPro over 14 days was significantly better in the budesonide group compared with the usual care group (CCQ mean difference -012, 95% CI -021 to -002 [p=0016]; FLUPro mean difference -010, 95% CI -021 to -000 [p=0044]). Blood oxygen saturations and SARS-CoV-2 load, measured by cycle threshold, were not different between the groups. Budesonide was safe, with only five (7%) participants reporting self-limiting adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Early administration of inhaled budesonide reduced the likelihood of needing urgent medical care and reduced time to recovery after early COVID-19.

Corticosteroids constitute a group of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs that are widely used in the treatment of COVID-19. Comprehensive reviews investigating the comparative proportion and efficacy of corticosteroid use are scarce. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials to evaluate the proportion and efficacy of corticosteroid use for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature review and meta-analysis of research articles, including observational studies and clinical trials, by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, and China Academic Journal Network Publishing databases. Patients treated between December 1, 2019, and January 1, 2021, were included. The outcome measures were the proportion of patients treated with corticosteroids, viral clearance and mortality. The effect size with the associated 95% confidence interval is reported as the weighted mean difference for continuous outcomes and the odds ratio for dichotomous outcomes. RESULTS: Fifty-two trials involving 15710 patients were included. The meta-analysis demonstrated that the proportion of COVID-19 patients who received corticosteroids was significantly lower than that of patients who did not receive corticosteroids (35.19% vs. 64.49%). In addition, our meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the proportions of severe and nonsevere cases treated with corticosteroids (27.91% vs. 20.91%). We also performed subgroup analyses stratified by whether patients stayed in the intensive care unit (ICU) and found that the proportion of patients who received corticosteroids was significantly higher among those who stayed in the ICU than among those who did not. The results of our meta-analysis indicate that corticosteroid treatment significantly delayed the viral clearance time. Finally, our meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the use of corticosteroids for COVID-19 between patients who died and those who survived. This result indicates that mortality is not correlated with corticosteroid therapy. CONCLUSION: The proportion of COVID-19 patients who received corticosteroids was significantly lower than that of patients who did not receive corticosteroids. Corticosteroid use in subjects with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections delayed viral clearance and did not convincingly improve survival; therefore, corticosteroids should be used with extreme caution in the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"The proportion and effect of corticosteroid therapy in patients with COVID-19 infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary: This text presents a very primay progress, although it is timely because it is associated with the current health emergency It is a quick investigation that we are developing from the Anthropology and Health Program, Department of Social Anthropology of the Faculty of Humanities and Education Sciences According to the proposal of the program management and the agreement of its members, the registration phase began in the first week of april this year, when the pandemic was just beginning to manifest itself in the country The measures taken, the attitudes of the authorities, of health professionals, of people in general at that time had the immediacy of surprise, of shared fear Here the theoretical-methodological proposal is captured, the foundations from which this qualitative research, of an ethnographic type, was developed in its first time Some general concepts are discussed and the actions that were carried out are outlined, as well as the steps that are missing to reach expected results","output":"Uniformity and divergence: Covid 19 pandemic of the 21st century Uniformidade e divergncia: Pandmica de covid 19 do sculo xxi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The willingness of African population to take the COVID-19 vaccines is critical to the efficiency of national immunisation programmes. This study surveys the views of adult African inhabitants toward vaccination and the possibility of participating or not participating in governments efforts to get citizens vaccinated. Method: A cross-sectional online survey of adult Africans was undertaken from December 2020 to March 2021. Responses were anonymised. The Pearson Chi-square test was performed to determine whether or not there were any variations in knowledge, awareness, perception, and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines among the participants. Binomial logistic regression was used to evaluate the factors associated with willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccines and participate in immunisation programmes. Results: The results indicate that COVID-19 vaccines are more likely to be used by adult Africans over the age of 18 who are largely technologically savvy (55 percent) if the vaccine is made broadly available. A total of 33 percent of those who responded said they were unlikely to receive the vaccine, with another 15 percent stating they were undecided. Aside from that, we found that vaccine hesitancy was closely associated with socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender, education, and source of information. We also found that there were widespread conspiracies and myths about the COVID-19 vaccines. Conclusion: More than two-thirds of African adults who participated in the survey indicated they would not receive the COVID-19 vaccine, with the majority of them expressing skepticism about the vaccine's efficacy. It is possible that many of the people who would not be vaccinated would have an impact on the implementation of a COVID-19 immunisation programme that is meant for all of society.

METHODS By optimizing the design of primers and probes and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) conditions, we achieved simultaneous detection of multiple influenza and zoonotic influenza viruses, including H1N1, H5N1, and H9N2 strains, in a one-step, quantitative real-time RT-PCR array (rRT-PCR array) of RNA from multiple influenza strains utilizing a single set of conditions for RT-PCR amplification. The target sequences from all targeted zoonotic influenza viruses were cloned into recombinant RNA virus particles, which were used to evaluate sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the zoonotic influenza viruses RT-PCR array. RESULTS The detection limit of the array was shown to be between 10(0) and 10(1) copies per reaction, and the standard curve demonstrated a linear range from 10 to 10(6) copies. Thus, the analytical sensitivity of this zoonotic influenza viruses RT-PCR array is 10-100 times higher than conventional RT-PCR. Specificity of the one-step zoonotic influenza viruses RT-PCR array was verified by comparison of results obtained with retroviral-like particles (RVPs), which contained RNA from isolates of seasonal influenza viruses, zoonotic influenza viruses, and other pathogens known to cause acute respiratory disease. CONCLUSION The high sensitivity, rapidity, reproducibility, and specificity of this zoonotic influenza viruses rRT-PCR array has been verified as being sufficient to detect the presence of multiple zoonotic influenza viruses in a single assay.

DESIGN: Qualitative in-depth key informant interviews were administered using semistructured interviews administered in both English and Filipino. Thematic analysis of the findings was done after transcribing all audio recordings. SETTING: The study was done in the National Capital Region (NCR), Philippines using online video conferencing platforms due to mobility restrictions and lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: All study participants were either MSM or TGW, 18C49 years old and residing/working in NCR. Exclusion criteria include biologically born female and/or currently on pre-exposure prophylaxis, antiretroviral therapy medications or an HIV-positive diagnosis. RESULTS: Twenty informants were interviewed, of which 75% were MSM, and most of them preferred the use of HIVST. Facilitators and barriers to the use of HIVST were grouped into three main themes: Acceptability, distribution and monitoring and tracking. Convenience and confidentiality, overcoming fears and normalisation of HIV testing services (HTS) in the country were the participants perceived facilitators of HIVST. In contrast, lack of privacy and maintenance of confidentiality during kit delivery were perceived as barriers in HIVST implementation. Moreover, social media was recognised as a powerful tool in promoting HIVST. The use of a welcoming tone and positive language should be taken into consideration due to the prevalent HIV stigma. CONCLUSIONS: The identified facilitators and barriers from the study may be considered by the Philippine HTS programme implementers. The HIVST strategy may complement the current HTS.

Together, residents and staff constitute the single most vulnerable population in the pandemic. The health of these workers is completely entangled with the health of those they care for. Vaccination of SNF staff is key to increasing uptake of the vaccine, reducing health disparities, and reopening SNFs to visitors. Yet, as the vaccine rollout begins, some SNF staff are declining to be vaccinated. The purpose of this article is to describe reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy reported by staff of skilled nursing facilities and understand factors that could potentially reduce hesitancy. DESIGN: Five virtual focus groups were conducted with staff of SNFs as part of a larger project to improve vaccine uptake. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Focus groups with 58 staff members were conducted virtually using Zoom. MEASURES: Focus groups sought to elicit concerns, perspectives, and experiences related to COVID-19 testing and vaccination. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that some SNF staff are hesitant to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Reasons for this hesitancy include beliefs that the vaccine has been developed too fast and without sufficient testing; personal fears about pre-existing medical conditions, and more general distrust of the government. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: SNF staff indicate that seeing people like themselves receive the vaccination is more important than seeing public figures. We discuss the vaccination effort as a social enterprise and the need to develop long-term care provider-academic-community partnerships in response to COVID-19 and in expectation of future pandemics.","output":"\\"Somebody Like Me\\": Understanding COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Among Staff in Skilled Nursing Facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although Latin America countries are similar in many aspects, psychology has evolved in different ways, according to the characteristics related to politics, economics, and culture of each country.

Patients wanting to access medical cannabis must receive certification from physicians for a limited number of physical and psychological conditions. Despite increasing numbers of patients using cannabis in the United States, little is known about the patient experience during certification and entry into state-regulated cannabis programs and how and if they are guided by health care professionals and dispensary staff. Through focus group discussions, we sought to capture patient perspectives of certification, cannabis acquisition and cannabis use. METHODS Twenty-seven Pennsylvania participants took part in 7 virtual focus groups from June to July 2020. Participants were recruited statewide from the community, medical settings, and dispensaries. RESULTS Focus group results indicate that while the medical cannabis program is functional, policymakers and the medical community have failed to meaningfully integrate cannabis into the health care system. Participants expressed frustration around two central themes: there was no overarching education about medical use of cannabis and there was little consistency and availability for people once they found a suitable product, resulting in inadequate symptom relief and exorbitant out of pocket costs to pursue cannabis use as an adjuvant therapeutic. Participants noted a siloed experience between the certification process, accessing dispensaries, and receiving ongoing medical care. The lack of integrated care required high levels of self-reliance and experimentation with medical cannabis for participants. CONCLUSION We recommend that cannabis be better integrated into medical care for patients with qualifying conditions.","output":"A Failure to Guide: Patient Experiences within a State-Run Cannabis Program in Pennsylvania, United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are large uncertainties with regard to the outcome of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and mechanical ventilation (MV). High mortality (50-97%) was proposed by some groups, leading to considerable uncertainties with regard to outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to investigate the characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and MV. METHODS: A multicentre retrospective observational cohort study at 15 hospitals in Hamburg, Germany, was performed. Critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 who completed their ICU stay between February and June 2020 were included. Patient demographics, severity of illness, and ICU course were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 223 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were included. The majority, 73% (n = 163), were men; the median age was 69 (interquartile range = 58-77.5) years, with 68% (n = 151) patients having at least one chronic medical condition. Their Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was a median of 5 (3-9) points on admission. Overall, 167 (75%) patients needed MV. Noninvasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula were used in 31 (14%) and 26 (12%) patients, respectively. Subsequent MV, due to noninvasive ventilation/high-flow nasal cannula therapy failure, was necessary in 46 (81%) patients. Renal replacement therapy was initiated in 33% (n = 72) of patients, and owing to severe respiratory failure, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was necessary in 9% (n = 20) of patients. Experimental antiviral therapy was used in 9% (n = 21) of patients. Complications during the ICU stay were as follows: septic shock (40%, n = 90), heart failure (8%, n = 17), and pulmonary embolism (6%, n = 14). The length of ICU stay was a median of 13 days (5-24), and the duration of MV was 15 days (8-25). The ICU mortality was 35% (n = 78) and 44% (n = 74) among mechanically ventilated patients. CONCLUSION: In this multicentre observational study of 223 critically ill patients with COVID-19, the survival to ICU discharge was 65%, and it was 56% among patients requiring MV. Patients showed high rate of septic complications during their ICU stay.","output":"Mechanical ventilation and mortality among 223 critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019: A multicentric study in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"n/a.","output":"Safety and BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite utilizing the same chymotrypsin fold to host the catalytic machinery, coronavirus 3C-like proteases (3CLpro) noticeably differ from picornavirus 3C proteases in acquiring an extra helical domain in evolution. Previously, the extra domain was demonstrated to regulate the catalysis of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro by controlling its dimerization. Here, we studied N214A, another mutant with only a doubled dissociation constant but significantly abolished activity. Unexpectedly, N214A still adopts the dimeric structure almost identical to that of the wild-type (WT) enzyme. Thus, we conducted 30-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for N214A, WT, and R298A which we previously characterized to be a monomer with the collapsed catalytic machinery. Remarkably, three proteases display distinctive dynamical behaviors. While in WT, the catalytic machinery stably retains in the activated state; in R298A it remains largely collapsed in the inactivated state, thus implying that two states are not only structurally very distinguishable but also dynamically well separated. Surprisingly, in N214A the catalytic dyad becomes dynamically unstable and many residues constituting the catalytic machinery jump to sample the conformations highly resembling those of R298A. Therefore, the N214A mutation appears to trigger the dramatic change of the enzyme dynamics in the context of the dimeric form which ultimately inactivates the catalytic machinery. The present MD simulations represent the longest reported so far for the SARS-CoV 3CLpro, unveiling that its catalysis is critically dependent on the dynamics, which can be amazingly modulated by the extra domain. Consequently, mediating the dynamics may offer a potential avenue to inhibit the SARS-CoV 3CLpro.","output":"Dynamically-Driven Inactivation of the Catalytic Machinery of the SARS 3C-Like Protease by the N214A Mutation on the Extra Domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy for bronchiolitis has become increasingly popular,however early initiation did not impact patient outcomes in the two randomized trials and is reported to be15x more costly than standard low flow nasal cannula (LFNC) We hypothesized that lack of initiation criteriafor use of HFNC was resulting in overutilization Objective: We sought to increase trials of LFNC in acute viralbronchiolitis in order to decrease the use of HFNC Our primary aim is to increase the percent of LFNCutilization prior to HFNC initiation by 50% by April 2020 Design/Methods: We undertook a multidisciplinaryquality improvement project involving Hospital Medicine, Emergency Medicine and Critical Care physicians,along with respiratory therapy and nursing We revised our existing bronchiolitis protocol to include LFNCfailure defined as no improvement in oxygen saturation, heart rate or respiratory rate within 30-60 minutes ofinitiation and protocolized LFNC treatment failure to precede HFNC initiation Our pathway change took effectDecember 1st, 2019 Inclusion criteria were: &lt; 2 years admitted to PHM with a primary diagnosis of any ICD-10 code for bronchiolitis PICU transfer rates serve as the balancing measure and statistical process controlgrouping data in two-week increments is the primary method of analysis Results: Baseline data for the seasonpreceding our intervention (2018-2019) revealed HFNC usage in floor patients with bronchiolitis to be 62%(61/98), with 39% (24/61) undergoing a trial of LFNC prior to initiation of HFNC Post-intervention datademonstrate an increase in LFNC trials to 73% (29/40) and a concomitant decrease in HFNC utilization to 48%(40/84) (Figure 1 a/b) Rules for special cause were satisfied for the LFNC measure (2 out 3 consecutivemeasures above 2 sigma) but not for the HFNC measure when the project had to be stopped due to the SARS-CoV2 epidemic which was an external pressure against the use of HFNC (an aerosolizing procedure) Ourbalancing measure appears stable with a pre-intervention PICU transfer rate of 6 1% (n=98) and a post-intervention rate of 2 9% (n=68) Conclusion: Preliminary data suggests a simple intervention consisting ofestablishing LFNC treatment failure criteria in patients with moderate bronchiolitis may reduce HFNC usewithout adverse effects","output":"Impact of low flow nasal cannula failure criteria on high flownasal cannula utilization: A quality improvement project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since its emergence in 2013, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) spread rapidly throughout the country due, in part, to contaminated livestock trailers. The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of an accelerated hydrogen peroxide (AHP) disinfectant for inactivating PEDV in swine feces on metal surfaces under freezing conditions. One 15.24 X 15.24 X 2.54 cm aluminum coupon, contaminated with swine feces, and randomly matched to one pig was the experimental unit. Eight treatment groups representing two AHP concentrations (1:16 and 1:32) in a 10% propylene glycol solution, two contact times in a -10 C freezer (40 min and 60 min), and two levels of fecal contamination (5 mL and 10 mL) in addition to negative and positive control groups were evaluated. Forty 3-week-old pigs, intragastrically inoculated with the contents of the coupons after treatment, were used as a bioassay to determine the infectivity of PEDV after treatment. Infectivity was determined by detection of virus with a nucleocapsid (N) gene-based quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) on rectal swabs collected from the inoculated pigs on days three and seven post-inoculation. RESULTS: All post-treatment swabs from the negative control coupons were negative for PEDV via RT-qPCR. All post-treatment swabs collected from coupons in the AHP disinfectant treatment groups and the positive control group were positive for PEDV via RT-qPCR. For the bioassay, no rectal swabs from pigs in the negative control (0 of 4) or the AHP disinfectant treatment groups (0 of 32) were positive for PEDV. Rectal swabs from all pigs within the positive control group (4 of 4) were positive for PEDV by RT-qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, 1:16 and 1:32 dilutions of the AHP disinfectant successfully inactivated PEDV in swine feces on metal surfaces when applied at -10 C with 40 or 60 min of contact time. This study also suggests that a positive RT-qPCR result for PEDV on an environmental sample should be expected when the AHP disinfectant is applied under freezing conditions, but does not necessarily indicate that an infectious dose of PEDV remains after disinfection.

METHOD A prospective cohort study was performed in all patients who underwent surgery for elective skin cancer service management, during the UK COVID-19 pandemic peak (April-May 2020). 'Real-time' 30-day hospital database deceased data were collected. Random selection was undertaken for patients who either underwent operative (surgery group) management or remained on the waiting list (control group); these groups were also prospectively followed-up within a controlled cohort study design and telephoned at the end of June 2020 for the control group or 30 days post-operatively. RESULTS Of the 767 patients who had operations, there were no COVID-19 related deaths. Both the surgery (n = 384) and control (n = 100) groups were matched for age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, presence of comorbidities, smoking and positive COVID-19 contact. There were no differences in post-operative versus any symptom development (1.3%, 5/384 vs. 4%, 4/100, p = 0.093), or proportion of positive tests (8.6%, 33/384 vs. 8%, 8/100; p = 0.849), between the surgery and control groups.

CASE DESCRIPTION A 40-year-old man presented with a past medical history of SLE in which he developed AVN of the tarsal navicular and medial cuneiform. This occurred first on the subject's right foot and then while recovering from surgical intervention, on his left foot. Talonaviculocuneiform arthrodesis was performed with the use of distal tibial autograft on both extremities. The subject's American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society midfoot score improved from 34 to 80 at 21 months on the right and 37 to 90 at 15 months to the left. DISCUSSION Patients with SLE carry a significant risk of developing AVN. Comorbidities such as vasculitis, corticosteroid use, cytotoxic medication, and peripheral neuropathy are known risk factors in the development of AVN. Unusual features such as multifocal AVN and unusual anatomic locations can occur with SLE. AVN of the foot is generally treated with surgical intervention. Treatments such as core decompression, open reduction and internal fixation, and arthrodesis have been recommended based on the symptoms and presentation.

Patient pathway analysis identifies mismatches between TB patient care-seeking patterns and service coverage, but to date, studies have only employed cross-sectional aggregate data. METHODS: We developed an algorithmic approach to analyse and interpret patient-level routine data on healthcare use and to construct patients pathways from initial care-seeking to treatment outcome. We applied this to patients with TB in a simple random sample of one million patients records in the Taiwan National Health Insurance database. We analysed heterogeneity in pathway patterns, delays, service coverage and patient flows between different health system levels. RESULTS: We constructed 7255 pathways for 6258 patients. Patients most commonly initially sought care at the primary clinic level, where the capacity for diagnosing TB patients was 12%, before eventually initiating treatment at higher levels. Patient pathways are extremely heterogeneous prior to diagnosis, with the 10% most complex pathways accounting for 48% of all clinical encounters, and 55% of those pathways yet to initiate treatment after a year. Extended consideration of alternative diagnoses was more common for patients aged 65 years or older and for patients with chronic lung disease. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that longitudinal analysis of routine individual-level healthcare data can be used to generate a detailed picture of TB care-seeking pathways. This allows an understanding of several temporal aspects of care pathways, including lead times to care and the variability in patient pathways.","output":"Patient pathways of tuberculosis care-seeking and treatment: an individual-level analysis of National Health Insurance data in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection fundamentally affects the lung field, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Machine learning techniques using clinical data such as chest X-rays have been used to predict which patients are most at risk of deterioration. We consider the task of predicting two types of patient deterioration based on chest X-rays: adverse event deterioration (i.e., transfer to the intensive care unit, intubation, or mortality) and increased oxygen requirements beyond 6 L per day. Due to the relative scarcity of COVID-19 patient data, existing solutions leverage supervised pretraining on related non-COVID images, but this is limited by the differences between the pretraining data and the target COVID-19 patient data. In this paper, we use self-supervised learning based on the momentum contrast (MoCo) method in the pretraining phase to learn more general image representations to use for downstream tasks. We present three results. The first is deterioration prediction from a single image, where our model achieves an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.742 for predicting an adverse event within 96 hours (compared to 0.703 with supervised pretraining) and an AUC of 0.765 for predicting oxygen requirements greater than 6 L a day at 24 hours (compared to 0.749 with supervised pretraining). We then propose a new transformer-based architecture that can process sequences of multiple images for prediction and show that this model can achieve an improved AUC of 0.786 for predicting an adverse event at 96 hours and an AUC of 0.848 for predicting mortalities at 96 hours.

Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is a common cause of chronic wet cough in preschool children with no symptoms or signs of other specific causes, and resolution usually follows a 2-week course of an appropriate oral antibiotic. The diagnosis is mainly clinical; generally, no instrumental examinations are necessary. The most common bacteria found in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of subjects with PBB include Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Nowadays, there is no certain evidence of the role of viruses in PBB pathogenesis even though different types of viruses have been detected in BAL from children with PBB. Airway malacia is commonly found in children with PBB; conversely, there is no correlation with any type of immunodeficiency. Amoxicillin-clavulanate acid is the most commonly used antibiotic, as first-line, prolonged therapy (longer than 2 weeks) is sometimes required to cough resolution. When the wet cough does not improve despite prolonged antibiotic treatment, an underlying disease should be considered. Moreover, there are several hypotheses of a link between PBB and bronchiectasis, as recent evidences show that recurrent PBB (>3 episodes/years) and the presence of H. influenzae infection in the lower airways seem to be significant risk factors to develop bronchiectasis. This underlines the importance of a close follow-up among children with PBB and the need to consider chest computerized tomography (CT) in patients with risk factors for bronchiectasis. In this brief review, we summarize the main clinical and pathogenetic findings of PBB, a disease that may be related to a relevant morbidity and decreased quality of life during the pediatric age.","output":"When the Cough Does Not Improve: A Review on Protracted Bacterial Bronchitis in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Residency is expected to be a long and difficult road.

We propose a clinical trial where the primary aims are: 1. To assess whether an algorithm with LUS and procalcitonin (PCT) may be useful for diagnosing bacterial pneumonia; 2. To analyse the sensitivity and specificity of LUS vs chest X-ray (CXR). METHODS/DESIGN: A 3-year clinical trial. Inclusion criteria: children younger than 18 years old with suspected pneumonia in a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. Patients will be randomised into two groups: Experimental Group: LUS will be performed as first lung image. Control Group: CXR will be performed as first pulmonary image. Patients will be classified according to the image and the PCT: a) PCT < 1 ng/mL and LUS/CXR are not suggestive of bacterial pneumonia (BN), no antibiotic will be prescribed; b) LUS/CXR are suggestive of BN, regardless of the PCT, antibiotic therapy is recommended; c) LUS/CXR is not suggestive of BN and PCT > 1 ng/mL, antibiotic therapy is recommended. CONCLUSION: This algorithm will help us to diagnose bacterial pneumonia and to prescribe the correct antibiotic treatment. A reduction of antibiotics per patient, of the treatment length, and of the exposure to ionizing radiation and in costs is expected.

CoVs are known to generate negative subgenomes (subgenomic RNAs [sgRNAs]) through transcription-regulating sequence (TRS)-dependent template switching, but the global dynamic landscapes of coronaviral subgenomes and regulatory rules remain unclear. Here, using next-generation sequencing (NGS) short-read and Nanopore long-read poly(A) RNA sequencing in two cell types at multiple time points after infection with SARS-CoV-2, we identified hundreds of template switches and constructed the dynamic landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomes. Interestingly, template switching could occur in a bidirectional manner, with diverse SARS-CoV-2 subgenomes generated from successive template-switching events. The majority of template switches result from RNA-RNA interactions, including seed and compensatory modes, with terminal pairing status as a key determinant. Two TRS-independent template switch modes are also responsible for subgenome biogenesis. Our findings reveal the subgenome landscape of SARS-CoV-2 and its regulatory features, providing a molecular basis for understanding subgenome biogenesis and developing novel anti-viral strategies.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 subgenome landscape and its novel regulatory features"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced many mental health professionals to therapy via videoconferencing.

METHODS This pilot study offered group cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis via videoconferencing to 14 individuals with early psychosis either living in remote areas or confined during the pandemic. RESULTS The rate of consenting to the study (79%) and actual participation rates were acceptable (18.5 sessions out of 24). Although some technological obstacles were encountered, solutions offered allowed the videoconferencing group to be considered feasible for most participants and therapists. Prepost results on symptoms and self-esteem were comparable to those of other studies using the same group treatment but in-person. Alliance scores seemed similar as well.

IGD is an area of concern in the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which can be objectively assessed by dysfunctional behaviour and the increasing time of being online, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Electroencephalography (EEG) identifies amplitude changes in the evoked response potential (ERP) among IGDs, correlated with underlying comorbidities. MATERIALS AND METHODS A scoping review was performed to elaborate on the research regarding resting-state EEG and task-based EEG, particularly for Go/No-go paradigms pertaining to subjects with IAD or specifically IGD. The role of EEG was identified in its diagnostic capability to identify the salient changes that occurred in the response to reward network and the executive control network, using restingstate and task-based EEG. The implication of using EEG in monitoring the therapy for IAD and IGD was also reviewed. RESULTS EEG generally revealed reduced beta waves and increased theta waves in addicts. IGD with depression demonstrated increased theta and decreased alpha waves. Whereas increased P300, a late cognitive ERP component, was frequently associated with impaired excessive allocation of attentional resources of the IAD towards addiction-specific cues. IGD had increased whole brain delta waves at baseline, which showed significant reduction post therapy.

BACKGROUND: Growing number of confirmed and deaths cases from the coronavirus worldwide, particularly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, has resulted concerns about the future of these countries and their deterioration. Also the European region is likely to face more casualties due to the delay in the virus reaching most of its regions and, of course, as the trend continues. METHODS: We conducted a simulation in both current and ideal situation for the next month to predict the death rate and examine the reason for the difference in Italy, Iran and South Korea individually. If we assume the cultural and political factors and age pyramids distribution are similar across regions, the differences are mainly due either to the heavier health-care burden owing to the larger population or to the medical facilities diversities. RESULTS: Our results for Italy showed higher death number, but the rate would be more for Iran. South Korea is also expected to have a smaller increase in the number of confirmed cases and deaths compared to Iran and Italy by the next month.

This paper examines the introduction, transmission, and incidence of COVID-19 into Pacific SIDS. METHODS: Calculate the rate of transmission (the average number of new cases per day between the first recorded case and the most recent day) and connectivity (daily direct flights to the leading airport in each selected island group) using flight history and COVID-19 transmission data. RESULTS: Correlational analyses show that connectivity is positively related with (a) first-case dates and (b) spread rate in Pacific SIDS. CONCLUSION: Connectivity plays a central role in the spread of COVID-19 in Pacific SIDS. The continued entry of people was a significant factor for spread within countries. Efforts to prevent transmission by closing borders reduced transmission but also created significant economic hardship because many Pacific SIDS rely heavily on tourism and international exchange. The findings highlight the importance of exploring the possibility that the COVID-19 spread rate may be higher than official figures indicate, and present pathways to mitigate socio-economic impacts.

Social mediaCbased methods represent a means to elicit and prioritize the research interests of such individuals, but there remains sparse methodological guidance on how best to conduct these social media efforts and assess their effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to identify social media strategies that enhance participation in priority-setting research, collate metrics assessing the effectiveness of social media campaigns, and summarize the benefits and limitations of social mediaCbased research approaches, as well as recommendations for prospective campaigns. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science from database inception until September 2021. Two reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts, as well as full texts for studies that implemented and evaluated social media strategies aimed at engaging knowledge users in research priority setting. We subsequently conducted a thematic analysis to aggregate study data by related codes and themes. RESULTS: A total of 23 papers reporting on 22 unique studies were included. These studies used Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, websites, video-calling platforms, emails, blogs, e-newsletters, and web-based forums to engage with health research stakeholders. Priority-setting engagement strategies included paid platformCbased advertisements, email-embedded survey links, and question-and-answer forums. Dissemination techniques for priority-setting surveys included snowball sampling and the circulation of participation opportunities via internal members and external organizations social media platforms. Social media campaign effectiveness was directly assessed as number of clicks and impressions on posts, frequency of viewed posts, volume of comments and replies, number of times individuals searched for a campaign page, and number of times a hashtag was used. Campaign effectiveness was indirectly assessed as numbers of priority-setting survey responses and visits to external survey administration sites. Recommendations to enhance engagement included the use of social media group moderators, opportunities for peer-to-peer interaction, and the establishment of a consistent tone and brand. CONCLUSIONS: Social media may increase the speed and reach of priority-setting participation opportunities leading to the development of research agendas informed by patients, family caregivers, clinicians, and researchers. Perceived limitations of the approach include underrepresentation of certain demographic groups and addressing such limitations will enhance the inclusion of diverse research priority opinions in future research agendas.","output":"Using Social Media to Engage Knowledge Users in Health Research Priority Setting: Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We discuss and extend a powerful, geometric framework to represent the set of portfolios, which identifies the space of asset allocations with the points lying in a convex polytope. Based on this viewpoint, we survey certain state-of-the-art tools from geometric and statistical computing to handle important and difficult problems in digital finance. Although our tools are quite general, in this paper, we focus on two specific questions. The first concerns crisis detection, which is of prime interest for the public in general and for policy makers in particular because of the significant impact that crises have on the economy. Certain features in stock markets lead to this type of anomaly detection: Given the assets returns, we describe the relationship between portfolios return and volatility by means of a copula, without making any assumption on investors strategies. We examine a recent method relying on copulae to construct an appropriate indicator that allows us to automate crisis detection. On real data the indicator detects all past crashes in the cryptocurrency market and from the DJ600-Europe index, from 1990 to 2008, the indicator identifies correctly 4 crises and issues one false positive for which we offer an explanation. Our second contribution is to introduce an original computational framework to model asset allocation strategies, which is of independent interest for digital finance and its applications. Our approach addresses the crucial question of evaluating portfolio management, and is relevant the individual managers as well as financial institutions. To evaluate portfolio performance, we provide a new portfolio score, based on the aforementioned framework and concepts.

Therefore, to find out what kind of employees have cooperated with the company's measures in the current corona (COVID-19) crisis, and what effect the cooperation has had to these employees/companies to get hints for preparing for the next crisis, the pass analysis was carried out using awareness data obtained from a questionnaire survey conducted on 2,973 employees of Japanese companies in China. The results showed that employees with higher social capital and resilience were more supportive of the company's measures against corona and that employees who were more supportive of corona measures were less likely to leave their jobs. However, regarding fatigue and anxiety about the corona felt by employees, it was shown that it not only works to support cooperation in corona countermeasures but also enhances the turnover intention. This means that just by raising the anxiety of employees, even if a company achieves the short-term goal of having them cooperate with the company's countermeasures against corona, it may not reach the longer-term goal by making them increase their intention to leave. It is important for employees to be aware of the crisis and to fear it properly.

The historical context that promoted this pernicious threat is understudied, and such studies lay the critical foundation for designing societal-level campaigns to combat it. We analyzed the trend and content of aging narratives over 210 years across multiple genresnewspaper, magazines, fiction, non-fiction books; and modelled the predictors of the observed trend. METHODS: A 600-million-word-dataset was created from the Corpus-of-Historical-American-English and the Corpus-of-Contemporary-American-English to form the largest structured historical corpus with over 150,000 texts from multiple genres. Computational linguistics and statistical techniques were applied to study the trend, content, and predictors of aging narratives. RESULTS: Aging narratives have become more negative, in a linear fashion (p=.003), over 210 years. There are distinct shifts: From uplifting narratives of heroism and kinship in the 1800s to darker tones of illness, death, and burden in the 1900s across newspapers, magazines, and non-fiction books. Fiction defied this trend by portraying older adults positively through romantic courtship and war heroism. Significant predictors of ageism over 210 years are the medicalization of aging, loss of status, warmth, competence, and social ostracism. DISCUSSION: Though it is unrealistic to reverse the course of ageism, its declining trajectory can be ameliorated. Our unprecedented study lay the groundwork for a societal level campaign to tackle ageism.

METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in August 2020 using MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, Health Technology Assessment databases and grey literature. Studies comparing the use of WMS against standard care for deterioration detection and related clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients were included. Deterioration related outcomes (primary) included unplanned intensive care admissions, rapid response team or cardiac arrest activation, total and major complications rate. Other clinical outcomes (secondary) included in-hospital mortality and hospital length of stay. Exploratory outcomes included alerting system parameters and clinical trial registry information.

The meta-analysis indicated that the WMS, when compared with standard care, was not associated with significant reductions in intensive care transfers (risk ratio, RR 0.87; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.66-1.15), rapid response or cardiac arrest team activation (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.69-1.01), total (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.44-1.32) and major (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.24-1.30) complications prevalence. There was also no statistically significant association with reduced mortality (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.18-1.29) and hospital length of stay (mean difference, MD - 0.09; 95% CI - 0.43 to 0.44). CONCLUSION: This systematic review indicates that there is no current evidence that implementation of WMS impacts early deterioration detection and associated clinical outcomes, as differing design/quality of available studies and diversity of outcome measures make it difficult to reach a definite conclusion. Our narrative findings suggested that alarms should be adjusted to minimise false alarms and promote rapid clinical action in response to deterioration.

Nowadays, these dairy products are also important for people with an allergy to cow milk, and these products are an essential part of the local daily diet in regions of the world that are not suitable for cows and goats. Consumption of raw milk and raw milk products has a zoonotic risk, and with regard to sheep, the main pathogens associated with such dairy products are: Brucella melitensis, Campylobacter spp., Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, tick borne encephalitis virus, and Toxoplasma gondii. Especially, young children, elderly people, pregnant women and immunocompromised (YOPI) persons, and those suffering from disease should be aware of the risk of consuming raw milk and raw milk products. This latter risk can be reduced by proper flock health management, prevention of contamination during milking, adequate milk processing, transport, and refrigerated storage. Only processes equaling pasteurization sufficiently reduce zoonotic risks from milk and milk products, but proper cooling is essential and recontamination must be prevented. Therefore, strict hygiene practices throughout the production process and supply chain especially for raw milk and raw dairy products, should be applied. Small scale production systems pose a greater risk compared to industrialized production systems because of a less protocolized and controlled production process. This manuscript describes zoonotic risks of pathogens from sheep and their milk borne transmission. Additionally, routes of contamination, possibilities for multiplication, and prevention measures thereof are described. We summarize some major human outbreaks caused by consumption of sheep milk and products made thereof, and finally discuss their implications.","output":"Zoonotic risks of pathogens from sheep and their milk borne transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) is expressed in epithelial cells of many tissues including the kidney, and has been identified to interact with human pathogenic coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

Interestingly, studies in rats have demonstrated that high dietary sodium intake results in down-regulation of the ACE2 expression in kidney tissue. We hypothesize that low sodium status makes kidney involvement during the course of COVID-19 infection more likely due to upregulation of membrane bound ACE2 in the kidneys. We propose that sodium intake and status should be monitored carefully during severe COVID-19 infections, and that low sodium intake be corrected early in its course, despite a potential conflict regarding common dietary recommendations to restrict dietary sodium intake in patients with hypertension, diabetes, and kidney disease.","output":"Sodium status and kidney involvement during COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food insecurity is a critical global problem with social and public health consequences.

SARS-CoV-2 is mainly airborne, transmitted by the salivary droplets produced when infected people cough or sneeze. In addition, diarrhea symptoms and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in feces suggest a fecalCoral route of contagion. Currently, the high demand for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis has surpassed the availability of PCR and immunodetection probes and has prompted the development of other diagnostic alternatives. In this context, mass spectrometry (MS) represents a mature, robust alternative platform for detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other human viruses. This possibility has raised great interest worldwide. Therefore, it is time for the global application of MS as a feasible option for detecting SARS-CoV-2, not only in human fluids, but also in other matrices such as foods and wastewater. This review covers the most relevant established methods for MS-based SARS-CoV-2 detection and discusses the future application of these tools in different matrices. Significance: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the pros and cons of currently available PCR and immunodetection tools. The great concern over the infective potential of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles that can persist for several hours on different surfaces under various conditions further evidenced the need for reliable alternatives and high-throughput methods to meet the needs for mass detection of SARS-CoV-2. In this context, MS-based proteomics emerging from fundamental studies in life science can offer a robust option for SARS-CoV-2 detection in human fluids and other matrices. In addition, the substantial efforts towards detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinal samples, position MS to support the detection of this virus in different matrices such as the surfaces of the packing food process, frozen foods, and wastewaters. Proteomics and mass spectrometry are, therefore, well positioned to play a role in the epidemiological control of COVID-19 and other future diseases. We are currently witnessing the opportunity to generate technologies to overcome prolonged pandemics for the first time in human history.","output":"Mass Spectrometry Approaches for SARS-CoV-2 Detection: Harnessing for Application in Food and Environmental Samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated mitigation strategies have significant psychosocial, behavioral, socioeconomic, and health impacts, particularly in vulnerable US populations. Different factors have been identified as influencers of the transmission rate; however, the effects of area deprivation index (as a measure of social determinants of health, SDoH) as a factor on COVID-19 disease early dynamics have not been established. We determined the effects of area deprivation index (ADI) and demographic factors on COVID-19 outcomes in Washington, D.C. This retrospective study used publicly available data on COVID-19 cases and mortality of Washington, D.C., during March 31stCJuly 4th, 2020. The main predictors included area deprivation index (ADI), age, and race/ethnicity. The ADI of each census block groups in D.C. (n=433) were obtained from Neighborhood Atlas map. Using a machine learning-based algorithm, the outcome variables were partitioned into time intervals: time duration (P(i), days), rate of change coefficient (E(i)), and time segment load (P(i)E(i)) for transmission rate and mortality. Correlation analysis and multiple linear regression models were used to determine associations between predictors and outcome variables. COVID-19 early transmission rate (E(1)) was highly correlated with ADI (SDoH; r= 0.88, p=0.0044) of the Washington, D.C. community. We also found positive association between ADI, age (0C17 years, r=0.91, p=0.0019), and race (African American/Black, r=0.86; p=0.0068) and COVID-19 outcomes. There was high variability in early transmission across the geographic regions (i.e., wards) of Washington, D.C., and this variability was driven by race/ethnic composition and ADI.

METHODOLOGY: A systematic review was carried out between December 2020 and April 2021 in the Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed databases, selecting the clinical trials that used acupuncture, electroacupuncture or dry needling as a treatment for spasticity. Sixteen clinical trials were included, summarizing all the study characteristics and the outcome measures, at last the evidence was described for their results. RESULTS: Most of the studies find a difference of significant decrease in spasticity between the subjects of the experimental groups. Only four studies found no significant changes in spasticity.

Evidence prior to the COVID-19 pandemic suggested that, compared with conventional ventilation strategies, airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) can improve oxygenation and reduce mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We aimed to assess the association between APRV use and clinical outcomes among adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 and hypothesized that APRV use would be associated with improved survival compared with conventional ventilation. Methods: A total of 25 patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis was admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) for invasive ventilation in Perth, Western Australia, between February and May 2020. Eleven of these patients received APRV. The primary outcome was survival to day 90. Secondary outcomes were ventilation-free survival days to day 90, mechanical complications from ventilation, and number of days ventilated. Results: Patients who received APRV had a lower probability of survival than did those on other forms of ventilation (hazard ratio, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.89; P=0.036). This finding was independent of indices of severity of illness to predict the use of APRV. Patients who received APRV also had fewer ventilator-free survival days up to 90 days after initiation of ventilation compared to patients who did not receive APRV, and survivors who received APRV had fewer ventilator-free days than survivors who received other forms of ventilation. There were no differences in mechanical complications according to mode of ventilation.

Meanwhile, the pandemic is reaching swiftly and silently, to low-income countries where international medias cover less. How likely health outcomes among the countries with different economies may differ during the pandemic has not been reported yet. Method: We conducted analysis of COVID-19 deaths comparing case fatality rate (CRF) among countries with different income categories, applying COVID-19 global data from European Centre for Disease Control including 199 countries data as of 31 March 2020, in the early phase of pandemic. We categorized countries into high income countries (HIC), upper-middle income countries (UMIC), lower middle-income countries (LMIC) and low-income countries (LIC) according to World Bank classification by income as of 2020. Result: Statistically, countries in different income groups are significantly different in term of new cases identified in last two weeks and case-fatality rate. (Manova P value <0.001). New tests and detected case numbers shot up in HICs where CFR shot up in LMICs and LICs. The results of this analysis pointed out an important gap among countries with different economic status during ongoing pandemic. Discussion: In the HIC, contact tracing, testing capacity and outbreak response as well as clinical services are strong. In the LICs, there is low capacity of outbreak response which is reflected by the significantly lower number of diagnosis tests. Consequently, reported number of COVID-19 cases in LICs may not reflect the actual burden of the pandemic. Without effective prevention, the pandemic can readily break into the weak health system, and over-burden the hospitals, and clinical services in poor countries.

Antiviral and immunomodulatory agents have been proposed as potential treatments. Azithromycin exhibits both properties and therefore may play a role. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety of azithromycin in viral infections, with emphasis on COVID-19. A literature search of PUBMED was conducted on May 30th and updated on July 28th. EXPERT OPINION: Azithromycin presents in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and could act in different points of the viral cycle. Its immunomodulatory properties include the ability to downregulate cytokine production, maintain epithelial cell integrity or prevent lung fibrosis. Azithromycin use was associated with a reduction in mortality and ventilation days in other viral infections. These properties could be beneficial throughout the COVID-19. However, the evidence of its use is scarce and of low quality. Azithromycin has been assessed in retrospective observational studies mainly in combination with hydroxychloroquine, which has shown to provide no benefit. This macrolide presents a well-known safety profile.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study took place in 14 German cities in the context of a humanitarian admission program that resettled 1000 especially vulnerable women and children from northern Iraq to Germany. Approximately 400 adult beneficiaries of the humanitarian admission program were eligible for the study. At baseline, a total of 116 of the 400 beneficiaries (29.0%) participated, with 96 (82.8%) of these women participating in the follow-up assessment. The study included a baseline assessment conducted 2 years after resettlement (September 1, 2017, to January 12, 2018) and a 1-year follow-up (August 29, 2018, to January 15, 2019). EXPOSURES: Violence and/or captivity during the 2014 genocide in northern Iraq by the so-called Islamic State. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Posttraumatic stress disorder severity and coping strategies were assessed in interpreter-aided interviews using the Impact of Event ScaleCRevised. RESULTS: A total of 116 women (mean [SD] age, 32.2 [8.2] years; 115 [99.1%] Yazidi; 1 [0.9%] Christian) participated at baseline. According to the Impact of Event ScaleCRevised, a high PTSD severity was found (mean [SD] raw sum score, 60.88 [15.75] of 88, with higher scores indicating greater distress), with no significant change over time. Helpful coping strategies included prayer, belief in collective strength, and belief in personal strength. Earlier symptoms of intrusions ( = 0.389, P = .007) and longer captivity ( = 0.218, P = .02) were identified as being associated with PTSD severity 1 year later.

In recent years, non-pharmacological approaches and specifically animal-assisted therapy have been shown to be beneficial for a variety of disorders such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and PTSD. However, little is mentioned in the literature about the reciprocal effects of the animalChuman interaction. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a one-year dog training programme on PTSD symptomatology in youngsters with PTSD and on dogs behaviour. METHODS: Fifty-three adolescents, previously exposed to interpersonal trauma, were clinically diagnosed with PTSD and assigned to a dog-training programme group (n = 30) and a control group (n = 23) that engaged in other training programmes (e.g. cooking, hairstyling, etc.). Both groups were evaluated at baseline and following 12-months by The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 in Children and Adolescents (CAPS-CA-5) and Beck-Depression Inventory (BDI). Additionally, we physiologically measured both emotional and attention dysregulation. RESULTS: Post-12-months training, a significant alleviation of PTSD symptomatology accompanied by lower depression severity was observed in the dog-training group, compared with a insignificant recovery in the control group. Furthermore, improved emotional and attentional regulation was observed in the dog-training group. Measuring the dogs behaviour revealed increased anxiety and decreased selective attention performance, which was inversely correlated with the beneficial effects observed in the dog-training programme group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasize the role of emotional and attentional regulations on the dogChandler interface, as evidence-based support for the beneficial effects of the dog-training programme, as either a non-pharmacological intervention or as complementary to anti-depressants treatment of PTSD. Though pharmacological treatments increase the patients well-being by treating certain PTSD symptoms, our suggested dog-training programme seems to influence the PTSD diagnostic status, thus may be implemented in civilians and veterans with PTSD.","output":"Dog training alleviates PTSD symptomatology by emotional and attentional regulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID\\\\19 convalescent plasma (CCP), from donors recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\\\\2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) infection, is one of the limited therapeutic options currently available for the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID\\\\19.

We evaluated the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card in a high-throughput, drive-through, free community testing site in Massachusetts (MA) using anterior nasal (AN) swab RT-PCR for clinical testing. Methods: Individuals presenting for molecular testing in two of seven lanes were offered the opportunity to also receive BinaxNOW testing. Dual AN swabs were collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic children ([]18 years) and adults. BinaxNOW testing was performed in a testing pod with temperature/humidity monitoring. One individual performed testing and official result reporting for each test, but most tests had a second independent reading to assess inter-operator agreement. Positive BinaxNOW results were scored as faint, medium, or strong. Positive BinaxNOW results were reported to patients by phone and they were instructed to isolate pending RT-PCR results. The paired RT-PCR result was the reference for sensitivity and specificity calculations. Results: Of 2482 participants, 1380 adults and 928 children had paired RT-PCR/BinaxNOW results and complete symptom data. 974/1380 (71%) adults and 829/928 (89%) children were asymptomatic. BinaxNOW had 96.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 90.0- 99.3) sensitivity and 100% (98.6-100.0) specificity in adults within 7 days of symptoms, and 84.6% (65.1-95.6) sensitivity and 100% (94.5-100.0) specificity in children within 7 days of symptoms. Sensitivity and specificity in asymptomatic adults were 70.2% (56.6-81.6) and 99.6% (98.9-99.9), respectively, and in asymptomatic children were 65.4% (55.6-74.4) and 99.0% (98.0-99.6), respectively. By cycle threshold (Ct) value cutoff, sensitivity in all subgroups combined (n=292 RT-PCR-positive individuals) was 99.3% with Ct []25, 95.8% with []30, and 81.2% with []35. Twelve false positive BinaxNOW results (out of 2308 tests) were observed; in all twelve, the test bands were faint but otherwise normal, and were noted by both readers. One invalid BinaxNOW result was identified. Inter-operator agreement (positive versus negative BinaxNOW result) was 100% (n = 2230/2230 double reads). Each operator was able to process 20 RDTs per hour. In a separate set of 30 specimens (from individuals with symptoms []7 days) run at temperatures below the manufacturer-recommended range (46-58.5F), sensitivity was 66.7% and specificity 95.2%. Conclusions: BinaxNOW had very high specificity in both adults and children and very high sensitivity in newly symptomatic adults. Overall, 95.8% sensitivity was observed with Ct []30. These data support public health recommendations for use of the BinaxNOW test in adults with symptoms for []7 days without RT-PCR confirmation. Excellent inter-operator agreement indicates that an individual can perform and read the BinaxNOW test alone. A skilled laboratorian can perform and read 20 tests per hour. Careful attention to temperature is critical.","output":"Performance and Implementation Evaluation of the Abbott BinaxNOW Rapid Antigen Test in a High-throughput Drive-through Community Testing Site in Massachusetts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although numerous studies have been published on the predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, some possible predictors remain underexplored. In this study, we explored the associations of unwillingness and indecisiveness regarding COVID-19 vaccination with generalized trust, mental health conditions such as depression and generalized anxiety, and fear of COVID-19. METHODS: Data of wave 1 (from October 27 till November 6, 2020) and wave 3 (from April 23 till May 6, 2021) of a longitudinal online study conducted in Japan were used for the analyses. Unvaccinated participants were asked at wave 3 about their willingness to be vaccinated, with possible responses of willing, unwilling, or undecided. These three responses were used as the outcome variable, and multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted with willingness to be vaccinated as the reference group. Explanatory variables included generalized trust, depression, generalized anxiety, and fear of COVID-19 both at wave 1 and 3, and sociodemographic and health-related variables. RESULTS: Of the 11,846 valid respondents, 209 (1.8%) answered that they had already been vaccinated against COVID-19, 7089 (59.8%) responded that they were willing to be vaccinated, 3498 (29.5%) responded that they were undecided, and 1053 (8.9%) responded that they were unwilling to be vaccinated. After adjusting for covariates, we found that: (1) participants with lower levels of generalized trust at wave 1 and 3 were more likely to be undecided or unwilling at wave 3; (2) respondents with moderately severe or severe depression at wave 1 and 3 were more likely to be undecided at wave 3; (3) participants with moderate or severe levels of generalized anxiety at wave 3 but not at wave 1 were more likely to be unwilling at wave 3; and (4) respondents with high levels of fear of COVID-19 at wave 1 and 3 were less likely to be undecided and unwilling at wave 3. CONCLUSIONS: Generalized trust, mental health conditions such as depression and generalized anxiety, and low level of fear of COVID-19 are associated with unwillingness or indecision regarding being vaccinated against COVID-19.

Consequently, a state of emergency was declared, which included mandatory social isolation and quarantine. This action meant that people would transit only in emergency cases. In this context, this studys objective is to analyze the air quality changes in terms of the capital citys NO2 levels due to these government decisions using satellite imagery data obtained from the Sentinel-5P satellite. One critical problem is the lack of spatially distributed air quality data. The Peruvian Meteorological Service only monitors air quality in Lima, the capital city. In addition, the air quality ground stations are not always functioning. Thus, there is a need to find new reliable methods to complement the official data obtained. One method of doing so is the use of remote sensing products, although the accuracy and applicability are yet to be determined;therefore, this is the articles focus. A temporal and spatial analysis was developed quantitatively and qualitatively to measure the levels of NO2 in eighteen regions of Lima to contrast the quarantines effect on polluting gas emission levels. The measurements are also compared with the official Peruvian data from ground sensors using Pearson correlation coefficients, thus, showing that Sentinel-5P data can be used for changes in the mean daily concentration of NO2. We also developed the first version of an open platform that converts the satellite data into a friendly format for visualization. The results show NO2 ambient concentration reductions compared to 2019 of between 60% and 40% in the first two weeks and between 50% and 25% in the following two weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown.

The opportunity for earlier detection of HF is lost. In this work, we first explore each of the three HF categories, preserved EF, mild-reduced EF, and reduced EF, using various morphological and functional etiology-specific characteristics supported by a literature review and an extensive analysis of a large, dedicated database accumulated over 8 years. We then explore the typical signs and co-morbidities of HF using prevalence analysis to unravel the diagnostic makeup of each HF category as characteristically derived by ECG- and ECHO-findings. From this, we then conduct a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data to interpret patterns of comorbidities, showing groups of comorbidities frequently associated with each other. Lastly, we delve into the role of breakthrough methods for the analysis of bio-signals to replicate common ECHO-findings, as alternatives for detecting and diagnosing HF similarly to Echocardiography, thereby providing a simple device for the effective detection of HF for use in Primary Care.","output":"Unraveling diagnostic co-morbidity makeup of each HF category as characteristically derived by ECG- and ECHO-findings, a prevalence analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To inform prevention strategies, we assessed the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and settings in which transmission occurred in a Georgia public school district. METHODS: During December 1, 2020-January 22, 2021, SARS-CoV-2-infected index cases and their close contacts in schools were identified by school and public health officials. For in-school contacts, we assessed symptoms and offered SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing; performed epidemiologic investigations and whole-genome sequencing to identify in-school transmission; and calculated secondary attack rate (SAR) by school setting (e.g., sports, elementary school classroom), index case role (i.e., staff, student), and index case symptomatic status. RESULTS: We identified 86 index cases and 1,119 contacts, 688 (63.1%) of whom received testing. Fifty-nine (8.7%) of 679 contacts tested positive; 15 (17.4%) of 86 index cases resulted in &#8805;2 positive contacts. Among 55 persons testing positive with available symptom data, 31 (56.4%) were asymptomatic. Highest SAR were in indoor, high-contact sports settings (23.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.7, 33.3), staff meetings/lunches (18.2%, CI 4.5-31.8), and elementary school classrooms (9.5%, CI 6.5-12.5). SAR was higher for staff (13.1%, CI 9.0-17.2) versus student index cases (5.8%, CI 3.6-8.0) and for symptomatic (10.9%, CI 8.1-13.9) versus asymptomatic index cases (3.0%, CI 1.0-5.5). CONCLUSIONS: Indoor sports may pose a risk to the safe operation of in-person learning. Preventing infection in staff members, through measures that include COVID-19 vaccination, is critical to reducing in-school transmission.

PATIENTS: The first 44 coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients were compared with a historical control group of 39 consecutive acute respiratory distress syndrome patients admitted to the ICU just before the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Obesity was the most frequent comorbidity exhibited by coronavirus disease 2019 patients (n = 32, 73% vs n = 11, 28% in controls; p < 0.001). Despite the same severity of illness and level of hypoxemia at admission, coronavirus disease 2019 patients failed more high flow oxygen via nasal cannula challenges (n = 16, 100% vs n = 5, 45% in controls; p = 0.002), were more often intubated (n = 44, 100% vs n = 22, 56% in controls; p < 0.001) and paralyzed (n = 34, 77% vs n = 3, 14% in controls; p < 0.001), required higher level of positive end-expiratory pressure (15 vs 8 cm H2O in controls; p < 0.001), more prone positioning (n = 33, 75% vs n = 6, 27% in controls; p < 0.001), more dialysis (n = 16, 36% vs n = 3, 8% in controls; p = 0.003), more hemodynamic support by vasopressors (n = 36, 82% vs n = 22, 56% in controls; p = 0.001), and had more often a prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation (n = 28, 64% vs n = 10, 26% in controls; p < 0.01) resulting in a more frequent resort to tracheostomy (n = 18, 40.9% vs n = 2, 9% in controls; p = 0.01). However, an intensive management requiring more staff per patient for positioning coronavirus disease 2019 subjects (6 [5-7] vs 5 [4-5] in controls; p < 0.001) yielded the same ICU survival rate in the two groups (n = 34, 77% vs n = 29, 74% in controls; p = 0.23).

Methods: A qualitative study with a phenomenological approach was performed. Focus groups were conducted in El Valle parish of Azuay province of Cuenca Ecuador. Women natives of this rural area were included in this research. Results: A total of 45 women, have participated in 7 focus groups, all participants live in rural area. Pap smear technique is considered a painful, intrusive and embarrassing method, however participants believe that is more reliable, compared with self sampling methods, due a direct visualization of the cervix and because other problems could be detected during the examination. Advantages of self-sampling include that it is perceived as comfortable, less painful, participation rate, time-saving, because it can be done at home, and can be made widely available for example through pharmacies or with help of traditional healers . Barriers are related with doubts of the quality of the sample and lack of capability to perform it. Conclusions: This study shows that women consider self sampling methods as a possible solution to overcome barriers that could reduce the uptake of cervical cancer screening;privacy, comfortability and accessibility are major advantages of those methods. Self examination at home reduces waiting times in health centers, with high demand of attention or during Covid pandemic. Barriers are mainly related with doubts in the self proficiency to perform the test and the accuracy of the results.

Vaccine design traditionally relies on the viral surface glycoproteins. However, surface glycoproteins rarely elicit effective long-term immunity due to high variability. Therefore, an alternative approach is to include conserved structural proteins such as nucleoprotein (NP). NP is engaged in myriad processes in the viral life cycle: coating and protection of viral RNA, regulation of transcription/replication processes and induction of immunosuppression of the host. A broad heterosubtypic T-cellular protection was ascribed very early to this protein. In contrast, the understanding of the humoral immunity to NP is very limited in spite of the high titer of non-neutralizing NP-specific antibodies raised upon natural infection or immunization. In this review, the data with important implications for the understanding of the role of NP in the immune response to human NSVs are revisited.

METHODSThis meta-analysis included original articles in English published from 01/01/2020 to 06/15/2020 in Pubmed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of science, and Cochrane. Outcomes were major VTE, defined as any objectively diagnosed pulmonary embolism (PE) and/or proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Primary analysis estimated the risk of VTE, stratified by acutely and critically ill inpatients. Secondary analyses explored the separate risk of proximal DVT and of PE;the risk of major VTE stratified by screening and by type of anticoagulation. RESULTSIn 33 studies (n=4009 inpatients) with heterogeneous thrombotic risk factors, VTE incidence was 9% (95%CI 5-13%, I 2 =92.5) overall, and 21% (95%CI 14-28%, I 2 =87.6%) for patients hospitalized in the ICU. Proximal lower limb DVT incidence was 3% (95%CI 1-5%, I 2 = 87.0%) and 8% (95%CI 3-14%, I 2 =87.6%), respectively. PE incidence was 8% (95%CI 4-13%, I 2 =92.1%) and 17% (95%CI 11-25%, I 2 =89.3%), respectively. Screening and absence of anticoagulation were associated with a higher VTE incidence. When restricting to medically ill inpatients, the VTE incidence was 2% (95%CI 0-6%).CONCLUSIONSThe risk of major VTE among COVID-19 inpatients is high but varies greatly with severity of the disease. These findings reinforce the need for the use of thromboprophylaxis in all COVID-19 inpatients and for clinical trials testing different thromboprophylaxis regimens in subgroups of COVID-19 inpatients.

RESULTS The rs2234694 polymorphism was associated with BC susceptibility when BC patients and the control group were compared for the AC genotype (p<0.0001), the AC/CC genotype (dominant model: p<0.0001), and the C allele (p<0.0001). The 50 bp Ins/Del polymorphism was associated with BC susceptibility for the Del allele (p=0.048), although the association between the dominant model AC/CC (rs2234694) and BC patients was evident for menopause [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.65 (95% CI 1.05-2.7); p=0.048], Ki-67 (15%) (OR1.9, 95% CI 1.14- 3.16, p=0.016), and the presence of DM2 (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.35- 4.31, p=0.003). A protective association for BC of the rs2234694 polymorphism was observed in patients younger than 50 years positive for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), carrying the AC genotypes (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23-0.94, p= 0.033) and CC (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.013-1.07, p=0.047). The association between the InsDel/DelDel (dominant model; 50 bp Ins/Del) genotype and BC with metastatic lymph nodes (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.25, p=0.019), hematologic toxicity (OR 1.5, 95%CI 1.1-2.23, p=0.015), gastric toxicity (OR 1.5, 95%CI 1.1-2.07, p=0.030), and Ki-67 (15%) (OR1.6, 95%CI 1.2-2.26, p=0.002) was evident, indicating that these factors may contribute significantly to BC risk. The C/Ins haplotype was also associated with BC susceptibility (OR3.47, 95% CI 1.62-7.74, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS rs2234694 and 50 bp Ins/Del polymorphisms in the SOD1 gene were associated with BC susceptibility in a Mexican population. A protective association for BC of the rs2234694 polymorphism was observed in patients younger than 50 years positive for ER and PR, carrying the AC genotypes. The haplogenotypes AA/InsIns and AC/InsDel could contribute significantly to BC risk in gastric and hematologic toxicities, metastatic lymph nodes, and the presence of DM2 in the Mexican population analyzed.","output":"The rs2234694 and 50 bp Insertion/Deletion polymorphisms of the SOD1 gene are associated with breast cancer risk in a Mexican population."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The aim of this review is to answer the following question: Does assistive technology contribute to social inclusion for people with intellectual disability? Previous research on assistive technology has focused on socioeconomic impacts such as education, employment and access to healthcare by people with intellectual disability. There is a need to consolidate evidence on the interaction between intellectual disability, assistive technology, community living and social inclusion. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The review will consider studies from all settings: geographical, socioeconomic and care (institutional and community care), published in English. Studies reported in other languages with abstracts in English will be included if they can be translated using Google Translate, otherwise such studies will be included in the appendix. The review will include both qualitative and quantitative studies. The intervention in this review refers to the use of assistive technology to promote community participation or interpersonal relationships (social inclusion) for people with intellectual disability.

In rodent and diseased human lungs, tobacco cigarette (TCIG) smoke increases ACE2, but the effect of electronic cigarette vaping (ECIG) is unknown. It is unknown whether nicotine (in both TCIGs and ECIGs) or non-nicotine constituents unique to TCIG smoke increase expression of key proteins in COVID-19 pathogenesis. METHODS: Immune (CD45(+)) cells collected before the pandemic in otherwise healthy young people, including TCIG smokers (n = 9), ECIG vapers (n = 12), or nonsmokers (NS) (n = 12), were studied. Using flow cytometry, expression of key proteins in COVID-19 pathogenesis were compared among these groups. RESULTS: TCIG smokers and ECIG vapers had similar smoking or vaping burdens as indicated by similar plasma cotinine levels. TCIG smokers compared with NS had a significantly increased percentage of cells that were positive for ACE2 (10-fold, p < .001), TMPRSS2 (5-fold, p < .001), and ADAM17 (2.5-fold, p < .001). Additionally, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) consistently showed greater mean ACE2 (2.2-fold, p < .001), TMPRSS2 (1.5-fold, p < .001), furin (1.1-fold, p < .05), and ADAM17 (2-fold, p < .001) in TCIG smokers compared with NS. In ECIG vapers, furin MFI was increased (1.15-fold, p < .05) and TMPRSS2 MFI tended to be increased (1.1-fold, p = .077) compared with NS. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that key instigators of COVID-19 infection are lower in ECIG vapers compared with TCIG smokers is intriguing and warrants additional investigation to determine if switching to ECIGs is an effective harm reduction strategy. However, the trend toward increased proteases in ECIG vapers remains concerning. IMPLICATIONS: (1) This is the first human study to report a marked increase in proteins critical for COVID-19 infection, including ACE2, TMPRSS2, and ADAM17, in immune cells from healthy tobacco cigarette smokers without lung disease compared with e-cigarette vapers and nonsmokers. (2) These findings warrant additional investigation to determine whether switching to electronic cigarettes may be an effective harm reduction strategy in smokers addicted to nicotine who are unable or unwilling to quit. (3) The increase in proteases in electronic cigarette vapers remains concerning.","output":"Instigators of COVID-19 in Immune Cells Are Increased in Tobacco Cigarette Smokers and Electronic Cigarette Vapers Compared With Nonsmokers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The guidelines on heritage management adopted by the 2018 Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting provide the most recent iteration for an Antarctic tourism sector which had, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, been projected to increase further with various risks and potential impacts requiring careful management In this paper the role of cultural heritage for tourism prior to the COVID-19 pandemic is examined through three empirical perspectives First, how the Antarctic cultural heritage is represented through the designation of Historic Sites and Monuments and Site Guidelines for Visitors;then how this is presented through tourism operators' websites;and, finally, how it is experienced by visitors as narrated in open-source social media information Each dataset suggests that, while cultural heritage is an important component of an increasingly commodified tourist offering, it is only part of an assemblage of elements which combine to create a subliminal and largely intangible Antarctic experience In particular, a polarization of the heritage experience between cultural and natural does not appear productive The paper proposes a more nuanced understanding of heritage tourism in Antarctica which accommodates the notion of a hybrid experience that integrates cultural heritage, the history and stories this heritage represents, and the natural environmental setting","output":"Tourism and heritage in Antarctica: exploring cultural, natural and subliminal experiences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can manifest from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). COVID-19 associated pneumonia develops into ARDS due to rapid progression of hypoxia. Although arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) should be implemented to confirm this deterioration, it is not easy to obtain such tests in the COVID-19 environment. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine whether oxygen saturation (SpO2) and SpO2/fraction of inhaled oxygen (FiO2) (SF ratio) predicts ARDS and mortality. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study that enrolled COVID-19 pneumonia patients requiring oxygen therapy from Feb 2020 to May 2020. Of 100 COVID-19 pneumonia cases, we compared 59 cases of pneumonia requiring oxygen, divided into ARDS and non-ARDS pneumonia requiring oxygen. The factors affecting mortality were investigated. Results: At the time of admission, the SpO2, FiO2, and SF ratios of the ARDS group were significantly different from those of the non-ARDS pneumonia requiring oxygen support group (P <0.001, respectively). With respect to predicting occurrence of ARDS, the SF ratio on admission and the SF ratio at exacerbation showed an overall area under the curve of 85.7% and 88.8% (P < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified the SF ratio at exacerbation (HR, 0.916; 95% CI, 0.846-0.991; P = 0.029) and National Early Warning Score (NEWS) (HR, 1.277; 95% CI, 1.010-1.615; P = 0.041) as significant predictors of mortality. Conclusions: The SF ratio on admission and the SF ratio at exacerbation can predict occurrence of ARDS.

For the resulting semiparametric mixture model, we proposed two estimators, maximum empirical likelihood estimator (MELE) and minimum Hellinger distance estimator (MHDE), and investigated their asymptotic properties such as consistency and normality. In addition, to test the validity of the proposed semiparametric model, we developed KolmogorovCSmirnov type tests based on the two estimators.

The effect of COVID-19 and quarantine isolation on the course of epilepsy and on incidence of new-onset seizures is still unclear. With the aim of managing epilepsy in quarantined patients, three Italian Epilepsy Centers set up telephone consultations using a semistructured interview, allowing a prospective collection of data on seizure course and other seizure-related problems during pandemic. The collected data on seizure course were compared with the analogous period of 2019. The level of patients' concern relating to the COVID-19 pandemic was also assessed using a numeric rating scale. To address the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on seizure incidence, data collection included the number of consultations for first seizures, relapse seizures, and status epilepticus (SE) in the emergency department of one of the participating centers. Clinical telephone interviews suggest the absence of quarantine effect on epilepsy course in our cohort. No differences in incidence of emergency consultations for seizures over a two-month period were also observed compared with a control period. As demonstrated in other infective outbreaks, good antiepileptic drug (AED) supplying, precise information, and reassurance are the most important factors in chronic conditions to minimize psychological and physical stress, and to avoid unplanned treatment interruptions.","output":"Epilepsy course during COVID-19 pandemic in three Italian epilepsy centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Chest CT is a rapid, useful additional screening tool for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in emergent procedures. We describe the feasibility and interim outcome of implementing a modified imaging algorithm for COVID-19 risk stratification across a regional network of primary stroke centers in the work-up of acute ischemic stroke referrals for time-critical mechanical thrombectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook a retrospective review of 49 patients referred to the regional neuroscience unit for consideration of mechanical thrombectomy between April 14, 2020, and May 21, 2020. During this time, all referring units followed a standard imaging protocol that included a chest CT in addition to a head CT and CT angiogram to identify Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infective pulmonary changes. RESULTS: Overall, 2 patients had typical COVID-19 radiologic features and tested positive, while 7 patients had indeterminate imaging findings and tested negative. The others had normal or atypical changes and were not diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19. There was an overall sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 74.1%, negative predictive value of 100%, and positive predictive value of 22.2% when using chest CT to diagnose COVID-19 in comparison with the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test.

METHODS An institutional database from a single NCI-designated cancer center identified 266 patients with p16+ OPSCC treated with definitive CRT in our department from 2005-2016 with evaluable pre-treatment FDG-PET scans. Quantitative SUV metrics and qualitative imaging metrics were determined from FDG-PET and CT scans, while clinical characteristics were abstracted from the medical record. Associations between clinical/imaging features and time to LR (TTLRF) or DM (TTDMF) failure and overall survival (OS) were assessed using univariable Cox regression and penalized stepwise regression for multivariable analyses (MVA). RESULTS There were 27 LR and 32 DM recurrences as incident failures. Imaging biomarkers were significantly associated with TTLRF, TTDMF and OS. FDG-PET metrics outperformed CT and clinical metrics for TTLRF, with metabolic tumor volume being the only significant feature selected on MVA: C-index=0.68 (p=0.01). Radiographic extranodal extension (rENE), positive retropharyngeal nodes (RPN+), and clinical stage were significant on MVA for TTDMF: C-index=0.84 (p<0.001). rENE, group stage, and RPN+ were significant on MVA for OS: C-index=0.77 (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS In the largest study to date of uniformly treated patients with CRT to evaluate both pretreatment CT and FDG-PET, radiographic biomarkers were significantly associated with TTLRF, TTDMF and OS among patients with p16+ OPSCC treated with CRT. CT metrics performed best to predict TTDMF, while FDG-PET metrics showed improved prediction for LRRFS. These metrics may help identify candidates for treatment intensification or de-escalation of therapy. STATEMENT OF TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE Pre-treatment imaging features from standard-of-care PET/CT imaging show promise for predicting long-term outcomes following HPV-associated oropharynx cancer (HPV-OPC) therapy. This study comprehensively characterizes qualitative and quantitative pre-treatment imaging metrics associated with time to pattern-specific failure in a cohort of 266 patients treated uniformly with definitive chemoradiation. Multivariate analysis (MVA) for time to loco-regional failure (TTLRF), time to distant metastatic failure (TTDMF), and overall survival (OS) was performed. FDG-PET metrics outperformed CT and clinical metrics for TTLRF. CT radiographic extranodal extension, positive retropharyngeal nodes, and stage strongly predicted TTDMF (combined C-index=0.84, log rank p<0.001). Number of smoking pack-years complemented clinical and imaging features only in patients without radiographic extranodal extension or positive retropharyngeal nodes. Time to pattern-specific failure is important for guiding treatment de-escalation strategies, which intend to reduce treatment-related toxicity in patients with relatively long expected survival times. This study suggests that PET/CT features should play a crucial role in future de-escalation trials and management of HPV-OPC patients.","output":"CT and FDG-PET radiologic biomarkers in p16+ oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To advance understanding of practices that support inclusion of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities in inclusive education classrooms in Africa by conducting a review of the extant literature.

Using Bronfenbrenner's bioecological framework, findings revealed that inclusive education implementation is influenced by factors on the bio level, micro level, meso level, and macro level. Recommendations for promoting inclusive education implementation are provided. CONCLUSIONS Inclusion goes beyond teachers and requires strong commitment of other stakeholders such as families and governments. To guarantee the smooth inclusion of children with special education needs and particularly with intellectual and developmental disabilities, a set of practices validated through rigorous research as supportive and unique and that can be universal to Africa is wise. Implications for rehabilitation A number of strategies were identified that can improve the classroom inclusion of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Development of policies that support such strategies could improve implementation. Inclusion goes beyond teachers. Rehabilitation professionals (i.e. occupational therapists) and educational professionals should partner to identify practical solutions to the challenges of creating inclusive environments for children with special education needs. Committing more resources and time towards the development and implementation of special education policies can advance the successful inclusion of children with special education needs.","output":"Implementation of inclusive education for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities in African countries: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, sub-Saharan Africa remains at high risk given the poor adherence to pandemic control protocols. Misconceptions about the contagion may have given rise to adverse risk behaviours across population groups. This study evaluates risk perception among 2,244 residents of seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe) in relation to socio-demographic determinants. METHODS: an online survey was conducted via social media platforms to a random sample of participants. Risk perception was evaluated across six domains: loss of income, food scarcity, having a relative infected, civil disorder, criminal attacks, or losing a friend or relative to COVID-19. A multivariable ordinal logistic regression was conducted to assess socio-demographic factors associated with the perceived risk of being affected by COVID-19. RESULTS: 595 (27%) respondents did not consider themselves to be at risk, while 33% perceived themselves to be at high risk of being affected by the pandemic with respect to the six domains evaluated. Hospital-based workers had the highest proportional odds (3.5; 95%CI: 2.3-5.6) high perceived risk. Teenage respondents had the highest predictive probability (54.6%; 95% CI: 36.6-72.7%) of perceiving themselves not to be at risk of being affected by COVID-19, while Zambia residents had the highest predictive probability (40.7%; 95% CI: 34.3-47.0%) for high-risk perception. CONCLUSION: this study reveals the need to increase awareness of risks among socio-demographic groups such as younger people and the unemployed.

The three research objectives of this study are to explore basic causality, mediating effects of attitude and moderating effects of age and perceived risk, of the extended TPB model, respectively. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was conducted in Taiwan during the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, the survey generated 351 responses. The structural model analysis was performed to test the cause-and-effect relationships in the traditional TPB model and the mediating role of an individuals attitude regarding travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. The SmartPLS multi-group analysis procedure was applied to test the moderation effects of age and perceived risk. Findings: It is found that the perceived behavioral control is the main contributor of travel intention for the traditional TPB while attitude partially mediates the relationship between subjective norm and travel intention for the test of mediation. Also, moderation tests confirm that both age and perceived risk show significant moderating effect only on subjective norm to travel intention relationship. Originality/value: The novelty of this research is that this study proposed and verified the mediating influence of attitude and two additional paths, the moderating influence of age and perceived risk, which deepened the understanding of the TPB model and the impact of COVID-19 on travel intention. Because TPB model is context-dependent, using one mediating and two moderating variables allows the study to understand how TPB functions in a different situation. ? 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Tourists travel intention: revisiting the TPB model with age and perceived risk as moderator and attitude as mediator"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome-novel coronavirus mediated COVID-19 has been recently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The primary target of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the human lungs governed by the ACE-2 receptor of epithelial type II cells/endothelial cells, which promote modulation of the immune response of host cells through generating cytokine storm, inflammation, severe pneumonia symptoms, and secondary complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although numerous antiviral and anti-parasitic drugs are under clinical trials to combat this pandemic, to date, neither a specific treatment nor any successful vaccine has been established, urging researchers to identify any potential candidate for combating the disease. Mesenchymal stem cells own self-renewal, differentiation, homing, immunomodulation and remains unaffected by the coronavirus on the virtue of the absence of ACE-2 receptors, indicating that MSC's could be used an ameliorative approach for COVID-19. MSCs have shown to combat the disease via various pathways such as repairing the lung epithelial and endothelial cells, reducing hyperimmune response, maintaining the renin-angiotensin system. Although MSCs-based treatment approaches for COVID-19 is still under consideration with limited data, many human clinical trials of MSC's has been initiated to explore their potential for COVID 19 treatment. The current review summarizes and emphasizes on how MSC's modulate the immune response, can repair the lungs from the impact of the virus, and various aspects of MSC's as a remedial source for COVID-19, to provide better insight for biomedical researchers and for those who are fascinated by stem cells as a therapeutic approach.","output":"Mesenchymal stem cell immunomodulation and regeneration therapeutics as an ameliorative approach for COVID-19 pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction In obese patients, it is thought that the excess of macronutrients stimulates adipocytes to generate cytokines such as interleukin-6 creating a pro-inflammatory and oxidative state leading to defective innate immunity. This environment potentially creates a conducive ground for the hyperinflammatory response mediated by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, in addition to accepted risk factors such as advanced age, pregnancy and diabetes, obesity is thought to be an important entity predisposing to severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and a potentially worse prognosis. The aim of this study is to understand the impact of obesity on the clinical course and outcome of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19. Methods All COVID-19 ICU admissions between March 1st and May 31st, 2020 were obtained from our hospital's data base. Patients age &gt;18 years with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction from a nasopharyngeal swab were included. ICU patients who were admitted for non-respiratory reasons with an incidental positive test result were excluded. Patients were divided into two groups obese: (BMI &gt;/=30) and non-obese (BMI &lt;30). All categorical variables are expressed as frequencies and percentages. Comparisons of categorical variables were performed using Fisher's Exact Test. Continuous variables are expressed as median (IQR). Medians were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-Test. P-value of &lt;0.05 was taken to be statistically significant. The institutional review board of New York Medical College approved this study. Results Of the 210 patients who met our inclusion criteria, 95 patients were obese and 115 were nonobese. Obese patients were significantly younger than their non-obese counterparts (p=0.005). Aside from this, there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of gender, race, baseline comorbidities and severity of illness at the time of ICU admission. Outcomes such as mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, stroke and death were not different between the two groups (Table 1). Conclusion Unlike other studies, ours did not find significant differences in the outcomes of critically ill obese patients with COVID-19. This might be because other authors used a BMI &gt;25 as their cutoff whereas we used BMI &gt;/= 30. Another potential explanation is that in our study, obese patients were younger, a factor which may have neutralized the negative impact of obesity. Our study is limited by sample size and the single center factor but suggests that obesity alone may not significantly affect prognosis although this will need to be confirmed by larger studies.","output":"Obesity and severe COVID-19: A retrospective analysis of intensive care unit patients at a quaternary medical center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Neutralising antibodies are one of the factors to measure individuals immune status for control of infectious diseases.

However, there is not much information available on the toxicity of nanoparticles in neuronal disorders. The toxic effect of nanoparticles on brain disorders and their regulatory issues is the primary concern of the healthcare industry. METHODS: A strategical literature search was performed on a various bibliographic database such as Scopus, PubMed, SciFinder, Google Scholar, Medline, Google patent, Derwent Innovation, and Orbit Intelligence for retrieval of peerreviewed articles and patents on regulatory issues and toxicity of nanoparticles in neuronal disorders over the past four decades or so. The relevant hits of articles and patents were analyzed and citation search for the relevant documents was carried out. RESULTS: The literature documents have been summarized regarding the existing regulatory issues and toxicity of nanoparticles on neuronal disorders with a focus on the detailed mechanism of developmental toxicity of nanoparticles. The focus of this report is to emphasize the negative effects of nanoparticle on neuronal disorders which may partially contribute to management of toxicity of nanoparticles. CONCLUSION: Although nanoparticles have unique physical and chemical properties that explain the broad range of application for the central nervous system, they can also manifest neurotoxic effects due to cell necrosis, a generation of free radicals, immune responses and neuroinflammation.

Smell loss has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it is unknown whether monitoring for smell loss can be used to identify asymptomatic infection among high risk individuals, like HCW. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study, tracking 473 HCW across three months to determine if smell loss could predict SARS-CoV-2 infection in this high-risk group. HCW subjects completed a longitudinal, novel behavioral at-home assessment of smell function with household items, as well as detailed symptom surveys that included a parosmia screening questionnaire, and RT-qPCR testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 17 (3.6%) of 473 HCW. Among the 17 infected HCW, 53% reported smell loss, and were more likely to report smell loss than COVID-negative HCW on both the at-home assessment and the screening questionnaire (P < .01). 67% reported smell loss prior to having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and smell loss was reported a median of two days before testing positive. Neurological symptoms were reported more frequently among COVID-positive HCW who reported smell loss (P < .01).

We report findings from the epidemiological investigation of the initial 135 COVID-19 cases in Brunei and describe the impact of control measures and travel restrictions. Methods Epidemiological and clinical information were obtained for all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Brunei, whose symptom onset was from March 9 to April 5, 2020 (covering the initial 5 weeks of the epidemic). Transmission-related measures such as reproduction number (R), incubation period, serial interval were estimated. Time-varying R was calculated to assess the effectiveness of control measures. Results A total of 135 cases were detected, of which 53 (39.3%) were imported. The median age was 36 years (range = 0.5 to 72). 41 (30.4%) and 13 (9.6%) were presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases respectively. The median incubation period was 5 days (IQR = 5, range = 1 to 11), and the mean serial interval was 5.39 days (sd = 4.47; 95% CI: 4.25, 6.53). R0 was between 3.88 and 5.96, and the doubling time was 1.3 days. By the 13th day of the epidemic, the Rt was under one (Rt = 0.91; 95% credible interval: 0.62, 1.32 ) and the epidemic was under control. Conclusion Epidemic control was achieved through a combination of public health measures, with emphasis on a test-isolate-trace approach supplemented by travel restrictions and moderate physical distancing measures but no actual lockdown.

Due to its social and economic impact, different countries imposed preventive measures that are aimed at reducing the transmission of the disease. Such control measures include physical distancing, quarantine, hand-washing, travel and boarder restrictions, lockdown, and the use of hand sanitizers. Quarantine, out of the aforementioned control measures, is considered to be more stressful for people to manage. When people are stressed, their body immunity becomes weak, which leads to multiplying of coronavirus within the body. Therefore, a mathematical model consisting of six compartments, Susceptible-Exposed-Quarantine-Infectious-Hospitalized-Recovered (SEQIHR) was developed, aimed at showing the impact of stress on the transmission of COVID-19 disease. From the model formulated, the positivity, bounded region, existence, uniqueness of the solution, the model existence of free and endemic equilibrium points, and local and global stability were theoretically proved. The basic reproduction number (R(0)) was derived by using the next-generation matrix method, which shows that, when R(0) < 1, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable whereas when R(0) > 1 the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Moreover, the Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) method was used to study the correlation between model parameters and R(0). Numerically, the SEQIHR model was solved by using the Rung-Kutta fourth-order method, while the least square method was used for parameter identifiability. Furthermore, graphical presentation revealed that when the mental health of an individual is good, the body immunity becomes strong and hence minimizes the infection.

We found that vhs-deficient virus activates the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR) much more strongly than the wild-type virus does in HeLa cells, while PKR is not activated in Vero cells, raising the possibility that PKR might play roles in stress granule induction and/or inhibiting translation in restrictive cells. We tested this possibility by evaluating the effects of inactivating PKR. Eliminating PKR in HeLa cells abolished stress granule formation but had only minor effects on viral true late protein levels. These results document an essential role for PKR in stress granule formation by a nuclear DNA virus, indicate that induction of stress granules is the consequence rather than the cause of the translational defect, and are consistent with our previous suggestion that vhs promotes translation of viral true late mRNAs by preventing mRNA overload rather than by suppressing eIF2 phosphorylation. IMPORTANCE The herpes simplex virus vhs RNase plays multiple roles during infection, including suppressing PKR activation, inhibiting the formation of stress granules, and promoting translation of viral late mRNAs. A key question is the extent to which these activities are mechanistically connected. Our results demonstrate that PKR is essential for stress granule formation in the absence of vhs, but at best, it plays a secondary role in suppressing translation of viral mRNAs. Thus, the ability of vhs to promote translation of viral mRNAs can be largely uncoupled from PKR suppression, demonstrating that this viral RNase modulates at least two distinct aspects of RNA metabolism.","output":"The Herpes Simplex Virus Virion Host Shutoff Protein Enhances Translation of Viral True Late mRNAs Independently of Suppressing Protein Kinase R and Stress Granule Formation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deficits in oral reading fluency (ORF) impair reading comprehension and tend to persevere throughout schooling.

In study 1 (N = 1166), the chained equipercentile equating method was performed to equate the test forms' scores horizontally and vertically. The tests of differences performed using the equated scores indicated that they were similar within the same grade level but increased significantly across grade levels. In study 2 (N = 549), reliability and validity evidence for the test forms was collected. Test-retest correlations were higher than .90, suggesting a high stability of the scores. Significant correlations between the TAF scores and the ones obtained in other reading tests, teachers' judgments, and school outcomes, were obtained, thus providing evidence of validity for the developed test forms.

In this interest, we discuss three different behavior change cases separately: constant behavior change, instantaneous behavior change response to the diseases perceived prevalence, and piecewise constant behavior change response to government policies.

Previous literature has developed bi-level models of the work starting time choice considering both labor output and urban mobility. Yet, most analytical studies assume the single trip purpose in peak hours (to work) only and do not consider the household travels (daycare drop-off/pick-up). In fact, as one of the main reasons to adopt flextime, household travel plays an influential role in travelers' decision making on work schedule selection. On this account, we incorporate household travels into the work starting time choice model in this study. Both short-run travel behaviours and long-run work start time selection of heterogenous commuters are examined under agglomeration economies. If flextime is not flexible enough, commuters tend to agglomerate in work schedule choice at long-run equilibrium. Further, we analyze optimal schedule choices with two system performance indicators. For total commuting cost, it is found that the rigid school schedule for households may impede the benefits of flextime in commuting cost saving. In terms of total net benefit, while work schedule agglomeration of all commuters leads to the maximum in some cases, the polarized agglomeration of the two heterogenous groups can never achieve the optimum.","output":"Bottleneck Congestion And Work Starting Time Distribution Considering Household Travels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown have encouraged increased internet use and addiction among young adults.

It is most commonly seen in children (MIS-C) and is rare in adults (MIS-A). We report a case of MIS-A with multiorgan failure in a previously healthy patient who had recently recovered from COVID-19. Case Presentation A 29-year-old Caucasian male with no medical history presented with fever to 103 degrees Fahrenheit, headache, syncope, and vomiting for 3 days. He had been diagnosed with COVID-19 five weeks prior and recovered without complication. Patient was seen in the ED the previous day for fever and neck stiffness, at which time he had a negative repeat COVID-19 test and unremarkable lumbar puncture. Physical exam was normal. Labs revealed WBC 13.4, platelets 90, AST 92, ALT 120, total bilirubin 1.7, ferritin 1,033, CRP 312, and procalcitonin 1.35. Initial imaging revealed gallbladder sludge and inflammation of the mesentery and distal ileum with adenopathy. Patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, over the next 3 days, he developed an oxygen requirement up to 6 liters, tachycardia, increasing liver function tests, and acute kidney injury. Procalcitonin trended up to 16.03. Infectious workup was negative. CTA chest revealed right upper lobe pulmonary emboli, bilateral pleural effusions, and pulmonary edema. Pro-BNP was 24,554. Echocardiogram showed ejection fraction (EF) 45-50%, enlarged right ventricle, and small pericardial effusion. Patient was started on a heparin drip, without improvement. Diuresis was attempted but limited by hypotension. He was ultimately treated with dexamethasone, resulting in rapid improvement. Discussion The pathophysiology of MIS-A is poorly understood but is thought to be due to immune dysregulation. This may be a post-infectious process or could be due to persistent infection outside of the upper respiratory system, as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is known to affect other organs, such as the heart, liver, kidneys, and gastrointestinal system. MIS-A usually occurs 2-5 weeks after the patient has COVID-19. It disproportionately affects minority groups. Common presenting symptoms include fever, chest pain, dyspnea, myalgias, and gastrointestinal and dermatologic symptoms. Inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) are elevated. Severe dysfunction of at least one extrapulmonary organ system (e.g., cardiac dysfunction, hypotension, acute kidney or liver injury, thromboembolism) must be present. The mainstay of treatment is corticosteroids;intensive care admission, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor or inotrope support, and hemodialysis may also be required. The majority of patients with MIS-A survive. The long-term effects are unknown.","output":"Not out of the woods yet: A case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome due to COVID-19 in an adult"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE By the end of February 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic infection had spread in Northern Italy, with thousands of patients infected. In Lombardy, the most affected area, the majority of public and private hospitals were dedicated to caring for COVID-19 patients and were organized following the 'Hub-and-Spoke' model for other medical specialties, like cardiac surgery and interventional procedures for congenital cardiac disease (CHD). Here, we report how the congenital cardiac care system was modified in Lombardy and the first results of this organization. METHODS We describe a modified 'Hub-and-Spoke' model - that involves 59 birthplaces and three specialized Congenital Cardiac Centers -- and how the hub center organized his activity. We also reported the data of the consecutive cases hospitalized during this period. RESULTS From 9 March to 15 April, we performed: a total of 21 cardiac surgeries, 4 diagnostic catheterizations, 3 CT scans, and 2 CMR. In three cases with prenatal diagnosis, the birth was scheduled. The spoke centers referred to our center six congenital cardiac cases. The postop ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation support was required in two cases; one case died. None of these patients nor their parents or accompanying person was found to be COVID-19-positive; 2 pediatric intensivists were found to be COVID-19-positive, and needed hospitalization without mechanical ventilation; 13 nurses had positive COVID swabs (4 with symptoms), and were managed and isolated at home.

These highly connected individuals may play an important role in case of an infectious disease outbreak. METHODS: We propose a novel strategy of finding and immunizing highly connected individuals and evaluate this strategy by computer simulations, using a stochastic, individual-and network-based simulation approach. A small random sample of the population is asked to list their acquaintances, and those who are mentioned most frequently are offered vaccination. This intervention is combined with case isolation and contact tracing. RESULTS: Asking only 10% of the population for 10 acquaintances each and vaccinating the most frequently named people strongly diminishes the magnitude of an outbreak which would otherwise have exhausted the available isolation units and gone out of control. It is extremely important to immunize all identified highly connected individuals. Omitting a few of them because of unsuccessful vaccination jeopardizes the overall success, unless non-immunized individuals are taken under surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: The strategy proposed in this paper is particularly successful because it attacks the very point from which the transmission network draws its strength: the highly connected individuals.

METHODS Patients <18 years of age who lived on Hong Kong Island (a separate island within Hong Kong) and were admitted to either of the only 2 public hospitals on the island for a febrile acute respiratory infection on 1 fixed day of the week in each hospital from October 2003 through September 2006 were prospectively recruited. These 2 hospitals together accounted for 72.5% of all general pediatric admissions in Hong Kong Island with a known population denominator. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from all recruited patients and were tested for influenza A and influenza B viruses by direct antigen detection and culture. RESULTS All cases of influenza A during 2003-2004 were caused by H3N2 virus, whereas 85.7% of cases during 2004-2005 were due to H3N2 virus, and 93.5% during 2005-2006 were due to H1N1 virus. During 2004-2005, infants <1 year of age had the highest rate of hospitalization for influenza A (103.8 cases per 10,000 population), whereas children 1 year of age had the highest rate of hospitalization during the other 2 seasons (95.5 and 54.6 cases per 10,000 population during 2003-2004 and 2005-2006, respectively). A protection rate of 25%, presumably attributable to maternal antibodies, was seen in infants <1 year of age who were hospitalized during 2003-2004 with infection due to an H3N2 virus that had been in circulation. The hospitalization rates for influenza B were highest among children 2-4 years of age.

Five RT-PCR-positive cases underwent in situ hybridisation (ISH) for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with lethal COVID-19 infection were mostly male (78%) and had a high incidence of hypertension (91%), coronary artery disease (61%), and diabetes mellitus (48%).

Respiratory viral infection\`s frequency and clinical outcome in symptomatic children with cancer: A single center experience from a middle-income country. Turk J Pediatr 2018; 60: 653-659. In developing countries, acute respiratory tract infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children, particularly in pediatric cancer patients. A majority of these illnesses are precipitated by viral infections. In our country, studies were conducted on the single respiratory viral infection in a pediatric hematology-oncology unit; however, the analysis of respiratory viral infections in children with cancer is lacking. The present study aimed to provide analysis of multiple respiratory viral infections and clinical outcome in children with cancer who receive chemotherapy and show signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infections. During January, 2014 and January, 2015 children with cancer under treatment who presented with respiratory tract infections were assessed for viruses by using multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Specimens were collected by nasal swabbing at in-patient and out-patient clinics. Overall, 72 samples of respiratory tract infection episodes, collected from children with cancer were evaluated with the simultaneous detection of 20 respiratory viruses. A respiratory viral pathogen was obtained in 56.9% samples. Rhinovirus (24.3%) and co-infection with two viruses (19.5%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens. There were four (9.6%) samples of severe pneumonia. Patients with febrile neutropenic episodes and pneumonia were hospitalized and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other non-neutropenic and mild respiratory tract infections were treated with supportive care as outpatient procedures. There were no deaths. Because there are no effective antiviral agents for certain respiratory viruses, infection control and early diagnosis are crucial in preventing the spread of infection.

However, the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections is likely to be higher than the confirmed case counts because many infected people have mild or no symptoms, and limitations exist with regard to testing capacity and surveillance systems in Zambia. We aimed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in six districts of Zambia in July, 2020, using a population-based household survey. METHODS: Between July 4 and July 27, 2020, we did a cross-sectional cluster-sample survey of households in six districts of Zambia. Within each district, 16 standardised enumeration areas were randomly selected as primary sampling units using probability proportional to size. 20 households from each standardised enumeration area were selected using simple random sampling. All members of selected households were eligible to participate. Consenting participants completed a questionnaire and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using real-time PCR (rtPCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using ELISA. Prevalence estimates, adjusted for the survey design, were calculated for each diagnostic test separately, and combined. We applied the prevalence estimates to census population projections for each district to derive the estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. FINDINGS: Overall, 4258 people from 1866 households participated in the study. The median age of participants was 182 years (IQR 77C314) and 506% of participants were female. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence for the combined measure was 106% (95% CI 73C139). The rtPCR-positive prevalence was 76% (47C106) and ELISA-positive prevalence was 21% (11C31). An estimated 454 708 SARS-CoV-2 infections (95% CI 312 705C596 713) occurred in the six districts between March and July, 2020, compared with 4917 laboratory-confirmed cases reported in official statistics from the Zambia National Public Health Institute. INTERPRETATION: The estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections was much higher than the number of reported cases in six districts in Zambia. The high rtPCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was consistent with observed community transmission during the study period. The low ELISA-positive SARS-CoV-2 prevalence might be associated with mitigation measures instituted after initial cases were reported in March, 2020.

Although antivirals are an integral tool in effective influenza management, the potential for the emergence of antiviral-resistant viruses can lead to uncertainty and hesitation among front-line prescribers and policy makers. Here, we provide an overview of influenza antiviral resistance in context, exploring the key concepts underlying its development and clinical impact. Due to the acute nature of influenza in immunocompetent patients, resistant viruses that develop during antiviral treatment of a single patient (\\"treatment-emergent resistance\\") are usually cleared in a relatively short time, with no impact on future antiviral efficacy. In addition, although available data are limited by small numbers of patients, they show that antiviral treatment still provides clinical benefit to the patient within whom resistance emerges. In contrast, the sustained community transmission of resistant variants in the absence of treatment (\\"acquired resistance\\") is of greater concern and can potentially render front-line antivirals ineffective. Importantly, however, resistant viruses are usually associated with reduced fitness such that their widespread transmission is relatively rare. Influenza antivirals are an essential part of effective influenza management due to their ability to reduce the risk of complications and death in infected patients. Although antiviral resistance should be taken seriously and requires continuous careful monitoring, it is not comparable to antibiotic resistance in bacteria, which can become permanent and widespread, with far-reaching medical consequences. The benefits of antiviral treatment far outweigh concerns of potential resistance, which in the vast majority of cases does not have a significant clinical impact.","output":"Understanding the Impact of Resistance to Influenza Antivirals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility (COVAX) represents an unprecedented global collaboration facilitating the development and distribution of vaccines for COVID-19. COVAX pools and channels funds from state and non-state actors to promising vaccine candidates, and has started to distribute successful candidates to participating states. The WHO, one of the leaders of COVAX, recognised vaccine doses would initially be scarce, and therefore, prepared a two-staged allocation mechanism they considered fair. In the first stage, vaccine doses are distributed equally among participating countries, while in the second stage vaccine doses will be allocated according to a country's need. Ethicists have questioned whether this is the fairest distribution-they argue a country's need should be taken into account from the start and correspondingly, have proposed a framework that treats individuals with equal moral concern, aims to minimise harm and gives priority to the worst-off. In this paper, we seek to explore these concerns by comparing COVAX's allocation mechanism to a targeted allocation based on need. We consider which distribution would more likely maximise well-being and align with principles of equity.

Alkaline phosphatase was localized in the granules of type II granulocyte and acid phosphatase cytochemistry also labelled a few vacuoles of polymorphonuclear agranulocyte. About 85 per cent of the coelomic inflammatory exudate cell population was type II granulocyte, 10 per cent polymorphonuclear agranulocyte and 5 per cent macrophages as judged by the nucleus and granule morphology. These results indicate that this lungfish utilises type II granulocytes as its main inflammatory granulocytes and that the polymorphonuclear agranulocyte may also be involved in the inflammatory response. The other two granulocytes appear similar to the mammalian eosinophil and basophil. In summary, this lungfish appears to posses the typical inflammatory granulocytes of teleosts, however, further functional studies are necessary to better understand the polymorphonuclear agranulocyte...(AU)","output":"Blood and inflammatory cells of the lungfish Lepidosiren paradoxa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide. Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) may reduce health risks associated with chronic exposure to smoke and their potential benefits have been the matter of intense scientific debate. Here we replicated three key published studies from the Tobacco Industry on cytotoxic and inflammatory effects of cigarette smoke and ENDS aerosol in an independent multicentric study. We aimed to establish the reliability of results and the robustness of conclusions by replicating the authors experimental protocols and further validating them with different techniques. We exposed human bronchial epithelial cell (NCI-H292) to cigarette smoke and to aerosol from ENDS. All the exposure were conducted at air-liquid interface to assess cytotoxicity effects of smoke and aerosol. Moreover, we aimed to assess different inflammatory mediators release (IL-6, IL-8 and MMP-1) from cells exposed to whole smoke and to smoke without particulate matter (vapor phase). We were able to replicate the results obtained in the original studies on cytotoxicity confirming that almost 80% of the cytotoxic effect of smoke is due to the vapor phase of smoke. Moreover, our results substantiated the reduced cytotoxic effects of ENDS aerosol in respect to cigarette smoke. However, our data are significantly different from the original ones in terms of inflammatory and remodeling activity triggered by smoke.

We reviewed the existing literature on COVID-19 to assess the incidence and mortality of dementia comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE To investigate the impact of pre-existing dementia comorbidities on COVID-19. METHODS We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for patients with preexisting dementia who were diagnosed with COVID-19. The statistical data on the prevalence and mortality of dementia comorbidities were examined. A fixed-or random-effect model was used to calculate the overall pooled risk estimates. Forest plots were generated to show the summarized results. RESULTS A total of 265 articles were retrieved from the three databases. After removing duplicates and performing two screenings, 10 articles were selected for meta-analysis, including 119,218 participants. Overall, the meta-analysis of the 10 studies showed that the incidence of dementia in COVID-19 patients was (R: 9%, [95% CI: 6% to 13%]). Moreover, the meta-analysis of 9 studies showed that the mortality rate of individuals with dementia after being infected with COVID-19 was higher than that of individuals with no dementia (OR: 5.17 [95% CI: 2.31 to 11.59]). Substantial heterogeneity was observed in this meta-analysis. Significant publication bias was also found. CONCLUSION Emerging literature shows that dementia comorbidities are a high risk factor for the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19.

We have developed an ablation strategy, where we incorporate voltage information as a surrogate for atrial fibrosis from the electro-anatomical map (EAM) during AFL ablation procedures to create individualized, substrate-based ablation lines along the area of most pronounced low-voltage within the reentry-circuit. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate acute procedural success and long-term outcome of a substrate-based ablation (SBA) strategy in comparison to a standard anatomically based ablation (ABA) strategy for the ablation of atypical AFL. Methods: Patients that underwent ablation for AFL at our institution were included. SBA procedures were compared to ABA procedures. Endpoints were acute termination of AFL and recurrence of the index AFL or any other AFL during follow-up. Results: We included 47 patients, 24 individuals (51.1%) in the SBA group and 23 patients (48.9%) in the ABA group. Most patients had signs of atrial cardiomyopathy, namely enlarged left atrial diameter (LAD) and extended amount of left atrial low-voltage areas (LVA). Termination of AFL occurred in 27 of 29 (93.1%) AFL in the SBA group and in 28 of 31 (90.3%) AFL in the ABA group (p = 0.99). Freedom from recurrence of any atypical AFL after 2.5 years was 21.5% in the ABA group compared to 48.8% in the SBA group (p = 0.047).

METHODS The prospective ADAPT-DES (Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents) study was used to determine the incidence and predictors of clinically relevant bleeding events occurring within 2 years after hospital discharge. The effect of PDB on subsequent 2-year all-cause mortality was estimated by time-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS Among 8,582 \\"all-comers\\" who underwent successful PCI with DES in the ADAPT-DES study, PDB occurred in 535 of 8,577 hospital survivors (6.2%) at a median time of 300 days (interquartile range: 130 to 509 days) post-discharge. Gastrointestinal bleeding (61.7%) was the most frequent source of PDB. Predictors of PDB included older age, lower baseline hemoglobin, lower platelet reactivity on clopidogrel, and use of chronic oral anticoagulation therapy. PDB was associated with higher crude rates of all-cause mortality (13.0% vs. 3.2%; p < 0.0001). Following multivariable adjustment, PDB was strongly associated with 2-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.03; p < 0.0001), with an effect size greater than that of post-discharge myocardial infarction (PDMI) (HR: 1.92; p = 0.009).

Many recommend to minimize radiation dose while maintaining diagnostic quality. This study was designed to evaluate the difference between findings of COVID-19 pneumonia on standard and low-dose protocols to provide data on the utility of the latter during initial imaging of COVID-19. METHODS Patients suspected of having COVID-19 were scanned with a 128-slices scanner using two consecutive protocols in the same session (standard-dose scan: 120 kV and 300 mA; low-dose scan: 80 kV and 40 mA). Dose data acquisition and analysis was performed using an automated software. High and low-dose examinations were anonymized, shuffled and read by two radiologist with consensus according to a highly structured reporting format that was primarily based on the consensus statement of the RSNA. Accordingly, 8 typical, 2 indeterminate, and 7 atypical findings were investigated. Cases were then assigned to one of the categories: (i) Cov19Typ, typical COVID-19; (ii) Cov19Ind, indeterminate COVID-19; (iii) Cov19Aty, atypical COVID-19; (iv) Cov19Neg, not COVID-19. McNemar test was used to analyze the number of disagreements between standard and low-dose scans regarding paired proportions of structured findings. Inter- test reliability was tested using kappa coefficient. RESULTS The study included 740 patients with a mean age of 44.0516.59 years. The median (minimum-maximum) dose level for standard protocol was 189.98 mGy?cm (98.20-493.54 mGy?cm) and for low-dose protocol was 15.59 mGy?cm (11.59-32.37 mGy?cm) differing by -80 and -254 mGy?cm from pan-European diagnostic reference levels. Only two findings for typical, one finding for indeterminate, and three findings for atypical categories were statistically similar (p > 0.05). The difference in other categories resulted in significantly different final diagnosis for COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Overall, 626 patients received matching diagnoses with the two protocols. According to intertest reliability analysis, kappa value was found to be 0.669 (p < 0.001) to indicate substantial match. CT with standard-dose had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 72%, while CT with low-dose had a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 81%. CONCLUSION Low kV and mA scans, as used in this study according to scanner manufacturer's global recommendations, may significantly lower exposure levels. However, these scans are significantly inferior in the detection of several individual CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly the ones with GGO. Therefore, they should not be used as the protocol of choice in the initial imaging of COVID-19 patients during which higher sensitivity is required.","output":"The reliability of low-dose chest CT for the initial imaging of COVID-19: comparison of structured findings, categorical diagnoses and dose levels."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the dynamics of equilibration processes in quantum systems as well as their interplay with dissipation and fluctuation is a major challenge in quantum many-body theory.

We found 11 patients and guardians with COVID-19 through vigorous contact tracing and closed-circuit television monitoring. We found one patient who probably had acquired COVID-19 through airborne-transmission. We performed airflow investigation with simulation software, whole-genome sequencing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: Of the nine individuals with COVID-19 who had been in the hematologic ward, six stayed in one multi-patient room (Room 36), and other three stayed in different rooms (Room 1, 34, 35). Guardian in room 35 was close contact to cases in room 36, and patient in room 34 used the shared bathroom for teeth brushing 40 minutes after index used. Airflow simulation revealed that air was spread from the bathroom to the adjacent room 1 while patient in room 1 did not used the shared bathroom. Airflow was associated with poor ventilation in shared bathroom due to dysfunctioning air-exhaust, grill on the door of shared bathroom and the unintended negative pressure of adjacent room.

In this study, we investigated changes in the proteome of kidney tissue of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens that were infected with an isolate of the nephrotropic variant 2 genotype (IS/1494/06) of avian coronavirus. Twenty 1-day-old SPF White Leghorn chickens were randomly divided into two groups, each comprising 10 chickens, which were kept in separate positive-pressure isolators. Chickens in group A served as a virus-free control group up to the end of the experiment, whereas chickens in group B were inoculated with 0.1 ml of 10(4.5) EID(50) of the IBV/chicken/Iran/UTIVO-C/2014 isolate of IBV, and kidney tissue samples were collected at 2 and 7 days post-inoculation (dpi) from both groups. Sequencing of five protein spots at 2 dpi and 22 spots at 7 dpi that showed differential expression by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) along with fold change greater than 2 was done by MS-MALDI/TOF/TOF. Furthermore, the corresponding protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks at 2 and 7 dpi were identified to develop a detailed understanding of the mechanism of molecular pathogenesis. Topological graph analysis of this undirected PPI network revealed the effect of 10 genes in the 2 dpi PPI network and nine genes in the 7 dpi PPI network during virus pathogenesis. Proteins that were found by 2DE analysis and MS/TOF-TOF mass spectrometry to be down- or upregulated were subjected to PPI network analysis to identify interactions with other cellular components.

Second, debates continue surrounding the production of scale and the multiscalarity of organized labour. Third, labour geographers have yet to engage in any sustained fashion with unpacking the complex identities of workers and the way in which those identities simultaneously are shaped by and shape the economic and cultural landscape. Fourth, there is some debate on the costs and benefits of a normative labour geography which emphasizes what workers and their organizations could or even should do. Lastly, we challenge the assumption that labour geographers have not yet asserted themselves as activists in their own right. We conclude the editorial by introducing the articles included in the issue. While these articles may not address every gap in the literature, they do contribute in significant ways to move the labour geography project forward.","output":"Labouring geography: Negotiating scales, strategies and future directions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several plus-strand RNA viruses encode proteins containing macrodomains.

Using a cross-sectional survey, the current paper aimed to examine self-reported changes in eating patterns and behaviour during the lockdown in the UK, and associations with BMI, demographic variables, eating styles, health anxiety, food insecurity and coping strategies. Participants (N = 620) were recruited online through social media advertising. The results showed that there were self-reported changes to food consumption during the lockdown across the sample. Increases in consumption of HED (high energy density) snack foods during the lockdown was associated with sex, pre-lockdown eating behaviour (emotional eating and uncontrolled eating), and Covid-specific health anxiety. Increases in positive eating practices such as eating more home prepared foods, and fruits and vegetables, were associated with adaptive coping strategies. Higher emotional eating (EE) during the lockdown was associated with a higher BMI, higher pre-lockdown EE and maladaptive coping strategies. Maladaptive coping strategies moderated the relationship between BMI and EE during the lockdown. In particular a higher BMI was associated with higher EE during the lockdown if an individual also had higher maladaptive coping strategies. These findings suggest that changes to eating behaviour may be part of a wider style of maladaptive or adaptive coping, particularly in those with a history of EE or uncontrolled eating. Preparing individuals to adopt more adaptive coping strategies during lockdown situations may be crucial to improving health during subsequent the lockdown events.","output":"Eating in the lockdown during the Covid 19 pandemic; self-reported changes in eating behaviour, and associations with BMI, eating style, coping and health anxiety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we examine if COVID-19 has impacted the relationship between oil prices and stock returns predictions using daily Japanese stock market data from 01/04/2020 to 03/17/2021.

Employing an empirical model that controls for seasonal effects, return-related control variables, heteroskedasticity, persistency, and endogeneity, we demonstrate that the influence of oil prices on stock returns declined by around 89.5% due to COVID-19. This implies that when COVID-19 reduced economic activity and destabilized financial markets, the influence of oil prices on stock returns declined.

To gather broad community input through Qualtrics surveys in order to assess needs and assets, guide project prioritization, and gather feedback on previous projects. Qualtrics surveys were distributed via email to community members, stakeholders, and partners serving low-income audiences. Three surveys solicited feedback for existing Healthy Communities coalitions (n = 45);1 survey gathered initial input for a newly formed Healthy Communities coalition (n = 63). The overall response rate across all surveys was 23.6%. Survey responses to community health and engagement questions were separated by counties and analyzed through qualitative content analysis. The research team worked with Extension agents to conduct member checking through discussing survey results with participants. One hundred and eight responses were received from 4 communities. Extension agents reported high satisfaction with the process. Surveys provided action items and potential new coalition members. Across all 4 communities, common themes included acknowledging racial health disparities, a need for greater community involvement in coalition efforts, and a lack of healthy food options. Qualtrics surveys were an effective way to gather community input and allowed wider participation than would have been possible with a virtual meeting. Post-COVID, agents plan to continue to solicit community input through Qualtrics surveys, in addition to face-to-face forums. This method is a valuable tool for lower-income and rural communities.

Nonetheless, only a few studies have thus far evaluated the degree of fear of COVID-19, partially due to the lack of validated measures. In this study we evaluated the psychometric properties of the Hebrew version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), recently developed to assess different aspects of the fear of the pandemic, in a normative population of participants in Israel. Participants (n = 639) were asked to complete the FCV-19S scale, as well as to report anxiety, depression, and stress levels using validated scales. The results a unidimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S which explained 53.71% of the variance. When forcing a two-factor structure model, the analysis revealed two factors pertaining to emotional fear reactions and symptomatic expressions of fear. Gender, sociodemographic status, chronic illness, being in an at-risk group, and having a family member dying of COVID-19 were positively associated with fear of COVID-19. The measure was associated with anxiety, stress and depression. These results suggest that the FCV-19S has good psychometric properties, and can be utilized in studies assessing the effects of the pandemic on the population's mental health.","output":"Fear of COVID-19 scale: Psychometric characteristics, reliability and validity in the Israeli population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a widespread microbial technology used to treat organic waste and recover energy in the form of methane (\\"biogas\\"). While most AD systems have been designed to treat a single input, mixtures of digester sludge and solid organic waste are emerging as a means to improve efficiency and methane yield. We examined laboratory anaerobic cultures of AD sludge from two sources amended with food waste, xylose, and xylan at mesophilic temperatures, and with cellulose at meso- and thermophilic temperatures, to determine whether and how the inoculum and substrate affect biogas yield and community composition. All substrate and inoculum combinations yielded methane, with food waste most productive by mass. Pyrosequencing of transcribed bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA showed that community composition varied across substrates and inocula, with differing ratios of hydrogenotrophic/acetoclastic methanogenic archaea associated with syntrophic partners. While communities did not cluster by either inoculum or substrate, additional sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in the source sludge revealed that the bacterial communities were influenced by their inoculum. These results suggest that complete and efficient AD systems could potentially be assembled from different microbial inocula and consist of taxonomically diverse communities that nevertheless perform similar functions.","output":"Effects of sludge inoculum and organic feedstock on active microbial communities and methane yield during anaerobic digestion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the functioning of education systems in a multitude of ways.

Two newly developed specifications of spatial regression models were established successfully to estimate COVID-19 mortality rate (R(2) = 0.49 and R(2) = 0.793). The level of spatial inequalities of COVID-19 mortality is higher than that of non-COVID-19 mortality in England. Although global spatial association of COVID-19 mortality and non-COVID-19 mortality is positive, local spatial association of COVID-19 mortality and non-COVID-19 mortality is negative in some areas. Expectedly, hospital accessibility is negatively related to COVID-19 mortality rate. Percent of Asians, percent of Blacks, and unemployment rate are positively related to COVID-19 mortality rate.

Results: A 37.5% decrease in the number of consultations was seen during the lockdown period and 17.9% after the lockdown. The number of individual patients seen decreased by 34.9% during the lockdown and 11.2% after the lockdown. A significant change in the number of consultations from week 11 to week 18 occurred, followed by a gradual increase. There was a higher percentage of patients with previous psychiatric hospitalizations during the lockdown period (61.1 vs. 56.3%) and a lower percentage after the lockdown (59.7 vs. 64.7%).

A few reports from the literature suggest that Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVSTs) may be a direct complication of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical and radiological presentation of COVID-19 positive patients diagnosed with CVST. METHODS: This was a multicenter, cross-sectional, retrospective study of patients diagnosed with CVST and COVID-19 reviewed from March 1, 2020 to November 8, 2020. We evaluated their clinical presentations, risk factors, clinical management, and outcome. We reviewed all published cases of CVST in patients with COVID-19 infection from January 1, 2020 to November 13, 2020. RESULTS: There were 8 patients diagnosed with CVST and COVID-19 during the study period at 7 out of 31 participating centers. Patients in our case series were mostly female (7/8, 87.5%). Most patients presented with non-specific symptoms such as headache (50%), fever (50%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (75%). Several patients presented with focal neurologic deficits (2/8, 25%) or decreased consciousness (2/8, 25%). D-dimer and inflammatory biomarkers were significantly elevated relative to reference ranges in patients with available laboratory data. The superior sagittal and transverse sinuses were the most common sites for acute CVST formation (6/8, 75%). Median time to onset of focal neurologic deficit from initial COVID-19 diagnosis was 3 days (interquartile range 0.75-3 days). Median time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to CVST radiologic diagnosis was 11 days (interquartile range 6-16.75 days). Mortality was low in this cohort (1/8 or 12.5%).

We hypothesized that there is minimal change in fracture alignment 2 weeks after CR, and consequently, that radiographs at 4 weeks add cost but little value to clinical care. METHODS A total of 184 patients enrolled in a prospective study of pediatric forearm fractures including both distal and diaphyseal injuries were evaluated. All were treated with CR, casting, and radiographic evaluation at 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks postinjury. Primary endpoint was radiographic LOR. Secondary endpoint was need for any intervention. A modified number-needed to treat analysis estimated the utility of the week 4 x-ray in predicting intervention. Relative value unit (RVU) costing, time-derived activity-based costing (TDABC), and billing totals were used for cost analysis. RESULTS Seventy patients (38%) demonstrated radiographic LOR. Independent predictors of LOR were initial radius displacement >75% (OR=5.40; CI, 2.23-12.60), concomitant ulna fracture (OR=1.71; CI, 1.15-2.54), and dominant arm involvement (OR=2.87; CI, 1.40-5.87). Eighty percent of all LORs occurred within the first 2 weeks. There was no statistically significant change in radiographic alignment after week 2. Of 40 total interventions, all were performed within the first 2 weeks of follow-up. The 4-week x-ray did not influence decision to intervene, and at most, 1 in every 40 patients would require an intervention after week 2. Elimination of the 4-week x-ray would result in a savings of 4.8% (RVU method) to 11.9% (TDABC method) in the overall cost of nonoperative fracture care. CONCLUSIONS There is minimal change in fracture alignment 2 weeks following CR of pediatric forearm fractures, and all interventions are based on early radiographic follow-up. The week 4 x-ray adds little value to clinical decision making, and its elimination would result in savings up to 11.9% of the overall cost of nonoperative fracture care.

Notwithstanding, the efficacy of influenza vaccination varies greatly among vaccinees due to largely unknown immunological determinants, thereby dampening population-wide protection. Here, we report that dietary fibre may play a significant role in humoral vaccine responses. We found dietary fibre intake and the abundance of fibre-fermenting intestinal bacteria to be positively correlated with humoral influenza vaccine-specific immune responses in human vaccinees, albeit without reaching statistical significance. Importantly, this correlation was largely driven by first-time vaccinees; prior influenza vaccination negatively correlated with vaccine immunogenicity. In support of these observations, dietary fibre consumption significantly enhanced humoral influenza vaccine responses in mice, where the effect was mechanistically linked to short-chain fatty acids, the bacterial fermentation product of dietary fibre.

Nevertheless, a clear definition of the genetic signatures underlying the circulating variants is still missing. Here, we provide a comprehensive insight into mutational profiles characterizing each SARS-CoV-2 variant, focusing on spike mutations known to modulate viral infectivity and/or antigenicity. We focused on variants and on specific relevant mutations reported by GISAID, Nextstrain, Outbreak.info, Pango, and Stanford database websites that were associated with any clinical/diagnostic impact, according to published manuscripts. Furthermore, 1,223,338 full-length high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were retrieved from GISAID and used to accurately define the specific mutational patterns in each variant. Finally, mutations were mapped on the three-dimensional structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to assess their localization in the different spike domains. Overall, this review sheds light and assists in defining the genetic signatures characterizing the currently circulating variants and their clinical relevance. IMPORTANCE Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, several recurrent mutations, particularly in the spike protein, arose during human-to-human transmission or spillover events between humans and animals, generating distinct worrisome variants of concern (VOCs) or of interest (VOIs), designated as such due to their clinical and diagnostic impacts. Characterizing these variants and their related mutations is important in tracking SAR-CoV-2 evolution and understanding the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics based on monoclonal antibodies, convalescent-phase sera, and direct antivirals.

However, due to the intrinsic random fluctuations of the viral signal in the wastewater (due to e.g., dilution;transport and fate processes in sewer system;variation in the number of persons discharging;variations in virus excretion and water consumption per day) the subsequent prevalence analysis may result in misleading conclusions. It is thus helpful to apply data filtering techniques to reduce the noise in the signal. In this paper we investigate 13 smoothing algorithms applied to the virus signals monitored in four wastewater treatment plants in Austria.

There was a marked decrease in ED visits after COVID-19 arrived in the New York metropolitan area in the United States in early March 2020. This was likely due to public health mandates and fear of exposure to the virus. Because torsion of the ovaries or testes is usually heralded by sudden onset of severe pain, patients with these conditions may have overcome this general reluctance to go to the ED. We hypothesized that, following the arrival of COVID-19 in the New York metropolitan area, the decrease in torsion visits was less than the decrease in ED visits overall. Methods: Design: Retrospective cohort. Setting: EDs of 28 hospitals within 150 miles of New York City. Hospitals were teaching or non-teaching and rural, suburban or urban. Annual ED volumes were from 12,000 to 122,000. Population: Consecutive ED patients from March through November in 2019 and 2020. Data analysis: We tallied the number of patients diagnosed with ovarian or testicular torsion using the International Classification of Disease codes (version 10). We calculated the difference in the decrease in total visits compared to the decrease in torsion visits from 2019 to 2020, along with the 95% CI. Results: The database contained a total of 1,587,246 visits, 898,850 in 2019 and 688,396 in 2020 (a 23% decrease from 2019 to 2020). The number of patients diagnosed with torsion was 203 in 2019 and 185 in 2020 (a 9% decrease from 2019 to 2020). The median ages [IQRs] for ovarian and testicular torsion were: 28 [18-37] and 15 [13-19] years, respectively. The difference in the decrease in total visits compared to the decrease in torsion visits was 14% (95% CI:10% to 18%). Conclusions: Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that following the arrival of COVID-19 in the New York metropolitan area, the decrease in torsion visits was less than the overall decrease in ED visits. We speculate this difference was because of the sudden onset of severe pain associated with torsion. Additional studies are needed to determine if patients who have sudden onset of severe pain from other conditions had less of a decrease in visits than overall ED visits.","output":"365 Emergency Department Visits for Ovarian and Testicular Torsion After the Arrival of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious mortality in the world, affecting mainly developing countries (DC), while diabetes (DM) is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases.This review analyzes the fact that diabetes is currently an important risk factor for developing TB, also presenting more complicated TB, more relapses and higher mortality.

Previous studies have suggested that serum carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (%dCDT) levels, relative to blood alcohol levels (BALs), may better differentiate episodic binge drinkers from sustained heavy consumers in admitted patients with traumatic injury. We characterized %dCDT levels and BAL levels to differentiate binge drinkers from sustained heavy consumers in admitted trauma patients and their associations with outcomes. METHODS This prospective, cross-sectional, observational study assessed %dCDT and BAL levels in admitted male and female patients with traumatic injury (18 y) at an American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma level-1 center from July 2014 to June 2016. We designated patients with %dCDT levels 1.7% (CDT+) as chronic alcohol users and dichotomized acutely intoxicated patients using three different BAL-level thresholds. Primary outcomes included in-hospital complications, along with prolonged ventilation and intensive care unit length of stay, both defined as the top decile. Secondary outcomes included rates of drug or alcohol withdrawal and all-cause mortality. Analyses were adjusted for clinical factors. RESULTS We studied 715 patients (77.5% men, 60.6%  40 y of age, median Injury Severity Score: 14, 41.7% motor vehicle crashes, 17.9% gunshot wounds, 11.1% falls). While 31.0% were CDT+, 48.7% were BAL>0. After adjusting for CDT levels, BAL levels >0, >100, or >200 were not associated with adverse outcomes. However, CDT+ relative to patients with CDT were associated with complications (adjusted odds ratio: 1.96 [1.24-3.09]), prolonged ventilation days (3.23 [1.08-9.65]), and prolonged intensive care unit stays (2.83 [1.20-6.68]).

However, despite the possibilities to include low-cost diagnosis and viable telemedicine, digital pathology is not yet accessible owing to expensive storage, data security requirements, and network bandwidth limitations to transfer high-resolution images and associated data. The increase in storage, transmission, and security complexity concerning data collection and diagnosis makes it even more challenging to use artificial intelligence algorithms for machine-assisted disease diagnosis. We designed and prototyped a digital pathology system that uses blockchain-based smart contracts using the nonfungible token (NFT) standard and the Interplanetary File System for data storage. Our design remediates shortcomings in the existing digital pathology systems infrastructure, which is centralized. The proposed design is extendable to other fields of medicine that require high-fidelity image and data storage. Our solution is implemented in data systems that can improve access quality of care and reduce the cost of access to specialized pathological diagnosis, reducing cycle times for diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: The main objectives of this study are to highlight the issues in digital pathology and suggest that a software architectureCbased blockchain and the Interplanetary File System create a low-cost data storage and transmission technology. METHODS: We used the design science research method consisting of 6 stages to inform our design overall. We innovated over existing public-private designs for blockchains but using a 2-layered approach that separates actual file storage from metadata and data persistence. RESULTS: Here, we identified key challenges to adopting digital pathology, including challenges concerning long-term storage and the transmission of information. Next, using accepted frameworks in NFT-based intelligent contracts and recent innovations in distributed secure storage, we proposed a decentralized, secure, and privacy-preserving digital pathology system. Our design and prototype implementation using Solidity, web3.js, Ethereum, and node.js helped us address several challenges facing digital pathology. We demonstrated how our solution, which combines NFT smart contract standard with persistent decentralized file storage, solves most of the challenges of digital pathology and sets the stage for reducing costs and improving patient care and speed of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: We identified technical limitations that increase costs and reduce the mass adoption of digital pathology. We presented several design innovations using NFT decentralized storage standards to prototype a system. We also presented the implementation details of a unique security architecture for a digital pathology system. We illustrated how this design can overcome privacy, security, network-based storage, and data transmission limitations. We illustrated how improving these factors sets the stage for improving data quality and standardized application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to such data.","output":"Improving Diagnosis Through Digital Pathology: Proof-of-Concept Implementation Using Smart Contracts and Decentralized File Storage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple prognostic scores have been developed for both veno-arterial (VA) and veno-venous (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), mostly in single-center cohorts. The aim of this study was to compare and validate different prediction scores in a large multicenter ECMO-population. Methods: Data from five ECMO centers included 300 patients on VA and 329 on VV ECMO support (March 2008 to November 2016). Different prognostic scores were compared between survivors and non-survivors: APACHE II, SOFA, SAPS II in all patients; SAVE, modified SAVE and MELD-XI in VA ECMO; RESP, PRESET, ROCH and PRESERVE in VV ECMO. Model performance was compared using receiver-operating-curve analysis and assessment of model calibration. Survival was assessed at intensive care unit discharge. Results: The main indication for VA ECMO was cardiogenic shock; overall survival was 51%. ICU survivors had higher Glasgow Coma Scale scores and pH, required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) less frequently, had lower lactate levels and shorter ventilation time pre-ECMO at baseline. The best discrimination between survivors and non-survivors was observed with the SAPS II score (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.73 (95% CI 0.67C0.78)).

These efforts have aimed for an equal access to high quality learning opportunities to fulfill the increasing interest in self-paced flexible studying using digital medial technology. The emergence of COVID pandemics has highlighted these demands for these educational resources. Human gross anatomy education is one of the fields that has been impacted by recent critical situation more dramatically. Thus, it is crucial to create more educational videos in gross human anatomy and study the effects of such videos on anatomy education. OBJECTIVES This project aims for understanding the role of self-paced educational videos in education of human body anatomy with a focus on cranial cavity and its contents. METHOD A video exploring the cranial cavity and its contents for learners in professional programs was filmed and edited by Camtasia 2020 software. Different features such as labels, transitions, schematic pictures, and quiz questions were added in the editing process to enhance the students' experience. The edited video was uploaded on YouTube and shared with students taking human gross anatomy courses. The viewers were asked to complete an online survey that was designed to assess their learning experience using the video. Link to video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROGgR7mxsr8&t=107s RESULTS: The video received 2429 views, 92 likes and 29 responses to the survey from Jan 2021 to Dec 2021. Participants watched the video from different countries such as Canada, US, India, and Brazil. Analysis of the data shows that the majority of the participants who completed the online survey found the video and its features enhancing their learning of the anatomy of the human body. More specifically, 82.8% of students selected \\"to prepare for my anatomy lab\\" as their main purpose for viewing the video and 93.1% choose \\"Strongly Agree\\" when asked if the videos helped them fulfill their purpose. Moreover, on the 1-5 scale, the average score of 4.59, 4.66, 4.41, and 4.86 were given by students for the quality of labelling, transitions, quiz questions, and overall quality of the video, respectively. CONCLUSION In conclusion, the feedback received from this survey strongly suggests that using digital media is beneficial for enhancing the anatomical learning experience of students.","output":"Role of Digital Media in Enhancing Anatomical Education: A Survey Study Focused on the Cranial Cavity and Its Contents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wireless body area networks (WBANs) have strong potential in the field of health monitoring. However, the energy consumption required for accurate monitoring determines the time between battery charges of the wearable sensors, which is a key performance factor (and can be critical in the case of implantable devices). In this paper, we study the inherent trade-off between the power consumption of the sensors and the probability of misclassifying a patients health state. We formulate this trade-off as a dynamic problem, in which at each step, we can choose to activate a subset of sensors that provide noisy measurements of the patients health state. We assume that the (unknown) health state follows a Markov chain, so our problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision problem (POMDP). We show that all the past measurements can be summarized as a belief state on the true health state of the patient, which allows tackling the POMDP problem as an MDP on the belief state. Then, we empirically study the performance of a greedy one-step look-ahead policy compared to the optimal policy obtained by solving the dynamic program. For that purpose, we use an open-source Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) dataset of 232 patients over six months and extract the transition matrix and sensor accuracies from the data. We find that the greedy policy saves 50% of the energy costs while reducing the misclassification costs by less than 2% compared to the most accurate policy possible that always activates all sensors. Our sensitivity analysis reveals that the greedy policy remains nearly optimal across different cost parameters and a varying number of sensors. The results also have practical importance, because while the optimal policy is too complicated, a greedy one-step look-ahead policy can be easily implemented in WBAN systems.","output":"Wireless Body Area Network Control Policies for Energy-Efficient Health Monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since HIV was first identified, and in a relatively short period of time, AIDS has become one of the most devastating infectious diseases of the 21st century. Classical antiretroviral therapies were a major step forward in disease treatment options, significantly improving the survival rates of HIV-infected individuals. Even though these therapies have greatly improved HIV clinical outcomes, antiretrovirals (ARV) feature biopharmaceutic and pharmacokinetic problems such as poor aqueous solubility, short half-life, and poor penetration into HIV reservoir sites, which contribute to the suboptimal efficacy of these regimens. To overcome some of these issues, novel nanotechnology-based strategies for ARV delivery towards HIV viral reservoirs have been proposed. The current review is focused on the benefits of using lipid-based nanocarriers for tuning the physicochemical properties of ARV to overcome biological barriers upon administration. Furthermore, a correlation between these properties and the potential therapeutic outcomes has been established.

Effective vaccination against HPAI H5N1 would protect commercial poultry and would thus provide an important control measure by reducing the likelihood of bird-to-bird and bird-to-human transmission. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study we evaluated the vaccine potential of recombinant soluble trimeric subtype 5 hemagglutinin (sH5(3)) produced in mammalian cells. The secreted, purified sH5(3) was biologically active as demonstrated by its binding to ligands in a sialic acid-dependent manner. It was shown to protect chickens, in a dose-dependent manner, against a lethal challenge with H5N1 after a single vaccination. Protected animals did not shed challenge virus as determined by a quantitative RT-PCR on RNA isolated from trachea and cloaca swabs. Also in mice, vaccination with sH5(3) provided complete protection against challenge with HPAI H5N1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that sH5(3) constitutes an attractive vaccine antigen for protection of chickens and mammals against HPAI H5N1.

Rational functions are hard to approach from an point-plotting perspective, and it has been suggested that students may be able to understand these functions better by \\"identifying their algebraic features such as zeros, asymptotes, turning points, and y-intercepts\\" (Watson, Jones, and Pratt 2013, p. 193).

A subgroup of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive cases was tested for IgM antibodies by proteome array method. RESULTS: All specificity and cross-reactivity specimens were negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (0/795, 0%). Positive agreement of IgG with PCR was 83% of samples confirmed to be more than 14 days from symptom onset, with less than 100% sensitivity attributable to a case with severe immunosuppression. Virus-specific IgM was positive in a higher proportion of cases less than 3 days from symptom onset. No association was observed between mild and severe disease course with respect to IgG and IgM levels. CONCLUSIONS: The studied SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay had 100% specificity and no adverse cross-reactivity. Measures of IgG and IgM antibodies did not predict disease severity in our patient population.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Responses Do Not Predict COVID-19 Disease Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are RNA viruses that have become a major public health concern since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2002 The continuous evolution of coronaviruses was further highlighted with the emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012 Currently, the world is concerned about the 2019 novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) that was initially identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019 Patients presented with severe viral pneumonia and respiratory illness The number of cases has been mounting since then As of late February 2020, tens of thousands of cases and several thousand deaths have been reported in China alone, in addition to thousands of cases in other countries Although the fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is currently lower than SARS-CoV, the virus seems to be highly contagious based on the number of infected cases to date In this review, we discuss structure, genome organization, entry of CoVs into target cells, and provide insights into past and present outbreaks The future of human CoV outbreaks will not only depend on how the viruses will evolve, but will also depend on how we develop efficient prevention and treatment strategies to deal with this continuous threat","output":"Insights into the Recent 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Light of Past Human Coronavirus Outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The enhanced removal of viruses in wastewater treatments plant is important due to concerns about public health.

The infection risk from SARS CoV-2, the high mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the duration of the pandemic have created sustained and often traumatic stressors affecting HCW and FR. Objectives: To assess the relationship of COVID-19 stressor frequency scores to psychiatric rating scale scores amongst HCW and FR. To determine if psychiatric rating scale scores mediate stressor effects on perceived work function and likelihood of remaining in current occupation. Design: Observational, self-report in a convenience sample Participants: 118 HCW and FR caring for COVID-19 patients in the United States. Main Measure: COVID-19 related stressor frequencies were assessed using a 17-item questionnaire. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed with the PTSD Checklist 5 (PCL5), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (for depression) (PHQ9), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7). Key Results: Stressor frequency scores correlated significantly with PCL5 scores (R=.57, p<1e-8), PHQ scores (R=.35, P<.001), ISI scores (R=.38, p<1e-4), and GAD7 scores (R=.39, p<.001), likelihood of staying in current occupation (R=-.39,p<1e-4), and trouble doing usual work (R=.33,p<.001). 51% of HCW and 44% of FR indicated decreased likelihood of staying in their current occupation. PCL5 scores substantially mediated the association between stress frequency scores and work function impairment. Conclusions: These results direct attention to recognizing potentially treatable psychiatric symptoms, particularly those of PTSD, in HCW and FR experiencing COVID-19 related stressors. They also suggest that mitigating COVID-19 related stressors when possible, such as by providing adequate personal protective equipment, can improve HCW and FR mental health, work function and retention in the health care work force.","output":"The impact of working during the Covid-19 pandemic on health care workers and first responders: mental health, function, and professional retention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy predominantly using stent retrievers have been shown to effectively restore cerebral blood flow and improve functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke. We sought to determine the safety and feasibility of mechanical thrombectomy using the new ERIC retrieval device. MATERIALS AND METHODS We identified 36 consecutive patients from our Stroke Center registry with acute ischemic stroke who were treated with the new ERIC retriever from September 2013 to December 2014. Patients with ischemic stroke meeting the following criteria were eligible: onset-to-treatment time of 4.5 hours or wake-up stroke (n = 10) with relevant CT perfusion mismatch, NIHSS score of 4, and proof of large-vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation on CT angiography. We assessed the baseline characteristics including age, sex, comorbidities, stroke severity, site of vessel occlusion, presence of tissue at risk, and treatment-related parameters such as onset-to-treatment time, recanalization grade, and outcome. RESULTS The mean age was 70  13 years, and the median NIHSS score on admission was 18 (interquartile range, 10-20). Seventeen of 36 patients were on platelet inhibitors or anticoagulants before endovascular treatment (47.2%); 20 patients received intravenous thrombolysis (55.5%). The ERIC was used as the sole retriever in 28 patients (77.8%) and as a rescue device in 8. Excellent recanalization was achieved in 30/36 patients (83.3%) with TICI 3 in 19/36 and 2b in 11/36, respectively. Median procedural time in these patients was 90 minutes (interquartile range, 58-133 minutes). No intraprocedural complications occurred.

At the time scientific excavation, sampling and analysis methods were either under-developed or did not exist. In this paper we present the first results of new excavations at Palegawra conducted in 2016C2017 by the Eastern Fertile Crescent (EFEC) project, a research collaboration of the University of Liverpool and the Sulaymaniyah Directorate of Antiquities and Heritage. Our research has produced the first radiometric evidence pushing back the chronology of the NW Zagros Epipalaeolithic to the Last Glacial Maximum, thus fully aligning it with Epipalaeolithic facies until now known only from the Levant and the south Anatolian coast. We have also unearthed, for the first time in the Palaeolithic of the Zagros, direct archaeobotanical evidence for hitherto elusive Zarzian plant exploitation and the vegetation of the NW Zagros piedmont zone from the LGM to the end of the Lateglacial (~19,600C13,000 cal BP). The new Palegawra chronology alongside our detailed studies of its material culture and faunal and botanical assemblages suggest that the prevailing Epipalaeolithic habitation pattern in the NW Zagros (centred on generalised persistent occupations of small caves and rock-shelters alongside task-oriented ephemeral open-air campsites) remained an enduring characteristic of the Zarzian horizon throughout this period. The Palegawra data clearly show that neither resource levels and climate conditions nor geographic and/or cultural isolation provide adequate explanations for the stability and longevity of Zarzian lifeways during this long timespan. More fieldwork is required, including the discovery, excavation and intensive sampling of other Zarzian sites, for reaching a data-informed understanding of the nature and evolution of the NW Zagros Epipalaeolithic.","output":"The Zagros Epipalaeolithic revisited: New excavations and (14)C dates from Palegawra cave in Iraqi Kurdistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lung ultrasound score (LUS) as well as radiographic assessment of lung edema (RALE) score as calculated from chest radiography (CXR) have been applied to assess Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) severity. CXRs, which are frequently performed in ARDS patients, pose a greater risk of radiation exposure to patients and health care staff. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate if LUS had a better correlation to oxygenation (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) compared with the RALE score in ARDS patients. We also aimed to analyse if there was a correlation between RALE score and LUS. We wanted to determine the LUS and RALE score cut-off, which could predict a prolonged length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (10 days) and survival. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients aged above 18 years with ARDS as per Berlin definition and admitted to the ICU were included in the study. It was a retrospective study done over a period of 11 months. On the day of admission to ICU, the global and basal LUS, global and basal RALE score, and PaO(2) /FiO(2) were recorded. Outcome and days of ICU stay were noted. RESULTS: Global LUS score and PaO(2)/FiO(2) showed the best negative correlation (r = C0.491), which was significant (p = 0.002), followed by global RALE score and PaO(2)/FiO(2) (r = C0.422, p = 0.009). Basal LUS and PaO(2)/FiO(2) also had moderate negative correlation (r = C0.334, p = 0.043) followed by basal RALE score and PaO(2)/FiO(2) (r = C0.34, p = 0.039). Global RALE score and global LUS did not show a significant correlation. Similarly, there was no significant correlation between basal RALE score and basal LUS. Global and basal LUS as well as global and basal RALE score were not beneficial in predicting either a prolonged length of ICU stay or survival as the area under curve was low. CONCLUSION: In ARDS patients, global LUS had the best correlation to oxygenation (PaO(2)/FiO(2)), followed by global RALE score. Basal LUS and basal RALE score also had moderate correlation to oxygenation.

This limitation is particularly concerning as preliminary data indicate that veterans may experience a higher rate of mortality compared to their civilian counterparts.

Indeed, findings from a recent meta-analysis highlight the association between lifetime smoking status and COVID-19 progression to more severe or critical conditions including death. Notably, prevalence rates of tobacco use are higher among veterans than civilians. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to examine demographic and medical variables that may contribute to likelihood of death among veterans testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we examined the unique influence of lifetime tobacco use on veteran mortality when added to the complete model. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted on 440 veterans (80.5% African American/Black) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (7.3% deceased) at a large, southeastern Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital between March 11, 2020 and April 23, 2020, with data analysis occurring from May 26, 2020 to June 5, 2020. Older age, male gender, immunodeficiency, endocrine, and pulmonary diseases were positively related to the relative risk of death among SARS-CoV-2 positive veterans, with lifetime tobacco use predicting veteran mortality above and beyond these variables.

Inspired by these works, we propose a hierarchical framework that integrates online learning for the Mb-trajectory optimization with off-policy methods for the Mf-RL. In particular, two loops are proposed, where the Dynamic Mirror Descent based Model Predictive Control (DMD-MPC) is used as the inner loop to obtain an optimal sequence of actions. These actions are in turn used to significantly accelerate the outer loop Mf-RL. We show that our formulation is generic for a broad class of MPC based policies and objectives, and includes some of the well-known Mb-Mf approaches. Based on the framework we define two algorithms to increase sample efficiency of Off Policy RL and to guide end to end RL algorithms for online adaption respectively. Thus we finally introduce two novel algorithms: Dynamic-Mirror Descent Model Predictive RL(DeMoRL), which uses the method of elite fractions for the inner loop and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) as the off-policy RL for the outer loop and Dynamic-Mirror Descent Model Predictive Layer(DeMo Layer), a special case of the hierarchical framework which guides linear policies trained using Augmented Random Search(ARS). Our experiments show faster convergence of the proposed DeMo RL, and better or equal performance compared to other Mf-Mb approaches on benchmark MuJoCo control tasks.

METHODS Pretreatment digital subtraction angiograms and post-treatment noncontrast enhanced computed tomographic scans from the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands) trial were evaluated for areas lacking capillary blush and with tissue hypodensity, respectively. Because the superior and middle zones of the CIS correspond to the 7 cerebral cortex regions of the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT (ASPECT) score, capillary blush was scored in these 2 zones (0-2), called sub-CIS, and compared with the ASPECT score in these 7 regions (0-7), called hypodensity score. The presence and extent of hypodensity were compared between sub-CIS zones with contingency tables and nonparametric comparisons between groups, respectively. RESULTS On the basis of a sample size of 50 subjects, 100% with sub-CIS <2 had the presence of hypodensity (hypodensity score 1) versus 57% for sub-CIS=2 (P=0.004). The extent of hypodensity (numeric hypodensity score) was significantly lower for sub-CIS=2 than 0 or 1 (P=0.02). For 42 subjects with revascularization data, the presence and extent of hypodensity were significantly lower for sub-CIS=2 plus good revascularization than for other combinations of sub-CIS and revascularization (P=0.02 and 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The absence of capillary blush on pretreatment digital subtraction angiogram seems to correspond to nonviable cerebral tissue. Successful revascularization reduces the chance of tissue hypodensity (infarction), when capillary blush is present. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.trialregister.nl.

Current research efforts are focused on the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to propose drug-based therapeutic options. Transcriptional changes due to epigenetic regulation are key host cell responses to viral infection and have been studied in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV; however, such changes are not fully described for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we analyzed multiple transcriptomes obtained from cell lines infected with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, and from COVID-19 patient-derived samples. Using integrative analyses of gene co-expression networks and de-novo pathway enrichment, we characterize different gene modules and protein pathways enriched with Transcription Factors or Epifactors relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified EP300, MOV10, RELA, and TRIM25 as top candidates, and more than 60 additional proteins involved in the epigenetic response during viral infection that has therapeutic potential.

This aesthetic labor is presented to women as freely chosen and empowering. Brazilian waxing is exemplary aesthetic labor directed at the self. Academic literature on aesthetic labor in general, and Brazilian waxing in particular, looks at white and middle-class women, as this category of women is considered the putative subject of postfeminism. Little attention is paid to racialized women from the global south who perform aesthetic labor on other womens bodies in the global north. In this paper, I draw on my ethnographic study of two beauty salons in London run by South Asian women to argue that these South Asian beauticians are postfeminist subjects as well. The aim of challenging the putative subject of postfeminism, using the example of Brazilian waxing, is not merely to include South Asian women in the discourse, but to advance a transnational theorization of postfeminism. Such theorization, I demonstrate, leads to a better understanding of how postfeminism is implicated in global structures of power as well as the affective qualities of postfeminism including intimacy and disgust.","output":"I Like it Clean: Brazilian Waxing and Postfeminist Subjectivity Among South Asian Beauticians in London"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with a dismal 5-year survival rate of 15%. The TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) classification system for lung cancer is a vital guide for determining treatment and prognosis. Despite the importance of accuracy in lung cancer staging, however, correct staging remains a challenging task for many radiologists. The new 7th edition of the TNM classification system features a number of revisions, including subdivision of tumor categories on the basis of size, differentiation between local intrathoracic and distant metastatic disease, recategorization of malignant pleural or pericardial disease from stage III to stage IV, reclassification of separate tumor nodules in the same lung and lobe as the primary tumor from T4 to T3, and reclassification of separate tumor nodules in the same lung but not the same lobe as the primary tumor from M1 to T4. Radiologists must understand the details set forth in the TNM classification system and be familiar with the changes in the 7th edition, which attempts to better correlate disease with prognostic value and treatment strategy. By recognizing the relevant radiologic appearances of lung cancer, understanding the appropriateness of staging disease with the TNM classification system, and being familiar with potential imaging pitfalls, radiologists can make a significant contribution to treatment and outcome in patients with lung cancer.","output":"Lung cancer staging essentials: the new TNM staging system and potential imaging pitfalls."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract We report new sensing element based on double-etched porous silicon (DEPSi) for sensitive detection of influenza viruses (H1N1).

In European countries and almost everywhere else in the world, people are confined to their homes in view of the imminent situation, producing reduced mobility to essential activities. This lockdown has had repercussions at different levels: (i) Inaccessibility to face-to-face healthcare, including the loss of multidisciplinary support programs for chronic pain patients. (ii) Physical reduction or inactivity due to overloaded childcare and housework, lack of space or online resources for practice, and/or as a consequence of unrefreshing sleep. (iii) Feelings of loneliness, loss of social support, uncertainty in the provision of health care if needed, and fear of contagion when exposed to open environments for essential activities, among others. (iv) Permanent or temporary loss of employment, implementation of teleworking or remote work, modifying the usual spaces of work occupation, and the interpersonal relationships inherent to this activity. (v) Vulnerability, especially in elderly population groups, associated with exposure to a large amount of information from reliable or unreliable sources, making it difficult to understand, and make decisions. (vi) Loss of family members and relatives without the social support inherent to these events. The sum of all of them entails a series of consequences in the lives of citizens that do not go unnoticed. The use of telerehabilitation offers the possibility of providing an accesible therapeutic context (assessment, treatment, and follow-up) in situations that limit patient's relationship with the environment such as the confinement suffered.

Vitamin-D has known immune modulatory effects and deficiency has been linked to increased severity of viral infections. METHODS: We evaluated patients admitted with confirmed SARS-COV-2 to our hospital between March-June 2020. Demographics and outcomes were assessed for those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with normal (>50 nmol/L) and low (<50 nmol/L) vitamin-D. RESULTS: There were 646 SARS-COV-2 PCR positive hospitalisations and 165 (25.5%) had plasma vitamin-D levels. Fifty patients were admitted to ICU. There was no difference in vitamin-D levels of those hospitalised (34, IQR 18.5-66 nmol/L) and those admitted to the ICU (31.5, IQR 21-42 nmol/L). Higher proportion of vitamin-D deficiency (<50 nmol/L) noted in the ICU group (82.0 vs. 65.2%). Among the ICU patients, low vitamin D level (<50 nmol/L) was associated with younger age (57 vs. 67 years, p=0.04) and lower cycle threshold (CT) real time polymerase chain reaction values (RT-PCR) (26.96 vs. 33.6, p=0.02) analogous to higher viral loads. However, there were no significant differences in ICU clinical outcomes (invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury and mechanical ventilation and hospital days) between patients with low and normal vitamin-D levels.

The results of a primary survey showed that the majority of test centres in Europe opted to implement the traditional paper-based format of the HSK during the Covid-19 pandemic, despite the availability of the HSK Home Edition. Concerns related to technical and security issues were among the major factors that hindered successful implementation of the Home Edition. Of the test centres that utilised the Home Edition, they rated their overall experience as satisfactory.

Many surgeons found themselves simultaneously managing surgical pathology, concerns of exposure, and limited resources. This led to challenging decisions regarding relative patient and case urgency. PURPOSE: 1. Define through expert opinion the relative urgency of prototypical pediatric arthroscopic surgical cases 2. Define current practices regarding pre-surgical testing and findings relevant to the recent, current, and potentially forthcoming challenges inherent to the COVID-19 pandemic. We further gathered information regarding variability of current practices and access to resources. METHODS: A mixed-methods survey was performed of the POSNA membership, specific to surgeons identifying as sub-specialized in pediatric sports medicine. A clinical vignette style survey was developed by the POSNA QSVI: Sports Committee. Cases included patients with a: meniscal tear, a bucket handle meniscus tear, ACL tear, unstable osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) lesion of the knee, locked knee due to a loose body, OCD of the capitellum, recurrent and primary shoulder instability, traumatic patellar instability with a loose osteochondral fragment, and a patient with a symptomatic discoid meniscus. The survey further asked how resource limitations could impact surgical decision-making, and how pre-operative testing might impact surgical timing and decisions. Information regarding personal and institutional experiences and limitations during the first 6 months of the pandemic was also collected. RESULTS: There were 119 survey respondents, of whom 54 met inclusion criteria. Seventy-five percent were primarily based at a university or academic hospital. Almost 56% of respondents had all scheduled cases cancelled for 4-7 weeks, 22% for 8-11 weeks, and 17% were shut down for more than 12 weeks. Forty-two percent followed guidance from an orthopaedic governing body, most commonly national orthopaedic organizations. There was significant variation in pre-operative testing protocols, ranging from screening questions to PCR testing and rapid testing. Triaging factors chosen by respondents for determining relative urgency, in order, were: Diagnosis, severity of symptoms/pathology, duration of symptoms, age, activity level, originally planned surgical date, and patient request. Each clinical vignette elicited variability in responses, but each had clear leaders in opinion regarding relative urgency. Most cases had more than 2/3 of respondents in relative agreement with respect to urgency. CONCLUSION: This study provides comparative details of the challenges and resource limitations experienced in pediatric sports medicine, and provides much-needed sub-specialty opinions on standards with respect to relative urgency and triaging for related cases. These experiences and opinions may be of benefit when advocating for patient access and care.","output":"The Effects of The Covid-19 Pandemic on Pediatric Orthopaedic Sports Medicine & Arthroscopy: Practice Implications, and The Management and Triaging of Surgical Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the sleep patterns among young West Balkan adults during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING Cross-sectional study conducted using an anonymous online questionnaire based on established sleep questionnaires Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (February-August 2021). PARTICIPANTS Young adults of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia. RESULTS Of 1058 subjects, mean age was 28.199.29 years; majority were women (81.4%) and students (61.9%). Compared with before the pandemic, 528 subjects (49.9%) reported a change in sleeping patterns during the pandemic, with 47.3% subjects reporting sleeping less. Mean sleeping duration during the COVID-19 pandemic was 7.712.14 hours with median sleep latency of 20 (10.0-30.0) min. Only 91 (8.6%) subjects reported consuming sleeping medications. Of all, 574 (54.2%) subjects had ISI score >7, with majority (71.2%) having subthreshold insomnia, and 618 (58.4%) PSQI score 5, thus indicating poor sleep quality. Of 656 (62.0%) tested subjects, 464 (43.9%) were COVID-19 positive (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) who were 48.8%, next to women (70%), more likely to have insomnia symptoms; and 66.9% were more likely to have poor sleep quality. Subjects using sleep medication were 44 times, and subjects being positive to ISI 15.36 times more likely to have poor sleep quality. In contrast, being a student was a negative independent predictor for both insomnia symptoms and poor sleep quality, and mental labour and not working were negative independent predictors for insomnia symptoms. CONCLUSIONS During the third wave of the pandemic, sleep patterns were impaired in about half of young West Balkan adults, with COVID-19-positive subjects and being women as positive independent predictors and being a student as negative independent predictor of impaired sleep pattern. Due to its importance in long-term health outcomes, sleep quality in young adults, especially COVID-19-positive ones, should be thoroughly assessed.","output":"Sleep quality and patterns of young West Balkan adults during the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical education has changed focus to a more learner-centred model, placing learners at the centre of innovations in training.

RESULTS The percent of the US population with at least one restoration (65.8  1.4) was relatively constant in 2011-2016. Among those with restored teeth, the mean number of teeth with amalgam restorations increased with age from 4.71 among 15-24 year olds to 7.03 among those 75 years. Non-Hispanic Whites with restored teeth had the highest mean of teeth with amalgam restorations (5.94), while non-Hispanic Blacks had the lowest (5.08).

DESIGN Convergence triangulation mixed-methods study design. Associations were examined between receiving the school feeding intervention and children's outcomes using multivariable regression models. Quantitative data were complemented with interviews and focus group discussions with parents and staff. SETTING In vulnerable communities in Lebanon, the World Food Programme has implemented an emergency SFP targeting Lebanese (attending morning sessions) and Syrian refugee children (attending afternoon sessions) attending public schools. PARTICIPANTS Children from ten intervention schools (Morning n=403; Afternoon n=379) and ten matched control schools (Morning n=399; Afternoon n=401), as well as 29 parents and 22 school staff members. RESULTS Diet diversity was higher in intervention schools as compared to control with a significantly higher consumption of dairy, nuts and fruit in both sessions. Child-reported food insecurity experience was lower in children attending the afternoon session of intervention vs control schools. The SFP intervention was associated with higher school engagement and sense of school community in the morning session only. While the SFP was significantly associated with higher attendance for children in afternoon sessions only, it was significantly associated with school retention of children in both sessions. CONCLUSIONS A daily healthy snack potentially acts as an incentive to improve children's nutritional outcomes, school engagement, sense of belonging, equality between students and improvement in children's attendance and retention in public schools.","output":"Does a school snack make a difference?

The potential involvement of COVID-19 in central nervous system (CNS) has attracted considerable attention due to neurological manifestations presented throughout the disease process. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is structurally similar to SARS-CoV, and both bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter human cells. Thus, cells expressing ACE2, such as neurons and glial cells may act as targets and are thus vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we have reviewed the neurological characteristics of COVID-19 and summarized possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the CNS. COVID-19 patients have presented with a number of different neurological symptoms such as headache, dizziness, hyposmia, and hypogeusia during the course of illness. It has also been reported recently that some cases of COVID-19 have presented with concurrent acute cerebrovascular disease (acute ischemic stroke, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage), meningitis/encephalitis, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and acute GuillainCBarr syndrome. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in a cerebrospinal fluid specimen of a patient with COVID-19 have provided direct evidence to support the theory of neurotropic involvement of SARS-CoV-2. However, the underlying neurotropic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 are yet to be established. SARS-CoV-2 may affect CNS through two direct mechanisms (hematogenous dissemination or neuronal retrograde dissemination) or via indirect routes.

BACKGROUND Nurses can be trusted, especially in these chaotic times, to provide trustworthy information on C-19. Publicly expressed gratitude to nurses does little to improve work environments made more precarious by C-19. Practical support may help retain nurses in the health system. DISCUSSION Public trust in governments has dissipated during the pandemic. People are confused by inconsistent and contentious information and services. Publishing practices that produce low-quality publications undermine scientific information and impede the flow of high-quality research information. CONCLUSION Science can advise on a pathway through the risks of C-19 but it is politicians and government officials who decide policy on whether to accept the science and set the level of acceptable risk to the general public. Problematic publishing and communication pathways for essential information contribute to public uncertainty and undermine trust in vaccines, public health strategies, and immigration and quarantine policies. IMPLICATIONS Nurse safety needs to be central to policy deliberations that affect transmission or spending on infection risk reduction. Policies that put nurses at increased risk encourage those with a choice, to abandon unsafe health system employment. Research quality systems that improve research communication pathways to support practice are urgently needed. Nurses rely on research information sources for credible evidence to support their clinical practice. Risk-shifting is the unintended consequence of government policy on vaccination, immigration, international travel, quarantine and screening for C-19. Governments must accept their role in generating public mistrust of vaccines and not judge people's decisions made on the basis of information available.

The study explored vaccination attitudes and hesitancy with regard to seasonal influenza and the anticipated Covid-19 vaccines among healthcare professionals and students. Methods: Anonymous questionnaires were distributed through electronic mail to healthcare professionals working in Malta's Health Division, at University of Malta, and in community pharmacies, and to members of Malta College of Family Doctors. Results: The response rate was 18.60% (n = 1802). The percentages of those who took the influenza vaccine last year (2019) and who will take it this year (2020) increased across professionals, highest for family doctors and lowest for trainees in family medicine. The proportion of those likelier to take the Covid-19 vaccine was directly related to likelihood of taking influenza vaccination. Both family doctor trainees and nurses showed the highest Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy. Concerns pertaining to COVID-19 vaccination were mostly related to insufficient knowledge, although pharmacists (community, academic and students) were concerned about the rapid approval of the vaccine. Conclusion: An increase in influenza vaccine uptake is expected in view of the current Covid-19 pandemic. Of concern is the hesitancy towards Covid-19 vaccine particular within healthcare professionals, a cohort expected to be insightful and potential role models for the community. The associated hesitancy for both COVID-19 and influenza vaccination infers an intrinsic degree of vaccine hesitancy, which brings forward the need for healthcare professionals to be engaged in education, vaccination policies and administration in order to ensure compliance.

Most of these visualizations lack reproducibility, credibility, or accuracy, and are static, which makes it difficult to analyze the spread over time. Furthermore, most current visualizations depicting the spread of COVID-19 are at a global or country level, meaning there is a dearth of regional analysis within a country. Keeping these issues in mind, a replicable, efficient, and simple method to generate regional COVID-19 visualizations mapped with time was created by using the KNIME software, an open-source data analytics platform that can create user-friendly applications or workflows. For this analysis, Albania, Sweden, Ukraine, Denmark, Russia, India, and Australia were closely observed. Among the maps generated for the aforementioned countries, it was noticed that regions with a high population or high population density were often the epicenters within their respective country. The regions caused the virus to spread to their neighboring regions: kickstarting the \\"domino effect\\", leading to the infection of another region until the country is overwhelmed with cases-what we call a proximity trend. These dynamic maps are crucial to fighting the pandemic because they can provide insight as to how COVID-19 spreads by providing researchers or officials with an accurate and insightful tool to aid their analysis.

HOFN can lead to the spread of ineffective and even harmful remedies. The study aims to understand Internet users' responses to HOFN during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic using the protective action decision model (PADM). Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected pandemic severity data (regional number of confirmed cases) from government websites of the USA and China (Studies 1 and 2), search behavior from Google and Baidu search engines (Studies 1 and 2) and data regarding trust in two online fake news stories from two national surveys (Studies 2 and 3). All data were analyzed using a multi-level linear model. Findings: The research detected negative time-lagged relationships between pandemic severity and regional HOFN search behavior by three actual fake news stories from the USA and China (Study 1). Importantly, trust in HOFN served as a mediator in the time-lagged relationship between pandemic severity and search behavior (Study 2). Additionally, the relationship between pandemic severity and trust in HOFN varied according to individuals' perceived control (Study 3). Originality/value: The authors' results underscore the important role of PADM in understanding Internet users' trust in and search for HOFN. When people trust HOFN, they may seek more information to implement further protective actions. Importantly, it appears that trust in HOFN varies with environmental cues (regional pandemic severity) and with individuals' perceived control, providing insight into developing coping strategies during a pandemic. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Health-related fake news during the COVID-19 pandemic: perceived trust and information search"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The current new SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had a profound impact on medical practice.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: An online cross-sectional survey was administered to stakeholders of the telerehabilitation program: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, health care professionals including pulmonary care physicians, rehabilitation nurses and physiotherapists. The survey sought to ascertain the causes, barriers, and facilitators associated with the implementation of smartphone-based telerehabilitation, as well as strategies for practice improvement. RESULTS: While 71% (n = 37/52) of the 52 healthcare professionals surveyed were aware of smartphone-based telerehabilitation, implementation was found to be extremely low (n = 4/37; 10%). The majority of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 21/30; 70%) agreed to accept smartphone-based telerehabilitation as one of their treatment options. In India, challenges to efficient telerehabilitation implementation included a lack of infrastructure, perceived time consumption, a lack of expertise and training, organizational support, and perceived inefficacy. CONCLUSION: While knowledge of smartphone-based telerehabilitation is high among healthcare professionals and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, implementation of this novel intervention measure has been limited due to perceived constraints associated with smartphone-based telerehabilitation.

With specific regard to the use of face protections for medical purposes, from the beginning of the XVII century onwards in Europe physicians in charge of curing patients with plague wore a complicated, and subsequently typical, costume. The face mask included eye sockets of glass and leather headdresses with long, pointed beaks. These beaks were filled with scented spices, aromatic substances and perfumes to filter out the plague and to mask \\"bad air\\", which was considered to be the vehicle of the disease. In the XVIII and XIX centuries a number of advances regarding personal protection devices in health care were achieved. In the course of the 1918 influenza pandemic (Spanish flu), health care professionals began to use face masks in a routine way to protect themselves and their patients. From the sixties (XX century) onwards, the explosion of health care technology has led to a continuous refinement in the study of individual protection devices, also because, even in the presence of an increasing number of powerful antimicrobial agents, infectious diseases have remained dominant during these last decades. It is not by chance, therefore, that one of the consequences of the 2020 ongoing COVID-19 pandemic should be the fact that face masks have become essential again both inside and outside health care environments. Even if more than a century has passed from Fluegge's historical definition of bacteria-laden droplets, the role of certain medical-preventive achievements of the past, including the paradigmatic model of protective face masks, continues to remain pivotal in this third millennium.","output":"Protective face masks through centuries, from XVII century plague doctors to current health care professionals managing the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To prepare students to address water-related challenges, undergraduate STEM education must provide them with opportunities to learn and reason about water issues.

The course focuses on both disciplinary concepts and civic engagement, and is designed around a variety of interactive, research-based practices to support students learning, engagement with authentic data, scientific models and modeling, and collaboration and learning among peers. This study aims to evaluate, how have student outcomes and perceptions changed over five years of the course?. The results are based on data from students (n = 326) in five consecutive years of the course, during which time the course transitioned from a face-to-face model to fully asynchronous online model due, in part, to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The particularly rapid and abrupt transition between 2020 and 2021 in response to COVID-19 led to many course changes, including modes of communication between instructors and students and opportunities for collaboration. Here, multiple measures are used to evaluate students learning about water concepts, model-based reasoning about socio-hydrologic systems, and perceptions of the course across all five years. By the end of each iteration of the course, students improved their knowledge of hydrologic concepts, independent of the course format or other student-level variables.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) underscores the need to innovate and accelerate the development of effective vaccination strategies against EIDs. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules play a central role in the immune system by determining the peptide repertoire displayed to the T-cell compartment. Genetic polymorphisms of the HLA system thus confer a strong variability in vaccine-induced immune responses and may complicate the selection of vaccine candidates, because the distribution and frequencies of HLA alleles are highly variable among different ethnic groups. Herein, we build on the emerging paradigm of rational epitope-based vaccine design, by describing an immunoinformatics tool (Predivac-3.0) for proteome-wide T-cell epitope discovery that accounts for ethnic-level variations in immune responsiveness. Predivac-3.0 implements both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitope predictions based on HLA allele frequencies retrieved from the Allele Frequency Net Database. The tool was thoroughly assessed, proving comparable performances (AUC ~0.9) against four state-of-the-art pan-specific immunoinformatics methods capable of population-level analysis (NetMHCPan-4.0, Pickpocket, PSSMHCPan and SMM), as well as a strong accuracy on proteome-wide T-cell epitope predictions for HIV-specific immune responses in the Japanese population. The utility of the method was investigated for the COVID-19 pandemic, by performing in silico T-cell epitope mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein according to the ethnic context of the countries where the ChAdOx1 vaccine is currently initiating phase III clinical trials. Potentially immunodominant CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitopes and population coverages were predicted for each population (the Epitope Discovery mode), along with optimized sets of broadly recognized (promiscuous) T-cell epitopes maximizing coverage in the target populations (the Epitope Optimization mode). Population-specific epitope-rich regions (T-cell epitope clusters) were further predicted in protein antigens based on combined criteria of epitope density and population coverage. Overall, we conclude that Predivac-3.0 holds potential to contribute in the understanding of ethnic-level variations of vaccine-induced immune responsiveness and to guide the development of epitope-based next-generation vaccines against emerging pathogens, whose geographic distributions and populations in need of vaccinations are often well-defined for regional epidemics.","output":"A Proteome-Wide Immunoinformatics Tool to Accelerate T-Cell Epitope Discovery and Vaccine Design in the Context of Emerging Infectious Diseases: An Ethnicity-Oriented Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper co-authored by M.

Although such measures may be effective in reducing the importation of COVID-19, the mental health implications remain unclear. AIMS: This study sought to assess mental well-being and factors associated with changes in mental health in individuals subject to mandatory quarantine following travel. METHOD: Travellers arriving at a large, urban international airport completed online questionnaires on arrival and days 7 and 14 of mandated quarantine. Questionnaire items, such as travel history, mental health, attitudes toward COVID-19, and protection behaviours, were drawn from the World Health Organization Survey Tool for COVID-19. RESULTS: There was a clinically significant decline in mental health over the course of quarantine among the 10 965 eligible participants. Poor mental health was reported by 5.1% of participants on arrival and 26% on day 7 of quarantine. Factors associated with a greater decline in mental health were younger age, female gender, negative views toward quarantine measures and engaging in fewer COVID-19 prevention behaviours.

CONCLUSIONS: Although the widespread use of quarantine may be effective in limiting the spread of COVID-19, the mental health implications are profound and have largely been ignored in policy decisions.

The absence of clinically available MERS-CoV vaccines and treatments to date has resulted in uncontrolled incidence and propagation of the virus. In vaccine design, fusion with the IgG Fc domain is reported to increase the immunogenicity of various vaccine antigens. However, limited reports have documented the potential negative effects of Fc fusion on vaccine antigens. To determine whether Fc fusion affects the immunogenicity of MERS-CoV antigen, we constructed a Fcassociated MERS-CoV spike protein (eS770-Fc, 110 kDa), whereby human IgG4 Fc domain was fused to MERS-CoV spike protein (eS770) via a Gly/Pro linker using baculovirus as the expression system. For comparative analyses, two eS770 proteins lacking the IgG4 Fc domain were generated using the IdeS protease (eS770-Fc) or His tag attachment (eS770-His) and the immunogenicity of the above constructs were examined following intramuscular immunization in mice. Contrary to expectations, non-Fc spike proteins (eS770-Fc, eS770-His; 90 kDa) showed higher immunogenicity than the Fc fusion protein (eS770-Fc). Moreover, unlike non- Fc spike proteins, eS770-Fc immunization did not elicit neutralizing antibodies against MERSCoV. The lower immunogenicity of Fc-fused eS770 was related to alterations in the structural conformation of the spike protein. Taken together, our results indicate that IgG Fc fusion reduces the immunogenicity of eS770 by interfering with the proper folding structure.","output":"Effect of Fc Fusion on Folding and Immunogenicity of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Spike Protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission is a form of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity that exists at most synapses in the nervous system. In the central nervous system (CNS), LTP has been recorded at numerous synapses and is a prime candidate mechanism associating activity-dependent plasticity with learning and memory. LTP involves long-lasting increase in synaptic strength with various underlying mechanisms. In the CNS, the predominant type of LTP is believed to be dependent on activation of the ionotropic glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), which is highly calcium-permeable. However, various forms of NMDAR-independent LTP have been identified in diverse areas of the nervous system. The NMDAR-independent LTP may require activation of glutamate metabotropic receptors (mGluR) or ionotropic receptors other than NMDAR such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7-nAChR), serotonin 5-HT3 receptor or calcium-permeable AMPA receptor (CP-AMPAR).

New approaches for the treatment of this disease are urgently needed since available treatments are not effective for all patients, take a long time to produce an effect, and are not well-tolerated in many cases; moreover, they are not safe for all patients. There is solid evidence showing that the antioxidant capacity is lower and the oxidative damage is higher in the brains of depressed patients as compared with healthy controls. Mitochondrial disfunction is associated with depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders, and this dysfunction can be an important source of oxidative damage. Additionally, neuroinflammation that is commonly present in the brain of depressive patients highly contributes to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). There is evidence showing that pro-inflammatory diets can increase depression risk; on the contrary, an anti-inflammatory diet such as the Mediterranean diet can decrease it. Therefore, it is interesting to evaluate the possible role of plant-derived antioxidants in depression treatment and prevention as well as other biomolecules with high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential such as the molecules paracrinely secreted by mesenchymal stem cells. In this review, we evaluated the preclinical and clinical evidence showing the potential effects of different antioxidant and anti-inflammatory biomolecules as antidepressants, with a focus on difficult-to-treat depression and conventional treatment-resistant depression.","output":"Antioxidant Biomolecules and Their Potential for the Treatment of Difficult-to-Treat Depression and Conventional Treatment-Resistant Depression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Bullying encompasses intentional intimidation, abuse, and physical or psychological harassment behaviors by a student (bully) against another student (victim) repeatedly.

METHODS: From February 29CMay 29, 2016, we actively identified and enrolled patients in two hospitals with acute respiratory infections (ARI) that met all PUE case criteria. We reviewed medical records for documented exposure history associated with respiratory infectious diseases, collected throat samples that were tested for seasonal and avian influenza, and interviewed clinicians regarding reasons for reporting or not reporting PUE cases. We described and analyzed the proportion of PUE cases reported and clinician awareness of and practices related to the PUE system. RESULTS: Of 2619 ARI admissions in two hospitals, 335(13%) met the PUE case definition; none were reported. Of 311 specimens tested, 18(6%) were seasonal influenza virus-positive; none were avian influenza-positive. < 10% PUE case medical records documented whether or not there were exposures to animals or others with respiratory illness. Most commonly cited reasons for not reporting cases were no awareness of the PUE system (76%) and not understanding the case definition (53%). CONCLUSIONS: Most clinicians have limited awareness of and are not reporting to the PUE system. Exposures related to respiratory infections are rarely documented in medical records.

However, the effect of plasma therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of plasma infusions in people with PD. METHODS: A total of 15 people with clinically established PD, at least 1 cognitive complaint, and on stable therapy received 1 unit of young fresh frozen plasma twice a week for 4 weeks. Assessments and adverse effects were performed/reported on and off therapy at baseline, immediately after, and 4 weeks after the infusions ended. Adverse effects were also assessed during infusions. The primary outcomes were safety, tolerability, and feasibility. Exploratory outcomes included Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III off medication, neuropsychological battery, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39, inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, interleukin-6), uric acid, and quantitative kinematics. RESULTS: Adherence rate was 100% with no serious adverse effects.

Mag-Pam2Cys also upregulated the gene expression of several IFN- subtypes, p65, NOS2, and molecules with antimicrobial activities (CD14, beta defensin 1). Overall, our data showed that Mag-Pam2Cys polarized porcine macrophages towards a proinflammatory antimicrobial phenotype. However, Mag-Pam2Cys downregulated the expression of IFN-3, six TLRs (TLR3, -4, -5, -7, -8, -9), and did not interfere with macrophage polarization induced by the immunosuppressive IL-10, suggesting that the inflammatory activity evoked by Mag-Pam2Cys could be regulated to avoid potentially harmful consequences.

However, some do not produce sufficient antibodies after vaccination (low responders). This study investigated changes in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody levels among HCWs after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and assessed whether low responders produced adequate SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike and neutralizing antibodies. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of HCWs before and after vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in a hospital in Tokyo, Japan. The HCWs received two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine, 3 weeks apart. Those whose antibody levels against previous antiviral vaccines did not reach protective antibody levels after receiving two doses were defined as low responders, whereas those who produced adequate antibodies were defined as normal responders. SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibodies were measured 11 times from before the first BNT162b2 vaccination to 5 months after the second vaccination. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody activity was measured twice in low responders, 1 week to 1 month and 5 months after the second vaccination. Results Fifty HCWs were included in the analytic cohort. After vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibody was detectable in the samples from both responders at each timepoint, but the level was lower at 5 months than at 1 week after the second vaccination.

It was performed in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and aims to help readers access the latest knowledge surrounding this new infectious disease and to provide a reference for future studies.","output":"The outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): A review of the current global status"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans. Globally, the number of confirmed cases and mortality rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have risen dramatically. Currently, there are no FDA-approved antiviral drugs and there is an urgency to develop treatment strategies that can effectively suppress SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytokine storms, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis. As symptoms progress in patients with SARS-CoV-2 sepsis, elevated amounts of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are produced, which in turn induce multiple organ failure in these patients. Furthermore, plasma levels of DNase-1 are markedly reduced in SARS-CoV-2 sepsis patients. In this study, we generated recombinant DNase-1-coated polydopamine-poly(ethylene glycol) nanoparticulates (named long-acting DNase-1), and hypothesized that exogenous administration of long-acting DNase-1 may suppress SARS-CoV-2-mediated neutrophil activities and the cytokine storm. Our findings suggest that exogenously administered long-acting nanoparticulate DNase-1 can effectively reduce cfDNA levels and neutrophil activities and may be used as a potential therapeutic intervention for life-threatening SARS-CoV-2-mediated illnesses.","output":"Long-acting nanoparticulate DNase-1 for effective suppression of SARS-CoV-2-mediated neutrophil activities and cytokine storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiac injury in patients infected with the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) seems to be associated with higher morbimortality. We provide a broad review of the clinical evolution of COVID-19, emphasizing its impact and implications on the cardiovascular system. The pathophysiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-&#945;) leading to systemic inflammation and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, acutely affecting the cardiovascular system. Hypertension (56.6%) and diabetes (33.8%) are the most prevalent comorbidities among individuals with COVID-19, who require hospitalization. Furthermore, cardiac injury, defined as elevated us-troponin I, significantly relates to inflammation biomarkers (IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), hyperferritinemia, and leukocytosis), portraying an important correlation between myocardial injury and inflammatory hyperactivity triggered by viral infection. Increased risk for myocardial infarction, fulminant myocarditis rapidly evolving with depressed systolic left ventricle function, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, and cardiomyopathies mimicking STEMI presentations are the most prevalent cardiovascular complications described in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 tropism and interaction with the RAAS system, through ACE2 receptor, possibly enhances inflammation response and cardiac aggression, leading to imperative concerns about the use of ACEi and ARBs in infected patients. Cardiovascular implications result in a worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of precocious detection and implementation of optimal therapeutic strategies.","output":"Covid-19 and the cardiovascular system: a comprehensive review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a new multi-agent model for simulating malware propagation in device-to-device (D2D) 5G networks.

Reproductive isolation is expected to be particularly likely to evolve by this mechanism in species such as phytophagous insects that mate in the habitats in which they eat. We tested this expectation by monitoring the evolution of reproductive isolation in laboratory populations of an RNA virus that undergoes genetic exchange only when multiple virus genotypes coinfect the same host. We subjected four populations of the RNA bacteriophage 6 to 150 generations of natural selection on a novel host. Although there was no direct selection acting on host range in our experiment, three of the four populations lost the ability to infect one or more alternative hosts. In the most extreme case, one of the populations evolved a host range that does not contain any of the hosts infectible by the wild\\\\type 6. Whole genome sequencing confirmed that the resulting reproductive isolation was due to a single nucleotide change, highlighting the ease with which an emerging RNA virus can decouple its evolutionary fate from that of its ancestor. Our results uniquely demonstrate the evolution of reproductive isolation in allopatric experimental populations. Furthermore, our data confirm the biological credibility of simple no\\\\gene mechanisms of assortative mating, in which this trait arises as a pleiotropic effect of genes responsible for ecological adaptation.","output":"EVOLUTION OF HOST SPECIFICITY DRIVES REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION AMONG RNA VIRUSES"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As of 8 April 2021, a total of 2 9 million people have died with or from the coronavirus infection causing COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) On 29 January 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved a COVID-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca (AZD1222, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca, Vaxzevria, Covishield) While the vaccine prevents severe course of and death from COVID-19, the observation of pulmonary, abdominal, and intracranial venous thromboembolic events has raised concerns Objective: To describe the clinical manifestations and the concerning management of patients with cranial venous sinus thrombosis following first exposure to the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca Methods: Patient files, laboratory findings, and diagnostic imaging results, and endovascular interventions of three concerning patients were evaluated in retrospect Results: Three women with intracranial venous sinus thrombosis after their first vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca were encountered Patient #1 was 22 years old and developed headaches four days after the vaccination On day 7, she experienced a generalized epileptic seizure Patient #2 was 46 years old She presented with severe headaches, hemianopia to the right, and mild aphasia 13 days after the vaccination MRI showed a left occipital intracerebral hemorrhage Patient #3 was 36 years old and presented 17 days after the vaccination with acute somnolence and right-hand hemiparesis The three patients were diagnosed with extensive venous sinus thrombosis They were managed by heparinization and endovascular recanalization of their venous sinuses They shared similar findings: elevated levels of D-dimers, platelet factor 4 antiplatelet antibodies, corona spike protein antibodies, combined with thrombocytopenia Under treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin, platelet counts normalized within several days Conclusion: Early observations insinuate that the exposure to the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca might trigger the expression of antiplatelet antibodies, resulting in a condition with thrombocytopenia and venous thrombotic events (e g , intracranial venous sinus thrombosis) These patients treatment should address the thrombo-embolic manifestations, the coagulation disorder, and the underlying immunological phenomena","output":"Thrombocytopenia and Intracranial Venous Sinus Thrombosis after COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca Exposure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Intracellular entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) depends on the interaction between its spike protein with the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and depends on Furin-mediated spike protein cleavage and spike protein priming by host cell proteases, including transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2).

Follistatin neutralizes the TGF ligands, myostatin and activin A, by forming a nearly irreversible non-signaling complex by surrounding the ligand and preventing interaction with TGF receptors. The FS288-ligand complex has higher affinity than unbound FS288 for heparin/HS, which accelerates ligand internalization and lysosomal degradation; however, limited information is available for how FS288 interactions with heparin affect ligand binding. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) we show that preincubation of FS288 with heparin/HS significantly decreased the association kinetics for both myostatin and activin A with seemingly no effect on the dissociation rate. This observation is dependent on the heparin/HS chain length where small chain lengths less than degree of polymerization 10 (dp10) did not alter association rates but chain lengths >dp10 decreased association rates. In an attempt to understand the mechanism for this observation, we uncovered that heparin induced dimerization of follistatin. Consistent with our SPR results, we found that dimerization only occurs with heparin molecules >dp10. Small-angle X-ray scattering of the FS288 heparin complex supports that FS288 adopts a dimeric configuration that is similar to the FS288 dimer in the ligand-bound state. These results indicate that heparin mediates dimerization of FS288 in a chain-length-dependent manner that reduces the ligand association rate, but not the dissociation rate or antagonistic activity of FS288.","output":"Heparin-mediated dimerization of follistatin."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Earlier, after our bioinformatic analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of TATA-binding protein-binding sites within gene promoters on the human Y chromosome, we suggested that human reproductive potential diminishes during self-domestication.

Therefore, this multinational study aimed to assess the mental health status of pregnant and breastfeeding women during the pandemic, and to explore potential associations between depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress and women's sociodemographic, health, and reproductive characteristics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based study was performed in Ireland, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the UK between 16 June and 14 July 2020. Pregnant and breastfeeding women up to 3 months postpartum who were older than 18 years of age were eligible. The online, anonymous survey was promoted through social media and hospital websites. The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven-item scale (GAD-7), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were used to assess mental health status. Regression model analysis was used to identify factors associated with poor mental health status. RESULTS: In total, 9041 women participated (including 3907 pregnant and 5134 breastfeeding women). The prevalence of major depressive symptoms (EDS &#8805; 13) was 15% in the pregnancy cohort and and 13% the breastfeeding cohort. Moderate to severe generalized anxiety symptoms (GAD &#8805; 10) were found among 11% and 10% of the pregnant and breastfeeding women. The mean (SD) PSS scores for pregnant and breastfeeding women were 14.1  6.6 and 13.7  6.6, respectively. Risk factors associated with poor mental health included having a chronic mental illness, a chronic somatic illness in the postpartum period, smoking, having an unplanned pregnancy, professional status, and living in the UK or Ireland.

In this study, we conducted statistical analysis on the natural shock of COVID-19 to investigate whether the large hospitals will draw health demand from the small hospitals when a supply capacity surplus is present, a phenomenon otherwise known as the \\"siphon effect\\". Methods We collected the monthly hospital income and service data, including outpatient income, inpatient income, number of visits, and discharges, from all public hospitals, from January 2018 to July 2020 in Shanghai. A difference-in-differences (DIDs) method was applied to analyze the existence of the large hospitals' siphon effect by identifying the differences in the healthcare service market share change between large and small hospital groups at the height of pandemic (February and March, 2020) and the postpandemic period (April and May, 2020). Case mix index (CMI) was used to verify whether the reduction in healthcare amount and market share of small hospitals was due to unnecessary care. Results In total, 156 public hospitals, including 46 large hospitals and 110 small hospitals, with an average number of beds of 1,079.21 and 345.25, respectively, were involved in this study. At the height of the pandemic, the healthcare service volume and revenue in public hospitals in Shanghai experienced a sharp decline, especially for large hospitals and inpatient services. Compared to small hospitals at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, large hospitals' market share decreased significantly in outpatient and inpatient services for overall and nonlocal patients (P<0.05). During the postpandemic period, large hospitals' market share increased significantly in outpatient and inpatient services for overall and local patients (P<0.05). This increase was more substantial in inpatient services. Conclusions Under conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic of higher care-seeking costs in the large hospitals, some of the healthcare services typically provided by large hospitals were then supplied by small hospitals.

The aim of the study was to identify the structure and properties of M4 metalloprotease proteins. RESULTS: A total of 31 protein sequences of M4 metalloprotease retrieved from UniProt representing different species of bacteria have been characterized for various physiochemical properties. They were thermostable, hydrophillic protein of a molecular mass ranging from 38 to 66 KDa. Correlation on the basis of both enzymes and respective genes has also been studied by phylogenetic tree. B. cereus M4 metalloprotease (PDB ID: 1NPC) was selected as a representative species for secondary and tertiary structures among the M4 metalloprotease proteins. The secondary structure displaying 11 helices (H1-H11) is involved in 15 helix-helix interactions, while 4 -sheet motifs composed of 15 -strands in PDBsum. Possible disulfide bridges were absent in most of the cases. The tertiary structure of B. cereus M4 metalloprotease was validated by QMEAN4 and SAVES server (Ramachandran plot, verify 3D, and ERRAT) which proved the stability, reliability, and consistency of the tertiary structure of the protein. Functional analysis was done in terms of membrane protein topology, disease-causing region prediction, proteolytic cleavage sites prediction, and network generation. Transmembrane helix prediction showed absence of transmembrane helix in protein. Protein-protein interaction networks demonstrated that bacillolysin of B. cereus interacted with ten other proteins in a high confidence score. Five disorder regions were identified.

Fifteen patients who did not receive oxygen therapy and 13 patients who were transferred from other hospitals were excluded. The rest of the 30 patients that received standardized oxygen therapy in our unit were included in the study. Baseline characteristics, symptoms, and finger pulse oxygen saturation were collected during hospitalization. RESULTS Clinical outcomes of the 30 patients were as follows: 27 patients (90.00%) were cured and discharged; 3 patients (10.00%) who continued to stay in hospital were stabilized with symptoms relieved.

Here, using patient data recorded in the UK Biobank, we demonstrate the importance of variations in Rab46 (CRACR2A) and clinical outcomes. Using logistic regression analysis, we determined that three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene EFCAB4B cause missense variations in Rab46, which are associated with COVID-19 fatality independently of risk factors. All three SNPs cause changes in amino acid residues that are highly conserved across species, indicating their importance in protein structure and function. Two SNPs, rs17836273 (A98T) and rs36030417 (H212Q), cause amino acid changes in important functional domains: the EF-hand and coiled-coil domain respectively. By using molecular modelling, we suggest that the substitution of threonine at position 98 causes structural changes in the EF-hand calcium binding domain. Rab46 is a Rab GTPase that plays regulates both regulating endothelial cell secretion and T-cell cytokine signalling and this study supports the hypothesis that genetic variations in Rab46 plays a role in COVID-19 severity.","output":"EFCAB4B (CRACR2A) genetic variants associated with COVID-19 fatality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIF: Dcrire les caractristiques pidmio-cliniques, radiologiques et thrapeutiques de linfection au SARS-COV2 chez les diabtiques.

Interesting recent publications will be highlighted against a background of established knowledge. RECENT FINDINGS In the field of anesthesia, particularly in pediatrics, some contributions have been made concerning intramuscular versus intravenous induction. The need for anticholinergic adjuvants has also been clarified. Neuroapoptosis has been observed in animals and its implications for human subjects are discussed in a general context of neurotoxicity. The most important developments, however, are in the treatment of pain. Neurological and urological side effects strongly question long-term use. Other potentially beneficial effects have also been reported, such as anti-inflammatory and antidepressive effects. There are also indications that ketamine may attenuate postoperative delirium in coronary by-pass patients. SUMMARY More questions have arisen than have been answered. Some have very grave implications. The issue of neuroapoptosis must be clarified. The long-term effects must be further investigated.

In the medical domain, sequential training on tasks may sometimes be the only way to train models, either because access to the original (potentially sensitive) data is no longer available, or simply owing to the computational costs inherent to joint retraining. A major issue inherent to sequential learning, however, is catastrophic forgetting, i.e., a substantial drop in accuracy on prior tasks when a model is updated for a new task. Elastic Weight Consolidation is a recently proposed method to address this issue, but scaling this approach to the modern large models used in practice requires making strong independence assumptions about model parameters, limiting its effectiveness. In this work, we apply Kronecker Factorization--a recent approach that relaxes independence assumptions--to prevent catastrophic forgetting in convolutional and Transformer-based neural networks at scale. We show the effectiveness of this technique on the important and illustrative task of medical entity linking across three datasets, demonstrating the capability of the technique to be used to make efficient updates to existing methods as new medical data becomes available. On average, the proposed method reduces catastrophic forgetting by 51% when using a BERT-based model, compared to a 27% reduction using standard Elastic Weight Consolidation, while maintaining spatial complexity proportional to the number of model parameters.","output":"Kronecker Factorization for Preventing Catastrophic Forgetting in Large-scale Medical Entity Linking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Correlation between weather and the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may suggest its seasonality.

Using the existing Google Earth Images, a segmentation algorithm using ENVI Feature Classification was developed to allow remote counting of vehicles from the earliest image in 2018. The devised algorithm was able to delineate, identify, and classify according to the types of vehicles that are visible on the image. An average error rate of 12.24% was found by comparison of automated counts and manual counts on the images, while a regression analysis yielded a value of R2 Combining double low line 0.9227 that denoted a strong relationship between automated and manual counts.

A common task is to infer the underlying tree structure, given only observations of its terminal nodes. Many algorithms for tree recovery are computationally intensive, which limits their applicability to trees of moderate size. For large trees, a common approach, termed divide-and-conquer, is to recover the tree structure in two steps. First, recover the structure separately of multiple, possibly random subsets of the terminal nodes. Second, merge the resulting subtrees to form a full tree. Here, we develop Spectral Top-Down Recovery (STDR), a deterministic divide-and-conquer approach to infer large latent tree models. Unlike previous methods, STDR partitions the terminal nodes in a non random way, based on the Fiedler vector of a suitable Laplacian matrix related to the observed nodes. We prove that under certain conditions, this partitioning is consistent with the tree structure. This, in turn, leads to a significantly simpler merging procedure of the small subtrees. We prove that STDR is statistically consistent and bound the number of samples required to accurately recover the tree with high probability. Using simulated data from several common tree models in phylogenetics, we demonstrate that STDR has a significant advantage in terms of runtime, with improved or similar accuracy.","output":"Spectral Top-Down Recovery of Latent Tree Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phenolic compounds have been related to multiple biological activities, and the antiviral effect of these compounds has been demonstrated in several viral models of public health concern.

Objectives: To compare the outcomes of dexamethasone vs. methylprednisolone, along with the effects of rescue, short-term, high-dose boluses of corticosteroids. Methods: Before/after and case/control retrospective analysis of consecutive critically ill COVID-19 subjects. Subjects were initially given dexamethasone; however, after review of the local protocol, methylprednisolone was suggested. A three-day course of 1000 mg/day of methylprednisolone was administered in the case of refractory hypoxemia within the first 10 days of treatment. Propensity score-adjusted comparisons were performed. Results: A total of 81 consecutive subjects were included (85% males, 60  10 years, SAPS II 27  7, SOFA 4 [IQR 3, 6] points) and 51 of these subjects (62.9%) received dexamethasone and 29 (35.8%) had methylprednisolone. The groups were well matched for age, comorbidities, and severity at admission. No differences were found in the duration of ICU stay, hospital mortality, or infectious complications between the groups. A total of 22 subjects (27.2%) received a rescue bolus; these subjects had a significantly lower oxygenation, a higher driving pressure, and an increased ventilatory ratio during the first ten days. Short-term/high-dose boluses were associated with higher hospital mortality, longer mechanical ventilation and ICU and hospital stay, and more infectious complications. A subgroup of subjects who received the boluses had significantly improved oxygenation and lower hospital mortality. Conclusions: We were unable to find any difference between dexamethasone or methylprednisolone on the explored outcomes; high-dose boluses of corticosteroids were associated with a worse outcome.

Resequencing Pathogen Microarrays-Flu 3.1 (RPM-Flu-3.1). Results were compared with human adenovirus (HAdV) hexon gene PCR sequencing and viral culture. Results Thirty-two of the 38 conjunctival swab samples were bacterial culture-negative. Four of the 7 pooled samples were positive for HAdV using RPM-Flu-3.1. Hexon gene PCR sequencing on the 38 original individual samples showed that 3 and 4 samples contained HAdVs species D and B respectively. All the 6 samples that were positive for hexon gene PCR but negative for bacterial culture were also positive by the resequencing microarray. Viral culture was positive for HAdV type 3 in 1 sample, which was also positive by PCR and resequencing microarray. Conclusions Resequencing microarray is as sensitive as PCR for detection of HAdV in conjunctival swabs.

Lung epithelial type II cells play a major role in several physiological processes, including recognition and clearance of respiratory viruses as well as repair of lung injury in response to environmental toxicants. Gene expression profiling of lung epithelial type II-specific genes led to the identification of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 3 (LAMP3). Intracellular locations of LAMP3 include plasma membrane, endosomes, and lysosomes. These intracellular organelles are involved in vesicular transport and facilitate viral entry and release of the viral RNA into the host cell cytoplasm. In this study, regulation of LAMP3 expression in human lung epithelial cells by several respiratory viruses and type I interferon signaling was investigated. Coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 significantly induced LAMP3 expression in lung epithelial cells within 24 hours after infection that required the presence of ACE2 viral entry receptor. Time-course experiments revealed that the induced expression of LAMP3 by SARS-CoV-2 was correlated with the induced expression of interferon-beta1 (IFNB1) and signal transducers and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) mRNA levels. LAMP3 was also induced by direct IFN-beta treatment or by infection with influenza virus lacking the non-structural protein1(NS1) in NHBE bronchial epithelial cells. LAMP3 expression was induced in human lung epithelial cells by several respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3). Location in lysosomes and endosomes as well as induction by respiratory viruses and type I Interferon suggests that LAMP3 may have an important role in inter-organellar regulation of innate immunity and a potential target for therapeutic modulation in health and disease.

In the drug combination nirmatrelvir + ritonavir (nirmatrelvir/r), the active agent, nirmatrelvir, is made bioavailable in clinically adequate amounts by the additional administration of a potent inhibitor of its first-pass metabolism by way of cytochrome P450 [CYP] 3A in the gut and liver. In view of the central role of CYP3A in the clearance of many different kinds of drugs, and the fact that many patients with COVID- 19 are taking multiple drugs to treat other conditions, it is important to assess the potential for drug interactions when nirmatrelvir/r is given, and to minimize the risks associated with such interactions. METHODS: We defined the interaction profile of ritonavir on the basis of information derived from two databases (Medline, GoogleScholar), three standard electronic texts on drug interactions, and manufacturer-supplied drug information. We compiled a list of drugs and their potentially relevant interactions, developed a risk minimization algorithm, and applied it to the substances in question. We also compiled a list of commonly prescribed drugs for which there is no risk of interaction with nirmatrelvir/r. RESULTS: Out of 190 drugs and drug combinations, 57 do not need any special measures when given in combination with brief, low-dose ritonavir treatment, while 15 require dose modification or a therapeutic alternative, 8 can be temporarily discontinued, 9 contraindicate ritonavir use, and 102 should preferably be combined with a different treatment.

METHODS: Data regarding the epidemiology of refractive errors was extracted from three different sources: systematic review of published literature, data from visual school screening programs, and data from Iran's national health survey (NHS). The pool of all available data on refractive errors as well as demographic, location, and socioeconomic status covariates were fitted in spatio-temporal and Gaussian process regression models to predict the prevalence of refractive errors from the years 1990 to 2018 in 31 provinces grouped by age and sex in order to calculate years lived with disability (YLDs). RESULTS: In 2018, the age-adjusted prevalence of refractive errors was 16.32% (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 12.44C21.48%) in both sexes, 17.98% (95% UI: 13.74C23.61%) in women, and 14.66% (95% UI: 11.14C19.36%) in men.

Three independent sets of data exemplify the two kinds of memory in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The data provide evidence of re-emergence of sequences that were hidden in cellular or anatomical compartments for extended periods of infection, and recovery of a quasispecies from pre-existing genomes. We develop a three-component model that incorporates the essential features of the quasispecies dynamics of retroviruses exposed to selective pressures. Significantly, a numerical study based on this model is in agreement with the experimental data, further supporting the existence of both replicative and reservoir memory in retroviral quasispecies.","output":"Memory in Retroviral Quasispecies: Experimental Evidence and Theoretical Model for Human Immunodeficiency Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging data indicate that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells targeting different viral proteins are detectable in up to 70% of convalescent individuals1-5.

A nasal and nasopharyngeal sample obtained from each patient was analyzed to determine the diagnostic ability of the rapid antigen detection test (RADT, nasal swab) in comparison with the current gold-standard (RT-PCR, nasopharyngeal swab). RESULTS: The calculated sensitivity and specificity of the RADT was 82.1 and 99.1%, respectively. Kappa's coefficient of agreement between the RADT and RT-PCR was 0.859 (p < 0.001). Stratified analysis showed that the sensitivity of the RADT improved significantly when lowering the cut-off RT-PCR Ct value to 24.

Mol.Biol. 245, 608-622). To determine if parameters other than nucleotide sequence in the crossover region affect junction site selection, recombinants were assayed at various times postinoculation of plants and protoplasts. Populations of recombinants became progressively shorter in plants and larger in protoplasts. Levels of inoculated transcript and age of the plant were not substantial factors in the shifts in crossover site locations. The two most commonly cloned recombinant species were not amplified to detectable levels in protoplasts, suggesting that these molecules are not viable templates for replication. These results suggest that recombination between sat-RNA D and TCV is a very frequent event, and populations of recombinants are likely generated de novo in each infected cell and represent the original recombinant molecules rather than progeny of such molecules. Therefore, factors other than simple selection for recombinants that are more fit to replicate are probably responsible for the differences in junction sites in populations of sat-RNA D/TCV recombinants.","output":"Changes in locations of crossover sites over time in de novo generated RNA recombinants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While early commenting on studies is seen as one of the advantages of preprints, the nature of such comments, and the people who post them, have not been systematically explored.

While the disease primarily presents as a respiratory illness, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea have been reported in up to one-third of confirmed cases, and patients may have mild symptoms that do not prompt them to seek medical attention. Internet-based infodemiology offers an approach to studying symptoms at a population level, even in individuals who do not seek medical care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine if a correlation exists between internet searches for gastrointestinal symptoms and the confirmed case count of COVID-19 in the United States. METHODS: The search terms chosen for analysis in this study included common gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Furthermore, the search terms fever and cough were used as positive controls, and constipation was used as a negative control. Daily query shares for the selected symptoms were obtained from Google Trends between October 1, 2019 and June 15, 2020 for all US states. These shares were divided into two time periods: preCCOVID-19 (prior to March 1) and postCCOVID-19 (March 1-June 15). Confirmed COVID-19 case numbers were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering data repository. Moving averages of the daily query shares (normalized to baseline preCCOVID-19) were then analyzed against the confirmed disease case count and daily new cases to establish a temporal relationship. RESULTS: The relative search query shares of many symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and constipation, remained near or below baseline throughout the time period studied; however, there were notable increases in searches for the positive control symptoms of fever and cough as well as for diarrhea. These increases in daily search queries for fever, cough, and diarrhea preceded the rapid rise in number of cases by approximately 10 to 14 days. The search volumes for these terms began declining after mid-March despite the continued rises in cumulative cases and daily new case counts. CONCLUSIONS: Google searches for symptoms may precede the actual rises in cases and hospitalizations during pandemics. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, this study demonstrates that internet search queries for fever, cough, and diarrhea increased prior to the increased confirmed case count by available testing during the early weeks of the pandemic in the United States. While the search volumes eventually decreased significantly as the number of cases continued to rise, internet query search data may still be a useful tool at a population level to identify areas of active disease transmission at the cusp of new outbreaks.","output":"Association of Search Query Interest in Gastrointestinal Symptoms With COVID-19 Diagnosis in the United States: Infodemiology Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), multiple thromboinflammatory events contribute to the pathophysiology, including coagulation system activation, suppressed fibrinolysis, vascular endothelial cell injury, and prothrombotic alterations in immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils.

Dome-down laparoscopic cholecystectomy provides the ability to evaluate the cystic duct circumferentially prior to its division, thus minimizing the risks of bile duct injury. This study assesses the feasibility and safety of SILC using a modified dome-down approach with all conventional laparoscopic instruments. METHODS Three low-profile 5-mm trocars are placed via a single transumbilical incision. The two working trocars are aimed laterally via the rectus to achieve adequate triangulation. An extralong 5-mm 30o laparoscope with an L-shaped light-cord adaptor is used to yield more external working space. Cephalic liver retraction is achieved with one transabdominal suture through the gallbladder fundus. Leaving the gallbladder fundus attached to the liver bed, a window is first created between the gallbladder body and the liver. The dissection is then carried down retrograde toward the porta hepatis. A 360o view of the gallbladder-cystic duct junction is achieved prior to transecting the cystic duct. The gallbladder is then freed by separation of the fundal attachments. The specimen is retrieved by enlarging the fascial incision. All fascial defects are then primarily closed. RESULTS Sixteen patients (mean age 31 years, mean BMI 26.3 kg/m(2)) were enrolled in this study. Thirteen had elective surgery for symptomatic cholelithiasis, and three had emergency surgery for acute cholecystitis. Mean operating time was 80.3 min, and blood loss was minimal. All patients were discharged within 24 h without complications. Follow-up at 1 month revealed a barely visible scar within the umbilicus. CONCLUSIONS SILC using a modified dome-down approach is technically feasible with all straight instruments, and it is safe because of good delineation of ductal anatomy.

Despite the promising advantages reported of GNPs, nanoscale materials may also present a potential hazard to humans. Therefore, in this study, the in vivo toxicity of these nanomaterials at a wide range of concentrations from 12.5 to 500 g/mL was evaluated in the Caenorhabditis elegans model for 24 h (acute toxicity) and 72 h (chronic toxicity). Furthermore, their in vitro toxicity (from 0 to 10 g/mL for 12 and 24 h), proliferative activity at 72 and 96 h, and their effect on the expression of thirteen genes in human keratinocytes HaCaT cells were studied. The physico-chemical and morphological aspects of the GNPs used in this study were analyzed by Raman scattering spectroscopy, electron microscopy, zeta potential as a function of pH, and particle size measurements by dynamic light scattering. The results of this study showed that GNPs showed in vivo non-toxic concentrations of 25 and 12.5 g/mL for 24 h, and at 12.5 g/mL for 72 h. Moreover, GNPs present time-dependent cytotoxicity (EC50 of 1.142 g/mL and 0.760 g/mL at 12 h and 24 h, respectively) and significant proliferative activity at the non-toxic concentrations of 0.005 and 0.01 g/mL in the HaCaT cell line. The gene expression study showed that this multi-layer-graphene is capable of up-regulating six of the thirteen genes of human keratinocytes (SOD1, CAT, TGFB1, FN1, CDH1, and FBN), two more genes than other CBNs in their oxidized form such as multi-layer graphene oxide.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: A population-based prospective cohort using the French national health data system (SNIIRAM), identified 69,911 adults living within five well-defined geographical areas, who were new users of antiplatelet drugs in 2013-2015 and who had not received any antithrombotics in 2012. Among them, 63,600 started a monotherapy and 6,311 a dual regimen. Clinical data for all adults referred for bleeding was collected from all emergency departments within these areas, and medically validated. Databases were linked using common key variables. The main outcome measure was time to major bleeding (GI, ICH and other bleedings). Secondary outcomes were death, and event-free survival (EFS). Hazard ratios (HR) were derived from adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. We used Inverse Propensity of Treatment Weighting as a stratified sensitivity analysis according to the antiplatelet monotherapy indication: primary prevention without cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, with CV risk factors, and secondary prevention. We observed 250 (0.36%) major haemorrhages, 81 ICH, 106 GI and 63 other types of bleeding. Incidences were twice as high in dual therapy as in monotherapy. Compared to low-dose aspirin (&#8804; 100 mg daily), high-dose (> 100 up to 325 mg daily) was associated with an increased risk of ICH (HR = 1.80, 95%CI 1.10 to 2.95).

Both groups will be stopped taking prednisone tablets and turn to electroacupuncture therapy in a recovery phase. Patients in the experimental group will receive treatment at least 6 times in the acute phase and both groups will receive treatment 9 times in the recovery phase, and there will be a follow-up period of 15 days after the treatment. The primary outcome is supposed to be related to the changes observed in the Sunnybrook (Toronto) Facial Grading System (SFGS) on the baseline and day 30 after the onset. Secondary outcome measures will include House-Brackmann Facial Nerve Grading System (H-B), measurement of Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Facial Disability Index scale (FDI, including physical function subscore, FDIP, and social functioning and well-being subscore, FDIS), surface electromyogram (sEMG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Adverse events will be recorded for safety assessment. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will allow the present study to compare the difference in efficacy and prognosis between the strategy of combined electroacupuncture in the acute phase and only oral prednisone tablets. The findings from this trial will be published in peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CHICTR ChiCTR2000038472.

In one experiment conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak, 93 Polish participants were randomly assigned to a simulated vignette of the good Samaritan parable where either the prevention or promotion regulatory focus was manipulated. The results confirmed a certain favorable tendency to offer quasi-realistic help in both the regulatory focus conditions. The finding highlights a dynamic association in goal pursuit motivation and prosocial behavior in a pandemic context regarding the good Samaritan parable.

Many companies and institutes are therefore striving to develop effective methods for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA), antibodies, antigens, and the virus. In this review, we summarize the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, its genome and gene expression characteristics, and the current progression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, antibodies, antigens, and virus detection. Further, we discuss the reasons for the observed false-negative and false-positive RNA and antibody detection results in practical clinical applications. Finally, we provide a review of the biosensors which hold promising potential for point-of-care detection of COVID-19 patients. This review thereby provides general guidelines for both scientists in the biosensing research community and for those in the biosensor industry to develop a highly sensitive and accurate point-of-care COVID-19 detection system, which would be of enormous benefit for controlling the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Detection of COVID-19: A review of the current literature and future perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online propaganda is a growing menace to domestic security, democratic institutions, and public health. The two most notable examples are the election-fraud propaganda that eventually led to the 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol, and the anti-vaccination propaganda, which is undermining the scientific efforts to turn the tide of the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study, while appreciating the inherent social, legal, and political dilemmas, contributes to the technological developments in countering propaganda in todays American cyberspace. Using a (political) news repository, we first construct a dataset that contains nearly 205,000 articles from 39 propagandistic and 30 trustworthy news outletsmaking it one of the richest and least biased datasets used for propaganda research thus far. We subsequently construct a set of models that use linguistic features to score news for its propagandistic content. The superior model, constructed with LightGBMa state-of-the-art gradient boosting tree-based algorithm, both outperforms (C-index=0.9 and F1-score=0.84) and outruns the baseline models. Motivated by the accuracy-interpretability trade-off (and tension) in machine learning, which is also underscored as a challenge in propaganda detection research agenda, we then draw on the coalitional game theory ideas to compute the contribution of each linguistic aspect of an article to its propaganda score, thereby explaining the model decision to the user. Finally, we aggregate the contributions of each linguistic feature across all predictions to provide new insights into the linguistic profile of propaganda in todays American news ecosystem.

It also evaluates the caregivers' perceptions of the use of telemedicine during the lockdown. METHODS: This is a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study. It was completed using Google forms and patients/caregivers were asked to consent if they agreed to answer. RESULTS: 235 patients/families participated in the study. The mean age of the patients was 10.8 years  3.9 years (N = 229). Twenty-four children (10.2%) needed to visit the emergency department during the lockdown period which lasted for 10 weeks. Of these, eight (3.4%) were hospitalized due to acute metabolic complications. Families (58.3%) faced insulin shortages and 14% had to ration insulin, i.e., decrease the dose, during the lockdown. Glucose monitoring strips were rationed by 43.4% of families leading to more frequent low/high glucose readings in 75.5% of children of these families. Telemedicine using phones and social media applications was utilized for communication with healthcare professionals and continuing medical care. Most of the participants (85.5%) described it as a smooth and positive experience.

Parenteral booster injection of a vaccine against a mucosal pathogen promotes stronger mucosal immune responses following prior mucosal infection compared to injections of a parenteral vaccine in a mucosally naive subject. We investigated whether this was also the case for the BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. METHODS: Twenty recovered COVID-19 subjects (RCS) and 23 SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects were vaccinated with respectively one and two doses of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. Nasal Epithelial Lining Fluid (NELF) and plasma were collected before and after vaccination and assessed for Immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgA antibody levels to Spike and for their ability to neutralize binding of Spike to ACE-2 receptor. Blood was analyzed one week after vaccination for the number of Spike-specific Antibody Secreting Cells (ASCs) with a mucosal tropism. RESULTS: All RCS had both nasal and blood SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies at least 90 days after initial diagnosis. In RCS, a single dose of vaccine amplified pre-existing Spike-specific IgG and IgA antibody responses in both NELF and blood against both vaccine homologous and variant strains, including delta. These responses were associated with Spike-specific IgG and IgA ASCs with a mucosal tropism in blood. Nasal IgA and IgG antibody responses were lower in magnitude in SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects after two vaccine doses compared to RCS after one dose.

This data set creates one-, three-, and seven-day forecasts of the COVID-19 pandemic's cumulative case counts at the county, health district, and state geographic levels for the state of Virginia. Forecasts are created over the first 46 days of reported COVID-19 cases using the cumulative case count data provided by The New York Times as of April 22, 2020. From this historical data, one-, three-, seven, and all-days prior to the forecast start date are used to generate the forecasts. Forecasts are created using: (1) a Na?ve approach; (2) Holt-Winters exponential smoothing (HW); (3) growth rate (Growth); (4) moving average (MA); (5) autoregressive (AR); (6) autoregressive moving average (ARMA); and (7) autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). Median Absolute Error (MdAE) and Median Absolute Percentage Error (MdAPE) metrics are created with each forecast to evaluate the forecast with respect to existing historical data. These error metrics are aggregated to provide a means for assessing which combination of forecast method, forecast length, and lookback length are best fits, based on lowest aggregated error at each geographic level. The data set is comprised of an R-Project file, four R source code files, all 1,329,404 generated short-range forecasts, MdAE and MdAPE error metric data for each forecast, copies of the input files, and the generated comparison tables. All code and data files are provided to provide transparency and facilitate replicability and reproducibility. This package opens directly in RStudio through the R Project file. The R Project file removes the need to set path locations for the folders contained within the data set to simplify setup requirements. This data set provides two avenues for reproducing results: 1) Use the provided code to generate the forecasts from scratch and then run the analyses; or 2) Load the saved forecast data and run the analyses on the stored data. Code annotations provide the instructions needed to accomplish both routes. This data can be used to generate the same set of forecasts and error metrics for any US state by altering the state parameter within the source code. Users can also generate health district forecasts for any other state, by providing a file which maps each county within a state to its respective health-district.

Novelty describes the desire to use new technology that tends to diminish over time. Primacy describes the growing engagement with technology as a result of adoption of the innovation. User-learning estimation is critical because it holds experimentation responsible for trustworthiness, empowers organizations to make better decisions by providing a long-term view of expected impact, and prevents user dissatisfaction.

Many people do not have the opportunity to express their wishes and die in their preferred place of death. Advance care planning (ACP) involves discussion, decisions and documentation about how an individual contemplates their future death. Recording end-of-life preferences gives patients a sense of control over their future. Coordinate My Care (CMC) is Londons largest electronic palliative care register designed to provide effective ACP, with information being shared with urgent care providers. The aim of this study is to explore determinants of dying in hospital. Understanding advance plans and their outcomes can help in understanding the potential effects that implementation of electronic palliative care registers can have on the end-of-life care provided. Retrospective observational cohort analysis included 21,231 individuals aged 18 or older with a Coordinate My Care plan who had died between March 2011 and July 2019 with recorded place of death. Logistic regression was used to explore demographic and end-of-life preference factors associated with hospital deaths. 22% of individuals died in hospital and 73% have achieved preferred place of death. Demographic characteristics and end-of-life preferences have impact on dying in hospital, with the latter having the strongest influence. The likelihood of in-hospital death is substantially higher in patients without documented preferred place of death (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.26C1.62, p<0.001), in those who prefer to die in hospital (OR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.60C3.30, p<0.001) and who prefer to be cared in hospital (OR = 2.77, 95% CI 1.94C3.96, p<0.001).

In this paper, the authors review the role of wildlife in the ecology of infectious disease, the staggering magnitude of the movement of wild animals and products across international borders in trade, the pathways by which they move, and the growing body of risk assessments from a multitude of disciplines. Finally, they highlight existing recommendations and offer solutions for a collaborative way forward.","output":"The spread of pathogens through trade in wildlife."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infants needing the support of a neonatal unit have unique, individual needs that require a Synactive approach to enable effective management of both the environment and the infant themselves (Als, 1986) Parents working in partnership with neonatal colleagues play an essential role in developing competent skills to appraise an infant's function For parents, learning to care and interact with their infant on a neonatal unit presents unexpected complications including learning to cope and be close to their baby in an unfamiliar setting (Cardin, 2020) The current COVID -19 pandemic has challenged all aspects of neonatal work causing anxiety and stress for all involved in infant care Neonatal teams have been working together to continue to provide excellent care, and to make adaptations in a difficult and unfamiliar situation A major change to practice has been the need to limit parent visiting time and access to the cot -side This is further complicated by the need for practitioner use of face - masks and personal protective equipment when treating infants on neonatal units which has inevitably altered the traditional developmental care approaches undertaken in the UK (Altimier et al , 2015)","output":"Reflections on COVID -19 and the potential impact on preterm infant feeding and speech, language and communication development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ecological studies have suggested fewer COVID-19 morbidities and mortalities in Bacillus CalmetteCGurin (BCG)-vaccinated countries than BCG-non-vaccinated countries.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted reviewing patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI, USA) between March 13, 2020 and June 11, 2020. All patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), through a nasopharyngeal or a bronchoscopy specimen. RESULTS: During the study period, 53 bronchoscopy procedures were performed at the institution, of which five patients tested positive for COVID-19. Of the five patients, three underwent BAL testing based on high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 after the nasopharyngeal (NP) swab(s) was negative. All three patients had underlying cancers and had lymphopenia for a considerable duration prior to being diagnosed with COVID-19. Two patients had better outcomes that could be attributed to earlier BAL specimen testing resulting in timely medical intervention. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the need for early lower respiratory tract sampling, whenever possible, in patients with cancer and prolonged lymphopenia. High clinical suspicion ought to supersede false-negative NP reverse transcriptase-PCR as early bronchoscopic evaluation in cancer patients, who are either receiving active treatment or are immunosuppressed, can allow timely institution of efficacious treatment, enrollment into clinical trials, as well as effective infection control.

The Chinese economy has been growing rapidly while serving as a global production base, but since 2012, it has become necessary to modify its approaches to achieve growth as it enters the so-called a?New Normal (?C)a?, an era of medium-speed growth. Recently, new reform and opening measures have been taken in various fields to improve the quality of the Chinese economy, and the need for reform and opening in the financial sector has also increased. Internally, the financial system centered on China's state-owned commercial banks has focused on indirect financing, which has served as a major obstacle to upgrading China's economy and industry to the next level, further increasing the need for reform and opening of the financial sector. Moreover, externally, the U.S.-China conflict which began in earnest in 2018, is applying strongly pressure toward reform and opening in Chinaa?s financial sector. The Chinese government began to show a proactive attitude toward financial opening amid such internal needs and external pressure, and an important development was seen in Chinaa?s financial opening when President Xi Jinping declared further opening measures at the Boao Forum in April 2018. The Chinese financial authorities have prepared follow-up measures related to financial opening, and the Chinese governmenta?s efforts toward financial opening in the three years from 2018 to 2020 yielded more results than the ten-year opening period since its accession to the WTO. Against this backdrop, this study examines the main contents of Chinaa?s financial opening process, which has been accelerating recently, and derives evaluation and implications. It analyzes environmental changes in internal, external, and industrial and technological aspects encompassing Chinaa?s financial opening since 2018. First of all, regarding the internal environment of Chinaa?s financial opening, we examined changes in the policy and institutions of Chinese financial opening by dividing these into the two categories of the financial service industry and capital account. Secondly, in terms of external environment, it was analyzed how the intensifying conflict between the U.S. and China affected Chinaa?s financial opening and Hong Konga?s status as a financial hub. Fi ally, the environmental changes in industry and technology were examined by looking at the recent development of Chinaa?s digital finance and international cooperation in the area, and their significance for the U.S.-China competition. Through this, we evaluated the financial opening of China and derived policy implications for Koreaa?s response and direction for financial cooperation with China.Chapter 2 analyzes the current status and policies of Chinese financial market openness as a result of internal environmental changes. The Chinese governmenta?s policies and systems in the financial opening were analyzed across two categories: financial services and capital account. Financial services were again divided into banking, securities, and insurance sectors. The capital account was examined by dividing it into the stock market and the bond market. In the case of the financial services sector, the Chinese government has taken the most active measures to ease or remove restrictions on the share ratio and scope of work permitted for foreign financial institutions among all sectors of banking, securities, and insurance. Compared to this, the Chinese government is taking a more cautious approach in the capital market, creating and managing channels for foreign capital to enter the Chinese capital market such as the QFII, RQFII schemes, and Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, and bond connect programs. The opening of the Chinese capital market is mainly carried out by easing or abolishing investment limits on Chinese stocks and bonds through these channels or facilitating investment.Chapter 3 analyzes changes in the financial opening environment in China due to intensifying conflict between the United States and China, which are external environmental changes. We reviewed the demands by the U.S. upon China to open its financial sector since the negotiations for Chinaa?s accession to the WTO. The conflict between the two countries has been complicated since the inauguration of the Trump administration, and thus, the environmental change was analyzed from the perspective of intensifying conflict between them. Chinaa?s financial opening has been accelerating since 2018 under U.S. pressure, and as a result, U.S. financial firms are actively entering China. On the other hand, however, as the Trump administration is pushing for various measures of U.S.-China financial decoupling after the Covid-19 pandemic, we carried out analyses and predictions for various scenarios according to the direction of future U.S.-China conflict. We also analyzed how Hong Konga?s status as a financial hub would develop, as it has emerged as a battleground for the U.S.-China conflict since the enforcement of the Hong Kong Security Act in July 2020. By analyzing Hong Konga?s foreign exchange and stock markets, and its capital inflow and outflow, we predicted the short- and long-term impact of the U.S.-China conflict on Hong Konga?s status.Chapter 4 analyzes the changes in Chinaa?s financial opening environment due to the development of Chinaa?s digital finance, focusing on industrial and technological aspects. The background and characteristics of the development of digital finance in China, the status of openness and international cooperation were examined, and the competition in the Digital Belt and Road initiative and the U.S.-China digital finance platforms was analyzed. Mobile payment platforms such as Alipay in China are actively entering the mobile payment market in neighboring regions with poor financial systems, such as Southeast Asia, employing QR code payment methods based on the competitiveness accumulated in the Chinese market. The expansion of international cooperation in Chinaa?s mobile platforms is expected to be carried out in conjunction with Chinaa?s Digital Belt and Road initiative and internationalization of the renminbi, but the competition for hegemony in digital finance between the U.S. and China is also expected to intensify. Therefore, this study examined Chinaa s countermeasures to prepare for U.S. financial sanctions, such as CIPS and QR code-compatible international mobile payment systems.Based on the analysis of the previous chapters, Chapter 5 evaluates Chinaa?s financial opening and forecasts future developments, going on to present the direction for Koreaa?s response. Since 2018, foreign companies in the financial service sector have been able to enter the Chinese market with China actively opening its financial services sector, and in the case of the capital market, free flow of foreign capital has been allowed by using channels established by the Chinese government. However, although the recent opening of the Chinese financial market is significant as an institutional opening through the revision of laws and regulations, there could be many non-institutional obstacles for foreign financial companies to enter the Chinese market and actually pursue their businesses. In addition, the Chinese financial opening measures currently remain a one-way opening, focusing on the inbound market. The two-way opening that the Chinese government aims for, especially the opening of the capital account, is expected to be possible only after the capacity of Chinese financial authorities to manage financial risks and the competitiveness of Chinese financial companies have improved.It is necessary to watch more closely how the intensifying conflict between the U.S. and China affects Chinaa?s financial opening. In particular, we may see different patterns depending on what tools are used after the inauguration of Presiden Biden. China is respon-ding to the U.S.-China decoupling, prompted by changes in the external environment of deepening U.S.-China conflict which has been in full swing since 2018, by expanding its financial opening. For China, the risks of Chinaa?s real economy can be shared with the U.S. through the financial opening, and for the U.S., the cooperation between the two countries is likely to continue to expand as the U.S. can earn profits from the development of Chinaa?s real economy. Concerns about Hong Konga?s status as a financial hub have been raised due to the U.S.-China conflict, but it looks difficult for global financial companies to move to other regions due to their business with China. However, as China's financial openness expands, competition between Hong Kong and mainland China (Shanghai and Shenzhen) is expected to intensify in the mid-to-long term.The development of digital finance in China and overseas expansion of mobile platform companies are being driven by private companies. The Chinese government also places great importance on establishing a mobile international payment system in promoting the Digital Belt and Road initiative, so it is expected to be established in connection with future national strategies. This linkage of China's digital platforms and international payment system is likely to be utilized for the internationalization of digital renminbi in the long term. Looking at the competitive landscape between the US and China, it is expected that the US will intensify checks against China's digital finance internationalization in the future. This is because China's digital international payment system is likely to threaten the current U.S.dollar-centered international currency system.In response to Chinaa?s financial opening, Koreaa?s countermeasures are to demonstrate competitive advantage through localization and differentiation in the banking sector, cultivation of its ability to integrate global resources and service transactions in the securities sector, and the establishment of sales networks with local govern-ments in the insurance sector. In the case of stock and bond markets, the risks followed by Chinese authorities' supervision on the foreign exchange market and the volatility in the Chinese stock market should be checked.","output":"Changing Environment for Opening of Chinese Financial Sector and Response Measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global COVID\\\\19 lockdowns have disrupted adolescents in\\\\person social networks, increasing likelihood of loneliness.

The use of siRNA and shRNA as antiviral therapeutic is limited because of the emergence of viral escape mutants. This problem is theoretically prevented by intracellular expression of lhRNAs generating multiple siRNAs that target the virus simultaneously, thus reducing the chance of viral escape. However, gene constructs encoding lhRNA molecules face problems with delivery to the right cells in an infected individual. In order to solve this problem, we constructed an HIV-1 variant with a 300 bp long hairpin structure in the 3' part of the genome corresponding to the Nef gene (HIV-lhNef). RESULTS: Intriguingly, HIV-lhNef potently inhibited wild-type HIV-1 production in trans. However, HIV-lhNef demonstrated a severe production and replication defect, which we were able to solve by selecting spontaneous virus variants with truncated hairpin structures. Although these escape variants lost the ability to trans-inhibit HIV-1, they effectively outgrew the wild-type virus in competition experiments in SupT1 cells. CONCLUSION: Expression of the lhNef hairpin within the HIV-1 genome results in potent trans-inhibition of wild-type HIV-1. Although the mechanism of trans-inhibition is currently unknown, it remains of interest to study the molecular details because the observed effect is extremely potent. This may have implications for the development of virus strains to be used as live-attenuated virus vaccines.","output":"Trans-inhibition of HIV-1 by a long hairpin RNA expressed within the viral genome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zoonotic pandemics, such as that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can follow the spillover of animal viruses into highly susceptible human populations. The descendants of these viruses have adapted to the human host and evolved to evade immune pressure. Coronaviruses acquire substitutions more slowly than other RNA viruses. In the spike glycoprotein, we found that recurrent deletions overcome this slow substitution rate. Deletion variants arise in diverse genetic and geographic backgrounds, transmit efficiently, and are present in novel lineages, including those of current global concern. They frequently occupy recurrent deletion regions (RDRs), which map to defined antibody epitopes. Deletions in RDRs confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies. By altering stretches of amino acids, deletions appear to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 antigenic evolution and may, more generally, drive adaptive evolution.","output":"Recurrent deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein drive antibody escape"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered vast governmental lockdowns. The impact of these lockdowns on mental health is inadequately understood. On the one hand such drastic changes in daily routines could be detrimental to mental health. On the other hand, it might not be experienced negatively, especially because the entire population was affected. METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine mental health outcomes during pandemic induced lockdowns and to examine known predictors of mental health outcomes. We therefore surveyed n = 9,565 people from 78 countries and 18 languages. Outcomes assessed were stress, depression, affect, and wellbeing. Predictors included country, sociodemographic factors, lockdown characteristics, social factors, and psychological factors. RESULTS: Results indicated that on average about 10% of the sample was languishing from low levels of mental health and about 50% had only moderate mental health. Importantly, three consistent predictors of mental health emerged: social support, education level, and psychologically flexible (vs. rigid) responding. Poorer outcomes were most strongly predicted by a worsening of finances and not having access to basic supplies. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that on whole, respondents were moderately mentally healthy at the time of a population-wide lockdown. The highest level of mental health difficulties were found in approximately 10% of the population. Findings suggest that public health initiatives should target people without social support and those whose finances worsen as a result of the lockdown.

China is one of the first big economies globally to show indications of recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic. The nation's economic growth has the biggest long-term influence on middle-income nations (0.17%) followed by low- and middle-income economies (0.16%) and high-income economies (0.16%) (0.15%).

Our findings show that the post-COVID-19 economic rebound in China will mostly benefit middle-income nations, with low- and middle-income countries following closely after. After COVID-19, the influence of the economic recovery of China is most visible in the rise of energy consumption in high-income nations, followed by middle-income economies. It is also worth noting that the influence of China's economic expansion on low- and middle-income economies does not always imply a rise in energy consumption. Overall, China's economic recovery has a significantly stronger influence on other countries economic development than other countries energy consumption has on other economies growth.","output":"Impact of Covid-19 on economic recovery: empirical analysis from China and global economies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND There are limited data regarding the criteria for prophylactic treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after hospital discharge. We sought to identify risk factors of post-hospital discharge VTE events following colorectal surgery. METHODS The NSQIP database was utilized to examine patients developed VTE after hospital discharge following colorectal surgery during 2005-2013. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression was performed to quantify risk factors of VTE after discharge. RESULTS We evaluated a total of 219,477 patients underwent colorectal resections. The overall incidence of VTE was 2.1 % (4556). 33.8 % (1541) of all VTE events occurred after hospital discharge. The length of postoperative hospitalization had a strong association with post-discharge VTE, with the highest risk in patients who were hospitalized for more than 1 week after operation (AOR 9.08, P < 0.01). Other factors associated with post-discharge VTE included chronic steroid use (AOR 1.81, P < 0.01), stage 4 colorectal cancer (AOR 1.40, P = 0.03), obesity (AOR 1.37, P < 0.01), age >70 (AOR 1.21, P = 0.04), and open surgery (AOR 1.36, P < 0.01).

The recent development of real-time EEG-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation (EEG-TMS) allows studying this relationship in a causal fashion. Specifically, it has been shown that corticospinal excitability is higher during the scalp surface negative EEG peak compared to the positive peak of -oscillations in sensorimotor cortex, as indexed by larger motor evoked potentials (MEPs) for fixed stimulation intensity. Objective We further characterize the effect of -rhythm phase on the MEP input-output (IO) curve by measuring the degree of excitability modulation across a range of stimulation intensities. We furthermore seek to optimize stimulation parameters to enable discrimination of functionally relevant EEG-defined brain states. Methods A real-time EEG-TMS system was used to trigger MEPs during instantaneous brain-states corresponding to -rhythm surface positive and negative peaks with five different stimulation intensities covering an individually calibrated MEP IO curve in 15 healthy participants. Results MEP amplitude is modulated by -phase across a wide range of stimulation intensities, with larger MEPs at the surface negative peak. The largest relative MEP-modulation was observed for weak intensities, the largest absolute MEP-modulation for intermediate intensities. These results indicate a leftward shift of the MEP IO curve during the -rhythm negative peak.

Numerous screening instruments have been developed for children under 3 years of age. Level 1 screeners are used in large-scale screening to detect at-risk children in the general population; Level 2 screeners are concerned with distinguishing children with signs of autism from those with other developmental problems. The focus here is evaluation of Level 2 screeners. However, given the contributions of Level 1 screeners and the necessity to understand how they might interface with Level 2 screeners, we briefly review Level 1 screeners and consider instrument characteristics and system variables that may constrain their effectiveness. The examination of Level 2 screeners focuses on five instruments associated with published evaluations in peer-reviewed journals. Key criteria encompass the traditional indices of test integrity such as test reliability (inter-rater, test-retest) and construct validity, including concurrent and predictive validity, sensitivity (SE), and specificity (SP). These evaluations reveal limitations, including inadequate sample sizes, reliability issues, and limited involvement of independent researchers. Also lacking are comparative test evaluations under standardized conditions, hindering interpretation of differences in discriminative performance across instruments. Practical considerations constraining the use of such instrumentssuch as the requirements for training in test administration and test administration timeare canvassed. Published Level 2 screener short forms are reviewed and, as a consequence of that evaluation, future directions for assessing the discriminative capacity of items and measures are suggested. Suggested priorities for future research include targeting large and diverse samples to permit robust appraisals of Level 2 items and scales across the 12C36 month age range, a greater focus on precise operationalization of items and response coding to enhance reliability, ongoing exploration of potentially discriminating items at the younger end of the targeted age range, and trying to unravel the complexities of developmental trajectories in autistic infants. Finally, we emphasize the importance of understanding how screening efficacy is dependent on clinicians' and researchers' ability not only to develop screening tests but also to negotiate the complex organizational systems within which screening procedures must be implemented.","output":"Autism Screening in Early Childhood: Discriminating Autism From Other Developmental Concerns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Uterine fibroids (UF) are the most common benign gynecologic tumors and lead to heavy menstrual bleeding, severe anemia, abdominal pain, and infertility, which seriously harm a women's health. Unfortunately, the regulatory mechanisms of UF have not been elucidated. Recent studies have demonstrated that miRNAs play a vital role in the development of uterine fibroids. As a high-throughput technology, microarray is utilized to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMs) between UF and myometrium. We identified 373 candidate DEGs and the top 100 DEMs. Function enrichment analysis showed that candidate DEGs were mainly enriched in biological adhesion, locomotion and cell migration, and collagen-containing extracellular matrix. Subsequently, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are constructed to analyze the functional interaction between DEGs and screen hub DEGs. Subsequently, the expression levels of hub DEGs were validated by real-time PCR of clinical UF samples. The DGIdb database was used to select candidate drugs for hub DEGs. Molecular docking was applied to test the affinity between proteins and drugs. Furthermore, target genes for 100 candidate DEMs were predicted by miRwalk3.0. After overlapping with 373 candidate DEGs, 28 differentially expressed target genes (DEGTs) were obtained. A miRNA-mRNA network was constructed to investigate the interactions between miRNA and mRNA. Additionally, two miRNAs (hsa-miR-381-3p and hsa-miR-181b-5p) were identified as hub DEMs and validated through RT-PCR. In order to better elucidate the pathogenesis of UF and the synergistic effect between miRNA and transcription factor (TF), we constructed a miRNA-TF-mRNA regulatory network. Meanwhile, in vitro results suggested that dysregulated hub DEMs were associated with the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of UF cells. Our findings provided a novel horizon to reveal the internal mechanism and novel targets for the diagnosis and treatment of UF.","output":"Identification and Validation of miRNA-TF-mRNA Regulatory Networks in Uterine Fibroids."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic has also affected mental health.

METHODS Cross-sectional, descriptive, observational study. A survey was carried out to collect sociodemographic data, and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (DASS 21), Athens Insomnia Scale and the 14-item Resilience Scale (RS-14) were applied. Central tendency and dispersion measures were obtained for quantitative variables and frequencies for qualitative variables. The chi-square test was used for bivariate analysis; alpha level was 0.05. RESULTS 1,667 individuals with a mean age of 33.78  10.79 years were analyzed. On DASS 21, a mean of 9.7 points (normal) was found, as well as 7.10 for anxiety (normal) and 6.73 for depression (normal). On Athens Insomnia Scale, a mean of 9.33 points (moderate alteration), and on the RS-14 scale, 69.13 points (high resilience) were obtained.

TBI patients suffer short- and long-term behavioral, cognitive, and emotional impairments, including difficulties in concentration, memory loss, and depression. Research shows that CE application can mitigate cognitive and behavioral impairments in animal models for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, whose pathophysiology is similar to that of TBI. This study builds on prior research by showing similar results in TBI mice models. After drinking CE for a week, mice were injured using our 70-g weight drop TBI device. For 2 weeks thereafter, the mice continued drinking CE alongside standard lab nutrition. Subsequently, the mice underwent behavioral tests to assess their memory, motor activity, and anxiety. The mice brains were harvested for immunohistochemistry staining to evaluate overall neuronal survival. Our results show that CE consumption almost completely mitigates memory impairment and decreases neuronal loss after TBI. Mice that did not consume CE demonstrated impaired memory. Our results also show that CE consumption attenuated neuronal loss in the temporal cortex and the dentate gyrus. Mice that did not consume CE suffered a significant neuronal loss. There were no significant differences in anxiety levels and motor activity between all groups.

To achieve herd immunity, widespread administration of vaccines is required, which necessitates significant cooperation from the general public. As such, it is crucial that governments and public health agencies understand public sentiments toward vaccines, which can help guide educational campaigns and other targeted policy interventions. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and apply an artificial intelligenceCbased approach to analyze public sentiments on social media in the United Kingdom and the United States toward COVID-19 vaccines to better understand the public attitude and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: Over 300,000 social media posts related to COVID-19 vaccines were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook posts from the United Kingdom and 144,864 from the United States, along with 40,268 tweets from the United Kingdom and 98,385 from the United States from March 1 to November 22, 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learningCbased techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends, and topics of discussion. These factors were analyzed longitudinally and geospatially, and manual reading of randomly selected posts on points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis. Results: Overall averaged positive, negative, and neutral sentiments were at 58%, 22%, and 17% in the United Kingdom, compared to 56%, 24%, and 18% in the United States, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness, and trials as well as concerns over their safety, economic viability, and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to those of nationwide surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly. Conclusions: Artificial intelligenceCenabled social media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude. Such analyses could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccines, help address the concerns of vaccine sceptics, and help develop more effective policies and communication strategies to maximize uptake.","output":"Artificial IntelligenceCEnabled Analysis of Public Attitudes on Facebook and Twitter Toward COVID-19 Vaccines in the United Kingdom and the United States: Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on neurology residency education and services in the United States.

BRSV is spread by horizontal contact causing a constant presence of seropositive animals that favors viral circulation throughout the year. Moreover, reinfections with BRSV are frequent between animals regardless of their age as BRSV does not confer long-lasting protective immunity. Several studies have demonstrated the circulation of BRSV in cattle from different regions of the world; however, little is known about the dynamics of BRSV infection in cows before and after they begin lactation. The aim of this work was to study the dynamics of BRSV neutralizing antibodies from birth up to 36 months of age in a closed dairy herd of Argentina specifically around the lactation period. Passive maternal antibodies against BRSV started to decrease monthly and became almost undetectable at 8 months of age. We detected two potential infection points at months 11 and 27 after birth, in which 30% and 45% of the animals showed seroconversion, respectively. Specifically, an increase in the proportion of seropositive cows after the start of lactation suggests that they became reinfected around the time they began lactating.

especially during a pandemic such as COVID-19, can lead to cognitive biases that may limit the physician when creating a proper diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan CASE PRESENTATION: A 33 y/o woman with ESRD, DM and CHF, presented to a Southern Arizona emergency department with fevers, SOB, and abdominal pain She was diagnosed with COVID-19 on a hospital admission two weeks prior related to an outbreak at her nursing facility On current presentation, her physical examination was remarkable for slight ascites, and bibasilar rales Laboratory evaluation demonstrated an elevated WBC count (neutrophil predominance), CRP, ESR, LDH, and respiratory procalcitonin Re -test of COVID-19 antigen PCR remained positive Chest radiography demonstrated diffuse nodular and hazy airspace opacities She was started on antibiotics for a presumed bacterial pneumonia and appropriate supportive care for her co-existing COVID-19 infection During her hospital stay, she became altered with worsening hypoxemia, prompting transfer to the designated COVID ICU Review of a chest CT done on her prior admission revealed diffuse ground glass opacities and a miliary pattern of nodularity concerning for a viral, mycobacterial, or fungal pneumonia (Fig 1) Given the high suspicion for a disseminated endemic fungal infection such as coccidioidomycosis, she was started on antifungal therapy and coccidioidomycosis serum antibodies were drawn (1) Antibody titers came back at &gt;1:256, highly suggestive of disseminated coccidioidomycosis (2) Her lab abnormalities and presenting symptoms rapidly improved over the course of her hospitalization She was discharged in stable condition with a prolonged course of fluconazole and appropriate outpatient follow-up DISCUSSION: Our patients care highlights availability and anchoring bias when treating patients with respiratory failure during the COVID-19 pandemic (3) Due to her carrying a diagnosis of COVID-19 prior to admission and the relative high number COVID-19 pneumonia cases during this pandemic, the initial treatment was incorrect and additional diagnoses were not considered These biases are most clear in the fact that a prior CT chest showed findings not necessarily representative of COVID-19 and may have not been acknowledged CONCLUSIONS: There is emerging evidence that patients with COVID-19 are at elevated risk for co-infection (4) Disseminated coccidioidomycosis is rare in immunocompetent hosts (5) and the presence of COVID-19 viral pneumonia may have made her more susceptible to an invasive fungal infection To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of COVID-19 and coccidioidomycosis co-infection A high suspicion and vigilance for excluding potentially treatable co-infections, such as

of survival, whilst for others, the theme might be suffering. The recurring motif of survival has continued throughout history, yet for the first time the sum of all fears has amounted to a run on the bare essentials. This paper seeks to offer an alternative formulation of \\"panic buying,\\" with references to literature, philosophy, and contemporary neurobiology. CONCLUSION The bare essentials disappeared perhaps as part of some self-fulfilling prophecy: the supermarkets became bare because others inadvertently lead us to believe they would become bare. The contagion model of emotional propagation provides a psychological model of how \\"panic buying\\" by an individual might lead to the replication of panic in an observer. The Polyvagal Theory further informs us of how the threat posed by the pandemic primes our limbic system to perceive danger, and explains how witnessing others engaging in fight-flight responses might evoke a fearful affect in an observer. In the end, it is perhaps through Nietzsche's study of classical tragedy that we may find some meaning to the pandemic, allowing our collective lived experience to serve as a template for growth.","output":"Gone with the Wind."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) has spread to almost every region of the world, infecting millions and resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.

METHODS: A prospective Swedish nationwide study of patients who undergone surgery for esophageal cancer between 2013 and 2019. Telephone interviews were conducted 5 weeks and 13 weeks after the introduction of social distancing recommendations. The participants responded to a few scales and items from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30. Regression models adjusted for potential confounders were used to examine mean score differences (MSD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) between compliance with the recommendations and HRQL. RESULTS: In total, 134 individuals participated in the study. At 5 weeks, a reduction in role function was seen for individuals who fully (MSD -8, 95% CI: -16 to 0) and to a large extent (MSD -19, 95% CI: -26 to -12) complied with the recommendations. Less fatigue (MSD 9, 95% CI: 3-15) was also detected for this group. Being female, elderly, having comorbidities, living in a region with higher COVID-19 incidence, living in a villa, and being considered as an at-risk person were related to changes in role function. At 13 weeks, reductions in role function continued for those who fully complied with the recommendations (MSD -10, 95% CI: -19 to -1), but the risk variables were of less importance. Improvements in fatigue were no longer detected. Global quality of life, emotional function, or insomnia remained stable over time. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that individuals who undergone surgery for esophageal cancer and fully or to a large extent complied with the recommendations experienced reductions in role function, but not in global quality of life or emotional function, during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic and health-related quality of life among esophageal cancer survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-Cov-2 infection causes local and systemic inflammation mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and COX-2 eicosanoid products with metabolic dysfunction and tissue damage that can lead to patient death These effects are primarily induced by IL-1 cytokines, which are involved in the elevation of hepatic acute phase proteins and fever IL-1 has a broad spectrum of biological activities and participates in both innate and acquired immunity In infections, IL-1 induces gene expression and synthesis of several cytokines/chemokines in both macrophages and mast cells (MCs) The activation of MCs triggers the secretion of mediators stored in the granules, and the de novo synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines In microorganism infections, the release of IL-1 macrophage acts on adhesion molecules and endothelial cells leading to hypotension and septic shock syndrome IL-1 activated by SARS-CoV-2 stimulates the secretion of TNF, IL-6 and other cytokines, a pro-inflammatory complex that can lead to cytokine storm and be deleterious in both lung and systemically In SARS-CoV-2 septic shock, severe metabolic cellular abnormalities occur which can lead to death Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 induces IL-1 in macrophages and MCs causing the induction of gene expression and activation of other pro-inflammatory cytokines Since IL-1 is toxic, its production from ubiquitous MCs and macrophages activated by SARS-CoV-2 can also provokes both gastrointestinal and brain disorders Furthermore, in these immune cells, IL-1 also elevates nitric oxide, and the release of inflammatory arachidonic acid products such as prostaglndins and thromboxane A2 All together these effects can generate cytokine storm and be the primary cause of severe inflammation with respiratory distress and death Although, IL-1 administered in low doses may be protective;when it is produced in high doses in infectious diseases can be detrimental, Therefore, IL-1 blockade has been studied in many human diseases including sepsis, resulting that blocking it is absolutely necessary This definitely nurtures hope for a new effective therapeutic treatment Recently, two interesting anti-IL-1 cytokines have been widely described: IL-37 and IL-1Ra IL-37, by blocking IL-1, has been observed to have anti-inflammatory action in rodents, in vivo and in transfected cells It has been reported that IL-37 is a very powerful protein which inhibits inflammation and its inhibition can be a valid therapeutic strategy IL-37 is a natural suppressor of inflammation that is generated through a caspase-1 that cleaves pro-IL-37 into mature IL-37 which translocates to the nucleus and inhibits the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes;while IL-1Ra inhibits inflammation by binding IL-1 to its IL-1R (receptor) We firmly believe that blocking IL-1 with an anti-inflammatory cytokine such as IL-37 and/or IL-1Ra is an effective valid therapy in a wide spectrum of inflammatory disorders including SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 Here, we propose for the first time that IL-37, by blocking IL-1, may have an important role in the therapy of COVID-19","output":"Coronavirus-19 (SARS-CoV-2) induces acute severe lung inflammation via IL-1 causing cytokine storm in COVID-19: a promising inhibitory strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rapid escalation in use of home monitoring and video consultations in children with a variety of chronic respiratory conditions.

STUDY DESIGN: Vital statistical data on deaths were obtained from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. For this analysis, we used data from January 2012 to June 2021. METHODS: A quasi-Poisson regression was used to estimate the expected weekly number of deaths. Excess deaths were expressed as the range of differences between the observed and expected number of all-cause deaths and the 95% upper bound of the one-sided prediction interval. RESULTS: Since January 2021, excess deaths were observed for the first time in the week corresponding to April 12C18 and have continued through mid-June, with the highest excess percentage occurring in the week corresponding to May 31CJune 6 (excess deaths: 1431C2587; excess percentage: 5.95C10.77%).

Clustering the MD trajectory enabled us to extract representative structures for the conformational space generated. Adding to the MD representative structures, X-ray structures were involved in an ensemble docking approach to screen the FDA approved drugs for a drug repositioning endeavor.

The results highlighted potential consensus binders to many of the MD clusters as well as the newly introduced X-ray structure of PLpro complexed with a small molecule. For instance, three drugs Benserazide, Dobutamine and Masoprocol showed a superior consensus enrichment against the PLpro conformations. Further MD simulations for these drugs complexed with PLpro suggested the superior stability and binding of dobutamine and masoprocol inside the binding site compared to Benserazide.

However, the administration of a high FGF (4-6 L/min) increases the inhaled anesthetic agent consumption. This study was designed to compare the sevoflurane consumption at 2 rates of flow and vaporizer concentration during the wash-in period. METHODS Patients were randomly enrolled into high FGF (HFGF) (n = 30) and low FGF (LFGF) (n = 30) groups. During the wash-in, the HFGF group received 4 L/minute FGF with a sevoflurane vaporizer setting of 2.5%, and the LFGF group received 1 L/minute FGF with a vaporizer setting of 8%. Once the wash-in was complete, anesthesia maintenance was performed with 0.5 L/min FGF with a vaporizer setting of 2.5-4.5% in both groups. The patient demographic data, bispectral index values, hemodynamic variables, wash-in time, sevoflurane consumption during the wash-in phase, and total sevoflurane consumption were analyzed. RESULTS The median sevoflurane consumption in the wash-in phase was 8.2 mL (7.1-9.3) in the HFGF group and 2.7 mL (2.2-3.1) in the LFGF group (p = 0.001).

Samples were divided for corresponding immunohistological and mechanical analysis. Collagen I and III, total collagen, elastin, and proteoglycans were quantified by computational image analysis of histological staining. Pre-surgical CT data were used for 3D segmentation of the AAA and calculation of mechanical conditions by advanced finite element analysis. AAA wall stiffness and strength were assessed by repeated cyclical, sinusoidal and destructive tensile testing. RESULTS Amounts of collagen I, III, and total collagen were increased with higher local wall stress (p = .002, .017, .030, respectively) and strain (p = .002, .012, .020, respectively). AAA wall failure tension exhibited a positive correlation with collagen I, total collagen, and proteoglycans (p = .037, .038, .022, respectively). -Stiffness correlated with collagen I, III, and total collagen (p = .011, .038, and .008), while -stiffness correlated only with proteoglycans (p = .028).

Based on in vitro data, IVM has recently been proposed for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection, a condition for which obesity is a major risk factor. In patients, IVM dosage is based on total body weight and there are no recommendations to adjust dosage in obese patients. The objective of this study was to establish, in a canine model, the influence of obesity on the clearance and steady-state volume of distribution of IVM, MOX, and a third analog, eprinomectin (EPR). An experimental model of obesity in dogs was based on a high calorie diet. IVM, MOX, and EPR were administered intravenously, in combination, to a single group of dogs in two circumstances, during a control period and when body weight had been increased by 50%. In obese dogs, clearance, expressed in absolute values (L/day), was not modified for MOX but was reduced for IVM and EPR, compared to the initial control state. However, when scaled by body weight (L/day/kg), plasma clearance was reduced by 55, 42, and 63%, for IVM, MOX and EPR, respectively. In contrast, the steady-state volume of distribution was markedly increased, in absolute values (L), by obesity. For IVM and MOX, this obese dog model suggests that the maintenance doses in the obese subject should be based on lean body weight rather than total weight. On the other hand, the loading dose, when required, should be based on the total body weight of the obese subject.","output":"A Large Impact of Obesity on the Disposition of Ivermectin, Moxidectin and Eprinomectin in a Canine Model: Relevance for COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unprecedented COVID-19 outbreak strengthened the critical manifestation of the rapid development vs survival for pharmaceutical companies, deploying strategic conduct worldwide This study therefore explores the endogenous relationship among pharmaceutical companies' manufacturing strategy and their performance indicators within the ambit of creating a long-lasting competitive advantage in turbulent times Very often, it is not possible to launch a cause-effect relationship between performance and their drivers To achieve this end, multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques are employed in a hybrid fashion in this study The notion has simultaneously ranked critical success factors (CSFs) in the manufacturing strategy and performance indicators in the limelight of managerial perceptions, while controlling the inherent bias concerning the causality direction in the ambit of these two entrenched concepts A case study on the Iranian pharmaceutical companies is piloted to demonstrate this hybrid-fashion multifarious approach Overall, the results revealed the most pertinent CSFs that reached superior-performance echelons in the Islamic Republic of Iran [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Mathematical Problems in Engineering is the property of Hindawi Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Critical Success Factors for Competitive Advantage in Iranian Pharmaceutical Companies: A Comprehensive MCDM Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Host cells orchestrate the production of IFN- upon detecting invading viral pathogens.

This led to the emergence of numerous variants, some of them recently being labeled variants of concern (VOC), due to their potential impact on transmission, morbidity/mortality, and the evasion of neutralization by antibodies elicited by infection, vaccination, or therapeutic application. The potential to evade neutralization is the result of diversity of the target epitopes generated by the accumulation of mutations in the spike protein. While three globally recognized VOCs (Alpha or B.1.1.7, Beta or B.1.351, and Gamma or P.1) remain sensitive to neutralization albeit at reduced levels by the sera of convalescent individuals and recipients of several anti-COVID19 vaccines, the effect of spike variability is much more evident on the neutralization capacity of monoclonal antibodies. The newly recognized VOC Delta or lineage B.1.617.2, as well as locally accepted VOCs (Epsilon or B.1.427/29-US and B1.1.7 with the E484K-UK) are indicating the necessity of close monitoring of new variants on a global level.

It is divided into two broad classes: classical strains that are a notable problem in health care settings due to multidrug resistance, and hypervirulent (hv) strains that are historically drug sensitive but able to establish disease in immunocompetent hosts. Alarmingly, there has been an increased frequency of clinical isolates that have both drug resistance and hv-associated genes. One such gene, rmpA, encodes a transcriptional regulator required for maximal capsule (cps) gene expression and confers hypermucoviscosity (HMV). This link has resulted in the assumption that HMV is caused by elevated capsule production. However, we recently reported a new cps regulator, RmpC, and rmpC mutants have reduced cps expression but retain HMV, suggesting that capsule production and HMV may be separable traits. Here, we report the identification of a small protein, RmpD, that is essential for HMV but does not impact capsule. RmpD is 58 residues with a putative N-terminal transmembrane domain and highly positively charged C-terminal half, and it is conserved among other hv K. pneumoniae strains. Expression of rmpD in trans complements both rmpD and rmpA mutants for HMV, suggesting that RmpD is the key driver of this phenotype. The rmpD gene is located between rmpA and rmpC, within an operon regulated by RmpA. These data, combined with our previous work, suggest a model in which the RmpA-associated phenotypes are largely due to RmpA activating the expression of rmpD to produce HMV and rmpC to stimulate cps expression.","output":"The Small Protein RmpD Drives Hypermucoviscosity in Klebsiella pneumoniae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It has been shown throughout the COVID-19 pandemic that the condition of a number of patients deteriorates acutely when not monitored. This is set against an increased demand for emergency medical services and the resulting scarcity of resources, which makes it necessary to prioritise inpatient treatment or ensure that patients are provided with appropriate outpatient care. In this context, the Berlin Fire Department has introduced emergency paramedic investigators (NotSan-Erkunder) as an additional operating resource. METHODOLOGY: We assessed all operations from 28.03.2020 to 28.04.2020 during which Emergency Paramedic Investigators of the Berlin emergency services were deployed. A total of 341 operations were included from the 31 days. Alongside data from the dispatch system, all operational documentation was assessed. RESULTS: In 57% of cases, mNACA II patients (outpatient treatment) were identified, in 42% of cases, mNACA III patients (inpatient treatment) were identified, and in 1% of cases, mNACA IV (imminent danger to life) patients were identified. In 51% of cases, the emergency services transported the patient to a hospital, and in 49%, alternative care measures were employed. These included referral to a local physician in 28% of cases. In 11% of cases, patients were referred to on-call services of the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (KV in German). In 4% of cases, the Berlin Fire Department emergency dispatch center deployed a physician of the KV (KV-ARE investigator). DISCUSSION: The results show that additional operational resources serve an important function during a pandemic with regards to an initial assessment and pilot function. This can help relieve not only the emergency services but also the medical facilities responsible for providing further care. The standardised dispatch enquiry enables the linking with the appropriate codes from the low-priority operational spectrum and support by a Tele-emergency physician lends additional professional competency to the emergency paramedics.","output":"Einfhrung von NotSan-Erkundern im Rahmen der COVID-19-Pandemie in der Berliner Notfallrettung"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents label-free electrochemical transduction as a suitable scheme for COVID-19-specific viral RNA/c-DNA detection, with an aim to facilitate point of care diagnosis In lieu of this, we discuss the proposed electrochemical biosensing scheme, based on electrodeposited gold nanoparticles as the transducing elements Specific to this approach, here, the protocols associated with the immobilization of the single-stranded probe nucleotide on to the biosensor, have also been laid out This paper also discusses the methods of electrochemical analysis, to be used for data acquisition and subsequent calibration, in relation to target analyte detection Towards facilitating portable diagnosis, development of miniaturized sensors and their integration with readout units have also been discussed","output":"Label-Free Electrochemical Detection of DNA Hybridization: A Method for COVID-19 Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: although Chinas total health expenditure has been dramatically increased so that the country can cope with its aging population, inequalities among individuals in terms of their medical expenditures (relative to their income level) have exacerbated health problems among older adults.

We aimed to describe the course of disease and early post-transplantation outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19 who failed to show lung recovery despite optimal medical management and were deemed to be at imminent risk of dying due to pulmonary complications. METHODS: We established a multi-institutional case series that included the first consecutive transplants for severe COVID-19-associated ARDS known to us in the USA, Italy, Austria, and India. De-identified data from participating centres-including information relating to patient demographics and pre-COVID-19 characteristics, pretransplantation disease course, perioperative challenges, pathology of explanted lungs, and post-transplantation outcomes-were collected by Northwestern University (Chicago, IL, USA) and analysed. FINDINGS: Between May 1 and Sept 30, 2020, 12 patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS underwent bilateral lung transplantation at six high-volume transplant centres in the USA (eight recipients at three centres), Italy (two recipients at one centre), Austria (one recipient), and India (one recipient). The median age of recipients was 48 years (IQR 41-51); three of the 12 patients were female. Chest imaging before transplantation showed severe lung damage that did not improve despite prolonged mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The lung transplant procedure was technically challenging, with severe pleural adhesions, hilar lymphadenopathy, and increased intraoperative transfusion requirements. Pathology of the explanted lungs showed extensive, ongoing acute lung injury with features of lung fibrosis. There was no recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in the allografts. All patients with COVID-19 could be weaned off extracorporeal support and showed short-term survival similar to that of transplant recipients without COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: The findings from our report show that lung transplantation is the only option for survival in some patients with severe, unresolving COVID-19-associated ARDS, and that the procedure can be done successfully, with good early post-transplantation outcomes, in carefully selected patients.

An increasing body of evidence suggests that patients with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) might have a heterogeneous spectrum of neurological symptoms METHODS: A systematic search of two databases was performed for studies published up to May 29th, 2020. PRISMA guidelines were followed. RESULTS: We included 19 studies evaluating 12,157 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections. The median age of patients was 50.3 (IQR 11.9), and the rate of male patients was 50.6% (95% CI 49.2-51.6%). The most common reported comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes (31.1%, 95% CI 30-32.3% and 13.5%, 95% CI 12.3-14.8%, respectively).

The main purpose was developing a reproducible model involving easy interpretation, utilized for a quick prediction of the inhibitory activity of SAR-CoV-3CLpro. The following statistical parameters were present in the best-developed QSAR model: (training set) R(2) = 0.9314, Q(2) = 0.9271; (test set) R(2) = 0.9243, Q(2) = 0.8986. Molecular fragments, defined as SMILES notation descriptors, that have a positive and negative impact on 3CLpro inhibition were identified on the basis of the results obtained for structural indicators, and were applied to the computer-aided design of five new compounds with (4-methoxyphenyl)[2-(methylsulfanyl)-6,7-dihydro-1H-[1,4]dioxino[2,3-f]benzimidazol-1-yl]methanone as a template molecule.

In patients who do not achieve glycemic targets with oral antidiabetic drugs, the initiation of insulin is recommended. However, a serious concern regarding insulin is drug-induced hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is known to affect quality of life and the use of health care resources. However, health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) data for economic modelling are limited, particularly regarding utility values and productivity losses. OBJECTIVE: This real-world prospective study aims to assess the impact of hypoglycemia on productivity and utility in insulin-treated adults with T2DM from Ontario and Quebec, Canada. METHODS: This noninterventional, multicenter, 3-month prospective study will recruit patients from 4 medical clinics and 2 endocrinology or diabetes clinics. Patients will be identified using appointment lists and enrolled through consecutive sampling during routinely scheduled consultations. To be eligible, patients must be aged 18 years, diagnosed with T2DM, and treated with insulin. Utility and productivity will be measured using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire and Institute for Medical Technology Assessment Productivity Cost Questionnaire, respectively. Questionnaires will be completed 4, 8, and 12 weeks after recruitment. Generalized estimating equation models will be used to investigate productivity losses and utility decrements associated with incident hypoglycemic events while controlling for individual patient characteristics. A total of 500 patients will be enrolled to ensure the precision of HEOR estimates. RESULTS: This study is designed to fill a gap in the Canadian evidence on the impact of hypoglycemia on HEOR outcomes. More specifically, it will generate productivity and utility inputs for the economic modeling of T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin therapy is expensive, and hypoglycemia is a significant component of economic evaluation. Robust HEOR data may help health technology assessment agencies in future reimbursement decision-making.

Influenza A virus (IAV) produces double-stranded RNA as an intermediate during the replication life cycle, which activates the intracellular pathogen recognition receptor RIG-I and induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines and antiviral interferon. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate innate immune responses to IAV and other viruses is of key importance to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Here we used myeloid cell specific A20 knockout mice to examine the role of the ubiquitin-editing protein A20 in the response of myeloid cells to IAV infection. A20 deficient macrophages were hyperresponsive to double stranded RNA and IAV infection, as illustrated by enhanced NF-B and IRF3 activation, concomitant with increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and type I interferon. In vivo this was associated with an increased number of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs of IAV infected mice. Surprisingly, myeloid cell specific A20 knockout mice are protected against lethal IAV infection. These results challenge the general belief that an excessive host proinflammatory response is associated with IAV-induced lethality, and suggest that under certain conditions inhibition of A20 might be of interest in the management of IAV infections.","output":"A20 (Tnfaip3) Deficiency in Myeloid Cells Protects against Influenza A Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Secondary bacterial infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), lead to worse clinical outcomes and increased mortality following viral respiratory infections including in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Using a combination of tracheal aspirate bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) we assessed lower respiratory tract immune responses and microbiome dynamics in 28 COVID-19 patients, 15 of whom developed VAP, and eight critically ill uninfected controls Two days before VAP onset we observed a transcriptional signature of bacterial infection Two weeks prior to VAP onset, following intubation, we observed a striking impairment in immune signaling in COVID-19 patients who developed VAP Longitudinal metatranscriptomic analysis revealed disruption of lung microbiome community composition in patients with VAP, providing a connection between dysregulated immune signaling and outgrowth of opportunistic pathogens These findings suggest that COVID-19 patients who develop VAP have impaired antibacterial immune defense detectable weeks before secondary infection onset","output":"Impaired immune signaling and changes in the lung microbiome precede secondary bacterial pneumonia in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nosocomial transmission of viral and bacterial infections is a major problem worldwide, affecting millions of patients (and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths) per year.

RESULTS Emergency medical services agencies from nine of the 23 counties (39%) provided responses to some or all of the questions in the telephone survey. Seven of the nine out-of-state agencies provided responses to the survey. Most of the EMS agencies do not have broad, formal plans for response to large-scale bio-terrorist or pandemic events. CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate that EMS agencies in this state fundamentally are unprepared for a large-scale bioterrorism or pandemic event. The few existing plans rely heavily on mutual aid from agencies that may be incapable of providing such aid. Therefore, EMS agencies must be prepared to manage a response to these incidents without assistance from any agencies outside of their local community.

METHODS: A single-centre retrospective, observational study in a dedicated COVID-19 intensive care unit in Cape Town, South Africa. Admission arterial blood gas, serum electrolytes, renal function and blood pressure readings performed on COVID-19 patients admitted between 26 March and 2 June 2020 were analysed and compared between survivors and non-survivors. RESULTS: A total of 56 intensive care unit patients had admission arterial blood gas performed at the time of intensive care unit admission. An alkalaemia (pH > 7.45) was observed in 36 (64.3%) patients. A higher arterial pH (median 7.48 [interquartile range: 7.45-7.51] versus 7.46 [interquartile range: 7.40-7.48], P = 0.049) and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (median 7.9 kPa [interquartile range: 7.3-9.6] versus 6.5 kPa [interquartile range: 5.2-7.3], P = <0.001) were significantly associated with survival.

METHODS: We enrolled 2,688 students from a certain university in Wuhu, China. Questionnaire measures of internet addiction, social support, sleep quality, depression and background characteristics were obtained. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression, among 2,688 college students (median age [IQR]=20.49 [20.0, 21.0] years) was 30.6%. 32.4% of the students had the tendency of internet addiction, among which the proportion of mild, moderate and severe were 29.8%, 2.5% and 0.1%, respectively. In our normal internet users and internet addiction group, the incidence of depression was 22.6% and 47.2%, respectively. The findings indicated that internet addiction was directly related to college students depression and indirectly predicted students depression via the mediator of social support and sleep quality. The mediation effect of social support and sleep quality on the pathway from internet addiction to depression was 41.97% (direct effect: standardized estimate=0.177; total indirect effect: standardized estimate=0.128). The proposed model fit the data well. CONCLUSION: Social support and sleep quality may continuously mediate the link between internet addiction and depression. Therefore, the stronger the degree of internet addiction, the lower the individuals sense of social support and the worse the quality of sleep, which will ultimately the higher the degree of depression. We recommend strengthening monitoring of internet use during the COVID-19 epidemic, increasing social support and improving sleep quality, so as to reduce the risk of depression for college students.","output":"Serial Multiple Mediation of the Correlation Between Internet Addiction and Depression by Social Support and Sleep Quality of College Students During the COVID-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Generally, COVID-19 is milder in children than in adults.

Methods: This study was a cross-sectional, analytical study that was done in urban areas of Maragheh from 13 November to 20 De-cember 2020. The sample size was estimated at 672 participants, and the sampling method was stratified random. The data collec-tion instrument was a researcher-made questionnaire that consisted of four sections: demographic information, health behaviors, respondents knowledge of COVID-19, and their viewpoints on adopted public policies against this disease and was shared online. The one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression were used to analyze data with SPSS version 23. Results: The mean scores of peoples knowledge (6.42  1.2) out of 9 and health behaviors (34.8  3.9) of 36 were moderate.

Knowledge ( = 0.23) and male ( =-0.27) were the predictors of health behaviors (p < 0.001, F = 12.47). The investigation of myths on COVID-19 indicated that 17% and 41.1% of the respondents believed that alcohol consumption and using garlic and herbal drinks are effective in the prevention and 57.7% of them believed that holding the breath for 10 seconds is a sign of being healthy. Peoples views on the COVID-19 control policies were assessed to be at the medium level (48.2  7.5) of 65. The most effective policies against COVID-19 from the peoples opinions consisted of lockdown policies (96.4%), schools closure (95.9%), and constraints on intercity trips (91.3%). Conclusions: It seems necessary to strengthen measures on health knowledge promotion and implementation of health education interventions on protective behaviors of COVID-19 in such a way that right beliefs are replaced with wrong ones.

METHODS: Independent translations of the 21-item CRBS were conducted by two bilingual health professionals, followed by back-translation. A Delphi process was undertaken with five experts to consider the semantics and cross-cultural relevance of the items. Following finalization, 380 cardiac patients from 11 hospitals in Shanghai were administered a validation survey including the translated CRBS. Following exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency was assessed. Validity was tested through assessing the association of the CRBS-C/M with the CR Information Awareness Questionnaire. RESULTS: Items were refined and finalized. Factor analysis of CRBS-C/M (Kaiser Meyer Olkin = 0.867, Bartlett's test p < 0.001) revealed five factors: perceived CR need, external logistical factors, time conflicts, program and health system-level factors, and comorbidities/lack of vitality; Cronbach's alpha () of the subscales ranged from 0.67 to 0.82.

The part-worth values for the trip product elements are expected to depend on a number of traveler characteristics. The predictors hypothesized are city travel experience, general modal preference, socio-economic status, and car ownership. In the survey, the combinations of trip attributes differed between the two subgroups of leisure and business travelers. The leisure travelers rated three levels of mode, length of stay, and price, but only one level of the hotel category. The business travelers were shown four mode alternatives and only two levels for each of the other trip product elements. The conjoint measurements were elaborated by fitting an Extended BradleyCTerry Model. Demonstrating the application of the EBTM is the main purpose of the paper. The EBTM offers several advantages over the more popular versions of conjoint analysis. It correctly treats ties and allows for simultaneous estimation of the trip package (object) parameters, object covariates (trip attributes), subject covariates (traveler characteristics) and their interactions. For both the business and the leisure travelers, the mode of transport dominated the assessment of a city trip package. For leisure tourists, e.g., switching from train 2nd class to an economy flight boosted the trip package more than twice as much as replacing train for bus. A variation of the package price was much more important for the leisure than for the business travelers. The socio-economic status proved to be an important factor and was particularly influential among the business travelers. In the leisure tourists' sub-sample age was not only important for valuing the mode of transport, but had a preferential impact for all trip components.

Most respondents declared carrying the animals in their personal vehicles. Of the dressing process, 61% of sites were outdoors, 68% of the participants declared using specific knives, 64% used the same clothes as in the field, and 42% used disposable gloves. The most usual way to dispose of the remains was garbage containers (41%); offal abandonment in the field was 33%, and 13% fed domestic animals using the remains. We conclude that public health authorities should increase their interest in the self-consumption of game meat.

Both innate and adaptive immunity contribute to the heterogeneous inflammatory pathogenesis of CRS, which is driven by genetic and environmental factors and the microbiome. CRS is classified by the presence of polyps. Molecular mechanisms in CRS with nasal polyps are similar to those in atopic diseases. AREAS COVERED This review focuses on the immune pathogenesis of CRS, differences between the two CRS subtypes, and latest treatments that may aid in the provision of personalized medicine. EXPERT OPINION Basic research in the last decade has helped significantly in enhancing our knowledge of the pathophysiologic processes of CRS, due to which there is now a better understanding of the associated natural history, physiopathology, novel treatments, and prevention strategies. Treatment success depends on the clarification of the underlying pathogenesis and disease-contributing factors. The exploration of disease endotypes and introduction of novel agents are important advancements. Prior studies performed without disease-endotyping resulted in the inefficiency of certain drugs and insignificant results. The identification of biomarkers, development of personalized approaches, and utilization of disease algorithms are required for CRS therapy success.","output":"Chronic rhinosinusitis: pathogenesis, therapy options, and more."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recently identified as a novel member of beta coronaviruses (CoVs) and the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It has been first discovered in China and soon has spread across continents with an escalating number of mortalities. There is an urgent need for developing a COVID-19 vaccine to control the rapid transmission and the deleterious impact of the virus. The potent vaccine should have a good tolerable and efficacious profile to induce target-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. It should also exhibit no or minimal detrimental effects in children, young adults, and elderly people with or without co-morbidities from different racial backgrounds. Previously published findings of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) played vital role in the characterization of surface spike proteins as the tool of entry of the SARS-CoV-2 into host cells. It has become evident that SARS-CoVs have high genetic similarity and this implies antecedent vaccination strategies could be implicated in the production of COVID-19 vaccines. Although several vaccines have been approved and rolled out, only a handful of them have passed the three phases of clinical studies.

NPAs may also promote disease worsening in various inflammatory diseases. However, characterization of NPAs in cancer remains totally unexplored. Using ImageStream?X (ISX) imaging flow cytometer, we were not only allowed able to detect CD15+ CD14? CD36+ ITGA2B+ NPAs in both healthy donors (HDs) and cancer patients bloods, but we also showed that NPAs result from the binding of platelets preferentially to low-density neutrophils (LDNs) as opposed to normal-density neutrophils (NDNs). By re-analyzing two independent public scRNAseq data of whole blood leukocytes from cancer patients and HDs, we could identify a subset of neutrophils with high platelet gene expression that may correspond to NPAs. Moreover, we showed that cancer patients derived NPAs possessed a distinct molecular signature compared with the other neutrophil subsets, independently of platelet genes. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis of this NPAs-associated neutrophil transcriptomic signature revealed a significant enrichment of neutrophil degranulation, chemotaxis and trans-endothelial migration GO terms. Lastly, using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we could show by multivariate Cox analysis that the NPAs-associated neutrophil transcriptomic signature was associated with a worse patient prognosis in several cancer types. These results suggest that neutrophils from NPAs are systemically primed by platelets empowering them with cancer progression capacities once at tumor site. NPAs may therefore hold clinical utility as novel non-invasive blood prognostic biomarker in cancer patients with solid tumors.

This disease also impacts European countries, including Germany. Without effective medicines or vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions are the best strategy to reduce the number of cases. Study design: A deterministic model was simulated to evaluate the number of infectious and healthcare demand. Method: Using an age-structured SEIR model for the COVID-19 transmission, we project the COVID-19-associated demand for hospital and ICU beds within Germany. We estimated the effectiveness of different control measures, including active case-finding and quarantining of asymptomatic persons, self-isolation of people who had contact with an infectious person, and physical distancing, as well as a combination of these control measures. Results: We found that contact tracing could reduce the peak of ICU beds as well as mass testing. The time delay between diagnosis and self-isolation influences the control measures. Physical distancing to limit the contact rate would delay the peak of the outbreak, which results in the demand for ICU beds being below the capacity during the early outbreak. Conclusions: Our study analyzed several scenarios in order to provide policymakers that face the pandemic of COVID-19 with insights into the different measures available. We highlight that the individuals who have had contact with a virus-positive person must be quarantined as soon as possible to reduce contact with possible infectious cases and to reduce transmission.

Methods: Young participants in the Danish National Birth Cohort reported these measures in an 18-year follow-up in 2015-2021 and in a COVID-19 survey in spring 2021 when participants were aged 19-24 years. Changes in measures from pre to post lockdown were estimated with longitudinal data (N=7,597) and with repeated cross-sectional data (N=24,625) by linear regression. Findings: In the longitudinal comparisons 14% of women and 7% of men reported self-injury pre lockdown, which decreased 6%-points (95% CI:-7%;-5%) for women and 3%-points (95% CI:-4%;-2%) for men during lockdown.

Evidence from research studies has indicated the efficacies of surgical procedures involving appendectomies. However, in Pakistan, there is a paucity of information regarding the epidemiology, clinical presentations, and surgical management of acute appendicitis. Objective This paper aims to report the epidemiologic data and findings of surgical management of acute appendicitis in Lahore General Hospital (LGH). The data was based on our two-year experiences of appendectomies in the hospital. Materials and methodology Data were collected retrospectively. The patients underwent appendectomies performed by the team of surgeons of Surgical Unit 1 of LGH in the Accident and Emergency (A&E) Department from July 2019 to October 2021. Results The total number of patients was 506, and the mean age was 26.8. Males (67.29%) and young adults aged 18-34 years were at higher risk of appendicitis. Compared to other surgical procedures performed, open appendectomy and laparoscopic appendectomy operative times were significantly shorter. Histopathology of all the cases showed acute inflammation of the appendix. Discussion Similar to findings from other research studies, the operative time of open appendectomies was shorter (70.6 minutes) in the hospital than the operative time of laparoscopic appendectomies (77 minutes). However, the overall operative times were longer than the operative times reported in some other research studies. Also, contrary to other research findings, open appendectomy (1.22 days) was associated with a longer length of hospital stay than laparoscopic appendectomy (1 day). Simple acute appendicitis was the most predominant operation findings (289, 57.1%).

However, recent studies have also associated alpha with processes of attentional control and stability. We addressed this issue in previous experiments by delivering transcranial alternating current stimulation at 10 Hz over posterior cortex during visual tasks (alpha tACS). As this stimulation can induce reliable increases in EEG alpha power, and given that performance on each of our visual tasks was negatively associated with alpha power, we assumed that alpha tACS would reliably impair visual performance. However, alpha tACS was instead found to prevent both deteriorations and improvements in visual performance that otherwise occurred during sham & 50 Hz tACS. Alpha tACS therefore appeared to exert a stabilizing effect on visual attention. This hypothesis was tested in the current, pre-registered experiment by delivering alpha tACS during a task that required rapid switching of attention between motion, color, and auditory subtasks. We assumed that, if alpha tACS stabilizes visual attention, this stimulation should make it harder for people to switch between visual tasks, but should have little influence on transitions between auditory and visual subtasks. However, in contrast to this prediction, we observed no evidence of impairments in visuovisual vs. audiovisual switching during alpha vs. control tACS. Instead, we observed a trend-level reduction in visuoauditory switching accuracy during alpha tACS. Post-hoc analyses showed no effects of alpha tACS in response time variability, diffusion model parameters, or on performance of repeat trials. EEG analyses also showed no effects of alpha tACS on endogenous or stimulus-evoked alpha power. We discuss possible explanations for these results, as well as their broader implications for current efforts to study the roles of neural oscillations in cognition using tACS.","output":"The Effects of 10 Hz Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation on Audiovisual Task Switching."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ventricular arrhythmias are an important cause of morbidity and mortality and come in a variety of forms, from single premature ventricular complexes to sustained ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.

Threats to mental health, psychological safety, and well-being are now emerging, increasing the impact of this virus on world health. Providing support for these challenges is difficult because of the high number of people requiring support in the context of a need to maintain physical distancing. This protocol describes the use of SMS text messaging (Text4Hope) as a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention. This program is evidence-based, with prior research supporting good outcomes and high user satisfaction. OBJECTIVE: The project goal is to implement a program of daily supportive SMS text messaging (Text4Hope) to reduce distress related to the COVID-19 crisis, initially among Canadians. The prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms; the demographic correlates of the same; and the outcomes of the Text4Hope intervention in mitigating distress will be evaluated. METHODS: Self-administered anonymous online questionnaires will be used to assess stress (Perceived Stress Scale), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale [GAD-7]), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). Data will be collected at baseline (onset of SMS text messaging), the program midpoint (6 weeks), and the program endpoint (12 weeks). RESULTS: Data analysis will include parametric and nonparametric techniques, focusing on primary outcomes (ie, stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms) and metrics of use, including the number of subscribers and user satisfaction. Given the large size of the data set, machine learning and data mining methods will also be used. CONCLUSIONS: This COVID-19 project will provide key information regarding prevalence rates of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms during the pandemic; demographic correlates of distress; and outcome data related to this scalable population-level intervention.

These include gait aids, bracing, taping, orthotics and footwear. The literature regarding efficacy of mechanical interventions has been conflicting or inconclusive, and this may be because certain subgroups with knee OA respond better to mechanical interventions. Our primary aim is to identify subgroups with knee OA who respond favourably to mechanical interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic review to identify randomised clinical trials of any mechanical intervention for the treatment of knee OA. We will invite lead authors of eligible studies to share individual participant data (IPD). We will perform an IPD meta-analysis for each type of mechanical intervention to evaluate efficacy, with our main outcome being pain. Where IPD are not available, this will be achieved using aggregate data. We will then evaluate five potential treatment effect modifiers using a two-stage approach. If data permit, we will also evaluate whether biomechanics mediate the effects of mechanical interventions on pain in knee OA. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No new data will be collected in this study. We will adhere to institutional, national and international regulations regarding the secure and confidential sharing of IPD, addressing ethics as indicated.

It is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The ability to gain quick control of the pandemic has been hampered by a lack of detailed knowledge about SARS-CoV-2-host interactions, mainly in relation to viral biology and host immune response. The rapid clinical course seen in COVID-19 indicates that infection control in asymptomatic patients or patients with mild disease is probably due to the innate immune response, as, considering that SARS-CoV-2 is new to humans, an effective adaptive response would not be expected to occur until approximately 2C3 weeks after contact with the virus. Antiviral innate immunity has humoral components (complement and coagulation-fibrinolysis systems, soluble proteins that recognize glycans on cell surface, interferons, chemokines, and naturally occurring antibodies) and cellular components (natural killer cells and other innate lymphocytes). Failure of this system would pave the way for uncontrolled viral replication in the airways and the mounting of an adaptive immune response, potentially amplified by an inflammatory cascade. Severe COVID-19 appears to be due not only to viral infection but also to a dysregulated immune and inflammatory response. In this paper, the authors review the most recent publications on the immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2, virus interactions with target cells, and host immune responses, and highlight possible associations between deficient innate and acquired immune responses and disease progression and mortality.

OBJECTIVES We aimed to assess the therapeutic success of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) in severe ARF in the course of COVID-19 in a noncritical care setting as well as to identify predictors of HFNO failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS This prospective observational study was conducted between March and December 2020. We enrolled all consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in whom HFNO therapy was used. The primary outcome measure was death or endotracheal intubation within 30 days from admission. RESULTS Of the 380 patients with COVID-19, 116 individuals (30.5%) requiring HFNO due to severe pneumonia were analyzed. The primary outcome, defined as death or endotracheal intubation within 30 days from admission, occurred in 54 patients (46.6%). The overall 30-day mortality was 30.2% (35/116) in the entire cohort and 64.7% (34/51) among patients requiring endotracheal intubation. A multivariable analysis revealed that the ROX index measured within the first 12 hours of therapy below 3.85 was related to increased mortality (hazard ratio, 5.86; 95% CI, 3.03-11.35) compared with the ROX index of 4.88 or higher. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that nearly half of patients treated with HFNO due to severe COVID-19 pneumonia will require mechanical ventilation. The ROX index is a useful tool for predicting HFNO failure in this population.","output":"High-flow nasal oxygen therapy in the treatment of acute respiratory failure in severe COVID-19 pneumonia: a prospective observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social behavior is widespread in the animal kingdom, and it remarkably influences human personal and professional lives. However, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying social behavior is elusive. Integrating the seemingly different fields of robotics and preclinical research could bring new insight on social behavior. Toward this aim, we established \\"behavioral teleporting\\" as an experimental solution to independently manipulate multiple factors underpinning social interactions. Behavioral teleporting consists of real-time transfer of the complete ethogram of a live zebrafish onto a remotely-located robotic replica. Through parallel and simultaneous behavioral teleporting, we studied the interaction between two live fish swimming in remotely-located tanks: each live fish interacted with an inanimate robot that mirrored the behavior of the other fish, and the morphology of each robot was independently tailored. Our results indicate that behavioral teleporting can preserve natural interaction between two live animals, while allowing fine control over morphological features that modulate social behavior.","output":"Behavioral Teleporting of Individual Ethograms onto Inanimate Robots: Experiments on Social Interactions in Live Zebrafish"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Heavy drug users was a global consensus high-risk population of HIV infection. However, the specific impact of drug on HIV infection has not yet been established. Depressants and stimulants were most widely used drugs in mainland China, and mix use of the two drugs was also serious. We assessed the HIV infection rate and trends in heavy drug users by analyzing data from the National Dynamic Management and Control Database for Drug Users (NDMCDDU). Methods: All heavy drug users with HIV test results in NDMCDDU from 2008 to 2016 were grouped into depressants only group (DOG), stimulants only group (SOG), and both depressants and stimulants group (DSG). We used joinpoint regression to examine trends of HIV infection rates. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine factors related to HIV infection. Results: A total of 466,033 heavy drug users with 9522 cases of HIV infection were included in this analysis. HIV infection rate was estimated at 2.97% (95% CI 2.91C3.04%) of 265,774 users in DOG, 0.45% (95% CI 0.42C0.49%) of 140,895 users in SOG, and 1.65% (95% CI 1.55C1.76%) of 59,364 users in DSG. In DOG, a U-shaped curve of HIV infection rate decreased from 3.85% in 2008 to 2.19% in 2010 (annual percent change (APC) ?12.9, 95% CI ?19.3C?6.0, p < 0.05), then increased to 4.64% in 2016 (APC 8.3, 95% CI 6.1C10.4, p < 0.05) was observed. However, SOG and DSG showed consistent increases from 0.15% in 2008 to 0.54% in 2016 (APC 8.2, 95% CI 4.8C11.8, p < 0.05) and from 0.78% in 2008 to 2.72% in 2016 (APC 13.5, 95% CI 10.7C16.4, p < 0.05), respectively. HIV infection rate of DOG in the southwest region presented a U-shaped trend. All groups showed significant increases in HIV infection in east and central regions. Conclusions: The U-shaped curve for HIV infection rate among DOG users and consistent increases among SOG and DSG users implies drug abuse is still a critical focus of HIV infection in China. It is urgently needed to reassess the effectiveness of current strategies on HIV prevention and control among drug users.","output":"Epidemics of HIV Infection among Heavy Drug Users of Depressants Only, Stimulants Only, and Both Depressants and Stimulants in Mainland China: A Series, Cross-Sectional Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN En 2019, en la cuidad de Wuhan, China, se detectaron pacientes infectados con un nuevo coronavirus denominado 2019-nCoV, hoy SARS-CoV-2 El alarmante crecimiento de esta pandemia hace necesario conocer e implementar mtodos de diagnstico confiables para detectar y tratar adecuadamente a los pacientes, lo que contribuir a frenar la propagacin de la enfermedad La necesidad de tener profesionales entrenados en la toma de muestras, en las buenas prcticas de laboratorio clnico y en el manejo de tcnicas moleculares y hematolgicas es de suma importancia para identificar adecuadamente la infeccin con este virus La estandarizacin de los protocolos de obtencin, traslado y almacenamiento de la muestra es igualmente relevante para detener la expansin de la pandemia de COVID-19 causada por el SARS-CoV-2 ABSTRACT In 2019, in the city of Wuhan, China, patients were diagnosed with a novel coronavirus originally named 2019-nCoV, currently known as SARS-CoV-2 The alarming expansion of this pandemic makes it necessary to find out and implement reliable diagnostic methods in order to properly detect and treat patients, thus contributing to slowing down the spread of the disease It is extremely important to have trained professionals in sample collection, good clinical laboratory practices, and molecular and hematological techniques to adequately detect any cases of infection with this virus Moreover, standardized protocols are essential for obtaining, transferring and storing samples to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2","output":"Diagnostic tests for COVID-19: the importance of the before and the after"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enamel-only proximal caries, if detected, can be reversed by non-invasive treatments.

This pilot study measures the ability of a cohort of third-year dental students to detect enamel-only proximal caries in bitewing radiographs with and without the use of a deep learning assistive software AssistDent(R). We demonstrate an increased ability in the detection of enamel-only proximal caries by the students using AssistDent, showing a mean sensitivity level of 0.80 (95%CI {+/-} 0.04), increased from 0.50 (95%CI {+/-} 0.13) p<0.01 shown by students not using AssistDent.

The objective of the study was to modify a mannequin-based surgical simulator originally developed for trachomatous trichiasis surgery training to teach margin-involving eyelid laceration repair and to evaluate its success within a residency wet-lab environment. METHODS: We modified a previously developed mannequin-based training system for trachomatous trichiasis surgery into a simulator for margin-involving eyelid laceration repair. Six ophthalmology residents from a tertiary care academic institution performed at least one simulated margin-involving eyelid laceration repair using the surgical simulator between September 2019 and March 2020. Each session was video recorded. Two oculoplastic surgeons reviewed the videos in a blinded fashion to assess surgical proficiency using a standardized grading system. Participants were surveyed on their comfort level with eyelid laceration repair pre- and post-completion of simulation. They were also queried on their perceived usefulness of the surgical simulator compared to past methods and experiences. RESULTS: Six residents completed 11 simulation surgeries. For three residents who completed more than one session, a slight increase in their skills assessment score and a decrease in operative time over two to three simulation sessions were found. Self-reported comfort level with margin-involving eyelid laceration repairs was significantly higher post-simulation compared to pre-simulation (p = 0.02). Residents ranked the usefulness of our surgical simulator higher than past methods such as fruit peels, surgical skill boards, gloves, and pig feet (p = 0.03) but lower than operating room experience (p = 0.02). Residents perceived the surgical simulator to be as useful as cadaver head and emergency department/consult experience. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a surgical simulator for teaching eyelid laceration repair and showed its utility in developing trainees surgical skills.

While there is evidence on ethnicity and single conditions and comorbidities, no review has attempted to look across these from a MLTCs perspective. As such, we currently have an incomplete understanding of the extent of ethnic inequalities in the prevalence of MLTCs. In this systematic review we aimed to 1) describe the literature that provides evidence of ethnicity and prevalence of MLTCs amongst people living in the UK, and 2) summarise the prevalence estimates of MLTCs across ethnic groups. We registered the protocol on PROSPERO (CRD42020218061). Between October and December 2020, we searched ASSIA, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, OpenGrey, and reference lists of key studies/reviews. The main outcome was prevalence estimates for MLTCs for at least one minoritised ethnic group, compared to the majority white population. We included studies conducted in the UK reporting on ethnicity and prevalence of MLTCs. To summarise the prevalence estimates of MLTCs across ethnic groups we included only studies of MLTCs that provided estimates adjusted at least for age. Two reviewers screened and extracted data from a random sample of studies (10%). Data were synthesised using narrative synthesis. Of the 7949 studies identified, 84 met criteria for inclusion. Of these, seven contributed to the evidence of ethnic inequalities in MLTCs. Five of the seven studies point to higher prevalence of MLTCs in at least one minoritised ethnic group compared to their white counterparts. Because the number/types of health conditions varied between studies and some ethnic populations were aggregated, the findings may not accurately reflect the true level of inequality. Thus, our conclusions can only be tentative. Future research should consider key explanatory factors, including those at the macrolevel (e.g. racism, discrimination), as they may play a role in the development of MLTCs in different ethnic groups.","output":"Ethnic inequalities in multiple long-term health conditions in the United Kingdom: a systematic review and narrative synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online misinformation regarding COVID-19 has undermined public health efforts to control the novel coronavirus.

First, research suggests that fact-checking has several important limitations and is rarely successful in fully undoing the effects of misinformation exposure. Second, there are many factors driving misinformation sharing and acceptance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic-such as emotions, distrust, cognitive biases, racism, and xenophobia-and these factors both make individuals more vulnerable to certain types of misinformation and also make them impervious to future correction attempts.

To compensate, triangulation is necessary, but the operative field becomes inadequate. To overcome this problem, intracorporeal attachable and detachable instruments can broaden the field of visceral tissue by retracting from at least 2 points. OBJECTIVE We tested this new procedure for colon cancer surgery. DESIGN This is a prospective study. SETTING This study was conducted at a single-center hospital. PATIENTS Ten consecutive patients (3 male and 7 female) with stage II or III colon cancer underwent the procedure. INTERVENTIONS All patients received a 3.0-cm incision at the umbilicus or right iliac fossa. At least 2 clips and a suspending bar were inserted through a 12-mm port in a multiport access device. The clips grasped the mesocolon at different points and were retracted with either an extracorporeal magnet or fine-loop retractors; this broadened the operative field in the mesocolon by at least 2 points. The mesocolon was dissected with a medial to lateral approach. The suspended bar was tied to 2 fine-loop retractors and manipulated to enlarge the operative field in the mesocolon. The roots of the vascular pedicles were isolated and divided during lymph node dissection. After extracting the specimen, an anastomosis was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Intra- and postoperative complications due to inadequate access were the primary outcomes measured. RESULTS There were no intraoperative complications and no need for conversions to open surgery or second access ports. The median total surgical time was 182 minutes (range, 122-245). Surgical blood loss was slight (range, 1-20 mL) in all patients. No postoperative complications occurred. The postoperative hospital stay was 5 to 7 days. LIMITATIONS The sample size was small.

We further aimed to compare inflammation, coagulation and organ dysfunction in patients with and without venous thromboembolism (VTE). METHODS: This observational study included patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary hospital in Sweden and screened for DVT with proximal compression ultrasound of the lower extremities between April and July 2020. Screening was performed by ICU residents having received a short online education and one hands-on-session. Pathological screening ultrasound was confirmed by formal ultrasound whereas patients with negative screening underwent formal ultrasound on clinical suspicion. Clinical data, laboratory findings and follow-up were extracted from medical records. RESULTS: Of 90 eligible patients, 56 were screened by seven ICU residents with no (n = 5) or limited (n = 2) previous experience of DVT ultrasound who performed a median of 4 (IQR 2C19) examinations. Four (7.1%) patients had pathological screening ultrasound of which three (5.6%) were confirmed by formal ultrasound. None of the 52 patients with negative screening ultrasound were diagnosed with DVT during follow-up. Six patients were diagnosed with PE of which four prior to negative screening and two following negative and positive screening respectively. Patients with VTE (n = 8) had higher median peak D-dimer (24.0 (IQR 14.2C50.5) vs. 2.8 (IQR 1.7C7.2) mg/L, p = 0.004), mean peak C-reactive protein (363 (SD 80) vs. 285 (SD 108) mg/L, p = 0.033) and median peak plasma creatinine (288 (IQR 131C328) vs. 94 (IQR 78C131) mol/L, p = 0.009) compared to patients without VTE (n = 48).

The BC COVID-19 Population Mixing Patterns survey (BC-Mix) was established as a surveillance system to measure behaviour and contact patterns in BC over time to inform the timing of the easing/re-imposition of control measures. In this paper, we describe the BC-Mix survey design and the demographic characteristics of respondents. MethodsThe ongoing repeated online survey was launched in September 2020. Participants are mainly recruited through social media platforms (including Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp). A follow up survey is sent to participants two to four weeks after completing the baseline survey. Survey responses are weighted to BCs population by age, sex, geography, and ethnicity to obtain generalizable estimates. Additional indices such as the material and social deprivation index, residential instability, economic dependency, and others are generated using census and location data.

Different interpretations of how to measure partners treated due to DIS efforts complicates PN evaluation. We measured PN impact by counting partners treated for syphilis after DIS interviewed the patient. METHODS We reviewed data from early syphilis cases reported during 2015-2017 in seven jurisdictions. We compared infected partners brought to treatment using: 1) DIS-assigned disposition codes or 2) all infected partners treated 0-90 days after the patient's interview (adjusted treatment estimate). Stratified analyses assessed patient characteristics associated with the adjusted treatment estimate. RESULTS DIS interviewed 23,613 patients who reported 20,890 partners with locating information. Many of the 3,569 (17.1%) partners classified by DIS as brought to treatment were treated before the patient was interviewed. There were 2,359 (11.3%) partners treated 0-90 days after the patient's interview. Treatment estimates were more consistent between programs when measured using our adjusted estimates (range 6.1%-14.8% per patient interviewed) compared to DIS-assigned disposition (range 6.1%-28.3%).

Approximately one quarter of patients infected with COVID-19 require ICU care, and among these patients, the mortality increases to 49%.

Similarly, an effective quarantine policy that isolates or hospital- izes diseased individuals as soon as possible, to limit their activity, is an important reason for the reduction in the rates of severe and critical disease in China.

It is characterized by the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix. This leads to structural alterations in the tissue, causing permanent damage and organ dysfunction. Depending on the organ it effects, fibrosis can be a serious threat to human life. The molecular mechanism of fibrosis is still not fully understood, but the NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrinCdomainCcontaining protein 3) inflammasome appears to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of fibrotic disease. The NLRP3 inflammasome has been the most extensively studied inflammatory pathway to date. It is a crucial component of the innate immune system, and its activation mediates the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-18. NLRP3 activation has been strongly linked with fibrosis and drives the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts by the chronic upregulation of IL-1 and IL-18 and subsequent autocrine signaling that maintains an activated inflammasome. Both IL-1 and IL-18 are profibrotic, however IL-1 can have antifibrotic capabilities. NLRP3 responds to a plethora of different signals that have a common but unidentified unifying trigger. Even after 20 years of extensive investigation, regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is still not completely understood. However, what is known about NLRP3 is that its regulation and activation is complex and not only driven by various activators but controlled by numerous post-translational modifications. More recently, there has been an intensive attempt to discover NLRP3 inhibitors to treat chronic diseases. This review addresses the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in fibrotic disorders across many different tissues.

Such measures may also impact the spread of other pathogens, including influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) with implications for future annual epidemics and expectations for the subsequent northern hemisphere winter. METHODS: We assessed the detection of influenza and RSV through facility-based syndromic surveillance of adults and children with mild or severe respiratory illness in South Africa from January to October 2020, and compared this with surveillance data from 2013 to 2019. RESULTS: Facility-based surveillance revealed a decline in influenza virus detection during the regular season compared with previous years. This was observed throughout the implementation of COVID-19 control measures. RSV detection decreased soon after the most stringent COVID-19 control measures commenced; however, an increase in RSV detection was observed after the typical season, following the re-opening of schools and the easing of measures. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions led to reduced circulation of influenza and RSV in South Africa. This has limited the countrys ability to provide influenza virus strains for the selection of the annual influenza vaccine. Delayed increases in RSV case numbers may reflect the easing of COVID-19 control measures. An increase in influenza virus detection was not observed, suggesting that the measures may have impacted the two pathogens differently. The impact that lowered and/or delayed influenza and RSV circulation in 2020 will have on the intensity and severity of subsequent annual epidemics is unknown and warrants close monitoring.","output":"Decline of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus detection in facility-based surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa, January to October 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Staff stress, burnout, and compassion fatigue related to increasing demands of oncology care have been further compounded by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this context, unbalanced ROS/RNS levels that connected to increased aerobic fermentation, which linked to alpha-tubulin-based cell restructuration and control of cell cycle progression, was identified as major complex trait for early de novo programming ( CoV-MAC-TED) during SARS-CoV-2 infection. This trait was highlighted as critical target for developing early anti-viral/anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategies. To obtain this result, analyses had been performed on transcriptome data from diverse experimental cell systems. A call was released for wide data collection of the defined set of genes for transcriptome analyses, named ReprogVirus, which should be based on strictly standardized protocols and data entry from diverse virus types and variants into the ReprogVirus Platform. This platform is currently under development. However, so far an in vitro cell system from primary target cells for virus attacks that could ideally serve for standardizing data collection of early SARS-CoV-2 infection responses was not defined.

Patients were divided into two groups based on the occurrence of adverse events during hospitalization. Heart and respiratory rate were monitored continuously and an automated EWS was calculated every 5 minutes. Data were compared between groups. RESULTS: Prior to the occurrence of adverse events, significantly higher median heart and respiration rate and significantly lower median SPO2 values were observed. Mean and median automated EWS were significantly higher in patients with an adverse event. CONCLUSION: Continuous monitoring systems might help to detect clinical deterioration in COVID-19 patients at an earlier stage.

Patients with cardiovascular disease are at risk of poor outcomes from deferral of healthcare during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Little is known about recovery of cardiovascular hospitalizations or procedural volume following the COVID-19 surges. We sought to examine the cardiovascular diagnoses requiring healthcare utilization surrounding the first and second COVID-19 waves and characterize trends in return to pre-pandemic levels at a tertiary care center in Massachusetts. METHODS: : Using electronic health records and administrative claims data, we performed a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing cardiovascular procedures and admitted to inpatient cardiology services throughout the first two COVID surges. ICD-10 codes were used to categorize admissions. RESULTS: : Patients who presented for care during the initial COVID-19 surge were younger, had higher comorbidity burden, and longer length-of-stay compared with pre- and post-surge. Marked declines in admissions in the first wave (to 29% of pre-surge levels) followed eventually by complete recovery were noted across all cardiac diagnoses, with smaller declines seen in the second wave. Cardiac procedural volume declined significantly during the initial surge but quickly rebounded post-surge, eventually eclipsing pre-COVID. CONCLUSIONS: : There was a gradual but initially incomplete recovery to pre-surge levels of hospitalizations and procedures during the reopening phase, which eventually rebounded to meet or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels.

Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes and the structural proteins revealed that CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013 had a close relationship with post-2010 Chinese PEDV strains and US strains identified in 2013. The nucleotide identity between the two Jiangxi strains (CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013) and 30 strains of PEDV identified ante-2010 and post-2010 ranged from 96.3C97.0% and 97.3C99.7%, respectively. Multiple nucleotide and deduced amino acid mutations were observed in the ORF1a/b, S, ORF3, E, M and N genes among the current field PEDV strains when compared to the CV777 strain. Some of the mutations altered the amino acid charge and hydrophilicity, and notably, there was an amino acid substitution in the middle of one neutralizing epitope (L1371I) of the S gene of both CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013. Taken together, the accumulated genetic variations of the current field PEDV strains might have led to antigenic changes of the viruses, which might confer the less effectiveness or failure of the CV777-based vaccines currently being widely used in Jiangxi, China.","output":"Molecular Characterization and Phylogenetic Analysis of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Viruses Associated with Outbreaks of Severe Diarrhea in Piglets in Jiangxi, China 2013"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, an outbreak due to extreme acute Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cow-2) respiratory syndrome was first identified in Wuhan, China The 2019 global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 culminated in an extraordinarily strong risk for spreading No medications in large-scale trials have been validated with substantial effectiveness of clinical care for COVID-19 patients considering the declining pattern of COVID-19 Remdesivir is deemed the most promising antiviral agent;it acts by inhibiting RNA-dependent polymerase RNA function (RdRp) No medications in large-scale trials have been validated with substantial effectiveness of clinical care for COVID-19 patients considering the declining pattern of COVID-19 Remdesivir is deemed the most promising antiviral agent;it acts by inhibiting RNA-dependent polymerase RNA function (RdRp) No medications in large-scale trials have been validated with substantial effectiveness of clinical care for COVID-19 patients considering the declining pattern of COVID-19 Remdesivir is deemed the most promising antiviral agent;it acts by inhibiting RNA-dependent polymerase RNA function (RdRp)","output":"COVID-19 care options: Facts and Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study was conducted to identify and describe the implementation of public services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kecamatan Sambaliung Kabupaten Berau.

Moreover, it is unknown whether endogenously derived antibodies drive viral clearance that might result in mitigation of clinical severity during natural infection. We developed a series of non-linear mathematical models to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 viral and antibody kinetics are coupled or governed by separate processes. Patients with severe disease had a higher production rate of IgG but not IgM antibodies. Maximal levels of both isotypes were governed by their production rate rather than different saturation levels between people. Our results suggest that an exponential surge in IgG levels occurs approximately 5C10 days after symptom onset with no requirement for continual antigenic stimulation. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies appear to have limited to no effect on viral dynamics but may enhance viral clearance late during primary infection resulting from the binding effect of antibody to virus, rather than neutralization. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies may play only a limited role in clearing infection from the nasal passages despite providing long-term immunity against infection following vaccination or prior infection.","output":"Endogenously Produced SARS-CoV-2 Specific IgG Antibodies May Have a Limited Impact on Clearing Nasal Shedding of Virus during Primary Infection in Humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Perioperative management of patients with an anterior mediastinal mass is difficult.

AIMS: To evaluate the association between mental disorders and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes following COVID-19. METHOD: We performed a cohort study using the Korean COVID-19 patient database based on national health insurance data. Each person with a mental or behavioural disorder (diagnosed during the 6 months prior to their first SARS-CoV-2 test) was matched by age, gender and Charlson Comorbidity Index with up to four people without mental disorders. SARS-CoV-2-positivity risk and the risk of death or severe events (intensive care unit admission, use of mechanical ventilation and acute respiratory distress syndrome) post-infection were calculated using conditional logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Among 230 565 people tested for SARS-CoV-2, 33 653 (14.6%) had mental disorders; 928/33 653 (2.76%) tested SARS-CoV-2 positive and 56/928 (6.03%) died. In multivariable analysis using the matched cohort, there was no association between mental disorders and SARS-CoV-2-positivity risk (odds ratio OR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.87-1.04); however, a higher risk was associated with schizophrenia-related disorders (OR = 1.50; 95% CI 1.14-1.99). Among confirmed COVID-19 patients, the mortality risk was significantly higher in patients with than in those without mental disorders (OR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.15-3.43). CONCLUSIONS: Mental disorders are likely contributing factors to mortality following COVID-19. Although the infection risk was not higher for people with mental disorders overall, those with schizophrenia-related disorders were more vulnerable to infection.","output":"Association of mental disorders with SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe health outcomes: nationwide cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using nasal prong cannula may meet opposition, because it is not a standalone eye-protective device, but an add-on to the protective eye goggles [2][3][4][6] Hence, eye goggles and safety face shields are mandatorily employed to protect eyes and curtail ocular transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [Extracted from the article] Copyright of Journal of Neurosciences in Rural Practice is the property of Wolters Kluwer India Pvt Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Defogging Strategy for Protective Eye Goggles to Prevent Microorganism Transmission While Performing Neurosurgical Procedures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rotavirus is the important etiological agents of infectious diarrhea among children under 5 years old. Rotaviruses are divided into ten serogroups (A-J) and each group is based on genetic properties of major structural protein VP6. We designed a novel VP6 sequence optimization to increase the expression level of this protein. Numerous factors such as codon adaptation index, codon pair bias, and GC content were adapted based on E. coli codon usage. In addition, the ribosome binding site of pET-15b was redesigned by the RBS calculator and the secondary structure of VP6 mRNA was optimized in the whole length of the coding sequence. Various factors including IPTG concentration, temperature and induction time were analyzed for the optimization of the best expression in E. coli by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. The recombinant VP6 (rVP6) protein was purified by the Ni-sepharose and then the hyper-immune sera were generated against rVP6 in rabbits. Among three different temperatures, IPTG concentrations, and post inductions, the level of rVP6 was higher at 37C, 1mM of IPTG, and 8 hours, respectively. Also, the high expression level of rVP6 was obtained in the insoluble aggregate form (43.8 g.L-1 ). After purification, the yield of rVP6 was 10.83 g.L-1 . The rVP6 specific antiserum was confirmed by both Immunofluorescent and western blot analyses. The versatile sequence optimization was the reason to produce a high level of rVP6 compared to other reports and can potentially apply to produce cheaper commercial kits in order to diagnose serological tests and new rotavirus vaccines.

However, there is significant variability across cancer types in the extent of disease burden and modalities of cancer treatment that may impact morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Therefore, we evaluated COVID-19 outcomes in patients with a history of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with a history of DTC and SARS-CoV2 infection from two academic Los Angeles healthcare systems. Demographic, thyroid cancer and treatment data were analyzed for association with COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: Of 21 patients with DTC and COVID-19, 8 were hospitalized (38.1%) and 2 died (9.5%) from COVID-19. Thyroid cancer initial disease burden and extent, treatment, or current response to therapy (e.g. excellent vs. incomplete) were not associated with COVID-19 severity among DTC patients. However, older age and the presence of a comorbidity other than DTC were significantly associated with hospitalization for COVID-19 (p=0.047 and p=0.024, respectively). COVID-19 attributed hospitalization and mortality in DTC patients was lower than previously reported in cancer patients, but similar to patients with non-thyroid malignancies in these centers. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that among patients with DTC, advanced age and comorbid conditions are significant contributors to the risk of hospitalization from SARS-CoV2 infection, rather than factors associated with thyroid cancer diagnosis, treatment, or burden of disease.

We hypothesized that endothelial damage may lead to substantially increased concentrations of von Willebrand factor with subsequent relative deficiency of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13). DESIGN: Prospective controlled cross-over trial. SETTING: Blood samples of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 and healthy controls were obtained in three German hospitals and analyzed in a German hemostaseologic laboratory. PATIENTS: Seventy-five patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 of mild to critical severity and 30 healthy controls. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: von Willebrand factor antigen, ADAMTS13, and von Willebrand factor multimer formation were analyzed. von Willebrand factor antigen was 4.1 times higher in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls (p < 0.0001), whereas ADAMTS13 activities were not significantly different (p = 0.18). The ADAMTS13/von Willebrand factor antigen ratio was significantly lower in COVID-19 than in the control group (24.4  20.5 vs 82.0  30.7; p < 0.0001). Fourteen patients (18.7%) undercut a critical ratio of 10 as described in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Gel analysis of multimers resembled a thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura pattern with loss of the largest multimers in 75% and a smeary triplet pattern in 39% of the patients. The ADAMTS13/von Willebrand factor antigen ratio decreased continuously from mild to critical disease (analysis of variance p = 0.026). Furthermore, it differed significantly between surviving patients and those who died from COVID-19 (p = 0.001) yielding an area under the curve of 0.232 in receiver operating characteristic curve curve analysis. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with a substantial increase in von Willebrand factor levels, which can exceed the ADAMTS13 processing capacity resulting in the formation of large von Willebrand factor multimers indistinguishable from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. The ADAMTS13/von Willebrand factor antigen ratio is an independent predictor of severity of disease and mortality. These findings provide a rationale to consider plasma exchange as a therapeutic option in COVID-19 and to include von Willebrand factor and ADAMTS13 in the diagnostic workup.","output":"von Willebrand Factor Multimer Formation Contributes to Immunothrombosis in Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adequate safety precautions and proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in hospitalized patients with health care-associated infections (HAIs) are the most effective preventions in their spread.

Rapid vaccination of additional people will prevent new infections among both the unvaccinated and the vaccinated, thus saving lives. With the rapid rollout of vaccination efforts this year, the internet has become a dominant source of information about COVID-19 vaccines, their safety and efficacy, and their availability. We sought to evaluate whether trends in internet searches related to COVID-19 vaccination - as reflected by Google's Vaccine Search Insights (VSI) index - could be used as a marker of population-level interest in receiving a vaccination. We found that between January and August of 2021: 1) Google's weekly VSI index was associated with the number of new vaccinations administered in the subsequent three weeks, and 2) the average VSI index in earlier months was strongly correlated (up to r = 0.89) with vaccination rates many months later. Given these results, we illustrate an approach by which data on search interest may be combined with other available data to inform local public health outreach and vaccination efforts.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed at four verified Level I trauma centers spanning three geographical regions across the United States (US). The study period spanned from April 1, 2020 C July 31, 2020 including a month-matched 2019 cohort. Patients were categorized into pre-COVID-19 (PCOV19) and first COVID-19 surge (FCOV19S) cohorts.

RESULTS: A total 5,616 patients presented to participating study centers during the PCOV19 (2,916) and FCOV19S (2,700) study periods. Blunt injury volume decreased (p = 0.006) due to a significant reduction in the number of motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) (p = 0.003). Penetrating trauma experienced a significant increase, 8% (246/2916) in 2019 to 11% (285/2,700) in 2020 (p = 0.007), which was associated with study site (p = 0.002), not SAHOs. Finally, study site was significantly associated with changes in nearly all injury mechanisms, whereas SAHOs accounted for observed decreases in calculated weekly averages of blunt injuries (p < 0.02) and MVCs (p = 0.003).

Encephalitis is an inflammatory condition of the brain that has been described as a severe neurological complication of COVID\\\\19. Despite a growing number of reported cases, encephalitis related to COVID\\\\19 infection has not been adequately characterised. To address this gap, this systematic review and meta\\\\analysis aims to describe the incidence, clinical course, and outcomes of patients who suffer from encephalitis as a complication of COVID\\\\19. METHODS: All studies published between 1 November 2019 and 24 October 2020 that reported on patients who developed encephalitis as a complication of COVID\\\\19 were included. Only cases with radiological and/or biochemical evidence of encephalitis were included. RESULTS: In this study, 610 studies were screened and 23 studies reporting findings from 129,008 patients, including 138 with encephalitis, were included. The average time from diagnosis of COVID\\\\19 to onset of encephalitis was 14.5 days (range = 10.8C18.2 days). The average incidence of encephalitis as a complication of COVID\\\\19 was 0.215% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.056%C0.441%). The average mortality rate of encephalitis in COVID\\\\19 patients was 13.4% (95% CI = 3.8%C25.9%). These patients also had deranged clinical parameters, including raised serum inflammatory markers and cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although encephalitis is an uncommon complication of COVID\\\\19, when present, it results in significant morbidity and mortality. Severely ill COVID\\\\19 patients are at higher risk of suffering from encephalitis as a complication of the infection.","output":"Encephalitis as a neurological complication of COVID\\\\19: A systematic review and meta\\\\analysis of incidence, outcomes, and predictors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-verbal behavior is essential for embodied agents like social robots, virtual avatars, and digital humans. Existing behavior authoring approaches including keyframe animation and motion capture are too expensive to use when there are numerous utterances requiring gestures. Automatic generation methods show promising results, but their output quality is not satisfactory yet, and it is hard to modify outputs as a gesture designer wants. We introduce a new gesture generation toolkit, named SGToolkit, which gives a higher quality output than automatic methods and is more efficient than manual authoring. For the toolkit, we propose a neural generative model that synthesizes gestures from speech and accommodates fine-level pose controls and coarse-level style controls from users. The user study with 24 participants showed that the toolkit is favorable over manual authoring, and the generated gestures were also human-like and appropriate to input speech.

But while so far all bat-borne paramyxoviruses have been identified in fruit bats across Africa, Australia, South America, and Asia, we describe the detection and characterization of the first paramyxoviruses in free-ranging European bats. Moreover, we examined the possible impact of paramyxovirus infection on individual animals by comparing histo-pathological findings and virological results. Organs from deceased insectivorous bats of various species were sampled in Germany and tested for paramyxovirus RNA in parallel to a histo-pathological examination. Nucleic acids of three novel paramyxoviruses were detected, two viruses in phylogenetic relationship to the recently proposed genus Jeilongvirus and one closely related to the genus Rubulavirus. Two infected animals revealed subclinical pathological changes within their kidneys, suggestive of a similar pathogenesis as the one described in fruit bats experimentally infected with Hendra virus. Our findings indicate the presence of bat-born paramyxoviruses in geographic areas free of fruit bat species and therefore emphasize a possible virusChost co-evolution in European bats. Since these novel viruses are related to the very distinct genera Rubulavirus and Jeilongvirus, a similarly broad genetic diversity among paramyxoviruses in other Microchiroptera compared to Megachiroptera can be assumed. Given that the infected bats were either found in close proximity to heavily populated human habitation or areas of intensive agricultural use, a potential risk of the emergence of zoonotic paramyxoviruses in Europe needs to be considered.","output":"Novel Paramyxoviruses in Free-Ranging European Bats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: We aimed to study the demographic and clinical profile of patients who sought teleconsultation for psychiatric disorders from august 2020 to January 2021. MATERIALS & METHODS: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, data was retrieved from the telepsychiatry services and was analyzed to examine the demographic and clinical parameters of patients. RESULTS: Atotal of 3444 teleconsultations were sought with a mean age of 37.78  15.08. About 80% of the patients were in the age group of 20-60 years. Females outnumbered males with 1938 (56.3%) females and 1538 (43.7%) males. Mood disorders were the most frequent diagnosis with Major Depressive Disorder in 1572 (45.6%) and Bipolar Disorder in 636 (18.5%). Co-morbidity was present in 234 (6.8%) of the study group. The mean psychotropics prescribed were 1.95  0.84. One, two, three and four psychotropics were prescribed in 918 (26.7%), 1470 (42.7%), 900 (26.1%) and 42 (1.2%) respectively. Those aged < 20 years or  60 years prescribed psychotropics at lower rates in comparison to the 20-60 years age group. Female patients had a significantly higher rate of psychotropic prescription than male patients. Three or four psychotropics were prescribed to those with co-morbidity at a significantly higher rate. CONCLUSION: Demographic and clinical profile of patients seeking treatment through telepsychiatry was found to be comparable with face-to-face outpatient consultations.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to understand peoples perceptions about the illness and their subsequent behaviour. In the present study we aimed to assess risk and illness perceptions about COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic in a community sample and to assess whether illness perception dimensions, dispositional optimism, compared risk and perceived self-efficacy are predictors of individual risk perception for COVID-19. The participants were 549 Portuguese adults not infected by COVID-19 who completed an online survey. Our findings showed that individual and compared risk perceptions about COVID-19 were high as well as concern, negative emotional representation, and perceived consequences. The predictive model showed that 54% of the variance of the perceived individual risk was explained by compared risk, followed by concern, emotional representation, and self-efficacy. These findings highlight the importance of comparative risk (unrealistic comparative optimism) in the formation of individual risk perception. Social comparison can be an important factor for risk perception and the adoption of protective behaviours for COVID-19.

The lack of PPE left health care professionals with a complicated ethical dilemma: Is there an ethical duty to care for patients in the absence of proper PPE? This article seeks to help the individual nurse (a) understand the ethical dilemma and the tensions that it brings, (b) look to the literature for guidance, and (c) understand how individuals can apply these ethical principles. After careful analysis, the recommendation is for the individual nurse to make a thorough assessment of their personal situation. This will include consideration for their family, community, financial responsibilities, legal protections, organizational policies, and personal health risk.

We assessed task- and domain-level dysfunction and relationships between clinical and patient-reported outcomes. ResultsPatients scored significantly lower on delayed verbal memory, attention, and executive functioning than healthy controls and in each of these domains, 10-20% of patients scored below cutoff. Delayed Memory was particularly affected and a rather small proportion of its variace was explained by hospitalization ({beta} = -.67, p < .01) and age ({beta} = -.03, p < .01; R2adj. = .06).

Factors such as the density of cats within the population or the sex-ratio can have potentially strong effects on the frequency of fight between individuals and hence appear as important population risk factors for FIV. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To study such population risk factors, we present data on FIV prevalence in 15 cat populations in northeastern France. We investigate five key social factors of cat populations; the density of cats, the sex-ratio, the number of males and the mean age of males and females within the population. We overcome the problem of dependence in the infective status data using sexually-structured dynamic stochastic models. Only the age of males and females had an effect (p = 0.043 and p = 0.02, respectively) on the male-to-female transmission rate. Due to multiple tests, it is even likely that these effects are, in reality, not significant. Finally we show that, in our study area, the data can be explained by a very simple model that does not invoke any risk factor. CONCLUSION: Our conclusion is that, in host-parasite systems in general, fluctuations due to stochasticity in the transmission process are naturally very large and may alone explain a larger part of the variability in observed disease prevalence between populations than previously expected. Finally, we determined confidence intervals for the simple model parameters that can be used to further aid in management of the disease.","output":"Using Dynamic Stochastic Modelling to Estimate Population Risk Factors in Infectious Disease: The Example of FIV in 15 Cat Populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When COVID-19 emerged in Indonesia in early 2020, students had to learn from home to prevent the spread of the virus The changing activity could effect on physical and mental health caused by students behavior during learning from home Survey showed that 84% students of Industrial Engineering, Mulawarman University used smartphone while learning from home Therefore, this study aimed to identify students behavior, to measure physical (i e , musculoskeletal and visual fatique) and mental health (i e , stress and smartphone addiction) problems that occurred when they were learning from home, as well as to suggest ergonomic recommendation for reducing the negative effects At the time of the study, they were 155 students studied in the IE department and a total of 134 (86 45%) participated in the online survey Musculoskeletal disorder was assessed using Nordic Body Map and visual fatique was evaluated using symptoms that were reported on previous studies Additionally, Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were administered to identify smartphone addiction tendency and stress level respectively The results showed that MSD occurred in left and right shoulder (95%), followed by upper neck (82 14%) and back (72 62%) 86% of participants experienced visual fatique with headache (71 55%), ache eye (68%) and dry eye (60 34%) symptoms Subsequently, this survey revealed that 35% of the participants addicted to smartphone and 68 66% experienced moderate level of stress To alleviate these physical problems, several ergonomic recommendations were proposed i e , supporting the arm that holding the smartphone with the other hand, practicing the 20-20-20 rule and applying stop, drop and flop slogan Moreover, cooperation among parents, students and lecturers was needed to create conducive learning environment so as the mental health problems could be minimized","output":"Analisis Ergonomi Pada Perkuliahan Daring Menggunakan Smartphone Selama Masa Pandemi COVID-19: Studi Kasus Mahasiswa Prodi Teknik Industri Universitas Mulawarman"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine services can be classified into the macro-categories of specialist Telemedicine, Tele-health and Tele-assistance.

One such factor might be the seaweed-rich diet commonly consumed in Japan. COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface and downregulates ACE2, likely elevating the ratio of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to ACE2. The overreaction of the immune system, combined with the cytokine storm and ACE dominance, is purported to cause the condition of COVID-19 patients to deteriorate rapidly. Dietary seaweeds contain numerous components, including ACE inhibitory peptides, soluble dietary fibers (eg, fucoidan, porphyran), omega-3 fatty acids, fucoxanthin, fucosterol, vitamins D(3) and B(12), and phlorotannins. These components exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral effects directly as well as indirectly through prebiotic effects. It is possible that ACE inhibitory components could minimize the ACE dominance caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, dietary seaweeds might confer protection against COVID-19 through multiple mechanisms.

AIM: To analyse death risk due to coinfections in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The odds of death of 212 severely ill COVID-19 patients were evaluated, with detailed focus on the risks for each pathogen, site of infection, comorbidities and length of hospitalization. FINDINGS: The mortality rate was 50.47%. Fungal and/or bacterial isolation occurred in 89 patients, of whom 83.14% died. Coinfected patients stayed hospitalized longer and had an increased odds of dying (odds ratio (OR): 13.45; R2 = 0.31). The risk of death was increased by bacterial (OR: 11.28) and fungal (OR: 5.97) coinfections, with increased levels of creatinine, leucocytes, urea and C-reactive protein. Coinfections increased the risk of death if patients suffered from cardiovascular disease (OR: 11.53), diabetes (OR: 6.00) or obesity (OR: 5.60) in comparison with patients with these comorbidities but without pathogen isolation. The increased risk of death was detected for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (OR: 25.39), Candida non-albicans (OR: 11.12), S. aureus (OR: 10.72), Acinetobacter spp. (OR: 6.88), Pseudomonas spp. (OR: 4.77), and C. albicans (OR: 3.97). The high-risk sites of infection were blood, tracheal aspirate, and urine. Patients with coinfection undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation were 3.8 times more likely to die than those without positive cultures.

The reason some municipalities are successful may come from a realization of their municipal power. The Regional Revitalization Law of 2014 certainly facilitated municipalities in examining their demographic situations, and to realize their municipal power. However, it is questionable how much municipal power has been taken into consideration in community revitalization. Let us reiterate then, the very first step for regional revitalization is to realize its own municipal power, be it positive or negative. In the era of the so-called Society 5.0 , this chapter explores some successful cases of community revitalization through the active use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) programs. We pay close attention to successful application of community building, such as drones, the Internet of Things (IoT), open data, cloud service, crowdfunding, inbound tourism, and economies-sharing. We come to realize that modern ICT programs can help, but communities determination to assess their municipal power, both strengths and weaknesses, is of most importance. We must admit that there are some unresolved issues in the study. We are most willing to set them as essential themes for the future research of community revitalization in Japan. At this point we can point out two essential unresolved issues for future research. First, we emphasized municipal power such as marriage power, household type, and economic indicators for the population-sustaining power of municipalities. However, in our future research we need to explore other aspects of municipal power, to allow the pursuit of regional revitalization more effectively. Although it is difficult to measure, we need to tap on the subjective dimension of people who facilitate community revitalization. Second, we have made deliberate efforts in taking the Goki-Shichido, particularly its provinces, as our theoretical framework to examine regional differences in municipal power, especially within the same prefecture. We were successful in examining such prefectures as Tokyo and Aichi of the Tokaido region, Aomori and Yamagata of the Tosando region, Osaka of the Kinai region, Shimane of the Sannindo region, Kochi of the Nankaido region, and Fukuoka of the Saikaido region. Nevertheless, we need to test municipal power in other prefectures within the prefectural variations, such as Nagano of the Tosando, Shizuoka and Mie of the Tokaido, Hiroshima of the Sannyodo, and Fukui, Ishikawa, and Niigata of the Hokurikudo. Only if we know these prefectural, the Goki-Shichido, and provincial variations can we say that taking the Goki-Shichido as our theoretical framework for regional variation is validated. We believe, however, our studies on Municipal Power and Population Decline in Japan: Goki-Shichido and Regional Variations are significant in shedding light on an unexplored field. One effective strategy in fighting the problem of Japans declining population would be to bring foreign workers into the municipality. An example is Izumo-shi in Shimane Prefecture. The city successfully implemented the Multicultural Symbiosis Promotion Plan to settle foreign workers with Family Stay status into the municipality. The implementation of such a plan seems simple, but is difficult to achieve. Izumo-shi, however, has proved that getting foreign workers settled in the municipality, with their families, would be one of the most effective strategies for population decline.","output":"What Can Be Done Before a Municipality Disappears: Making the Best of Negative Municipal Resources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the advent of advancements in deep learning approaches, such as deep convolution neural network, residual neural network, adversarial network; U-Net architectures are most widely utilized in biomedical image segmentation to address the automation in identification and detection of the target regions or sub-regions.

Besides, this article also highlights the contribution of U-Net based frameworks in the ongoing pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also known as COVID-19. Finally, the strengths and similarities of these U-Net variants are analysed along with the challenges involved in biomedical image segmentation to uncover promising future research directions in this area.","output":"Modality specific U-Net variants for biomedical image segmentation: a survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on human mobility around the world Many cities issued stay-at-home orders during the outbreak of COVID-19, and many commuters have also changed their travel modes in the post pandemic period;e g , transit/bus passengers have switched to driving or car-sharing Urban road traffic congestion patterns are significantly different than they were pre-pandemic, and understanding such changes can be an opportunity to improve future emergency traffic management and control Previous studies on this topic have focused on natural disasters or major accidents/incidents However, very few studies have analyzed the empirical traffic congestion patterns that have occurred during a pandemic This study takes Shanghai as an example, and conducts a retrospective analysis of empirical spatio-temporal road traffic congestion during the COVID-19 pandemic The three-month road traffic speed data in the 446 Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs) collected from Baidu Maps was used in this study The algorithm of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) was employed to investigate the inherent composition of the spatio-temporal variation simultaneously influenced by several factors Three principal components were identified from the spatio-temporal variation, including the stable, main part of variation;the part of the variation that is affected by commuting;and the part of the variation that is affected by migrant populations and the pandemic The results may suggest ways to improve the emergency management and control of urban roadways in other metropolitan areas worldwide during and after the COVID-19 pandemic period","output":"Urban Road Congestion Patterns under the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study in Shanghai"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preclinical studies indicate an age-associated accumulation of senescent cells across multiple organ systems. Emerging evidence suggests that tau protein accumulation, which closely correlates with cognitive decline in Alzheimers disease and other tauopathies, drives cellular senescence in the brain. Pharmacologically clearing senescent cells in mouse models of tauopathy reduced brain pathogenesis. Compared to vehicle treated mice, intermittent senolytic administration reduced tau accumulation and neuroinflammation, preserved neuronal and synaptic density, restored aberrant cerebral blood flow, and reduced ventricular enlargement. Intermittent dosing of the senolytics, dasatinib plus quercetin, has shown an acceptable safety profile in clinical studies for other senescence-associated conditions.

BACKGROUND: CVS accounts for high morbidity and mortality of aSAH. Abnormal cellular physiological processes of VECs play a critical rale in aSAH induced CVS. In addition, Ang-1 involve in the regulation of vascular structure and function. OBJECTIVE: To study the role of Ang-1 played in CVS and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Blood samples of 130 aSAH patients were collected from 2016 to 2020 in West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Two-hemorrhage rodent model was employed to structured aSAH-induced CVS rat model. And oxyHb was used to treat VECs to constructed CVS cell model in vitro. ELISA was used to measure the level of Ang-1. HE staining was used to assess basilar arteries of rat. CCK-8 was used to detect cell viability ability. Flow cytometry was used to test the cell apoptosis rate. Western blotting was used to determine the expression level of ERS marker and apoptosis-related proteins. RESULTS: There was an abnormally low expression of Ang-1 in CVS patients and CVS rats; besides, oxyHb treatment decreased Ang-1 in VECs in a concentration-dependent manner. Ang-1 treatment led to the basilar artery wall thinner and lumen circumference larger in CVS rat; moreover, in oxyHb treated VECs, Ang-1 treatment inhibited ERS and apoptosis. In addition, the expression of p-PI3K and p-Akt in the CVS group decreased, while the expression of p53 in the CVS group increased. The expression of p-PI3K and p-Akt in 8 CVS rat have negative correlation with expression of Ang-1, but the correlation between p53 and Ang-1 was positive. Furthermore, the results suggested that Ang-1 suppressed ERS and apoptosis of VECs through regulated PI3K/Akt/p53 pathway. CONCLUSION: Elevated Ang-1 inhibited p53 mediated ERS and apoptosis of VECs by activated PI3K/Akt pathway, Ang-1 might be an attractive treatment strategy for CVS.","output":"Ang-1 inhibited endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis of VECs in rats with aSAH induced CVS through regulated PI3K/Akt pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented strain on health systems, with rapidly increasing demand for healthcare in hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. As the pandemic escalates, determining the resulting needs for healthcare resources (beds, staff, equipment) has become a key priority for many countries. Projecting future demand requires estimates of how long patients with COVID-19 need different levels of hospital care. Methods We performed a systematic review to gather data on length of stay (LoS) of patients with COVID-19 in hospital and in ICU. We subsequently developed a method to generate LoS distributions which combines summary statistics reported in multiple studies, accounting for differences in sample sizes. Applying this approach we provide distributions for general hospital and ICU LoS from studies in China and elsewhere, for use by the community. Results We identified 52 studies, the majority from China (46/52). Median hospital LoS ranged from 4 to 53 days within China, and 4 to 21 days outside of China, across 45 studies. ICU LoS was reported by eight studies - four each within and outside China - with median values ranging from 6 to 12 and 4 to 19 days, respectively. Our summary distributions have a median hospital LoS of 14 (IQR: 10-19) days for China, compared with 5 (IQR: 3-9) days outside of China. For ICU, the summary distributions are more similar (median (IQR) of 8 (5-13) days for China and 7 (4-11) days outside of China). There was a visible difference by discharge status, with patients who were discharged alive having longer LoS than those who died during their admission, but no trend associated with study date. Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 in China appeared to remain in hospital for longer than elsewhere. This may be explained by differences in criteria for admission and discharge between countries, and different timing within the pandemic. In the absence of local data, the combined summary LoS distributions provided here can be used to model bed demands for contingency planning and then updated, with the novel method presented here, as more studies with aggregated statistics emerge outside China.","output":"COVID-19 length of hospital stay: a systematic review and data synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CVT) is a rare but serious complication associated with ulcerative colitis (UC), an idiopathic autoimmune inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Management approaches for CVT remain unclear but may include anticoagulation and surgical thrombectomy. Herein, we report a case of a 23-year-old male who developed CVT with a history of UC. The patient was presented to Howard University Hospital when he slipped and fell. On arrival at the hospital, he complained of a headache with an aching sensation, associated with light/sound sensitivity. The patient had a history of uncontrolled UC. He had positive bloody diarrhea, lower abdominal pain, but denied any other neurological deficit. Computed tomography of the head showed left frontoparietal lobe hypodensities. Neurological exam was nonfocal. Vital signs were within normal range, but the patient experienced some memory loss and personality changes. Subsequent diagnosis of CVT was made with magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance venography. Immediate treatment with low-molecular-weight intravenous heparin (18 IU/kg) was introduced. His UC was managed with methylprednisolone (60 mg IV daily), proton pump inhibitors, mesalamine, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. His condition gradually improved. On discharge, he was prescribed prednisone, azathioprine for his UC, levetiracetam for seizure, and warfarin with an INR goal of 2-3. In conclusion, the sudden onset and/or acute worsening of neurological status such as headache and mental confusion in a patient with UC should alert the treating physician about the possibility of CVT so that timely intervention could be employed to prevent disabling and potentially lethal sequelae of this disease.","output":"Case Report: Ulcerative Colitis with Multiple Dural Venous Thrombosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ventriculitis after meningitis is a serious complication in the neonatal age group.

To overcome current drawbacks regarding room disinfection, the use of cold atmospheric plasma in remote operation represents a promising alternative for the disinfection of larger volumes. In this study, a compact plasma system was evaluated regarding its disinfection efficiency inside an ambulance car. METHODS AND RESULTS: The developed plasma device is based on a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) and operates with ambient air as process gas. The humidified afterglow from the plasma nozzle was introduced into an ambulance car with a volume of approximately 10 m3 while Bacillus atrophaeus endospores, Staphylococcus aureus or Phi 6 bacteriophages dried on different surfaces (PET-films, glass slides or aluminum foil) were exposed to the reactive gas inside the ambulance vehicle at eight different positions. Reductions of spores by more than 4 orders of magnitude were found on all surfaces and positions within 2 h. Due to their higher susceptibility, Phi 6 bacteriophages and S. aureus counts were reduced by at least 4 orders of magnitude within 30 min on all surfaces. CONCLUSION: The results show that different microorganisms dried on variable surfaces can be inactivated by several orders of magnitude inside an ambulance by plasma gas from of a compact DBD plasma nozzle.

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of different iron-rich CFs on infant gut inflammation and microbiota. METHODS Eighty-seven exclusively breastfed infants were randomly assigned to receive one of the following as their first CF: iron-fortified cereal (Cer), iron-fortified cereal with fruit (Cer + Fr), or meat (M). Urine and stool samples were collected to assess reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, gut microbiota and inflammation. RESULTS Fecal iron differed across feeding groups (p < 0.001); levels were highest in the Cer group and lowest in M group. A significant increase of fecal ROS formation (p < 0.002) after the introduction of CFs was observed, but did not differ across feeding groups. Fecal calprotectin increased within all groups after the introduction of CFs (p = 0.004). Gut microbiota richness increased after introduction of M or Cer + Fr. Regardless of feeding group, Coriobacteriaceae were positively correlated with ROS and Staphylococcaceae were negatively correlated with calprotectin. CONCLUSIONS Choice of first CF may influence gut inflammation and microbiota, potentially due to variations in iron absorption from different foods.

Previous experiments using IAV/H1N1 infection models have shown impaired hippocampal neuronal morphology and cognitive abilities, but the underlying pathways have not been fully described. In this study, we demonstrate that infection with a low-dose non-neurotrophic H1N1 strain of IAV causes ample peripheral immune response followed by a temporary blood-brain barrier disturbance. Although histological examination did not reveal obvious pathological processes in the brains of IAV-infected mice, detailed multidimensional flow cytometric characterization of immune cells uncovered subtle alterations in the activation status of microglial cells. More specifically, we detected an altered expression pattern of major histocompatibility complex classes I and II, CD80, and F4/80 accompanied by elevated mRNA levels of CD36, CD68, C1QA, and C3, suggesting evolved synaptic pruning. To closer evaluate how these profound changes affect synaptic balance, we established a highly sensitive multiplex flow cytometry-based approach called flow synaptometry. The introduction of this novel technique enabled us to simultaneously quantify the abundance of pre- and postsynapses from distinct brain regions.

In England a number of non-pharmaceutical interventions have been introduced throughout the pandemic, including guidelines on healthcare attendance (for example, promoting remote consultations), increased handwashing and social distancing. These interventions are likely to have impacted the incidence of nonCCOVID-19 conditions as well as healthcare seeking behaviour. Syndromic Surveillance Systems offer the ability to monitor trends in healthcare usage over time. METHODS: This study describes the indirect impact of COVID-19 on healthcare utilisation using a range of syndromic indicators including eye conditions, mumps, fractures, herpes zoster and cardiac conditions. Data from the syndromic surveillance systems monitored by Public Health England were used to describe the number of contacts with NHS 111, general practitioner (GP) In Hours (GPIH) and Out-of-Hours (GPOOH), Ambulance and Emergency Department (ED) services over comparable periods before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: The peak pandemic period in 2020 (weeks 13C20), compared to the same period in 2019, displayed on average a 12% increase in NHS 111 calls, an 11% decrease in GPOOH consultations, and a 49% decrease in ED attendances. In the GP In Hours system, conjunctivitis consultations decreased by 64% and mumps consultations by 31%. There was a 49% reduction in attendance at EDs for fractures, and there was no longer any weekend increase in ED fracture attendances, with similar attendance patterns observed across each day of the week.

This significant improvement is assigned to the optimal recombination of electronChole pairs in the multiple quantum wells (MQWs).

Although this shift increased the efficiency of data processing, it has security drawbacks. Healthcare databases are a precious target for attackers because they facilitate identity theft and cybercrime. This paper presents an approach for database damage assessment for healthcare systems. Inspired by the current behavior of COVID-19 infections, our approach views the damage assessment problem the same way. The malicious transactions will be viewed as if they are COVID-19 viruses, taken from infection onward. The challenge of this research is to discover the infected transactions in a minimal time. The proposed parallel algorithm is based on the transaction dependency paradigm, with a time complexity O((M+NQ+N?3)/L) (M = total number of transactions under scrutiny, N = number of malicious and affected transactions in the testing list, Q = time for dependency check, and L = number of threads used). The memory complexity of the algorithm is O(N+KL) (N = number of malicious and affected transactions, K = number of transactions in one area handled by one thread, and L = number of threads). Since the damage assessment time is directly proportional to the denial-of-service time, the proposed algorithm provides a minimized execution time.

These observations could be important in the face of future variants of concern and emphasise the need for continued access to high sensitivity PCR testing and other forms of surveillance.","output":"COVID-19 testing: disparity between national and institution-based case detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This retracts the article DOI: 10.1039/C8RA02418A.].","output":"Retraction: Salvianolic acid B inhibits inflammatory response and cell apoptosis via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in IL-1?-induced osteoarthritis chondrocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since mid-March 2014, the frequency with which cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection have been reported has increased, with the majority of recent cases reported from Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Design A nationwide cross-sectional study Setting and Participants Home care service agencies in Japan were randomly selected from all agencies nationwide. Methods An online survey was conducted between January and February 2021. The administrators at home care service agencies responded to the following items: adherence to PPE (disposable masks, gloves, and aprons) use during diaper change among their home care workers, agency-level actions toward IPC, including monitoring of infection outbreak among users, existing manual for IPC, training opportunities on IPC for care workers, and other agency and administrator characteristics. Results Of the 1942 agencies, 197 were included in the analysis (response rate: 10.1%). Although 145 (73.6%) of the agencies always used both masks and gloves during diaper change, 32 (16.2%) agencies fully adhered to wearing masks, gloves, and aprons. Agencies monitoring infectious disease outbreaks among service users were more likely to adhere to PPE use (adjusted odds ratio: 5.97, 95% confidence interval: 1.30C27.31). Conclusions and Implications Low adherence to PPE use, especially apron use, during diaper change among home care service agencies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan was revealed, despite the widespread availability of the manual for IPC and/or training opportunities. To ensure safety and quality home care services for both users and home care workers, agencies should not simply create manuals or training systems as a structure; rather, they should implement effective processes for appropriate PPE use.","output":"Adherence to PPE use in home-care service agencies during COVID-19 in Japan: A cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: In a CICO (cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate) situation, anesthesiologists and acute care physicians must be able to perform an emergency surgical cricothyrotomy (front-of-neck airway procedure).

In COVID-19 airway management guidelines, bougie-assisted surgical cricothyrotomy is the recommended emergency strategy for CICO situations. Methods: We designed a 4-hour procedural simulation workshop on surgical cricothyrotomy to train 16 medical residents. We provided prerequisite readings, a lecture, and a videotaped demonstration. Two clinical scenarios introduced deliberate practice on partial-task neck simulators and fresh human cadavers. We segmented an evidence-based procedure and asked participants to verbalize the five steps of the procedure on multiple occasions. Results: Thirty-two residents who participated in the workshops were surveyed, with a 97% response rate (16 of 16 from anesthesiology, 15 of 16 from emergency medicine). Participants commented positively on the workshop's authenticity, its structure, the quality of the feedback provided, and its perceived impact on improving skills in surgical cricothyrotomy. We analyzed narrative comments related to three domains: preparation for the procedure, performing the procedure, and maintaining the skills. Participants highlighted the importance of performing the procedure many times and mentioned the representativeness of fresh cadavers. Discussion: We developed a surgical cricothyrotomy simulation workshop for anesthesiology and emergency medicine residents.

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is frequently used intraoperatively in man to provide information regarding cerebral perfusion. OBJECTIVES To determine whether NIRS can identify trends in regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) in horses and whether there is a correlation between rSO2 and venous oxygen tensions. METHODS A cerebral oximeter sensor recorded rSO2 from the dorsal sagittal sinus of 6 healthy horses. Values for rSO2, arterial and venous oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions (PaO2, PvO2, PaCO2 and PvCO2 respectively), along with arteriovenous oxygen saturations (SavO2) were recorded in unsedated (recording period [RP] 1), sedated (RP2) and anaesthetised horses (RP3-5) and during recovery (RP6-8). During anaesthesia, horses were ventilated to achieve states of normo- (RP3), hyper- (RP4) and hypocapnoea (RP5). Data were evaluated descriptively and analysed using linear mixed-effects models and Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS Overall mean  s.d. values for rSO2, PaO2, PvO2, PaCO2, SavO2 and mean arterial pressure varied significantly by RP (P<0.001). Significant decreases in rSO2 were identified between RP1 and the post anaesthetic periods (P<0.001). No significant differences in rSO2 values were identified between RP1 and the intra-anaesthesia periods or between RP3, RP4 and RP5. Significant correlations were identified between rSO2 and PaO2 (r = 0.448, P<0.001), rSO2 and PvO2 (r = 0.512, P<0.001) and rSO2 and SavO2 (r = 0.469, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to identify trends in rSO2 in horses using NIRS. A positive correlation was identified between rSO2 and PvO2, suggesting that alterations in cerebral oxygenation may be reflected in PvO2 . POTENTIAL RELEVANCE Near-infrared spectroscopy may be used to monitor trends in rSO2 during equine anaesthesia. Decreasing rSO2 values may act as an early warning signal, alerting clinicians to potential cerebral desaturation events and indicating a need for intervention.","output":"Use of near-infrared spectroscopy to identify trends in regional cerebral oxygen saturation in horses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ocean contains numerous marine organisms, including algae, animals, and plants, from which diverse marine polysaccharides with useful physicochemical and biological properties can be extracted.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey conducted from May 29 through July 31, 2020, among 1,148 participants, reported time spent in physical activity and leisure screen time during a typical week before (retrospectively) and a week during the COVID-19 stay-at-home period. Mental health outcomes during this period were measured with the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Linear regression models were used to estimate the associations between changes in physical activity and leisure screen time and mental health outcomes by socioeconomic status (SES), adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Compared with maintaining high levels of physical activity or increasing them, decreasing physical activity was associated with higher stress scores overall, and among people of high SES, with higher scores for DASS-21, depression, and anxiety. Among participants of low and medium SES only, increasing screen time was associated with higher DASS-21, depression, anxiety, and stress scores compared with maintaining low or decreasing leisure screen time.

The etiology is largely unknown, which limits effective treatment. Layer 5 prelimbic cortex (L5PL) increases anxiety responses but undergoes adolescent synaptic pruning, raising the question of the impact of pruning on anxiety. Here we show that preventing L5PL pruning increases anxiety in response to an aversive event in adolescent and adult female mice. Spine density of Golgi-stained neurons decreased ~ 63% from puberty (~ PND35, vaginal opening) to post-puberty (PND56, P < 0.0001). Expression of 4¦ GABA(A) receptors (GABARs) transiently increased tenfold in L5PL at puberty (P < 0.00001), but decreased post-pubertally. Both global and local knockdown of these receptors during puberty prevented pruning, increasing spine density post-pubertally (P < 0.0001), an effect reversed by blocking NMDA receptors (NMDARs). Pubertal expression of the NMDAR-dependent spine protein kalirin7 decreased (50%, P < 0.0001), an effect prevented by 4 knock-out, suggesting that 4¦-induced reductions in kalirin7 underlie pruning. Increased spine density due to local 4 knockdown at puberty decreased open arm time on the elevated plus maze post-pubertally (62%, P < 0.0001) in response to an aversive stimulus, suggesting that increases in L5PL synapses increase anxiety responses. These findings suggest that prelimbic synaptic pruning is necessary to limit anxiety in adulthood and may suggest novel therapies.","output":"Preventing adolescent synaptic pruning in mouse prelimbic cortex via local knockdown of 4¦ GABA(A) receptors increases anxiety response in adulthood"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, a variant first detected in the UK in September 20201, has spread to multiple countries worldwide.

Model-driven and data-driven image segmentation methods are widely used for their less computational complexity and more accurate feature extraction. However, model-driven methods like thresholding usually suffer from wrong segmentation and noises regions because different grayscale images have distinct intensity distribution property thus pre-processing is always demanded. While data-driven methods with deep learning like encoder-decoder networks always are always accompanied by complex architectures which require amounts of training data. METHODS Combining thresholding method and deep learning, this paper presents a novel method by using 2D&3D object detection technologies. First, interest regions contain segmented object are determined with fine-tuning 2D object detection network. Then, pixels in cropped images are turned as point cloud according to their positions and grayscale values. Finally, 3D object detection network is applied to obtain bounding boxes with target points and boxes' bottoms and tops represent thresholding values for segmentation. After projecting to 2D images, these target points could composite the segmented object. RESULTS Three groups of grayscale medical images are used to evaluate the proposed image segmentation method. We obtain the IoU (DSC) scores of 0.92 (0.96), 0.88 (0.94) and 0.94 (0.94) for segmentation accuracy on different datasets respectively. Also, compared with five state of the arts and clinically performed well models, our method achieves higher scores and better performance. CONCLUSIONS The prominent segmentation results demonstrate that the built method based on 2D&3D object detection with deep learning is workable and promising for segmentation task of grayscale medical images.","output":"Grayscale medical image segmentation method based on 2D&3D object detection with deep learning."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Students have been highly vulnerable to mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, and researchers have shown that perceived stress and mental health problems have increased during the pandemic.

A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 358 undergraduates from 14 universities in Turkey, including 200 female students (56%). The measurements used in the study were the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Perception of COVID Impact on Student Well-Being (CI), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Physical Activity Scale (PA), and a sociodemographic survey. Students reported high perceived stress, mild generalized anxiety, and low satisfaction with life. More than half of the students met the diagnostic criteria of GAD (52%) and depression (63%). Female and physically inactive students had higher PSS-10 levels. A hierarchical linear regression model showed that after controlling for gender and negative CI, anxiety and physical inactivity significantly predicted high perceived stress.

Many interventions of COVID-19 have been implemented. It is of great public health and societal importance to evaluate the effects of interventions in the pandemic of COVID-19. In this paper, with help of synthetic control method, regression discontinuity and a Susceptible-Infected and infectious without isolation-Hospitalized in isolation-Removed (SIHR) model, we evaluate the horizontal and longitudinal effects of stringent interventions implemented in Wenzhou, a representative urban city of China, where stringent interventions were enforced to curb its own epidemic situation with rapidly increasing newly confirmed cases. We found that there were statistically significant treatment effects of those stringent interventions which reduced the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19. Those reduction effects would increase over time. Also, if the stringent interventions were delayed by 2 days or mild interventions were implemented instead, the expected number of cumulative confirmed cases would have been nearly 2 times or 5 times of the actual number. The effects of stringent interventions are significant in mitigating the epidemic situation of COVID-19.

METHODS: Register- and survey-based data. Responses from managers in municipal and private residential/home units. Number of municipal COVID-19 cases from national registries. Multilevel logistic multivariate regression analysis with presence of COVID-19 among older people in residential/home units as the outcome variable. RESULTS: The proportions of residential/home units with client COVID-19 cases, mid-March-April 2020 were Denmark 22.7%, Finland 9.0%, Norway 9.7% and Sweden 38.8%, most cases found in clusters. The proportions were similar among employees. Client likelihood of having COVID-19 was six-fold higher if the employees had COVID-19. Mean client cases per residential/home unit were Denmark 0.78, Finland 0.46, Norway 0.22 and Sweden 1.23. For the same municipal infection incidence class, Sweden's mean client infection levels were three-fold those of other countries. The regression analysis variables country, municipal COVID-19 incidence proportion, and care type were associated with client cases at p a .001.

The effects of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the role of NO and the endothelium in mediating O(2)(*-) formation were therefore investigated in intact porcine pulmonary arteries in vitro. METHODS Intrapulmonary artery (PA) segments were obtained from White Landrace pigs (25-35 kg) and incubated with LPS, IL-1alpha, and TNF-alpha and O(2)(*-) release was measured by the superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c. The source of O(2)(*-) formation was determined using a number of enzyme inhibitors. The role of NO was explored using NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors and the distribution of NOS isoforms and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-), an index of NO-O(2)(*-) interactions) assessed by immunocytochemistry. RESULTS LPS, IL-1alpha, and TNF-alpha promoted the formation of O(2)(*-) from PA compared with untreated controls in a time and dose dependent manner, an effect markedly enhanced by removal of the endothelium but completely inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium chloride (DPI). L-NAME and the eNOS inhibitor N(5)-(1-iminoethyl)-ornithine (L-NIO) enhanced O(2)(*-) formation from PA (with endothelium) in response to IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha but had no effect on LPS mediated O(2)(*-) formation, whereas L-NAME and the iNOS inhibitor L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)-lysine-HCl (L-NIL) enhanced O(2)(*-) formation only in response to LPS. CONCLUSIONS LPS, IL-1alpha, and TNF-alpha promote O(2)(*-) formation through an upregulation of NADPH oxidase activity which is augmented by removal of the endothelium, as well as the inhibition of eNOS (in the case of cytokines) and iNOS (in the case of LPS). The concomitant expression of NOS isoforms (and NO formation) with that of NADPH oxidase may therefore constitute a protective system designed to remove O(2)(*-) through the formation of ONOO(-). If this is so, the integrity of the endothelium may be axiomatic in the progression and severity of ARDS.","output":"Role of the endothelium and nitric oxide synthases in modulating superoxide formation induced by endotoxin and cytokines in porcine pulmonary arteries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to treat severe cases of infection and for prophylactic use. The main viral protease (nsp5 or 3CLpro) represents an attractive and possibly broad-spectrum target for drug development as it is essential to the virus life cycle and highly conserved among betacoronaviruses. Sensitive and efficient high-throughput screening methods are key for drug discovery. Here we report the development of a gain-of-signal, highly sensitive cell-based luciferase assay to monitor SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 activity and show that it is suitable for high-throughput screening of compounds in a 384-well format. A benefit of miniaturisation and automation is that screening can be performed in parallel on a wild-type and a catalytically inactive nsp5, which improves the selectivity of the assay. We performed molecular docking-based screening on a set of 14,468 compounds from an in-house chemical database, selected 359 candidate nsp5 inhibitors and tested them experimentally. We identified four molecules, including the broad-spectrum antiviral merimepodib/VX-497, which show anti-nsp5 activity and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in A549-ACE2 cells with IC(50) values in the 4C21 M range. The here described assay will allow the screening of large-scale compound libraries for SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 inhibitors. Moreover, we provide evidence that this assay can be adapted to other coronaviruses and viruses which rely on a viral protease.","output":"A highly sensitive cell-based luciferase assay for high-throughput automated screening of SARS-CoV-2 nsp5/3CLpro inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND It has been reported worldwide that patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 usually suffer a loss of smell and taste. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the severity of the disease and the loss of smell and taste. In addition, we evaluated patients' smell and taste functions after recovery. METHODS Between March and May 2020, 418 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were divided into 3 groups: home-quarantined, hospitalized, and intensive care patients. The disease, smell, and taste functions of patients were evaluated with visual analog scores before diagnosis of COVID-19, during the disease, and fourth week after recovery. The types of smell loss and types of taste flavor loss occurring during the disease were questioned. RESULTS In all 3 groups, changes in smell and taste loss during the disease were statistically detected (P = 0.001). The smell loss rates determined in groups 1 to 3 were 45%, 43.7%, and 31.2%, respectively. The taste loss rates determined in groups 1 to 3were 46.6%, 32.1%, and 31.2% respectively. The rate of patients with a total recovery of smell loss in groups 1 to 3 were 95.5%, 93.7%, and 100%, respectively (P = 0.768).

Knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and also to calculate the infection fatality rate (IFR). These measures may help the authorities to make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions. Blood donors comprise approximately 4.7% of the similarly aged population of Denmark and blood is donated in all areas of the country. The objective of this study was to perform real-time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous SARS-CoV-2 infections and the population based IFR. Methods: All Danish blood donors aged 17-69 years giving blood April 6 to 17 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test. Antibody status was compared between areas and an estimate of the IFR was calculated. The seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: The first 9,496 blood donors were tested and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.7% (CI: 0.9-2.3) was calculated. The seroprevalence differed across areas. Using available data on fatalities and population numbers a combined IFR in patients younger than 70 is estimated at 82 per 100,000 (CI: 59-154) infections. Conclusions: The IFR was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data. The IFR, including only individuals with no comorbidity, is likely several fold lower than the current estimate. This may have implications for risk mitigation.

This is the first time that national mass asymptomatic testing has been introduced in the UK and the effectiveness of the policy depends on uptake with testing and willingness to self-isolate following a positive test result. This paper examines attitudes towards twice-weekly testing, as well as barriers and facilitators to engaging in testing. METHODS: Between 5th April and 28th May 2021 we searched Twitter, Facebook, and online news articles with publicly available comment sections to identify comments relating to twice-weekly testing. We identified 5783 comments which were then analysed using a framework analysis. RESULTS: We identified nine main themes. Five themes related to barriers to engaging in testing: low perceived risk from COVID-19; mistrust in the government; concern about taking a test; perceived ineffectiveness of twice-weekly testing policy; and perceived negative impact of twice-weekly testing policy. Four themes related to facilitators to engaging in testing: wanting to protect others; positive perceptions of tests; a desire to return to normal; and perceived efficacy for reducing asymptomatic transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the comments identified indicated predominately negative attitudes towards the twice weekly testing policy. Several recommendations can be made to improve engagement with twice weekly testing, including: 1) communicate openly and honestly about the purpose of testing; 2) provide information about the accuracy of tests; 3) provide financial support for those required to self-isolate, and; 4) emphasise accessibility of testing.","output":"The social media response to twice-weekly mass asymptomatic testing in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is a well-recognized treatment option for high-risk patients with aortic stenosis.

The period of investigation was from 1 February to 30 June 2020 and was segmented into three intervals: pre-lockdown (February and March 2020), hard lockdown (April and May 2020) and immediately post lockdown (June 2020). The electronic HECTIS health record registry was interrogated for the total number of patients that were seen per month. These were further categorised according to mechanism of injury (stab, gunshot, blunt assault and road traffic injuries). Penetrating (stab and gunshot) and blunt assault victims were collectively grouped as violent trauma. Results. The mean total number of patients seen decreased by 53% during the hard lockdown period. There was a moderate reduction (15%) in patients with gunshot injuries seen during the hard lockdown phase, but there was an 80% increase in the post-lockdown period. The proportion of patients injured in road traffic collisions pre lockdown, hard lockdown and immediate post lockdown was 16.4%, 8.9% and 11.1%, respectively. Patients injured in road traffic collisions decreased by 74% during the hard lockdown period and maintained a reduction of 32% during the immediate post-lockdown period.

Recent studies have shown that neurological symptoms are a major issue for people infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, the mechanism through which the pathological effects emerge is still unclear. Brain endothelial cells (ECs), one of the components of the bloodCbrain barrier, are a major hurdle for the entry of pathogenic or infectious agents into the brain. They strongly express angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for its normal physiological function, which is also well-known to be an opportunistic receptor for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, facilitating their entry into host cells. First, we identified rapid internalization of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) S1 domain (S1) and active trimer (Trimer) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein through ACE2 in brain ECs. Moreover, internalized S1 increased Rab5, an early endosomal marker while Trimer decreased Rab5 in the brain ECs. Similarly, the permeability of transferrin and dextran was increased in S1 treatment but decreased in Trimer, respectively. Furthermore, S1 and Trimer both induced mitochondrial damage including functional deficits in mitochondrial respiration. Overall, this study shows that SARS-CoV-2 itself has toxic effects on the brain ECs including defective molecular delivery and metabolic function, suggesting a potential pathological mechanism to induce neurological signs in the brain.","output":"Spike Proteins of SARS-CoV-2 Induce Pathological Changes in Molecular Delivery and Metabolic Function in the Brain Endothelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of January, the current outbreak of COVID-19 coronavirus disease was declared an important international public health emergency.

The following recommendations, based on current knowledge of the disease and therefore liable to change in the future, are proposed when the pandemic appears to have entered a process of decreasing virulence and, with it, the strict containment measures established to date. However, in view of the possibility of a second wave of the pandemic, it seems necessary to establish basic and minimum recommendations to respect the patient's right to appropriate care, similar to that provided prior to the pandemic, and to maintain minimum safety standards for the patients themselves and for the doctors, technicians and health personnel carrying out these tests. These recommendations concern the constitution of a priority based on the reason for consultation, the establishment of calls to check the patient's clinical situation before going to the outpatient department and the rules for carrying out neurophysiological tests, which are generally based on the preservation of hospital circuits, respect for and observation of the known barriers to contagion of this disease, and the use of disposable material.

In Spain, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a lockdown for almost 100 days and forced the sudden stop of sport practices and competitions. This interruption had a negative impact on high-level athletes mental health. However, its impact on young athletes, who are intrinsically developing a high-demanding dual career, remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed at (1) describing and characterizing the general impact that COVID-19 lockdown had on Spanish young athletes life-spheres and mental health, and (2) identifying different profiles of athletes regarding life-conditions and sport-related variables. A sample of 544 young athletes (M = 15.9; SD = 1.51) participated in this study. Measures included life-conditions and sport-related information along with the Holistic Monitoring Questionnaire (HMQ) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). After the screening and description of the data, profiles were defined using a two-level cluster analysis using HMQ and GHQ-12 subscales. We explored differences in demographic and sports information between profiles using MANOVA and subsequent ANOVA. Results suggest a general negative impact of COVID-19 on young athletes life-spheres and mental health, but with three different clusters regarding the degree of such impact. Cluster 1 grouped the 54.78% of the sample and exhibited a low negative impact of COVID-19 lockdown on life-spheres and few mental health issues.

However, limited evidence exists on how frequency and duration of exercise affect the risk of hypoglycemia. The study aimed to compare the percentage of time spent in hypoglycemia between two 5-day periods with different frequency and duration of physical activity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this outpatient randomized crossover study, 26 participants aged 18C65 years with type 1 diabetes for 2 years and insulin pump use for 1 year were included. After a 7-day observation period, participants completed two 5-day intervention periods separated by a washout period of at least 14 days. One period included five exercise sessions on 5 consecutive days (5S), each consisting of 4 min of resistance training and 30 min of aerobic exercise. Another period included two exercise sessions on 2 days with at least 2 days in between (2S), each consisting of 10 min of resistance training and 75 min of aerobic exercise. During each period, participants performed in total 150 min of aerobic exercise and 20 min of resistance training and wore continuous glucose monitors (Dexcom G6) and accelerometers (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT). RESULTS: Twenty insulin pump-treated adults (10 women) with type 1 diabetes completed the study.

To date, there is no standard treatment for AH. The Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet 1064-nm(QS) laser and intense pulsed light (IPL) are two effective modalities for the treatment of pigmentary disorders; however, the efficacy and safety levels of both treatments for AH have not yet been compared in a controlled study. OBJECTIVES To evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of the QS laser and IPL in the treatment of AH. METHODS A randomized, split-side study was conducted on 22 subjects; all subjects received a total of five split-side treatments every 2 weeks. The efficacy was determined using the melanin index (MI), color chart level using the Pantone Skintone? Guide, improvement grading scale (IGS), and patient satisfaction scores at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. RESULTS The results showed that there was no significant difference in MI, color chart level, IGS, and patient satisfaction scores between the two treatments. Both treatments significantly improved AH after three sessions. However, the pain score was lower for IPL treatment. The adverse effects were transient and were found after IPL treatment in one participant (4.45%) who developed hyperpigmentation and another participant (4.45%) who developed erythema.

Most individuals are asymptomatic or display mild symptoms, which raises an inherent question as to how does the immune response differs from patients manifesting severe disease? During the initial phase of infection, dysregulated effector immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, megakaryocytes, basophils, eosinophils, erythroid progenitor cells, and Th17 cells can alter the trajectory of an infected patient to severe disease. On the other hand, properly functioning CD4+, CD8+ cells, NK cells, and DCs reduce the disease severity. Detailed understanding of the immune response of convalescent individuals transitioning from the effector phase to the immunogenic memory phase can provide vital clues to understanding essential variables to assess vaccine-induced protection. Although neutralizing antibodies can wane over time, long-lasting B and T memory cells can persist in recovered individuals. The natural immunological memory captures the diverse repertoire of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes after natural infection whereas, currently approved vaccines are based on a single epitope, spike protein. It is essential to understand the nature of the immune response to natural infection to better identify correlates of protection against this disease. This article discusses recent findings regarding immune response against natural infection to SARS-CoV-2 and the nature of immunogenic memory. More precise knowledge of the acute phase of immune response and its transition to immunological memory will contribute to the future design of vaccines and the identification of variables essential to maintain immune protection across diverse populations.","output":"Infection and Immune Memory: Variables in Robust Protection by Vaccines Against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phenotypic variation plays an important role in how species cope with environmental challenges.

We found a strong PL reduction in dream frequency (t = ?5.49;p < 0.001), emotional load (t = ?2.71;p = 0.008), vividness (t = ?4.90;p < 0.001), bizarreness (t = ?4.05;p < 0.001), length (t = ?4.67;p < 0.001), and lucid dream frequency (t = ?2.40;p = 0.018). Fear was the most frequently reported emotion in dreams at TL (26.9%) and PL (22.2%). Only the frequency of specific lockdown-related dream contents exhibited a reduction at PL. These findings highlight that the end of the home confinement had a strong impact on the oneiric activity, in the direction of reduced dream frequency, intensity, and lockdown-related contents. The co-occurrence of such changes with a decline in nocturnal PTSD-related symptoms, sleep latency, and time with digital media suggests an influence of post-traumatic stress levels, lifestyle modifications, and sleep pattern on dream changes during different phases of the pandemic. The stable prevalence of fear in dreams and the large frequency of poor sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and anxiety are probably related to the persistence of many negative consequences of the pandemic. Overall, these results are consistent with the continuity hypothesis of dreams.","output":"The Oneiric Activity during and after the COVID-19 Total Lockdown in Italy: A Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of April 12, 2020, a total of 389 cases of coronavirus disease were confirmed in Jordan. To control this imminent threat, Jordan has enforced public health infection prevention and control measures, called for social distancing, seized all forms of inbound and outbound movement and international travel, and enacted the Defence Law that transferred the authority to the Minister of Defence to work and formulate orders according to the situation. In an effort to support the government in anticipating the requirements of the health system in the upcoming period, an in-depth reflection and examination of different scenarios of the disease spread were developed. This viewpoint suggests different strategies and measures for case detection and contact tracing, clinical management of cases, public health system functioning, and civil society organizations contribution. It is necessary to accelerate containment of the disease to protect the economy and to maintain the continuity of some activities to mitigate the subsequent social, economic, and financial impacts. This requires finding a coping mechanism for a period that may be prolonged until laboratories develop a vaccine. Specifically, it is strongly recommended to promote community health awareness toward public health prevention and control measures, increase the efficiency and comprehensiveness of the epidemiological investigation and active and passive surveillance, and employ technology and digital health solutions to track cases and contacts. It is also recommended to increase and expand resources of intensive care units including respirators, increase the capacity and the number of trained health staff in the area of public health and epidemiology, ensure continued provision of essential public health programs, and mobilize the resources of nongovernmental sectors and donors to provide services for refugees and vulnerable populations.","output":"COVID-19 Crisis in Jordan: Response, Scenarios, Strategies, and Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypercoagulability in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may aggravate disease severity during hospitalization but the reported survival benefits from anticoagulation (AC) vary among studies.

In addition to the monoamine hypothesis, neuroinflammation is also discussed as a cause of schizophrenia. To date, there has been no evidence of alterations in the central cholinergic transmitter balance in patients with schizophrenia under clinical conditions. By contrast, studies in critically ill patients have established the measurement of acetylcholinesterase activity as a suitable surrogate parameter of central cholinergic transmitter balance/possible pathophysiological changes. Butyrylcholinesterase activity has been established as a parameter indicating possible (neuro)inflammatory processes. Both parameters can now be measured using a point-of-care approach. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to investigate whether acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activity differs in patients with various forms of schizophrenia. Secondary objectives address the possible association between acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activity and (1) schizophrenic symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, (2) the quantity of antipsychotics taken and (3) the duration of illness. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is designed as a prospective, observational cohort study with one independent control group. It is being carried out at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy III, Ulm University Hospital, Germany. Patient enrolment started in October 2020, and the anticipated end of the study is in January 2022. The enrolment period was set from October 2020 to December 2021 (extension required due to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic). The sample size is calculated at 50 patients in each group. Esterase activity is measured on hospital admission (acute symptomatology) and after referral to a postacute ward over a period of three consecutive days. The matched control group will be created after reaching 50 patients with schizophrenia. This will be followed by a comprehensive statistical analysis of the data set.

Dates were chosen based on statewide stay-at-home orders for Colorado. Patients were excluded for treatment at another institution (n = 148), no fracture noted in clinic (n = 18), or other (n = 13). Data were retrospectively collected from the remaining 1838 patients regarding demographics, fracture injury, mechanism, and treatment. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for each variable during COVID-19 relative to prior years. The number of fractures during 2020 decreased by 26% relative to 2019 and 23% to 2018. A larger proportion of patients experienced at least a 5-day delay to definitive treatment [OR: 1.55, confidence interval (CI): 1.23C1.96, P = 0.0002].

The potential of a live oral vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), however, remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the immunogenicity of live SARS-CoV-2 delivered to the gastrointestinal tract in rhesus macaques and its protective efficacy against intranasal and intratracheal SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Postpyloric administration of SARS-CoV-2 by esophagogastroduodenoscopy resulted in limited virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract and minimal to no induction of mucosal antibody titers in rectal swabs, nasal swabs, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Low levels of serum neutralizing antibodies were induced and correlated with modestly diminished viral loads in nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid following intranasal and intratracheal SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Overall, our data show that postpyloric inoculation of live SARS-CoV-2 is weakly immunogenic and confers partial protection against respiratory SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 remains a global threat, despite the rapid deployment but limited coverage of multiple vaccines. Alternative vaccine strategies that have favorable manufacturing timelines, greater ease of distribution, and improved coverage may offer significant public health benefits, especially in resource-limited settings. Live oral vaccines have the potential to address some of these limitations; however, no studies have yet been conducted to assess the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a live oral vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we report that oral administration of live SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates may offer prophylactic benefits, but the formulation and route of administration will require further optimization.","output":"Protective Efficacy of Gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 Delivery against Intranasal and Intratracheal SARS-CoV-2 Challenge in Rhesus Macaques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study investigates and describes the time course of fears and worries about COVID-19 among current employees during this outbreak.

However, to our knowledge, cohort studies of COVID-19 in clinically vulnerable groups are lacking. Host genetics has also emerged as a major risk factor for COVID-19, and variation in the ACE2 receptor, which facilitates entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the cell, has become a major focus of attention. Thus, we interrogated an ethnically diverse cohort of National Health Service (NHS) patients in the United Kingdom (United Kingdom) to assess the association between variants in the ACE2 locus and COVID-19 risk. We analysed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of 1,837 cases who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 37,207 controls who were not tested, from the UKs 100,000 Genomes Project (100KGP) for the presence of ACE2 coding variants and extract expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We identified a splice site variant (rs2285666) associated with increased ACE2 expression with an overrepresentation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients relative to 100KGP controls (p = 0.015), and in hospitalised European patients relative to outpatients in intra-ethnic comparisons (p = 0.029). We also compared the prevalence of 288 eQTLs, of which 23 were enriched in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. The eQTL rs12006793 had the largest effect size (d = 0.91), which decreases ACE2 expression and is more prevalent in controls, thus potentially reducing the risk of COVID-19. We identified three novel nonsynonymous variants predicted to alter ACE2 function, and showed that three variants (p.K26R, p. H378R, p. Y515N) alter receptor affinity for the viral Spike (S) protein. Variant p. N720D, more prevalent in the European population (p < 0.001), potentially increases viral entry by affecting the ACE2-TMPRSS2 complex. The spectrum of genetic variants in ACE2 may inform risk stratification of COVID-19 patients and could partially explain the differences in disease susceptibility and severity among different ethnic groups.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Susceptibility and ACE2 Gene Variations Within Diverse Ethnic Backgrounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The common cold continues to be the major cause of absences from school and work.

This study, made possible by the participation of members of the Philadelphia Orchestra, brings insight on the modes of production and early life of aerosols of human origin emitted by wind instruments. We find that these instruments produce aerosol levels that are comparable to normal speech in quantity and size distribution. However, the exit jet flow speeds are lower than violent expiratory events (coughing, sneezing).

In addition, the Chi-square formula was also applied in order to confirm that the differences found in both groups of adverts were not significantly important. The results show that a great deal of similar messages and even expressions was conveyed to both audiences in both countries, although some differences were also found. Besides, the main goal of these ads in both groups was to comfort the audience, and not to clearly promote or advertise the product. Thus, this study demonstrates once again that despite the differences that these two cultural groups display, and which are usually portrayed in intercultural literature, the context highly influences the values typically assigned to a linguistic community. That is reflected in the discourse of speakers, and it is the reason why we can find values opposite to those expected in a cultural group.

Among the discussions around health disparities lies a discussion on the role of psychosocial stress during this pandemic, especially with broadly applied social distancing and isolation recommendations. In nonpandemic times, psychosocial stressors have a significant association with physiological responses and behavioral responses. Within the current pandemic, increased attention on health-promoting behaviors, such as cooking and physical activity, has occurred. However, based on disparities from structural racism and socioeconomic effects on neighborhood environments, we may see a limiting value to the possible mitigating role of health behaviors within some disparate communities. We present in this perspective that there may be a role for behavioral interventions to mitigate psychosocial stressors and promote health behaviors.

Medical advances have led to an increase in the world's population of immunosuppressed individuals. The most severely immunocompromised patients are those who have been diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy, solid organ tumor, or who have other conditions that require immunosuppressive therapies and/or solid organ or stem cell transplants. Materials and methods. Medically attended patients with a positive clinical diagnosis of influenza were recruited prospectively and clinically evaluated. Nasal washes and serum were collected. Evaluation of viral shedding, nasal and serum cytokines, clinical illness, and clinical outcomes were performed to compare severely immunocompromised individuals to nonimmunocompromised individuals with influenza infection. Results. Immunocompromised patients with influenza had more severe disease/complications, longer viral shedding, and more antiviral resistance while demonstrating less clinical symptoms and signs on clinical assessment. Conclusions. Immunocompromised patients are at risk for more severe or complicated influenza induced disease, which may be difficult to prevent with existing vaccines and antiviral treatments. Specific issues to consider when managing a severely immunocompromised host include the development of asymptomatic shedding, multi-drug resistance during prolonged antiviral therapy, and the potential high risk of pulmonary involvement.

Blockchain technologys unique architecture provides individuals greater control over their information and may help address some of the problems related to health data. A multidisciplinary team designed and tested a blockchain application, MediLinker, as a patient-centric identity management system. METHODS: The study used simulated data of avatars representing different types of patients. Thirty study participants were enrolled to visit simulated clinics, and perform various activities using MediLinker. Evaluation was based on Bouras criteria for patient-centric identity management and on the number of errors in entry and sharing of data by participants. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of the 30 participants completed all study activities. MediLinker fulfilled all of Bouras criteria except for one which was not testable. A majority of data errors were due to user error, such as wrong formatting and misspellings. Generally, the number of errors decreased with time. Due to COVID-19, sprint 2 was completed using virtual clinic visits. The number of user errors were less in virtual visits than in personal visits. DISCUSSION: The evaluation of MediLinker provides some evidence of the potential of a patient-centric identity management system using blockchain technology. The results showed a working system where patients have greater control over their information and can also easily provide consent for use of their data. CONCLUSION: Blockchain applications for identity management hold great promise for use in healthcare but further research is needed before real-world adoption.","output":"Designing and testing a blockchain application for patient identity management in healthcare"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To address the COVID-19 pandemic, as for other infectious diseases, a key intervention is vaccination. To inform on the benefits and risks of vaccines, health communications are of great importance to enable empowered decisions and contribute to developing sustainable society-wide responses to health priorities such as the pandemic. To achieve the necessary citizen inclusion and involvement, the readability of media content fundamental. Previous research related to COVID-19 information has found readability of online information considerably more difficult than recommended. However, studies on the readability of information related to COVID-19 vaccination in Asia have not been carried out yet. Furthermore, especially in this pandemic, sources of health information include a variety of information channels, including through the internet and mass media. Thus, this paper aims to understand the ease of reading information generated through web-searches and newspaper articles on COVID-19 vaccination in Asia where English is one of the main languages, namely Singapore, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. Methods: The readability of information on COVID-19 vaccination from web-search results and newspaper articles for each location was assessed using a set of readability tests (Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index, Coleman-Liau Index, and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook Grade level). Results: Overall, the readability tests indicated a low proportion of URLs scoring within recommended readability thresholds, consistent across locations and types of sources. Furthermore, a relatively low proportion of web searches directed to local sources, as most URLs linked to sources beyond Singapore, Hong Kong or the Philippines. Further, local online and newspaper sources on average did not score any better on readability than non-local sources. Conclusion: Understanding of heath communications for COVID-19 vaccination encompasses accessing information on vaccine development and deployment, which benefits from including experiences from other locations as well as information on local uptake. The results pointed to relatively difficult-to-read readability scores for top search results as well as for local newspapers, and with a fairly low proportion of local sources amongst top search results. Hence, for health communications strategies addressing COVID-19 vaccination, an important issue is to consider different types of media sources to achieve the right mix of local and non-local sources while also ensuring appropriate readability.","output":"Health Information on COVID-19 Vaccination for Sustainable Society: Readability of Online Sources and Newspapers in Singapore, Hong Kong, and the Philippines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 has kept the whole world in tenterhooks due to its severe life\\\\threatening infectious disease, COVID\\\\19.

Their assembly and dynamics are finely regulated by posttranslational modifications. The type III IFs, vimentin, desmin, peripherin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), are targets for diverse modifications by oxidants and electrophiles, for which their conserved cysteine residue emerges as a hot spot. Pathophysiological examples of these modifications include lipoxidation in cell senescence and rheumatoid arthritis, disulfide formation in cataracts and nitrosation in endothelial shear stress, although some oxidative modifications can also be detected under basal conditions. We previously proposed that cysteine residues of vimentin and GFAP act as sensors for oxidative and electrophilic stress, and as hinges influencing filament assembly. Accumulating evidence indicates that the structurally diverse cysteine modifications, either per se or in combination with other posttranslational modifications, elicit specific functional outcomes inducing distinct assemblies or network rearrangements, including filament stabilization, bundling or fragmentation. Cysteine-deficient mutants are protected from these alterations but show compromised cellular performance in network assembly and expansion, organelle positioning and aggresome formation, revealing the importance of this residue. Therefore, the high susceptibility to modification of the conserved cysteine of type III IFs and its cornerstone position in filament architecture sustains their role in redox sensing and integration of cellular responses.

Findings reveal that contractual modifications derived from COVID-19 were mainly driven by extending the project schedule, increasing concessionaire's liquidity in the middle term, and reducing the project scope. Overall, the empirical findings indicate that USP was much more renegotiated than SP, which suggests that the public sector is more prone to guaranteeing the intended private's sector conditions in projects initiated by the same private sector.","output":"In the Name of the Pandemic: A Case Study of Contractual Modifications in PPP Solicited and Unsolicited Proposals in COVID-19 Times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus pandemic is recording unprecedented deaths worldwide.

A chain of experimental design was set up with distinct laboratories to standardize the extraction of samples, preparation of the master mix and detection. At the commencement of sample reception and testing, laboratory contamination was among the primary challenges faced. The source of the contamination was identified in the master mix room and resolved. In summary, the established COVID-19 testing lab has tested more than 40,000 samples (August 2020) and is the preferred setting for research and training.

MS2 coliphage was used as a surrogate for pathogenic viruses. A viral droplet test system was constructed, and the size distribution of viral droplets loaded directly onto respirators was characterized using an aerodynamic particle sizer. The sizes ranged from 0.5 to 15 mum, and the sizes of the majority of the droplets were the range from 0.74 to 3.5 mum. The results also showed that the droplet test system generated similar droplet concentrations (particle counts) at different respirator locations. The test system was validated by studying the relative efficiencies of decontamination of sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and UV irradiation with droplets containing MS2 virus on filtering facepiece respirators. It was hypothesized that more potent decontamination treatments would result in corresponding larger decreases in the number of viable viruses recovered from the respirators. Sodium hypochlorite doses of 2.75 to 5.50 mg/liter with a 10-min decontamination period resulted in approximately 3- to 4-log reductions in the level of MS2 coliphage. When higher sodium hypochlorite doses (> or =8.25 mg/liter) were used with the same contact time that was used for the dilute solutions containing 2.75 to 5.50 mg/liter, all MS2 was inactivated. For UV decontamination at a wavelength of 254 nm, an approximately 3-log reduction in the level of MS2 virus was achieved with dose of 4.32 J/cm(2) (3 h of contact time with a UV intensity of 0.4 mW/cm(2)), while with higher doses of UV irradiation (> or =7.20 J/cm(2); UV intensity, 0.4 mW/cm(2); contact times, > or =5 h), all MS2 was inactivated.

The ability to generate viral particles pseudotyped with SARS-COV2 Spike is useful for many types of studies, such as characterization of neutralizing antibodies or development of fusion-inhibiting small molecules. Here we characterized the use of a codon-optimized SARS-COV2 Spike glycoprotein for the generation of pseudotyped HIV-1, MLV, and VSV particles. The full-length Spike protein functioned inefficiently with all three systems but was enhanced over 10-fold by deleting the last 19 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of Spike. Infection of 293FT target cells was only possible if the cells were engineered to stably express the human ACE-2 receptor, but stably introducing an additional copy of this receptor did not further enhance susceptibility. Stable introduction of the Spike activating protease TMPRSS2 further enhanced susceptibility to infection by 5-10 fold. Substitution of the signal peptide of the Spike protein with an optimal signal peptide did not enhance or reduce infectious particle production. However, modification of a single amino acid in the furin cleavage site of Spike (R682Q) enhanced infectious particle production another 10-fold. With all enhancing elements combined, the titer of pseudotyped particles reached almost 106 infectious particles/ml. Finally, HIV-1 particles pseudotyped with SARS-COV2 Spike was successfully used to detect neutralizing antibodies in plasma from COVID-19 patients, but not plasma from uninfected individuals. Importance When working with pathogenic viruses, it is useful to have rapid quantitative tests for viral infectivity that can be performed without strict biocontainment restrictions. A common way of accomplishing this is to generate viral pseudoparticles that contain the surface glycoprotein from the pathogenic virus incorporated into a replication-defective viral particle that contains a sensitive reporter system. These pseudoparticles enter cells using the glycoprotein from the pathogenic virus leading to a readout for infection. Conditions that block entry of the pathogenic virus, such as neutralizing antibodies, will also block entry of the viral pseudoparticles. However, viral glycoproteins often are not readily suited for generating pseudoparticles. Here we describe a series of modifications that result in the production of relatively high titer SARS-COV2 pseudoparticles that are suitable for detection of neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients.","output":"Optimized pseudotyping conditions for the SARS-COV2 Spike glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the Thai education system, as many universities had to transfer their learning management to e-learning.

Serpin traps its target proteases by presenting a reactive center loop (RCL) as protease-specific cleavage site, resulting in protease inactivation.

Alternatively, RCL cleavage site of serpins with known evidence of inhibition of cysteine proteases can be replaced by Mpro target site to make chimeric proteins. Purified chimeric serpin can possibly inhibit Mpro that can be assessed indirectly by observing the decrease in ability of Mpro to cleave its chromogenic substrate.

By using regression analysis, the result shows that though the scandal event affected Luckin Coffees stock price severely, causing it to be in an irreversible situation, the impacts on Starbucks and Nasdaq are limited;the dip shown in Starbucks and Nasdaq on March is just due to the hit by the global pandemic, COVID-19.","output":"The Impact of Luckin Coffees Negative News on Its Stock Price and the Financial Market"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the beginning of the novel coronavirus another phenomenon was observed: the dissemination of false information on a large scale The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the coronavirus pandemic is not the only threat that the world is facing, but there is also an infodemic that needs to be controlled For example, false articles claiming that SARSCoV-2 was man-made or that the EU is going to be eradicated are invading the health sector This pilot study aims to analyze several COVID-19 related fake news disseminated in Romania that was identified as fake by traditional media outlets A content analysis of N=22 COVID-19 related fake news was conducted using a coding scheme adapted from Keselman et al (2019) The articles were written in a colloquial language, and the majority of them included criticism towards the government and their measures against the pandemic Some of the distinguished features of fake news according to previous literature in the field were identified in the examples that we chose","output":"An Analysis of COVID-19 C Related Fake News from Romania.

METHODS Data are from participants of the alteplase-dose arm of the randomized controlled trial, Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study (ENCHANTED). Associations between baseline characteristics of clinically defined supratentorial and infratentorial AIS patients and poor functional outcome, defined by scores 3-6 on the modified Rankin Scale, were evaluated in logistic regression models, with area under the curve (AUC) receiver operating characteristics defining the optimal NIHSS predictor cut point. RESULTS Patients with infratentorial AIS (n = 289) had lower baseline NIHSS scores than those with supratentorial AIS (n = 2,613) (median 7 vs 9; p < 0.001). NIHSS cut points for poor outcome were 10 (AUC 76, sensitivity 65%, specificity 73%) and 6 (AUC 69, sensitivity 72%, specificity 56%) in supratentorial and infratentorial AIS, respectively. There was no significant difference in functional outcome or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage between AIS types. CONCLUSIONS In thrombolysis-eligible AIS patients, the NIHSS may underestimate clinical severity for infratentorial compared to supratentorial lesions for a similar prognosis for recovery. Because thrombolysis treatment has low effect on stroke outcome in patients with infratentorial AIS when baseline NIHSS score is more than 6, additional treatment such as endovascular treatment should be considered to improve stroke outcome.

Some studies also suggest that there are ethnic inequalities in healthcare use and care quality among people with multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs). The aims of this review are to (1) identify and describe the literature that reports on ethnicity and healthcare use and care quality among people with MLTCs in the UK and (2) examine how healthcare use and/or care quality for people with MLTCs compares across ethnic groups. We registered the protocol on PROSPERO (CRD42020220702). We searched the following databases up to December 2020: ASSIA, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science core collection. Reference lists of key articles were also hand-searched for relevant studies. The outcomes of interest were patterns of healthcare use and care quality among people with MLTCs for at least one minoritised ethnic group, compared to the White majority population in the UK. Two reviewers, L.B. and B.H., screened and extracted data from a random sample of studies (10%). B.H. independently screened and extracted data from the remaining studies. Of the 718 studies identified, 14 were eligible for inclusion. There was evidence indicating ethnic inequalities in disease management and emergency admissions among people with MLTCs in the five studies that counted more than two long-term conditions. Compared to their White counterparts, Black and Asian children and young people had higher rates of emergency admissions. Black and South Asian people were found to have suboptimal disease management compared to other ethnic groups. The findings suggest that for some minoritised ethnic group people with MLTCs there may be inadequate initiatives for managing health conditions and/or a need for enhanced strategies to reduce ethnic inequalities in healthcare. However, the few studies identified focused on a variety of conditions across different domains of healthcare use, and many of these studies used broad ethnic group categories. As such, further research focusing on MLTCs and using expanded ethnic categories in data collection is needed.","output":"Ethnic Inequalities in Healthcare Use and Care Quality among People with Multiple Long-Term Health Conditions Living in the United Kingdom: A Systematic Review and Narrative Synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020, impacting the lifestyles, economy, physical and mental health of individuals globally.

DNAm variability has been demonstrated to be tightly related to lifestyle behavior and exposure to environmental risk factors, ultimately providing an unbiased proxy of an individual state of health. At present, the creation of DNAm surrogates relies on univariate penalized regression models, with elastic-net regularizer being the gold standard when accomplishing the task. Nonetheless, more advanced modeling procedures are required in the presence of multivariate outcomes with a structured dependence pattern among the study samples. In this work we propose a general framework for mixed-effects multitask learning in presence of high-dimensional predictors to develop a multivariate DNAm biomarker from a multi-center study. A penalized estimation scheme based on an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is devised, in which any penalty criteria for fixed-effects models can be conveniently incorporated in the fitting process. We apply the proposed methodology to create novel DNAm surrogate biomarkers for multiple correlated risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and comorbidities. We show that the proposed approach, modeling multiple outcomes together, outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, both in predictive power and bio-molecular interpretation of the results.","output":"A general framework for penalized mixed-effects multitask learning with applications on DNA methylation surrogate biomarkers creation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been observed in coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19) patients, but whether RAS inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), are associated with clinical outcomes remains unknown.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study in a large tertiary care university hospital in Wuhan, China. All consecutive inpatients older than 65 years with COVID-19 were enrolled in this cohort. Demographic data, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between patients with AKI and without AKI. The association between AKI and mortality was analyzed. RESULTS: Of 1764 in-hospital patients, 882 older adult cases were included in this cohort. The median age was 71 years (interquartile range: 68-77), 440 (49.9%) were men. The most presented comorbidity was cardiovascular diseases (58.2%), followed by diabetes (31.4%). Of 882 older patients, 115 (13%) developed AKI and 128 (14.5%) died. Patients with AKI had higher mortality than those without AKI (68 [59.1%] vs 60 [7.8%]; pa? <a? .001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that increasing odds of in-hospital mortality are associated with higher interleukin-6 on admission, myocardial injury, and AKI. CONCLUSIONS: Acute kidney injury is not an uncommon complication in older patients with COVID-19 but is associated with a high risk of death. Physicians should be aware of the risk of AKI in older patients with COVID-19.","output":"Acute Kidney Injury Is Associated With In-hospital Mortality in Older Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although fetal death is now understood to be a severe outcome of congenital Zika syndrome, the role of viral genetics is still unclear. We sequenced Zika virus (ZIKV) from a rhesus macaque fetus that died after inoculation and identified a single intrahost substitution, M1404I, in the ZIKV polyprotein, located in nonstructural protein 2B (NS2B). Targeted sequencing flanking position 1404 in 9 additional macaque mothers and their fetuses identified M1404I at a subconsensus frequency in the majority (5 of 9, 56%) of animals and some of their fetuses. Despite its repeated presence in pregnant macaques, M1404I has occurred rarely in humans since 2015. Since the primary ZIKV transmission cycle is human-mosquito-human, mutations in one host must be retained in the alternate host to be perpetuated. We hypothesized that ZIKV I1404 increases viral fitness in nonpregnant macaques and pregnant mice but is less efficiently transmitted by vectors, explaining its low frequency in humans during outbreaks. By examining competitive fitness relative to that of ZIKV M1404, we observed that ZIKV I1404 produced lower viremias in nonpregnant macaques and was a weaker competitor in tissues. In pregnant wild-type mice, ZIKV I1404 increased the magnitude and rate of placental infection and conferred fetal infection, in contrast to ZIKV M1404, which was not detected in fetuses. Although infection and dissemination rates were not different, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes transmitted ZIKV I1404 more poorly than ZIKV M1404. Our data highlight the complexity of arbovirus mutation-fitness dynamics and suggest that intrahost ZIKV mutations capable of augmenting fitness in pregnant vertebrates may not necessarily spread efficiently via mosquitoes during epidemics. IMPORTANCE Although Zika virus infection of pregnant women can result in congenital Zika syndrome, the factors that cause the syndrome in some but not all infected mothers are still unclear. We identified a mutation that was present in some ZIKV genomes in experimentally inoculated pregnant rhesus macaques and their fetuses. Although we did not find an association between the presence of the mutation and fetal death, we performed additional studies with ZIKV with the mutation in nonpregnant macaques, pregnant mice, and mosquitoes. We observed that the mutation increased the ability of the virus to infect mouse fetuses but decreased its capacity to produce high levels of virus in the blood of nonpregnant macaques and to be transmitted by mosquitoes. This study shows that mutations in mosquito-borne viruses like ZIKV that increase fitness in pregnant vertebrates may not spread in outbreaks when they compromise transmission via mosquitoes and fitness in nonpregnant hosts.","output":"Two Sides of a Coin: a Zika Virus Mutation Selected in Pregnant Rhesus Macaques Promotes Fetal Infection in Mice but at a Cost of Reduced Fitness in Nonpregnant Macaques and Diminished Transmissibility by Vectors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 virus is the cause of the global pandemic since the end of the year 2019.

The sFLT1-mediated endothelial dysfunction is a common theory for the manifestation of maternal preeclampsia symptoms. However, the influence of sFLT1 on SpA-remodeling and the link between placental and maternal preeclampsia symptoms is less understood. To dissect the hsFLT1 (human sFLT1) effects on maternal and/or fetoplacental physiology in preeclampsia, sFLT1-transgenic mice with systemic hsFLT1 overexpression from midgestation onwards were used. SpA-remodeling was analyzed on histological and molecular level in placental/mesometrial triangle tissues. Maternal kidney and aorta morphology was investigated, combined with blood pressure measurements via telemetry. hsFLT1 overexpression resulted in maternal hypertension, aortic wall thickening, and elastin breakdown. Furthermore, maternal kidneys showed glomerular endotheliosis, podocyte damage, and proteinuria. preeclampsia symptoms were combined with fetal growth restriction already at the end of the second trimester and SpA-remodeling was strongly impaired as shown by persisted vascular smooth muscle cells. This phenotype was associated with shallow trophoblast invasion, delayed presence of uterine natural killer cells, and altered lymphatic angiogenesis. Overall, this study showed that circulating maternal hsFLT1 is sufficient to induce typical maternal preeclampsia-like symptoms in mice and impair the SpA-remodeling independent from the fetoplacental compartment, revealing new insights into the interaction between the placental and maternal contribution of preeclampsia.","output":"Circulating Maternal sFLT1 (Soluble fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase-1) Is Sufficient to Impair Spiral Arterial Remodeling in a Preeclampsia Mouse Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Newborn screening (NBS) is a test done shortly after birth to detect conditions that cause severe health problems if not treated early. An estimated 71% of babies worldwide are born in jurisdictions that do not have an established NBS programme. Guyana currently has no NBS programme and has established a partnership with Newborn Screening Ontario (NSO) to initiate screening. OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of implementing a NBS programme in Guyana for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) and haemoglobinopathies (HBG) and to report on screen positive rates and prevalence (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)) for CH and HBG. METHODS: Term, healthy Guyanese infants were evaluated (with consent) using heel prick dried blood spots (DBS) shortly after birth (closer to 24 hours of life). DBS samples were analysed at NSO. Screening test for CH was done using a human thyroid-stimulating hormone (hTSH) assay. Mean hTSH levels between the Guyanese sample and the Ontarian population were compared using Students t-test with an alpha of 0.05. Screening test for HBG was performed with a cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The pilot was conducted from 6 June 2016 to 22 September 2017. Georgetown Public Hospital Corporation recruited 2294 mothers/infants. Screen positive rate for CH in our sample was 0.0% (0/2038 infants). Mean TSH levels in Guyanese samples (1.7 U/mL blood) was noticed to be significantly different than in the Ontarian population (4.3 U/mL blood) (p<0.05). Screen positive rate for sickle cell anaemia (SCA) in our sample was 0.3% (7/2039 patients), and the carrier rate was 8.4% (172/2039 patients).

In addition, the emotional status of individuals with less concern for their own health and that of family and friends is less likely to be described as a feeling of uncertainty. Although the results related to age, income, and job losses, as regards concern for health, agree with the international literature, the limited health literacy of lower-class individuals may explain the reduced likelihood of their experiencing feelings of uncertainty.

DESIGN Eligible patients had IVT started within 4.5 hours of stroke symptom onset. Those randomised to additional MT underwent thrombectomy using any Conformit Europene (CE)-marked device, with target interval times for IVT start to arterial puncture of <90 min. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving independence defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 at day 90. RESULTS Ten UK centres enrolled 65 patients between April 2013 and April 2015. Median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 16 (IQR 13-21). Median stroke onset to IVT start was 120 min. In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant difference in disability-free survival at day 90 with MT (absolute difference 11%, adjusted OR 2.12, 95% CI 0.65 to 6.94, p=0.20). Secondary analyses showed significantly greater likelihood of full neurological recovery (mRS 0-1) at day 90 (OR 7.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 37.2, p=0.010).

People experiencing homelessness (PEH) have high rates of chronic illness, and have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. The burden of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) in PEH has not been well-studied and PEH may be uniquely affected due to barriers to medical care and the potential exacerbation of existing threats to health, housing, employment, and self-care. Methods The Seattle Flu Study conducted community-based surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in nine homeless shelters from September 1, 2020 and May 31, 2021. Individuals with and without respiratory symptoms were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using a PCR assay. We completed follow-up surveys with shelter residents age 18 years at days 5, 10, 30 and 60+ after positive or inconclusive diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Individuals were asked about residual symptoms, impact on activities of daily living, access to medical care, and health-related quality of life.

Sensitivity analyses and numerical simulations reveal that, improving the proportion of timely diagnosis and shortening the waiting time for diagnosis can not eliminate COVID-19 but can effectively decrease the basic reproduction number, significantly reduce the transmission risk, and effectively prevent the endemic of COVID-19, e.g., shorten the peak time and reduce the peak value of new confirmed cases and new infection, decrease the cumulative number of confirmed cases and total infection. More rigorous prevention measures and better treatment of patients are needed to control its further spread, e.g., increasing available hospital beds, shortening the period from symptom onset to isolation of patients, quarantining and isolating the suspected cases as well as all confirmed patients.","output":"Effect of delay in diagnosis on transmission of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antiviral therapeutics are a front-line defense against virally induced diseases. Because viruses frequently mutate to escape direct inhibition of viral proteins, there is interest in targeting the host proteins that the virus must co-opt to complete its replication cycle. However, a detailed understanding of the interactions between the virus and the host cell is necessary in order to facilitate development of host-directed therapeutics. As a first step, we performed a genome-wide loss of function screen using the alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E to better define the interactions between coronaviruses and host-factors. We report the identification and validation of an ER-resident host protein, TMEM41B, as an essential host factor for not only HCoV-229E but also genetically distinct coronaviruses including the pandemic beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We show that the protein is required at an early, but post-receptor engagement, stage of the viral lifecycle. Further, mechanistic studies revealed that although the protein was not enriched at replication complexes, it likely contributes to viral replication complex formation via mobilization of cholesterol and other lipids to facilitate host membrane expansion and curvature. Continued study of TMEM41B and the development of approaches to prevent its function may lead to broad spectrum anti-coronavirus therapeutics.","output":"TMEM41B is a host factor required for the replication of diverse coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to investigate the relationship between inbound tourism and housing market along with the recent boom in Icelandic real estate sector, in which both house and rental prices have been rising dramatically.

They also reported their access to formal and informal teaching had been limited by COVID-19 restrictions. We aimed to create an accessible teaching programme that met their developmental needs as set out by the Foundation curriculum, as well as their confidence and skill set in dealing with common mental health presentations. Our supplementary aims were to promote psychiatry as a career and to provide supervised teaching opportunities to core trainees. METHOD: Having assessed the foundation doctors confidence in dealing with different scenarios, we created a 9 week teaching programme covering common mental health presentations they're likely to encounter during their training. The virtual sessions focus on what assessment and management skills would be expected for a foundation doctor, as well as when and how to access support and refer on. The programme was designed to be trainee led with the teaching being facilitated by core trainees as it was felt that they would best relate to the experiences and developmental needs of foundation doctors. This also provided the CTs with an opportunity to develop their teaching skills, something that has become more difficult during COVID. RESULT: Through weekly feedback of the sessions we were able to demonstrate that for 8 of the 9 sessions the foundation doctors rated them as being useful or very useful and we're currently reviewing the topic and materials for the outlying session. Through self-assessed ratings before and after the programme, we demonstrated significant increases in confidence in dealing with all 9 of the scenarios. All of the foundation doctors indicated that they had found the programme beneficial. CONCLUSION: As shown in the results, the programme has been well received by the foundation doctors who's confidence in dealing with a range of scenarios has improved. The programme has also been well received by the trust who have asked us to repeat the it for future foundation rotations and by core trainees who were grateful of the development opportunities that this provided.

The effectiveness of adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy in the management of 2019-nCoV-infected patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections is not clear, and warrants further investigation. METHODS: The present study will be conducted as an open-labeled, randomized, controlled trial. We will enrol 48 subjects from Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. Each eligible subject will be assigned to an intervention group (methylprednisolone via intravenous injection at a dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day for 3 days) or a control group (no glucocorticoid use) randomly, at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both groups will be invited for 28 days of follow-up which will be scheduled at four consecutive visit points. We will use the clinical improvement rate as our primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include the timing of clinical improvement after intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate of adverse events at each visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: The present coronavirus outbreak is the third serious global coronavirus outbreak in the past two decades. Oral and parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the management of severe respiratory symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the past. However, there remains no definitive evidence in the literature for or against the utilization of systemic glucocorticoids in seriously ill patients with coronavirus-related severe respiratory disease, or indeed in other types of severe respiratory disease. In this study, we hope to discover evidence either supporting or opposing the systemic therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019.

This condition has resulted in a change in how learning and assessment of psychiatric and interprofessional practice occur. The pandemic has also increased clinical mentors' need to follow their mentees' educational progress via virtual technology, including smartphone-based educational apps. The aim of the study is to propose a model in psychiatric and medical interprofessional practice e-assessment. METHODS In this study, 228 undergraduate healthcare students underwent a training period in interprofessional practice across specialties being assessed by Ecological Momentary e-Assessment (EMeA), and consisting of ongoing or before/after Interprofessional Education (IPE) learning evaluations with the assistance of an IPE-app linked to online surveys. The Goodness of Fit Test Chi-square and t-test statistics analyzed the data. RESULTS Surveys during, at entry and exit points in IPE captured increased percentages of learners, specifically, reporting high patient satisfaction with interprofessional teams (c2=22.54; p<.01), learners experiencing very good quality of care when delivered by interprofessional teams (c2=30.02; p<.01) assessed by distance technology, and learners selecting less frequently peers from the same clinical background when support was needed in patient care (c2=19.84; p<.01). CONCLUSIONS Contextual assessment (in the real-time and real-world scenario) of IPE learning moments via EMeA shows its value and applicability during the current covid-19 pandemic when the assessment of learning cannot occur face-to-face between learners and teachers. All healthcare students, including those on psychiatric rotations, could log in their progress, self-reflective assessments, and responses to coordinated care in interprofessional teams, without needing direct contact with their clinical tutors, and while treating patients with mental and physical illnesses, also including covid-19 positive patients.","output":"Psychiatric training during covid-19 pandemic benefits from integrated practice in interprofessional teams and ecological momentary e-assessment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background:Patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are at a higher risk for developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) than the general population. This increased risk is partly due to a higher incidence of traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, and partly due to the underlying systemic inflammation. During the past two decades, the burden of the systemic inflammation has been reduced by more efficacious anti-inflammatory treatment, which somewhat attenuated the increased CV risk of rheumatic patients. However, it remains important to monitor the effects of these new treatment strategies on the prevalence of CVD in patients with a rheumatic disease in systematically controlled cohorts.Objectives:The aim of the current report was to evaluate whether the CV risk of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases still differs from the general population, despite advances In anti-rheumatic treatment strategies.Methods:In March 2020, all adult patients with an inflammatory rheumatic disease from the Amsterdam Rheumatology and Immunology Center, location Reade were systematically asked to participate in a prospective cohort study. The primary aim of this study was to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases compared to age and sex matched healthy controls. Between April 26, 2020 and May 27, 2020, participants completed the first online questionnaire of the study. Amongst others, information on demographic data, including CV comorbidities and risk factors, and medication use was collected. The baseline characteristics and prevalence of CVD were compared between RA, PsA or AS and healthy controls.Results:In total, 1455 consecutive patients with an inflammatory rheumatic disease (979 RA patients, 261 PsA patients and 215 AS patients), and 414 healthy controls completed the first questionnaire, as shown in table 1.

This corresponds with previous research, although the reported prevalence of CVD in PsA and AS patients is even higher compared to prior studies. This suggests that the CVD risk of patients with rheumatic diseases is still elevated in 2020 compared to the general population, despite the improved management of rheumatic disease activity. Therefore, adequate and timely treatment of CV risk factors remains relevant, not only in patients with RA, but in patients other rheumatic diseases as well.References:[1]Hooijberg F et al.

More specifically, we question the standard assumption in the literature on epidemiological models, where the transmission rate dictating propagation of infections is taken to be proportional to the product between the infected and susceptible sub-populations; a model that relies on strong mixing between the two groups and widespread contact between members of the groups. We content, that contact between infected and susceptible individuals, especially during the early phases of an epidemic, takes place over a (possibly diffused) boundary between the respective sub-populations. As a result, the rate of transmission depends on the product of fractional powers instead. The intuition relies on the fact that infection grows in geographically concentrated cells, in contrast to the standard product model that relies on complete mixing of the susceptible to infected sub-populations. We validate the hypothesis of fractional exponents i) by numerical simulation for disease propagation in graphs imposing a local structure to allowed disease transmissions and ii) by fitting the model to a COVID-19 data set provided by John Hopkins University (JHUCSSE) for the period Jan-31C20 to Mar-24C20, for the countries of Italy, Germany, Iran, and France.","output":"Fractional SIR Epidemiological Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this unprecedented coronavirus crisis, telehealth had emerged as a substitute way of treatment.

However, to develop effective public-health initiatives for such crisis events, it would also be relevant to determine the pandemics impact on the behavioral, emotional, and social lives of Saudi children. Objective To assess, among Saudi children aged 3-15 years, the behavioral, emotional, and social changes that have occurred in their daily lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods This study featured a cross-sectional design. Potential participants were approached through the most popular social media in Saudi Arabia, and the final sample size was 651 parents. As, at the time of data collection, the members of the Saudi public were requested to avoid face-to-face meetings where possible, a well-designed electronic questionnaire featuring closed-ended questions was used. Results Descriptive statistics showed that the mean age of the parents was 297 years (range: 20-60 years); over half (58%) were female. During the COVID-19 outbreak, one-third of children had asked to sleep in their parents beds. Furthermore, approximately 30% of children demonstrated increased irritability and mood swings when compared with the period before the pandemic. Concerning adaptive social behaviors, during the pandemic, 22% of children appeared calmer and 14% of children seemed more thoughtful. Our study reports more screen time, less physical activity, and reduced sleep time among children compared with the pre-pandemic period.

Comparing the above four structures, we found that the structure of &#945;-CoVs nsp1 in the same subtype was more conserved. We then selected mammalian cells that were treated with SADS-CoV and FIPV nsp1 for RNA sequencing analysis and found that nsp1 had a specific inhibitory effect on interferon (IFN) and cell cycle genes. Using the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) assay and Western blotting, we confirmed that seven representative &#945;-CoVs nsp1s could significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of STAT1-S727 and interfere with the effect of IFN-I.

It is of particular concern that during the acute phase of COVID-19, the control of pre-existing metabolic diseases tends to get worse which again increases the risk for complications and a poor outcome in these patients. A significant contributor to these complications is endothelial dysfunction which is associated with COVID-19.

In contrast to statins, the PCSK9 inhibitors lower lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] level, and, accordingly, these latter drugs need to be considered particularly in FH patients with an elevated level of Lp(a).

The membership category of Specialty Trainees within the national specialty association-the British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (BAOMS) is Fellows in Training abbreviated to FiT. We designed an OMFS FiT (Fellows in Training) webinar series based on the current Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) curriculum. Senior trainers delivered weekly national web-based teaching using learning theories of education. Thirteen webinars were conducted between the 14th of May and the 4th of August 2020. Webinars were attended by 40-75 ST's with 98 percent of trainees rating the webinars as 'excellent' or 'very good', and 99% found the content 'extremely useful' or 'very useful'. We discuss the learning theories used for this teaching which include - Bloom's taxonomy, Bruner's spiral model, Vygotsky's zone of proximal development, the flipped classroom model, and Knowles' andragogy model. This pilot national teaching programme has been extremely well received by OMFS trainees and is here to stay!","output":"Providing national level teaching to OMFS specialty trainees in a virtual classroom setting using learning theories of education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Crises such as European debt crisis, Brexit, and COVID-19 have challenged established relations between finance and the state in attempts at mitigating a broad range of crises-related risks. We ask whether and how these altered relations in themselves constitute novel uncertainties and risks between the two fields. To better understand these dynamics, we introduce the concept of risk entanglement to complement financialization as a key concept presently capturing these relations. Based on qualitative research in the German finance-state nexus, we show how financial and state actors mutually construe each other as risks that need to be managed and mitigated to safeguard their particular, field-specific logics and ends. We focus on systemic risk and political risk as two cases of risk entanglement: whereas systemic risk reflects the threat of a potential financial meltdown to the state, political risk reflects how the state endangers established risk practices in finance.","output":"Risk Entanglement in the Finance-State Nexus: The Case of Systemic and Political Risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Performing exercise with medium intensity has positive effects on the maternal health. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of Pilates exercise program during pregnancy on childbirth outcomes: METHODS: This clinical trial study was performed on 110 primiparous women who were randomly divided into two groups of intervention (n = 55) and control (n = 55). The intervention group performed Pilates exercises from 26 to 28 weeks of gestation for 8 weeks while the control group did not do any exercise. Data collection tools included Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Mackey Childbirth Satisfaction Rating Scale, and a checklist including demographic and obstetrics information. RESULTS: The results of the study showed that Pilates exercise during pregnancy significantly reduces the labor pain intensity, length of the active phase and second stage of labor and increases maternal satisfaction of the labor process (p < 0.05). Based on the Kaplan Meyer analysis, the mean whole length of labor was shorter in Pilates exercise group than in the control group (P = .004). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of Episiotomy, type of delivery, first and fifth Apgar score of neonates (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, Pilates exercise during pregnancy improved the labor process and increased maternal satisfaction of chidbirthprocess, without causing complications for the mother and baby. However, studies with larger sample sizes are recommended to prove the efficacy and safty of this practiceduring labor. TRIAL REGISTRATION: IRCT registration number: IRCT20200126046266N1.

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted food supplies across the world, and public health restrictions have changed the way people shop for food, potentially exacerbating food insecurity. This systematic literature review aimed to synthesize the available evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aspects of food insecurity in rural populations residing in high-income countries. Five electronic databases were searched, identifying 22 articles that assessed food insecurity prevalence or data on food availability, access, utilization and the stability of the food supply in rural populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ten studies examined the prevalence of food insecurity in rural populations, with the reported prevalence ranging from 15% to 95%. Where rural/urban comparisons were presented, most studies (n = 5; 71%) reported that food insecurity was significantly higher in rural regions. Five studies examined the availability of food and eight studies examined access to food, identifying that rural populations often had lower food availability and access to food during the pandemic. In contrast, two studies identified positive effects such as more gardening and increased online access to food. Rural populations experienced multiple changes to food utilization, such as reduced diet quality and food safety observed in eight studies, but this was not shown to be different from urban populations. Additionally, the food supply in rural regions was perceived to be affected in two studies. The results of this review may be used to inform region-specific mitigation strategies to decrease the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic and future global events on food security. However, the lack of consistency in study outcomes in research on rural populations limits the identification of priority areas for intervention at a global-scale.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Rural Food Security in High Income Countries: A Systematic Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Limited data are available on metabolic responses of plants to copper (Cu)-toxicity. Firstly, we investigated Cu-toxic effects on metabolomics, the levels of free amino acids, NH4+-N, NO3--N, total nitrogen, total soluble proteins, total phenolics, lignin, reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde, and the activities of nitrogen-assimilatory enzymes in 'Shatian' pummelo (Citrus grandis) leaves. Then, a conjoint analysis of metabolomics, physiology and transcriptomics was performed. Herein, 59 upregulated [30 primary metabolites (PMs) and 29 secondary metabolites (SMs)] and 52 downregulated (31 PMs and 21 SMs) metabolites were identified in Cu-toxic leaves. The toxicity of Cu to leaves was related to the Cu-induced accumulation of NH4+ and decrease of nitrogen assimilation. Metabolomics combined with physiology and transcriptomics revealed some adaptive responses of C. grandis leaves to Cu-toxicity, including (a) enhancing tryptophan metabolism and the levels of some amino acids and derivatives (tryptophan, phenylalanine, 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan, 5-oxoproline and GSH); (b) increasing the accumulation of carbohydrates and alcohols and upregulating tricarboxylic acid cycle and the levels of some organic acids and derivatives (chlorogenic acid, quinic acid, d-tartaric acid and gallic acid o-hexoside); (c) reducing phospholipid (lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine) levels, increasing non-phosphate containing lipid [monoacylglycerol ester (acyl 18:2) isomer 1] levels, and inducing low-phosphate-responsive gene expression; and (d) triggering the biosynthesis of some chelators (total phenolics, lignin, l-trytamine, indole, eriodictyol C-hexoside, quercetin 5-O-malonylhexosyl-hexoside, N-caffeoyl agmatine, N'-p-coumaroyl agmatine, hydroxy-methoxycinnamate and protocatechuic acid o-glucoside) and vitamins and derivatives (nicotinic acid-hexoside, B1 and methyl nicotinate).

Furthermore, 85% of respondents took two doses of the vaccine and 15% took one. The authorial questionnaire was completed by the participants in the study online in February 2021. The results obtained indicate that the COVID-19 vaccine generates hope for stopping the pandemic. In addition, 96% of research participants think so. Doctors in middle and mature age are the most optimistic, while the youngest ones are less optimistic. In addition, 57% of respondents do not worry about side effects after taking the vaccine. Fear at the time of vaccination was experienced by over 9% of doctors. The most frequently reported post-vaccination reactions are injection site pain, fatigue and headache. Increased temperature occurred in older female respondents. From a psychosocial perspective, men are more likely to fear being infected personally with the virus, and women are more likely to be infected with their loved ones.

However, even though collecting BT data is subject to random noise and may result in substantial measurement errors, there is an absence of rigorous procedures for validating the quality of the inferred BT social networks. This paper presents a methodology for inferring and validating BT-based social networks based on parameter optimization algorithm and social network analysis (SNA). The algorithm performs edge inference in a brute-force search over a given BT data set, for deriving optimal BT social networks by validating them with predefined ground truth (GT) networks. The algorithm seeks to optimize a set of parameters, predefined considering some reliability challenges associated to the BT technology itself. The outcomes show that optimizing the parameters can reduce the number of BT data false positives or generate BT networks with the minimum amount of BT data observations. The subsequent SNA shows that the inferred BT social networks are unable to reproduce some network characteristics present in the corresponding GT networks. Finally, the generalizability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by applying the algorithm on external BT data sets, while obtaining comparable results.","output":"Understanding the complexities of Bluetooth for representing real-life social networks: A methodology for inferring and validating Bluetooth-based social network graphs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Studies show that historically marginalized populations, such as racial/ethnic minorities, thoseliving in poverty, and those with limited English prociency are less likely to utilize patient portals that arebecoming increasingly integrated into clinical care In March 2020, nearly all in-person clinical operations forour large primary care network were ordered to cease due to COVID-19 In order to pivot quickly whileensuring our most vulnerable children and families were not left behind, we leveraged an equity-focusedquality improvement (QI) framework As we rolled out increased telehealth capacity we concurrently sought toreduce existing disparities in patient portal activation and utilization Methodology We executed ourintervention in a large primary care network that cares for over 270,000 children in southeastern PA/NJ,including over 90,000 Medicaid-insured children To determine baseline data, we queried our data warehouseand identied the patient portal activation status of all patients with a primary care visit between January 2018 - December 2019 We then stratied the data by sociodemographic variables: race/ethnicity, insurance type(private or government), preferred language, and the percent of households in their neighborhoods(approximated by census tract) living below the federal poverty line This analysis revealed disparities inactivation status, which prompted assembly of a multidisciplinary task force to ensure that barriers werequickly removed for families to access telehealth We used an equity-focused QI approach to carry out cyclesof sequential interventions Discussion During the two-year pre-intervention period, nearly 300,000 patientswere seen in our primary care practices Notable disparities were observed across all four demographiccategories examined (Figure 1) Differential patient portal activation status was noted by: race/ethnicity (69%among non-Hispanic white vs 42% among non-Hispanic black patients);insurance types (67% amongprivately-insured vs 42% among Medicaid patients);language (60% among English speaking vs 22% among ofnon-English speaking patients);and poverty (66% in the lowest poverty neighborhoods vs 38% in the highestpoverty neighborhoods) After iterative innovative interventions to remove technological and process barriersto portal utilization, rates of activation for the entire primary care population increased by 16% overall Additionally, we observed marked improvement in activation rates among Medicaid-insured children (26%increase);among Spanish-speaking families (36% increase), and African-American families (23% increase) Conclusion We demonstrated signicant narrowing in baseline disparities in electronic patient portalutilization by race, ethnicity, insurance type, and language This improvement was accomplished through useof an equity-focused QI framework that resulted in interventions focused on removing as many barriers aspossible and creating a value-add for patients Next steps include demonstrating sustained improvement,evaluating patient satisfaction, and ascertaining which of our interventions were most contributory to our improvement","output":"Never let a pandemic go to waste: Applying an equity-focusedquality improvement framework to close gaps in patient portalactivation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has caused a great disruption in higher education worldwide.

Most concerns regarding glucocorticoids stem from observational studies which are affected by several forms of bias, mainly confounding by indication, that may result in overestimation of harm. Solid evidence regarding the safety of low-dose glucocorticoids remains remarkably scarce. RECENT FINDINGS Several observational studies showed heterogeneous results and two 6-month trials showed no increase of harm. The GLORIA trial of 5 mg/day prednisolone vs. placebo in patients aged 65+ is the first randomized control trial with glucocorticoids safety as coprimary outcome. The benefits of glucocorticoids in terms of symptoms and structural damage were confirmed, but the proportion of patients with at least one adverse event of special interest (serious or glucocorticoids-related) was increased by 24%, mostly due to nonsevere infections. SUMMARY Based on current evidence the benefit-risk balance of low-dose glucocorticoids in rheumatoid arthritis, and probably in other rheumatic diseases is generally favourable.

With different coil shapes and stimulation location, inspiratory responses and side-effects may differ. Objective: To compare the inspiratory and sensory responses of three different RMS-coils either used bilaterally on the neck or on the chest, and to determine if ventilation over 10min can be achieved without muscle fatigue and coils overheating. Methods: Healthy participants underwent 1-s RMS on the neck (RMSBAMPS) (n=14) with three different pairs of magnetic coils (parabolic, D-shape, butterfly) at 15, 20, 25 and 30Hz stimulator-frequency and 20% stimulator-output with +10% increments. The D-shape coil with individual optimal stimulation settings was then used to ventilate participants (n=11) for up to 10min. Anterior RMS on the chest (RMSaMS) (n=8) was conducted on an optional visit. Airflow was assessed via pneumotach and transdiaphragmatic pressure via esophageal and gastric balloon catheters. Perception of air hunger, discomfort, pain and paresthesia were measured with a numerical scale. Main results: Inspiration was induced via RMSBAMPS in 86% of participants with all coils and via RMSaMS in only one participant with the parabolic coil. All coils produced similar inspiratory and sensory responses during RMSBAMPS with the butterfly coil needing higher stimulator-output, which resulted in significantly larger discomfort ratings at maximal inspiratory responses. Ten of 11 participants achieved 10min of ventilation without decreases in minute ventilation (15.7{+/-}4.6L/min).

In this study, a robot-assisted US-navigation platform has been developed for 3D US guidance and planning of conformal HIFU ablations. The platform was used to evaluate a conformal therapeutic strategy associated with an interstitial dual-mode USgHIFU catheter prototype (64 elements linear-array, measured central frequency f = 6.5 MHz), developed for the treatment of HepatoCellular Carcinoma (HCC). The platform included a 3D navigation environment communicating in real-time with an open research dual-mode US scanner/HIFU generator and a robotic arm, on which the USgHIFU catheter was mounted. 3D US-navigation was evaluated in vitro for guiding and planning conformal HIFU ablations using a tumor-mimic model in porcine liver. Tumor-mimic volumes were then used as targets for evaluating conformal HIFU treatment planning in simulation. Height tumor-mimics (ovoid- or disc-shaped, sizes: 3-29 cm3) were created and visualized in liver using interstitial 2D US imaging. Robot-assisted spatial manipulation of these images and real-time 3D navigation allowed reconstructions of 3D B-mode US images for accurate tumor-mimic volume estimation (relative error: 4  5%).

We assessed the safety and efficacy of the Flow-Redirection Endoluminal Device (FRED) in a consecutive series of 50 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Inclusion criteria were wide-neck, blister-like, or fusiform/dissecting aneurysms independent of size, treated with the FRED between February 2014 and May 2015. Assessment criteria were aneurysm occlusion, manifest ischemic stroke, bleeding, or death. The occlusion rate was assessed at 3 months with flat panel CT and at 6 months with DSA by using the Raymond classification and the O'Kelly-Marotta grading scale. RESULTS Fifty patients with 52 aneurysms were treated with 54 FREDs; 20 patients were treated with the FRED and coils. Aneurysm size ranged from 2.0 to 18.5 mm. Deployment of the FRED was successful in all cases. There were no device-associated complications. One patient developed mild stroke symptoms that fully receded within days. There have been no late-term complications so far and no treatment-related mortality. Initial follow-up at 3 months showed complete occlusion in 72.3% of the overall study group, Six-month follow-up showed total and remnant-neck occlusion in 87.2% of patients, distributed over 81.5% of the FRED-only cases and 95.0% of the cases with combined treatment. CONCLUSIONS The FRED flow diverter is a safe device for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms of various types.

Among anti-cytokine therapies, interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitors have been the most used and studied since the beginning of the pandemic. Going through previous observational studies, subsequent randomised controlled trials, and meta-analyses, we focused on the baseline characteristics of the patients recruited, identifying the most favourable features in the light of positive or negative study outcomes; taking into account the biological significance and predictivity of IL-6 and other biomarkers according to specific thresholds, we ultimately attempted to delineate precise windows for therapeutic intervention. By stimulating scavenger macrophages and T-cell responsivity, IL-6 seems protective against viral replication during asymptomatic infection; still protective on early tissue damage by modulating the release of granzymes and lymphokines in mild-moderate disease; importantly pathogenic in severe disease by inducing the proinflammatory activation of immune and endothelial cells (through trans-signalling and trans-presentation); and again protective in critical disease by exerting homeostatic roles for tissue repair (through cis-signalling), while IL-1 still drives hyperinflammation. IL-6 inhibitors, particularly anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibodies (e.g., tocilizumab, sarilumab), are effective in severe disease, characterised by baseline IL-6 concentrations ranging from 35 to 90 ng/mL (reached in the circulation within 6 days of hospital admission), a ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen (PaO2) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) between 100 and 200 mmHg, requirement of high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation, C-reactive protein levels between 120 and 160 mg/L, ferritin levels between 800 and 1600 ng/mL, D-dimer levels between 750 and 3000 ng/mL, and lactate dehydrogenase levels between 350 and 500 U/L. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor inhibitors might have similar windows of opportunity but different age preferences compared to IL-6 inhibitors (over or under 70 years old, respectively). Janus kinase inhibitors (e.g., baricitinib) may also be effective in moderate disease, whereas IL-1 inhibitors (e.g., anakinra) may also be effective in critical disease.

We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R0, the average number of secondary cases generated per case). METHODS: We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The questionnaire was conducted online via email recruitment and documents the age and location of contacts and a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday, 24 March, 1 day after a \\"lockdown\\" was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the \\"lockdown\\" to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place. RESULTS: We found a 74% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.8 to 2.8). This would be sufficient to reduce R0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22-0.53) for physical (skin to skin) contacts only. CONCLUSIONS: The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease, and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Tracking behavioural change can give a more rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine epidemiological surveillance.","output":"Quantifying the impact of physical distance measures on the transmission of COVID-19 in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE A number of new techniques have been developed to prevent lymphocele formation after pelvic lymphadenectomy in gynecologic cancers. We assessed whether the electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing device (EBVSD) could decrease the incidence of postoperative lymphocele secondary to pelvic lymphadenectomy. METHODS A total of 321 patients with gynecologic cancer underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy from 2005 to 2011. Pelvic lymphadenectomy without EBVSD was performed in 134 patients, and pelvic lymphadenectomy with EBVSD was performed in 187 patients. We retrospectively compared the incidence of lymphocele and symptoms between both groups. RESULTS Four to 8 weeks after operation, 108 cases of lymphocele (34%) were detected by computed tomography scan examination. The incidence of lymphocele after pelvic lymphadenectomy was 56% (75/134) in the tie ligation group, and 18% (33/187) in the EBVSD group. We found a statistically significant difference in the incidence of lymphocele between both groups (p<0.01). To detect the independent risk factor for lymphocele development, we performed multivariate analysis with logistic regression for three variables (device, number of dissected lymph nodes, and operation time). Among these variables, we found a significant difference (p<0.001) for only one device.

METHODS: Humoral response, including neutralizing antibodies, and T-cell mediated response elicited by BNT162b2 vaccine in 145 healthcare workers (both na?ve and positive for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection) were evaluated. In a subset of subjects, effect of SARS-CoV-2 variants on antibody level and cell-mediated response was also investigated. RESULTS: Overall 125/127 (98.4%) na?ve subjects developed both neutralizing antibodies and specific T-cells after the second dose. Moreover, the antibody and T-cell responses were effective against viral variants since SARS-CoV-2 NT Abs were still detectable in 55/68 (80.9%) and 25/29 (86.2%) na?ve subjects when sera were challenged against beta and delta variants, respectively.T-cell response was less affected, with no significant difference in the frequency of responders (p=0.369).

We review some current misconceptions about UC in adults with the aim of optimizing care for patients. Although UC and Crohn's disease (CD) are considered discrete diseases, distinctions between them are not always clear-cut and phenotypes may change over time. Patient management should take into account disease manifestations, disease severity and extent, and response to prior treatments. Although disease extent often defines severity, distal UC is not always less disabling than extensive disease as patients can progress to more extensive disease. In addition, severe proctitis can give rise to severe and debilitating symptoms, with a substantial impact on health-related quality of life. UC carries an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) compared with CD; however, more recent data indicate a similar risk of CRC in CD with colonic involvement as with UC. Corticosteroids are widely used to induce remission in UC, and prolonged use of steroids in patients with UC is common, but corticosteroid-free maintenance of remission is an important therapeutic goal. Although biologic therapies provide a valuable treatment option in UC, they are not clinically effective in all patients and are also associated with secondary loss of response.","output":"Ulcerative Colitis: Shifting Sands."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Malnutrition amongst under-fives remains common in resource-poor countries and is resistant to current interventions. New opportunities have emerged to target environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) that refers to the abnormal gut structure and function that results from colonisation of the gut with pathogenic microbes and compromises nutrition and growth in early life. Although the gut microbiome may provide a defence against ingested gut pathogens through colonisation resistance, its development is adversely affected by multiple environmental factors. Dietary supplements of pro- or synbiotics may build the resilience of the gut microbiome against these environmental factors and boost colonisation resistance. We aim to assess whether dietary supplementation of newborns in rural Kenya with pro/synbiotics prevents or ameliorates EED and improves growth. METHODS: Six hundred newborns less than 4 days old will be recruited from Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital, western Kenya. Newborns will be randomly allocated, stratified by HIV exposure, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of 4 study arms to receive either of two synbiotics, a probiotic or no supplement. Supplements will be given daily for 10 days and then weekly until 6 months of age. Participants will be followed until the age of 2 years. The primary outcome is systemic inflammation at 6 months assessed by plasma alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Secondary outcomes include biomarkers of gut health and growth, anthropometric indices, morbidity and mortality.

Additional registry cases known to the authors were included. Steps were taken to minimise duplicate patients. Information on coagulopathy based on abnormal coagulation test results or clinical evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and on arterial or venous thrombosis, were extracted using a standard form. If available, detailed laboratory results and information on maternal outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: One thousand sixty-three women met the inclusion criteria, of which three (0.28, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.6) had arterial and/or venous thrombosis, seven (0.66, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.1) had DIC, and a further three (0.28, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.6) had coagulopathy without meeting the definition of DIC.

To solve that, here we have integrated meta-dynamics, an enhanced sampling molecular simulation method, with all-atom molecular dynamics to determine a specific compound that could target the main protease of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).

Ileum gene expression studies were performed through high throughput reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. A deep review on the bibliography was done and genes related to intestinal health were selected for barrier function, immune response, oxidation, digestive hormones, nutrient transport, and metabolism. The panel was firstly tested by using a nutritional/Clostridium perfringens model of intestinal barrier failure (induced using commercial reused litter and wheat-based diets without exogenous supplementation of enzymes) and the consistency of results was evaluated by another experiment under a coccidiosis challenge (orally gavaged with a commercial coccidiosis vaccine, 90 vaccine dose). Growth traits and intestinal morphological analysis were performed to check the gut barrier failure occurrence. Results of ileum gene expression showed a higher expression in genes involved in barrier function and nutrient transport in chickens raised in healthy conditions, while genes involved in immune response presented higher expression in C.perfringens-challenged birds. On the other hand, the Eimeria challenge also altered the expression of genes related to barrier function and metabolism, and increased the expression of genes related to immune response and oxidative stress. The panel developed in the current study gives us an overview of genes and pathways involved in broiler response to pathogen challenge.

Methods: The clinical, laboratory test and computed tomography (CT) features of 30 medical personnel (MP group, 26-65 years, 16 males) with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed, and compared to 33 non-medical related patients (non-MP group, 26-74 years, 19 males). Follow-up CT characteristics were analyzed to assess the changes of the COVID-19 infection in the period of hospitalization. Results: At admission, the main complaints of MP group, including fever (86.7%), fatigue (53.3%) and cough (43.3%), were similar to the non-MP group;the C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase levels of the non-MP group (55.645.9mg/L, 34.726.3mm/H and 321117U/L) were higher than that of the MP group (17.819.9mg/L, 18.621.3mm/H and 21954.2U/L, respectively, all p<0.05). Ground-grass opacities, consolidation, interstitial thickening were common CT features of both groups. The days from illness onset to the first CT exam, and the severity of opacities on initial CT were less in the MP group than that of the non-MP group (p<0.05).

However, there has been substantial variability in the policies and intensity of diagnostic efforts between countries. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate the association between national contact tracing policies and case fatality rates of COVID-19 in 138 countries. Our regression analyses indicate that countries that implement comprehensive contact tracing have significantly lower case fatality rates. This association of contact tracing policy and case fatality rates is robust in our longitudinal regression models, even after controlling for the number of tests conducted and non-pharmaceutical control measures adopted by governments. Our results suggest that comprehensive contact tracing is instrumental not only to curtailing transmission but also to reducing case fatality rates. Contact tracing achieves the early detection and isolation of secondary cases which are particularly important given that the peak in infectiousness occurs during the presymptomatic phase. The early detection achieved by contact tracing accelerates the rate at which infected individuals receive medical care they need to maximize their chance of recovery. In addition, the combination of reduced transmission and more rapid recovery diminishes the burden on the healthcare system which in turn ensures that the resources remain available for individuals who do become infected.","output":"Cross-country evidence on the association between contact tracing and COVID-19 case fatality rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a sense of urgency in the research community in their bid to contribute to the evidence required for healthcare policy decisions.

Robotics is a rising field in the context of health care, and we sought to evaluate the use of robots in critical care settings. OBJECTIVE: Although robotic presence is prevalent in the surgical setting, its role in critical care has not been well established. We aimed to examine the uses and limitations of robots for patients who are critically ill. METHODS: This systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. MEDLINE, Embase, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Library were searched from their inception to December 23, 2021. Included studies involved patients requiring critical care, both in intensive care units or high-dependency units, or settings that required critical care procedures (eg, intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Randomized trials and observational studies were included. RESULTS: A total of 33 studies were included. The greatest application of robots in the intensive care unit was in the field of telepresence, whereby robots proved advantageous in providing a reduced response time, earlier intervention, and lower mortality rates. Challenges of telepresence included regulatory and financial barriers. In therapy and stroke rehabilitation, robots achieved superior clinical outcomes safely. Robotic use in patient evaluation and assessment was mainly through ultrasound evaluation, obtaining satisfactory to superior results with the added benefits of remote assessment, time savings, and increased efficiency. Robots in drug dispensing and delivery increased efficiency and generated cost savings. All the robots had technological limitations and hidden costs. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results show that robotic use in critical care settings is a beneficial, effective, and well-received intervention that delivers significant benefits to patients, staff, and hospitals.

Sturdy observing of the initial site of infection in patients is crucial to gain control in the struggle with COVID-19.

Many initial studies have focused on the identification of the genetic material of coronavirus and have a poor detection rate for long-term surgery. The first imaging procedure that played an important role in COVID-19 treatment was the chest X-ray. Radiological imaging is often used as a method that emphasizes the performance of chest X-rays. Recent findings indicate the presence of COVID-19 in patients with irregular findings on chest X-rays. There are many reports on this topic that include machine learning strategies for the identification of COVID-19 using chest X-rays. Other current studies have used non-public datasets and complex artificial intelligence (AI) systems. In our research, we suggested a new COVID-19 identification technique based on the locality-weighted learning and self-organization map (LWL-SOM) strategy for detecting and capturing COVID-19 cases. We first grouped images from chest X-ray datasets based on their similar features in different clusters using the SOM strategy in order to discriminate between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases.

With the increasing number of phenyl substituents, the molecule is transformed from a positive hard (&#916;HOMO > &#916;LUMO) to a soft (&#916;HOMO &#8776; &#916;LUMO) chromophore. This is manifested by a drastic decrease of the absorption intensity in the 0-0 region of the Q-band and by the strongly altered ratio of MCD intensities in the Q and Soret regions. Such behavior can be readily predicted using perimeter model, by analyzing frontier orbital shifts caused by various perturbations: alkyl and aryl substitution, insertion of a metal, and deviations from planarity. TDDFT calculations confirm the trends predicted by the perimeter model, but they fail in cases of less symmetrical derivatives to properly reproduce the MCD spectra in the Soret region. Our results confirm the power of the perimeter model in predicting absorption and MCD spectra of large organic molecules, porphyrins in particular.

Several potential allosteric or protein-protein interaction druggable sites on different viral targets were identified, knowledge that could be used to expand current drug discovery endeavors beyond the currently explored cysteine proteases and the polymerase complex. It is our hope that this study will support the efforts of the scientific community both in understanding the molecular determinants of this disease and in widening the repertoire of viral targets in the quest for repurposed or novel drugs against COVID-19.","output":"Functional and druggability analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interferon-simulated gene 15 (ISG15) belongs to the family of ubiquitin-like proteins.

However, existing continuum robots reach the bottleneck in actuation on account of the contradiction among small size, compliance actuation, large tender range, high precision, and small dynamic error. Herein, a 3D-printed millimeter-scale soft continuum robot with an ultrathin hollow skeleton wall (300 m) and a large inner-to-outer ratio (0.8) is reported. After coating a thin ferromagnetic elastomer layer (&#8776;100-150 m), the proposed soft continuum robot equipped with hybrid actuation (tendon- and magnetic-driven mode) achieves large-angle (up to 100) steering and high-precision (low to 2 m for static positioning) micromanipulation simultaneously. Specifically, the robot implements an ultralow dynamic tracking error of &#8776;10 m, which is &#8776;30-fold improved than the state of art. Combined with a microneedle/knife or nasopharyngeal swab, the robot reveals the potential for versatile biomedical applications, such as drug injection on the target tissue, diseased tissue ablation, and COVID-19 nasopharyngeal sampling. The proposed millimeter-scale soft continuum robot presents remarkable advances in large-range and high-precise actuation, which provides a new method for miniature continuum robot design and finds broad applications in biomedical engineering.","output":"Millimeter-Scale Soft Continuum Robots for Large-Angle and High-Precision Manipulation by Hybrid Actuation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To establish associations of the prevalence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and factors of psychoemotional stress in men of the open urban population in the age group 4564 years after two decades of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional epidemiological study using a model of the city of Tyumen was conducted on a representative sample of the population among males of mature age (4564 years). Based on standard epidemiological methods, IHD was established according to strict epidemiological criteria definite IHD. The study of the factors of psycho-emotional stress (depression, hostility, life exhaustion) was carried out according to the algorithms of the World Health Organization program MONICA-psychosocial. When calculating the odds ratio for the development of IHD, a low level of psycho-emotional stress factors was regarded as the absence of a sign, a combination of medium and high levels as a presence. RESULTS: The prevalence of ischemic heart disease in the open population (on the model of Tyumen) according to strict epidemiological criteria in men aged 4554 years was 8.2%, at the age of 5564 years 19.2%, a predominance of painless form of ischemic heart disease was revealed. According to the levels of factors of psychoemotional stress in mature men, mainly the average level of depression and life exhaustion, a high level of hostility were established. In men of an open population (on the model of Tyumen), depending on the psychoemotional stress, a high risk of developing a certain coronary heart disease was established in the age categories 4554 and 5564 years old in the presence of depression, at the age of 5564 years in the presence of hostility or life exhaustion. CONCLUSION: Consequently, the data obtained indicate the importance of further studying the factors of psychoemotional stress in men of mature age in Siberian populations, their relationships with conventional risk factors for coronary artery disease, as well as the advisability of preventive measures aimed at weakening the influence of not only conventional risk factors, but also factors of psycho-emotional stress. among the Russian population.","output":"[Prevalence of ischemic heart disease depending on factors of psychoemotional stress among men of mature age (epidemiological study)]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospitalized patients affected by coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) have a sustained pro-inflammatory state and recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms that correlate with a decline in the nutritional status, which is directly related to poor immune response and clinical evolution. Nutritional therapy has proven crucial in COVID-19 treatment through the provision of adequate amounts of nutrients. Since the beginning of the pandemic, medical societies have mobilized to provide practical nutritional guidelines to support decision-making; despite this, there are only a few studies dedicated to compiling the most relevant recommendations. In this narrative review, we aimed to summarize and stratify the current scientific literature on nutritional support for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We carried out a literature review from three databases between January 2020 and July 2021, using nutrition therapy (or medical nutrition or enteral nutrition or parental nutrition or nutritional support) and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) as the search terms. Only those studies that evaluated adult hospitalized patients with admissions to wards, specific clinics, or intensive care units were included. The nutritional intervention considered was that of specific nutritional support via oral, enteral, or parenteral modes. A total of 37 articles were included. In general, the nutritional care provided to COVID-19 patients follows the same premises as for other patients, i.e., it opts for the most physiological route and meets nutritional demands based on the clinical condition. However, some protocols that minimize the risk of contamination exposure for the health team have to be considered. Energy requirements varied from 15 kcal -1kg -1day-1 to 30 kcal -1kg -1day-1 and protein goals from 1.2 g -1kg -1day-1 to 2 g -1kg -1day-1. In both cases, the ramp protocol for increased supply should be considered. In cases of enteral therapy, ready-to-use diet and continuous mode are recommended.

We compared the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of capmatinib 200 mg administered to participants with varying degrees of hepatic impairment versus matched controls with normal hepatic function. METHODS: This phase 1, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group study enrolled adult participants with normal hepatic function and mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairments. Eligible participants received a single oral dose of 200 mg capmatinib. The pharmacokinetic parameters of capmatinib were analyzed and compared across participants with impaired and normal hepatic function. RESULTS: Of 31 enrolled participants, 29 had an evaluable pharmacokinetic profile: normal (n=9); mild (n=6); moderate (n=8); severe (n=6). Compared with the normal group, geometric mean (GM) Cmax decreased by 27.6% in the mild group (geometric mean ratio [GMR]=0.724; 90% confidence interval [CI]: 0.476-1.10), by 17.2% in the moderate group (GMR=0.828; 90% CI: 0.563-1.22), and remained unchanged in the severe group (GMR=1.02; 90% CI: 0.669-1.55).

We examined a digital approach to child maltreatment training through the ERICA project experience (Stopping Child Maltreatment through Pan-European Multiprofessional Training Programme). ERICA has been piloted during the pandemic in seven European centers involving interconnected sectors of professionals working with children and families. The training consisted of interactive modules embedded in a digital learning framework. Different aspects (technology, interaction, and organization) were evaluated and trainers feedback on digital features was sought. Technical issues were the main barrier, however, these did not significantly disrupt the training. The trainers perceived reduced interaction between participants, although distinct factors were uncovered as potential favorable mediators. Based on participants subjective experiences and perspectives, digital learning frameworks for professionals working with children and families (such as the ERICA model nested in its indispensable

Abnormalities in pulmonary function tests (PFT) after COVID-19 infection have been described. The determinants of these abnormalities are unclear. We hypothesized that inflammatory biomarkers and CT scan parameters at the time of infection would be associated with abnormal gas transfer at short term follow-up. METHODS: We retrospectively studied subjects who were hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and discharged. Serum inflammatory biomarkers, CT scan and clinical characteristics were assessed. CT images were evaluated by Functional Respiratory Imaging with automated tissue segmentation algorithms of the lungs and pulmonary vasculature. Volumes of the pulmonary vessels that were 5mm (BV5), 5-10mm (BV5_10), and 10mm (BV10) in cross sectional area were analyzed. Also the amount of opacification on CT (ground glass opacities). PFT were performed 2C3 months after discharge. The diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) was obtained. We divided subjects into those with a DLCO <80% predicted (Low DLCO) and those with a DLCO 80% predicted (Normal DLCO). RESULTS: 38 subjects were included in our cohort. 31 out of 38 (81.6%) subjects had a DLCO<80% predicted. The groups were similar in terms of demographics, body mass index, comorbidities, and smoking status. Hemoglobin, inflammatory biomarkers, spirometry and lung volumes were similar between groups. CT opacification and BV5 were not different between groups, but both Low and Normal DLCO groups had lower BV5 measures compared to healthy controls. BV5_10 and BV10 measures were higher in the Low DLCO group compared to the normal DLCO group. Both BV5_10 and BV10 in the Low DLCO group were greater compared to healthy controls. BV5_10 was independently associated with DLCO<80% in multivariable logistic regression (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01, 1.64). BV10 negatively correlated with DLCO% predicted (r = -0.343, p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in pulmonary vascular volumes at the time of hospitalization are independently associated with a low DLCO at follow-up. There was no relationship between inflammatory biomarkers during hospitalization and DLCO.

In this study, we aimed to assess patients' confidence in this triage concept and patients' satisfaction regarding the received treatment during the outbreak. METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients with a diagnosed retinal disease, triaged into three priority groups based on their condition's urgency during lockdown. After restrictions were eased, a subset of previously triaged patients was interviewed to assess their confidence in the triage and their satisfaction regarding the received treatment during the pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 743 patients were triaged during the lockdown. Over 80% received an urgent appointment (priority 1). Among all priority 1 patients, over 84% attended their appointment and 77% received an intravitreal injection (IVI), while 7% cancelled their appointment due to COVID-19. In post-lockdown interviews of 254 patients, 90% trusted the emergency regimen and received treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our triage seemed to be useful in optimizing access to treatment for patients with retinal diseases.

The objective of this study was to compare the biomechanical properties of medial and anterolateral plating constructs used to stabilize simulated varus and valgus fracture patterns of the distal tibia. In 16 synthetic tibia models, a 45 oblique cut was made to model an Orthopedic Trauma Association type 43-A1.2 distal tibia fracture in either a varus or valgus injury pattern. Each fracture was then reduced and plated with a precontoured medial or anterolateral distal tibia plate. The specimens were biomechanically tested in axial and torsional loading, cyclic axial loading, and load to failure. For the varus fracture pattern, medial plating showed less fracture site displacement and rotation and was stiffer in both axial and torsional loading (P<.05). For the valgus fracture pattern, there was no statistically significant difference between medial and anterolateral plating. There were no significant differences between the 2 constructs for either fracture pattern with respect to ultimate load, displacement, or energy absorption in load to failure testing. When used to stabilize varus fracture patterns, medial plates showed superior biomechanical performance compared with anterolateral plates. In this application, the medial plates functioned in anti-glide mode. For valgus fracture patterns, no biomechanical differences between anterolateral and medial plating were observed. In clinical practice, surgeons should take this biomechanical evidence into account when devising a treatment strategy for fixation of distal tibia fractures.","output":"Anterolateral Versus Medial Plating of Distal Extra-articular Tibia Fractures: A Biomechanical Model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world has been thrown into pandemonium due to the recent Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Differently, we developed an original strategy to induce CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) immunity based on in vivo engineering of extracellular vesicles (EVs). This is a new vaccination approach based on intramuscular injection of DNA expression vectors coding for a biologically inactive HIV-1 Nef protein (Nefmut) with an unusually high efficiency of incorporation into EVs, even when foreign polypeptides are fused to its C-terminus. Nanovesicles containing Nefmut-fused antigens released by muscle cells can freely circulate into the body and are internalized by antigen-presenting cells. Therefore, EV-associated antigens can be cross-presented to prime antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells. To apply this technology to a strategy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we designed DNA vectors expressing the products of fusion between Nefmut and different viral antigens, namely N- and C-terminal moieties of S (referred to as S1 and S2), M, and N. We provided evidence that all fusion products are efficiently uploaded in EVs. When the respective DNA vectors were injected in mice, a strong antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immunity became detectable in spleens and, most important, in lung airways. Co-injection of DNA vectors expressing the diverse SARS-CoV-2 antigens resulted in additive immune responses in both spleen and lungs. Hence, DNA vectors expressing Nefmut-based fusion proteins can be proposed for new anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strategies.","output":"Simultaneous CD8+ T-Cell Immune Response against SARS-Cov-2 S, M, and N Induced by Endogenously Engineered Extracellular Vesicles in Both Spleen and Lungs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the associations between physical activity (PA), sunshine duration (SD) and the occurrence of osteoporosis according to lifestyle status. (2) Methods: Data from the Korean National Health Insurance ServiceCNational Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) collected from 2009 to 2015 were used. Osteoporosis (n = 19,351) and control (n = 38,702) participants were matched in a 1:2 ratio according to age, sex, income, and region of residence. PA was classified as moderate- to high-intensity PA (MHPA) or low-intensity PA (LPA) based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). SD was classified as short (6 h) or long (>6 h). Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of MHPA and long SD for the occurrence of osteoporosis. Subgroup analyses were performed according to SD (or PA), obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. (3) The adjusted OR of MHPA for osteoporosis was 0.90 (95% CI = 0.87C0.94). The results were consistent in the age/sex, SD, obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption subgroups, but not the <60-year-old male and underweight subgroups. The adjusted OR of long SD for osteoporosis was 0.96 (95% CI = 0.93C1.00). The findings were consistent in the <60-year-old female, obese, nonsmoker, and <1 time a week alcohol consumption subgroups. (4) Conclusions: We suggest that both higher intensity of PA and long SD could decrease the risk of osteoporosis. Specifically, PA could decrease the risk of osteoporosis in individuals with most characteristics except male sex or underweight. Long SD could decrease the risk of osteoporosis in young females, obese individuals, nonsmokers, and individuals with lower alcohol consumption.","output":"Associations between Physical Activity, Sunshine Duration and Osteoporosis According to Obesity and Other Lifestyle Factors: A Nested CaseCControl Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: The entire globe is undergoing an unprecedented challenge of COVID-19. Considering the need of rapid and accurate diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, this study was planned to evaluate the cost effective extraction free RT-PCR technique in comparison to the standard VTM based RT-qPCR method. Materials and Methods: Paired swabs from nasopharynx and oropharynx were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing, from 211 adult patients (>= 18 years) in VTM and plain sterile tubes (dry swabs). These samples were processed and RT-qPCR was carried out as per standard protocols. Results: 54.5% of the patients were females and 45.5% were males with sex ratio 1:1.19 (M: F). 38.86% were symptomatic, of which fever (86.59%), cough (79.23%) and breathlessness (46.34%) were the most common symptoms. The positivity by VTM based method and index method was 31.27% and 13.27% respectively. Of the 27 inconclusive results from index method, 37.04% were positive, 48.15% were negative by VTM based method. However, in 40 inconclusive results by VTM based method, 90% were negative and rest remained inconclusive by index method. The sensitivity and specificity of the index method were 39.39% and 85.71% respectively. The overall agreement between VTM based method and index method was 49.59% with estimated Kappa value of 0.19. Conclusion: VTM based method showed higher sensitivity compared to the index method. The higher positivity by VTM based method, suggests that VTM based method could plausibly be a better detection method of SARS-CoV-2.

The present study examined COVID-19s impact on adolescent depression and possible influences of different domains of social connectedness (loneliness, social media use, social video game time, degree of social activity participation). METHODS: : A community sample of 175 adolescents (50.1% boys, mean age=16.01 years) completed questionnaires once before and twice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Piecewise growth modeling examined the acute (7 weeks) and persistent (8 months) effects of COVID-19 on depressive symptoms, and differences across sex and social connectedness. RESULTS: : Significant increases in depressive symptoms followed pandemic onset for boys and girls. However, this increase was earlier and more pronounced among girls than boys, whose depression only increased significantly during the persistent period and to a lesser degree. Trajectories of depression were influenced by loneliness and social connections. LIMITATIONS: : Most participants had economic stability and minimal exposure to the virus. Exacerbation of depressive symptoms may be more severe in higher risk populations. CONCLUSIONS: : Adolescent depression levels have increased during COVID-19, and are higher for girls and those who are lonely.

The model is theoretically analyzed and sufficient conditions for the stability of its equilibria are derived. In addition to the disease-free and endemic equilibria, the model also has single-strain 1 and strain 2 endemic equilibria. Using the center manifold theory, it is shown that the model does not exhibit the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, and global stability of the model equilibria when the basic reproduction number R 0 is either less or greater than unity as the case maybe are proved using various approaches. Simulations to support the model theoretical results are provided. We calculate the basic reproductive number for both strains R 1 and R 2 independently. Results indicate that - both strains will persist when R 1 > 1 and R 2 > 1 - Stain 2 could establish itself as the dominant strain if R 1 < 1 and R 2 > 1, or when R 2 is at least two times greater than R 1 . However, with the current knowledge of the epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic and the availability of treatment and an effective vaccine against strain 1, it is expected that eventually, strain 2 will likely be eradicated in the population due to de novo herd immunity provided the threshold parameter R 2 is controlled to remain below unity.","output":"Dynamic of a two-strain COVID-19 model with vaccination (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS epidemic has boosted interest in research on coronavirus biodiversity and genomics.

In all these scenarios the optimal drug regimen is proposed based on two methods. In the first method these medical interventions are modeled as control interventions and a corresponding objective function and optimal control problem is formulated. In this setting the optimal drug regimen is proposed. Later using the the comparative effectiveness method the optimal drug regimen is proposed based on basic reproduction number and viral load. The average infected cell count and viral load decreased the most when all the four interventions were applied together. On the other hand the average susceptible cell count decreased the best when Arbidol alone was administered.

RESULTS There were 265 asthma admissions to Middlemore Hospital CCC during the study period. The median age was 34 years; 64% were female. NIV was used in 186 admissions, of which eight went on to require intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Twenty-three other admissions received IMV without a trial of NIV and a further 58 were managed with medical care only. The average pH for all admissions was 7.23 and the IMV group had an average pH of 6.99. Forty-five admissions presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 10. Twenty-five of these were managed with NIV with only one requiring subsequent intubation. The mean duration of NIV in this group was 5 h (range 1-17 h) with a mean ICU and hospital length of stay of 17 h and 3.5 days, respectively.

Adding to this uncertainty is the fact that our mathematical models tend to assume some level of random mixing patterns instead of the higher-order structures necessary to describe these large events. Here, we discuss a higher-order description of epidemic dynamics on networks that provides a natural way of extending common models to interaction beyond simple pairwise contacts. We show that unlike the classic diffusion of standard epidemic models, higher-order interactions can give rise to mesoscopic localization, i.e., a phenomenon in which there is a concentration of the epidemic around certain substructures in the network. We discuss the implications of these results and show the potential impact of a blanket cancellation of events larger than a certain critical size. Unlike standard models of delocalized dynamics, epidemics in a localized phase can suddenly collapse when facing an intervention operating over structures rather than individuals.","output":"School closures, event cancellations, and the mesoscopic localization of epidemics in networks with higher-order structure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To briefly review epidemiology and pathophysiology of SICM and provide a more extensive review of the data on diagnostic and management strategies.

METHODS Data on demographics, referral source, and patient's concern were recorded. The web-based referral sources were website and Instagram and non-web-based included other patients (word-of-mouth), medical professionals (physician, nurse, and optometrist), and others (printed media, TV, and radio). Patients' concerns were divided into cosmetic and noncosmetic. The first (2012-2015) and second (2016-2019) half of the study period were also compared. RESULTS Included patients were 19,965. The 8-year referral sources, in order of frequency, were medical professionals (34%), other patients (32.7%), web-based sources (32.5%), and the others (0.7%). The web-based sources significantly increased by 2.4 times in the second half. While they had a third rank after the medical professionals and other patients in the first half of the study period, they became the first in the second half. The non-web-based source showed a decline during the study period. Type of referral sources was not significantly different between the 2 genders. A significantly higher percentage of the patients between 21 and 50 years of age were referred through web-based sources than the other age groups. Patients with cosmetic concerns were 2 times more likely to be referred through web-based sources.

However, little is known about its impact on gaze-mediated attentional orienting in the context of its interplay with strategic top-down control. Here, we aimed at investigating how the social component of eye contact interacts with the top-down strategic control. To this end, we designed a gaze cuing paradigm with the iCub humanoid robot, in which iCub either established eye contact with the participants before averting its gaze or avoided their eyes. Across four experiments, we manipulated gaze cue validity to either elicit strategic top-down inhibitory activity (25% validity) or to allow for relaxing the control mechanisms (50% validity). Also, we manipulated the stimulus-onset-asynchrony (SOA) to examine the dynamics of the top-down modulatory effects. Our results showed that eye contact influenced the gaze cuing effect when the strategic control was not required, by prolonging the prioritized processing of the gazed-at locations. Thus, the effect was observed only when the measurement was taken after a sufficient amount of time (1,000 ms SOA). However, when inhibitory control was necessary (25% validity), the social component was not potent enough to exert influence over the gaze cuing effect independently. Overall, we propose that strategic top-down control is the primary driving force over the gaze cuing effect and that the social aspect plays a modulatory effect by prolonging prioritized processing of gazed-at locations.

The present study investigated changes after the COVID-19 confinement in maximal oxygen intake (VO2 max) levels in a sample of 89 Spanish school children aged 12 and 14 years at baseline (49.8% girls). The 20-m shuttle run test served to estimate VO2 max before and after the COVID-19 confinement. Paired t-tests estimated an overall difference of - 0.5 ml.kg-1.min-1 (SD 0.3) (p = 0.12), whereas the highest significant reductions were observed for girls aged 14 years (- 1.5 ml.kg-1.min-1 (SD 0.6) (p < 0.05)). Boys aged 14 years showed a slight increase (0.4 ml.kg-1.min-1 (SD 0.5) (p = 0.44)), whereas boys aged 12 years presented an important decrease (- 1.2 ml.kg-1.min-1 (SD 0.7) (p = 0.14)). Healthy Fitness Zone (HFZ) levels also experienced a decrease of - 3.4% as regards baseline levels over the examined period.

Dietary habits changed rapidly in the last decades and few data are available on recent dietary changes in children and adolescents with T1D. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that diet composition changed in a 10-year period in children and adolescents with T1D. METHODS: 229 T1D subjects (M/F:121/108) aged 6-16 years were recruited: 114 (group A) enrolled in 2009, not using CGM and/or CSII, and 115 (group B) enrolled in 2019. Anthropometric, biochemical (HbA1c, lipid profile), diet and insulin therapy parameters were compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed with HbA1c as dependent variable (HbA1c > 58 mmol/mol = 1) and nutritional variables and technology use as independent ones. RESULTS: Energy intake of group A was not statistically different from that of group B. Group B had a significantly (p < 0.001) higher protein and lipids intake and lower total carbohydrate and fiber intake than group A. HbA1c was significantly (p < 0.01) lower in group B than in group A. Logistic regression analysis showed that MUFA (OR 0.83,95%CI:0.693-0.998), fiber intake (OR 0.82,95%CI:0.699-0.0969), and technology use (OR 0.15,95%CI:0.031-0.685), adjusted for age, gender, BMI, energy intake and diabetes duration, were were associated with a HbA1c higher than 58 mmol/mol) (R2 = 0.27, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In a 10-year period, diet composition of children and adolescents with T1D changed and glucometabolic control improved. Fiber and MUFA intake showed a positive effect on HbA1c, independent from technology use, supporting the importance of educating children with T1D and families to maintain healthy eating habits.

Vaccine hesitancy is now an ordinary part of the conversation when discussing population-based programmes aimed at reducing the spread of disease. To provide, refuse or delay consent is has often seen as tangible expression of the acceptability of public health intervention, but debate has started to include the consent process itself, particularly where one person is making the decision for another e.g parent for child. In developed countries parental consent is required prior to vaccination of children. Health professionals are trained to provide medical facts to parent to help them make a choice but not to interfere in personal decisions. However, deciding whether to consent to or refuse vaccination on behalf of a child can be a difficult task for some parents and there is little understanding of the influences that facilitate or impede parents decision making.The following question was posed: What influences parents decisions to provide or refuse their consent for inclusion into public health programmes aimed at their school age children (4-18 years) in developed national healthcare systems? Methods: This is a systematic review that uses qualitative meta-synthesis. PsychINFO, PsycARTICLES, MEDLINE and the International Bibliography of the Social Sciences were searched for papers. After screening abstracts and full texts, 14 papers were subject to quality standards review and ultimately nine papers were included in the final review. First, second, and third order constructs were identified. First order constructs were taken as participant views, interpretations put forward by the papers authors were deemed second order constructs, before any commonalities were identified and grouped into third order constructs that were subsequently arranged into seven major analytical themes. Findings: Parents provide or refuse consent based on more than the factual, evidence-based information supplied by health professionals. Personal information from a trusted source often has more influence, with parents valuing this evidence as much as traditional scientific information. Consent decisions reflect the fact that people are inherently social beings that are politically and economically located in society. Parents consent decisions are influenced by a complex web of circumstances. Conclusion: We should not think of consent for public health interventions in simplistic terms i.e. where medically factual information is provided by health professionals on with no other input and on which we expect parents to make a decision. This is an outdated mode of operating based on medical model of health.","output":"Autonomy and Parental Consent Decisions for Public Health Interventions: a Qualitative Meta-synthesis of School Age Vaccination (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first case of infection by SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., COVID-19) was officially recorded by the Italian National Health Service on 21 February 2020.

Severity of ARDS, ventilator settings, oxygenation and laboratory parameters, and outcomes were documented. Predictors associated with severe ARDS were evaluated. RESULTS: Among 128 laboratory-confirmed pediatric COVID-19 cases admitted in PICU, 18 (14%) developed ARDS, 6 (33.3%) had severe ARDS, and 3 (16.6%) succumbed to death. Outcome was measured by median hospital stay [20 days (IQR 19, 21)], PICU stay [13 days (IQR 10, 16)], and 28-day ventilator-free days [14 days (IQR 13, 22)]. Half (n = 9) of our study cohort had different comorbidities and congenital heart disease being the most common (4, 22.2%). Median positive end-expiratory pressure requirement was 10 cm H(2)O (9, 11) for invasively ventilated children (n = 13, 72.2%) along with peak inspiratory pressure of 24 cm H(2)O (20, 29) and mean airway pressure of 17 cm H(2)O (14, 20).

A total of 1830 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were recruited. The temporal profiles of the virus, antibodies, and cytokines of the patients until 12 weeks since illness onset were fitted by the locally weighted scatter plot smoothing (LOWESS) method. The mediation effect of cytokines on the associations between antibody responses and survival were explored by mediation analysis. Of the 1830 patients, 1435 were detectable for SARS-CoV-2, while 395 were positive in specific antibodies only. Of the 1435 patients, 2.4% presented seroconversion for neither immunoglobulin G (IgG) nor immunoglobulin M (IgM) during hospitalization. The seropositive rates of IgG and IgM were 29.6% and 48.1%, respectively, in the first week, and plateaued within five weeks. For the patients discharged from the hospital, the IgM decreased slowly, while high levels of IgG were maintained at around 188 AUmL-1 for the 12 weeks since illness onset.

The results show that the odds of having unrealized fertility were higher among Hausa-Fulani women compared with women of other ethnic groups in Nigeria. Also, having daughters only (no sons) was associated with higher odds of unrealized fertility, after controlling for other important covariates.

Identifying a subset of early PC that has a higher likelihood to evolve into this entity is key for developing therapeutic strategies that could more effectively target this phenotype. This study aimed to assess the prognostic relevance of mRNA expression of major players involved in NED of primary prostate tumors. Methods: RNA sequencing data from 122 patients with localized PC were analyzed. Transcript levels of key genes involved in NED, with a focus on endothelin axis and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B), were assessed and were correlated with time to prostate specific antigen (PSA) recurrence. Copy number alteration of tumor suppressor genes and gene expression of additional signals hallmarking NED was compared between altered and unaltered groups, including lineage determining transcription factors, transcriptional repressors, cell cycle and epigenetic regulators. Results: The presence of altered mRNA expression using a z-score threshold of 2 in NFKB1, RELA, EDN1, EDNRA, and EDNRB genes was associated with a higher Gleason score (P < 0.001) and a shorter time to biochemical recurrence (BCR) (P = 0.029). There was a significant direct correlation between NFKB1 and RELA (P < 0.001), NFKB1 and EDNRA (P < 0.001), NFKB1 and EDNRB (P < 0.001), EDNRA and EDNRB expression (P < 0.001). ASCL1 (q < 0.001), ONECUT2 (q < 0.001), DLL3 (q = 0.019), AURKA (q = 0.013), AURKB (q = 0.014), PLK1 (q < 0.001), and EZH2 (q < 0.001) were enriched in patients with tumors harboring alterations in endothelin axis and NF-B subunit genes whereas REST was downregulated (q < 0.001). Conclusions: This analysis suggests that altered mRNA expression of NF-B and endothelin axis genes in early PC is not only a harbinger of a more aggressive clinical course but is also associated with aberrant gene expression of several transcription factors, transcriptional repressors, cell cycle and epigenetic regulators that are directly involved in NED, in line with their biological roles.

A key gap is the absence of data on uptake by occupation. MethodsUsing nationwide population-level data, we calculated the proportion of people who had received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine (assessed on 31 August 2021) by detailed occupational categories in adults aged 40-64 and estimated adjusted odds ratios to examine whether these differences were driven by occupation or other factors, such as education. We also examined whether vaccination rates differed by ability to work from home. ResultsOur study population included 14,298,147 adults 40-64. Vaccination rates differed markedly by occupation, being higher in administrative and secretarial occupations (90.8%); professional occupations (90.7%); and managers, directors and senior officials (90.6%); and lowest (83.1%) in people working in elementary occupations. We found substantial differences in vaccination rates looking at finer occupational groups even after adjusting for confounding factors, such as education. Vaccination rates were higher in occupations which can be done from home and lower in those which cannot. Many occupations with low vaccination rates also involved contact with the public or with vulnerable people ConclusionsIncreasing vaccination coverage in occupations with low vaccination rates is crucial to help protecting the public and control infection, especially in occupations that cannot be done from home and involve contacts with the public. Policies such as work from home if you can may only have limited future impact on hospitalisations and deaths What is already known on this subject?Whilst several studies highlight differences in vaccination coverage by ethnicity, religion, socio-demographic factors and certain underlying health conditions, there is very little evidence on how vaccination coverage varies by occupation, in the UK and elsewhere. The few study looking at occupational differences in vaccine hesitancy focus on healthcare workers or only examined broad occupational groups. There is currently no large-scale study on occupational differences in COVID-19 vaccination coverage in the UK.

Vaccination rates were high in administrative and secretarial occupations, professional occupations and managers, directors and senior officials and low in people working in elementary occupations. Adjusting for other factors likely to be linked to occupation and vaccination, such as education, did not substantially alter the results.

Although the diagnosis of KD is generally not difficult, it is challenging in cases of incomplete KD lacking characteristic clinical manifestations. The incidence of incomplete KD is higher in infants younger than 6 months of age. Pneumonia is an extremely rare complication of KD and can be misinterpreted as atypical pneumonia rather than KD. Herein, we report a neonate with atypical KD and severe pneumonia who required mechanical ventilation. CASE PRESENTATION: Japanese one-month-old infant had only fever and rash on admission (day 1), and he was transferred to the intensive care unit for severe pneumonia on day 2. Although pneumonia improved following intensive care, he was diagnosed with KD on day 14 because of emerging typical clinical manifestations such as fever, bulbar nonexudative conjunctival injection, desquamation of the fingers, and coronary artery aneurysm. KD symptoms improved after three doses of intravenous immunoglobulin plus cyclosporine. However, small coronary aneurysms were present at the time of discharge. In a retrospective analysis, no pathogens were detected by multiplex real-time PCR in samples collected at admission, and the serum cytokine profile demonstrated prominent elevation of IL-6 as well as elevation of neopterin, sTNF-RI, and sTNF-RII, which suggested KD.

COURSE Nonetheless, a complicated course with bacterial superinfection and pulmonary aspergillosis as well as ARDS developed. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION In contrast to COVID-19, the typical course, diagnosis and therapy of Pneumocystitis jirovecii pneumonia are discussed. It is particularly emphasized that not all ground glass infiltrates in the CT chest image can be traced back to a COVID-19, even in a pandemic situation.

However, these changes, hinder them from performing COVID-19 diagnosis. We constructed a machine learning predictive model for COVID-19 diagnosis. The model was based and cross-validated on the routine blood tests of 5,333 patients with various bacterial and viral infections, and 160 COVID-19-positive patients. We selected operational ROC point at a sensitivity of 81.9% and specificity of 97.9%. The cross-validated area under the curve (AUC) was 0.97. The five most useful routine blood parameters for COVID19 diagnosis according to the feature importance scoring of the XGBoost algorithm were MCHC, eosinophil count, albumin, INR, and prothrombin activity percentage. tSNE visualization showed that the blood parameters of the patients with severe COVID-19 course are more like the parameters of bacterial than viral infection. The reported diagnostic accuracy is at least comparable and probably complementary to RT-PCR and chest CT studies. Patients with fever, cough, myalgia, and other symptoms can now have initial routine blood tests assessed by our diagnostic tool. All patients with a positive COVID-19 prediction would then undergo standard RT-PCR studies to confirm the diagnosis. We believe that our results present a significant contribution to improvements in COVID-19 diagnosis.","output":"COVID-19 diagnosis by routine blood tests using machine learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research Objective India's March 2020 nationwide lockdown garnered early support from the World Health Organization, but has also been the subject of criticism due to strict enforcement and the inaccessibility of basic supplies for those under lockdown. Given the scale of the policy and relevant concerns, there is an urgent need to better understand the impact of this policy on its intended outcome: slowing covid case growth. Study Design We assessed state-level variation in response to the nation-wide lockdown. Using a public dataset of differentially privatized aggregate mobility data, we assessed the combined impact of the Janta Curfew and lockdown using a Single Interrupted Time Series (SITS) design. Our primary outcomes were change in relative mobility and change in state-level COVID-19 case growth. We first looked at variation in mobility between states and then used the results from state-level SITS to assess the relationship with COVID-19 case growth. To do so, we used a model with rate of increase in COVID-19 cases over time as our dependent variable and change in aggregate mobility as our predictor, controlling for population demographics, such as: size, urbanicity and poverty as well as known COVID-19 cases (cumulative as of March 25th). For COVID-19, we used ?Covid19India? which aggregated statistics from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), each state or union territory and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Population Studied Our analytic sample included 10,512 state-day observations, representing 1.21 billion individuals across 36 states and union territories in India. Principal Findings We observed an immediate and pronounced decrease in mobility following the policy's implementation. Overall the lockdown was associated with an 86% decrease in mobility as compared to a location-specific pre-lockdown baseline. However, these effects were not homogeneous by mobility type, nor were they homogeneously sustained in the post-policy period. Visits to grocery stores and pharmacies (slope = 0.62% increase in visits per day) and transit stations (slope = 0.24%) began to recover relatively quickly whereas visits to retail and recreation (slope = ?0.41%), and parks (slope0.47%) continued to decline during the post period. We observed significant state-level variation in mobility responses (71% to 95% decrease in visits to retail and recreation sites). States with the largest decreases in aggregate mobility to retail and recreational sites had a relatively slow (7.2%) rate of increase in COVID-19 case growth in contrast to states with the lowest decreases in mobility, who saw a 53% rate increase in COVID-19 cases (p = 0.03) over the same time period. Conclusions States that were most effective in responding to the lockdown policy, as measured by decreased mobility, were also most effective in slowing covid case growth (controlling for state wealth, size, and urbanicity). Implications for Policy or Practice While our findings suggest India's nationwide lockdown may have been effective in achieving its primary goal, we require a better understanding of what drives sub-national variation in policy adherence over time as well as careful tracking of unintended economic and wellbeing costs.","output":"Heterogeneity in Response to India's Initial COVID-19 Nationwide-Lockdown: A Quasi-Experimental Study Using Aggregate Mobility Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ASEAN, include Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, are the countries with ongoing transmission of SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The confirmed cases in Indonesia and Philippines are the highest ranks among other ASEAN countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore. To reduce the spread of the pandemic COVID-19, each country has implemented the lock-down policy differently, depending on its economic situation. Therefore, the study of the impact of lock-down across the world, particularly in ASEAN countries, is still relevant to do. In this study, we developed the lock-down model in ASEAN countries by using hybrid ARIMA-SVR and hybrid SEIR-ANN. The first hybrid is based on the time series model ARIMA, with the revision of the error is by using SVR. The second hybrid is based on the classical model of infectious diseases, SEIR, which we revise on the prediction part by using ANN. The hybrid is intended to revise the individual prediction model. The data collected per country was started from January 20, 2020 to August 5, 2020. The periods of lock-down in this study are divided into three, namely no lock-down, implemented lock-down, and the new normal periods. The strictness levels of lock-down were predicted for 60 days ahead. The results showed that the hybrid ARIMA-SVR had smaller RMSE compared with individual ARIMA, similarly, hybrid SEIR-ANN predicted S, E, I, and R more accurately compared with individual SEIR model. It has been also found that the lock down was most effectively implemented in Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia, whereas Indonesia and Philippines were inefficient countries to enforce the restriction. It is indicated by the number of cases increased significantly during the restriction periods in both countries. ? 2021 The Author(s).

Methods: In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, COVID-19 patients from Huoshenshan Hospital and Taikang Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) were included. Clinical features showing significant differences between the severe and nonsevere groups were screened out by univariate analysis. Then, these features were used to generate classifier models to predict whether a COVID-19 case would be severe or nonsevere based on machine learning. Two test sets of data from the two hospitals were gathered to evaluate the predictive performance of the models. Results: A total of 455 patients were included, and 21 features showing significant differences between the severe and nonsevere groups were selected for the training and validation set. The optimal subset, with eleven features in the k-nearest neighbor model, obtained the highest area under the curve (AUC) value among the four models in the validation set. D-dimer, CRP, and age were the three most important features in the optimal-feature subsets. The highest AUC value was obtained using a support vector-machine model for a test set from Huoshenshan Hospital. Software for predicting disease progression based on machine learning was developed.

In a publicly-funded HIV clinic, we aimed to evaluate a pre-visit phone-based planning intervention to address anticipated barriers to telemedicine. METHODS We conducted a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of patients scheduled for a phone-based HIV primary care visit at the Ward 86 HIV clinic in San Francisco from 15 April to 15 May 2020. Once reached by phone, patients were randomized to either have a structured pre-visit planning intervention to address barriers to an upcoming telemedicine visit versus a standard reminder call. The primary outcome was telemedicine visit attendance. RESULTS Of 476 scheduled telemedicine visits, 280 patients were reached by a pre-visit call to offer enrollment. Patients were less likely to be reached if virally unsuppressed (odds ratio (OR) 0.11, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.03-0.48), CD4 < 200 (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07-0.85), or were homeless (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07-0.87). There was no difference between intervention and control in scheduled visit attendance (83% v. 78%, OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.67-2.81). CONCLUSIONS A structured phone-based planning call to address barriers to telemedicine in a public HIV clinic was less likely to reach patients with poorly-controlled HIV and patients experiencing homelessness, suggesting additional interventions may be needed in this population to ensure access to telemedicine-based care. Among patients reachable by phone, telemedicine visit attendance was high and not improved with a structured pre-visit intervention, suggesting that standard reminders may be adequate in this population.","output":"Pragmatic randomized trial of a pre-visit intervention to improve the quality of telemedicine visits for vulnerable patients living with HIV."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eczema (atopic eczema) is a common, chronic and recurrent inflammatory skin disease affecting 10-15% of the population.

Rat models of contusive SCI, Western blot, immunofluorescence staining imaging, flow cytometry analysis, histological staining, and behavioral assessment were used to evaluate BTK activity, neuroimmune cascades, and functional outcomes. Both BTK expression and phosphorylation were increased at the lesion site at 2, 7, 14, and 28 days after SCI. Ibrutinib treatment (6 mg/kg/day, IP, starting 3 h post-injury for 7 or 14 days) reduced BTK activation and total BTK levels, attenuated the injury-induced elevations in Iba1, GFAP, CD138, and IgG at 7 or 14 days post-injury without reduction in CD45RA B cells, improved locomotor function (BBB scores), and resulted in a significant reduction in lesion volume and significant improvement in tissue-sparing 11 weeks post-injury.

To assess the association between renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASIs) and disease progression and critical outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: All consecutive hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in a university hospital in Amiens (France) were included in this study. The primary composite endpoint was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or death before ICU admission. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with the composite endpoint. Between 28 February 2020 and 30 March 2020, a total of 499 local patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 231 were not hospitalized {males 33%; median [interquartile range (IQR)] age: 44 (32-54)}, and 268 were hospitalized [males 58%; median (IQR) age: 73 (61-84)]. A total of 116 patients met the primary endpoint: 47 died before ICU admission, and 69 were admitted to the ICU. Patients meeting the primary endpoint were more likely than patients not meeting the primary endpoint to have coronary heart disease and to have been taking RASIs; however, the two subsets of patients did not differ with regard to median age. After adjustment for other associated variables, the risk of meeting the composite endpoint was 1.73 times higher (odds ratio 1.73, 95% confidence interval 1.02-2.93) in patients treated at baseline with a RASI than in patients not treated with this drug class. This association was confirmed when the analysis was restricted to patients treated with antihypertensive agents. CONCLUSIONS: We highlighted a potential safety signal for RASIs, the long-term use of which was independently associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 and a poor outcome.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Objectives : Here, we assess whether alveolar epithelial cell necrosis and subsequent releases of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) at an early disease stage aggravate ARDS with COVID-19 Methods: In patients with COVID-19 with and without ARDS and healthy adults, serum levels of the following were quantified: an epithelial total cell death marker, cytokeratin18-M65; an epithelial apoptosis marker, CK18-M30; HMGB-1; and alveolar epithelial and endothelial injury markers, sRAGE, angiopoietin-2, and surfactant protein-D. Molecular mechanisms of alveolar epithelial cell death and effects of HMGB-1 neutralization on alveolar tissue injury were assessed using a mouse model of COVID-19-induced ARDS. Measurements and main results: The levels of CK18-M65, CK18-M30, and alveolar tissue injury markers were elevated in early stages of ARDS. The median M30/M65 ratio, an epithelial apoptosis indicator, was 31.50% in patients with ARDS, a value significantly lower than that of non-ARDS patients or healthy subjects. Serum levels of HMGB-1, one of DAMPs released from necrotic cells, were also significantly elevated in ARDS versus non-ARDS patients. In a COVID-19-induced ARDS mouse model, alveolar epithelial cell necrosis involved two forms of programmed necrosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis. Finally, neutralization of HMGB-1 attenuated alveolar tissue injury in the mouse model. Conclusions: Necrosis, including necroptosis and pyroptosis, seems to be the primary form of alveolar epithelial cell death, and subsequent release of DAMPs is a potential driver of COVID-19-induced ARDS.","output":"Early Alveolar Epithelial Cell Necrosis is a Potential Driver of ARDS with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Calves may experience increased oxidative stress at birth through activation of metabolic and respiratory processes. Reducing oxidative stress may enhance calf viability in early life. Our objective was to determine the dose response to fish and flaxseed oil when supplemented in colostrum on concentrations of plasma fatty acid (FA), FA metabolites, and index of oxidative stress during the critical first week of life in calves to understand how supplementing n-3 FA may decrease oxidative stress. We hypothesized that n-3 FA supplemented in colostrum in a linear dose-dependent fashion would associate with increased plasma n-3 FA concentrations and decreased oxidative stress. Twenty-four male and female Holstein calves were randomly assigned to receive 0, 30, 60, or 120 mL of a 1:1 fish to flaxseed oil supplement in colostrum. All calves received 2.8 L of previously frozen colostrum (22% Brix) with their respective treatment within 6 h after birth. Blood was sampled before first feeding after birth and on d 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 d of age to assess oxidant status and plasma free PUFA, phospholipid FA, and oxylipid concentrations. Health indicators were observed daily. Indicators of general health and growth were unaffected by treatment. Supplemented calves exhibited greater concentrations of n-3 FA in plasma as free and phospholipid FA and some n-3 and n-6 FA-derived oxylipids in the first week of life in a linear fashion with increasing supplemental dose. Fish and flaxseed oil treatments did not alter oxidant status but overall decreased isoprostane concentrations in plasma, indicating oxidative stress was decreased. Together, these responses indicate that the fish and flaxseed oil supplement was antiinflammatory. In conclusion, supplementing colostrum with 30, 60, and 120 mL of a 1:1 mixture of fish and flaxseed oil linearly increased plasma concentrations of n-3 FA and metabolites and decreased biomarkers of oxidative stress, but did not alter oxidant status or affect health or growth.

No major changes were introduced in the vaccination of healthcare workers. In Baixo Tamega health cluster (Portugal), it was perceived that these workers' vaccine uptake had markedly increased in 2020-2021. This study aims to compare their influenza vaccination coverage rates in 2020-2021 to the last 10 seasons. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of the vaccine uptake among the health workers of Baixo Tamega health cluster was developed. A descriptive analysis was carried out, calculating annual influenza vaccination coverage rates from 2010-2011 to 2020-2021, in doctors, nurses and other health workers. Inferential analysis was performed through chi-squared tests in IBM SPSS Statistics 27.0.1.0., considering significant p-values<0.05. RESULTS: The difference between health workers 2020-2021's influenza coverage rate and the last season's average rates was 22.81%. Before 2020-2021, average vaccination coverage rates were 51.60% (standard deviation 7.34%, 44.26-58.94%), 60.44% (standard deviation 4.12%, 56.32-64.56%) and 51.20% (standard deviation 7.66%, 43.54-58.86%), in doctors, nurses and other health workers, respectively. In 2020-2021, vaccination rates significantly increased to 79.34%, 79.52% and 74.24% in doctors, nurses and others, respectively (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination uptake increased in 2020-2021 among health workers. Further studies should be developed to evaluate this tendency on a larger scale and to better understand its associated factors, which could have been unstructured awareness-raising campaigns, perception of protection against COVID-19 or avoidance of COVID-19-like symptoms and coinfection.

COVID-19 is now a global pandemic and public health emergency due to rapid human-to-human transmission. The impact is far-reaching, with enforced social distancing and isolation, detrimental effects on individual physical activity and mental wellbeing, education in the young and economic impact to business. Whilst most COVID-19 patients demonstrate mild-to-moderate symptoms, those with severe disease progression are at a higher risk of mortality. As more is learnt about this novel disease, it is becoming evident that comorbid cardiovascular disease is associated with a greater severity and increased mortality. Many patients positive for COVID-19 demonstrate increased concentrations of cardiac troponin, creating confusion in clinical interpretation. While myocardial infarction is associated with acute infectious respiratory disease, the majority of COVID-19 patients demonstrate stable cTn rather than the dynamically changing values indicative of an acute coronary syndrome. Although full understanding of the mechanism of cTn release in COVID-19 is currently lacking, this mini-review assesses the limited published literature with a view to offering insight to pathophysiological mechanisms and reported treatment regimens.","output":"Clinical utility of cardiac troponin measurement in COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral sepsis is rare, and its real incidence is not known.

The objective is to simultaneously minimize the total cost and maximize the PPE supply timeliness. For the problem, we first develop a bi-objective mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Then an epsilon-constraint combined with logic-based Benders decomposition method is proposed based on some explored properties. We then extend the proposed model to handle dynamics and randomness. In particular, we design a predictive reactive rescheduling approach to address random order arrivals and manufacturer disruptions. Computational experiments on a real case from China and 100 randomly generated instances are conducted. Results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms an adapted epsilon-constraint method combined with the proposed MILP and the widely used non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) in obtaining high-quality Pareto solutions. Note to Practitioners-The unprecedented outbreak of COVID-19 and its rapid spread caught numerous national and local governments unprepared. Healthcare systems faced a vital scarcity of PPEs. The urgency of producing and delivering PPEs increases as the number of infected cases rapidly increases. A key challenge in response to the epidemic is effectively and efficiently matching the demands and needs. Performing practical and efficient order assignment and scheduling for PPE production during the COVID-19 outbreak is critical to curbing the COVID-19 pandemic. This work first proposes a bi-objective mixed-integer linear program for optimal order assignment and scheduling for PPE production. The aim is to achieve an economical and timely PPE production and supply. A novel method that combines the epsilon-constraint framework and the logic-based Benders decomposition is proposed to yield high-quality Pareto solutions for practical-sized problems. Computational results indicate that the proposed approaches are practical and feasible, which can help decision-makers to perform acceptable order assignment and scheduling decisions.","output":"Order Assignment and Scheduling for Personal Protective Equipment Production During the Outbreak of Epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the Covid-19 outbreak, researchers have been predicting how the epidemic will evolve, especially the number in each country, through using parametric extrapolations based on the history.

Methods: Convalescent plasma was collected from patients recovered from COVID-19 following a screening protocol which also included measuring plasma anti SARS-CoV2 spike IgG content. Retrospectively, neutralizing antibody content was measured and proteome was characterized by LC-MS/MS for all convalescent plasma units that were transfused to patients. Severe COVID-19 patients with evidence for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with PaO2/FiO2 ratio 100-300 (moderate ARDS) were recruited and randomised into two parallel arms of SOC and CPT, N=40 in each arm. Peripheral blood samples were collected on the day of enrolment (T1) followed by day3/4 (T2) and day 7 (T3). RT-PCR and sequencing was done for SARS-CoV2 RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs collected at T1. A panel of cytokines and neutralizing antibody content were measured in plasma at all three timepoints. Patients were followed up for 30 days post-admission to assess the primary outcomes of all cause mortality and immunological correlates for clinical benefits. Results: While across all age-groups no statistically significant clinical benefit was registered for patients in the CPT arm, significant immediate mitigation of hypoxia, reduction in hospital stay as well as survival benefit was recorded in severe COVID-19 patients with ARDS aged less than 67 years receiving convalescent plasma therapy. In addition to its neutralizing antibody content a prominent effect of convalescent plasma on attenuation of systemic cytokine levels possibly contributed to its benefits.

In addition, clinical characteristics and laboratory findings, including Hb, platelet count, white blood cell count, lymphocyte percentage, neutrophil percentage, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), D-dimer, highly sensitive C-reactive protein (HS-CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatinine, were measured. The presence of hypertension and/or diabetes was found to be a significant risk factor for disease severity and poor outcome. Increased respiratory rate, levels of SpO(2), HS-CRP, D-dimer, NLR, ALT, LDH, lymphopenia and neutrophilia, as well as changes in chest computed tomography (CT), were associated with increased disease severity and fatal consequences. Highly sensitive C-reactive protein, D-dimer, NLR and LDH constituted excellent predictors for both disease severity and death. Laboratory biomarkers, such as HS-CRP, D-dimer, NLR and LDH, are excellent predictors for both disease severity and death. They can predict mortality in patients at the time of admission secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can help physicians identify high-risk patients before clinical deterioration.","output":"Laboratory biomarker predictors for disease progression and outcome among Egyptian COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work investigates whether and how COVID-19 containment policies had an immediate impact on crime trends in Los Angeles.

Different situations are included in the recommendations: a sexual partner passing quarantine without any symptoms, a sexual partner that has not passed quarantine, a sexual partner with some suspicious symptoms of COVID-19, a positive sexual partner with COVID-19, a pregnant sexual partner, a health professional partner in contact with COVID-19 patients, and people without a sexual partner. The main recommendations include returning to engaging in safe sex after quarantine is over (28 days based on the duration one can carry SARS-CoV-2, or 33 days for those who are >60 years old) and all parties are asymptomatic. In all other cases (for those under quarantine, those with some clinical symptoms, health professionals in contact with COVID-19 patients, and during pregnancy), abstaining from coital/oral/anal sex, substituting it with masturbatory or virtual sexual activity to provide maximum protection from the contagion, and increasing the benefits inherent to sexual activity are recommended.

Since Black patients suffer disproportionately from colon cancer incidence and mortality compared to other populations, we investigated the utility of aspirin and statin in reducing advanced adenomatous polyp (AAP) risk in Black patients. METHODS: We carried out a retrospective cohort study of screening colonoscopies performed at a large urban academic center from 1/1/2011 through 12/31/2019. We analyzed self-identified Black patients with > 1 colonoscopy and no personal history of either inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer syndromes. Our primary endpoint was first AAP development after index colonoscopy among Black patients taking both aspirin and a statin compared to those taking one or neither medication. We used multivariate logistic regression modeling to investigate our outcomes. RESULTS: We found data on chemoprophylaxis use in 560 patients. The mean observation period between index colonoscopy and AAP identification was 4 years. AAP developed in 106/560 (19%) of our cohort. We found no difference in AAP risk among Black patients taking both chemoprevention medications compared to partial or no chemoprophylaxis (20% vs 18% respectively, p = 0.49). This finding remained after adjusting for age, body mass index, and tobacco use (odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.65C1.67; p = 0.87).

Saliva is being increasingly used in COVID-19 tests as a diagnostic sample for virus detection and quantification. This study aimed to evaluate the possible changes in ferritin in saliva in COVID-19 patients. In addition, the effects of different inactivation SARS-CoV-2 treatments in ferritin measurements in saliva, the correlation between ferritin in saliva and serum, and the possible effects of correction of ferritin values by total protein were assessed. Ferritin was measured in saliva from healthy (n = 30) and COVID-19 (n = 65) patients with severe, (n = 18) or mild (n = 47) disease, depending on the need for nasal flow oxygen or assisted respiration. Ferritin was also measured in paired serum and saliva samples (n = 32) from healthy and COVID-19 patients. The evaluated inactivation protocols did not affect the assays results except the addition of 0.5% SDS. Significantly higher ferritin was found in the saliva of COVID-19 patients (median; 25C75th percentile) (27.75; 9.77C52.2 g/L), compared with healthy controls (4.21; 2.6C8.08 g/L).

DATA RESOURCES: Medline(OVID), Embase(OVID), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of Science and LILACS databases were searched for eligible studies from each database's inception to May 2020 (search updated 11/08/20). Studies investigating clinical dental activities that generate aerosol using duplicate independent screening. Data extraction by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias assessed through contamination measurement tool sensitivity assessment. STUDY SELECTION: A total eighty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and covered: ultrasonic scaling (USS, na?=a?44), highspeed air-rotor (HSAR, na?=a?31); oral surgery (na?=a?11), slow-speed handpiece (na?=a?4); air-water (triple) syringe (na?=a?4), air-polishing (na?=a?4), prophylaxis (na?=a?2) and hand-scaling (na?=a?2). Although no studies investigated respiratory viruses, those on bacteria, blood-splatter and aerosol showed activities using powered devices produced greatest contamination. Contamination was found for all activities, and at the furthest points studied. The operator's torso, operator's arm and patient's body were especially affected. Heterogeneity precluded inter-study comparisons but intra-study comparisons allowed construction of a proposed hierarchy of procedure contamination risk: higher (USS, HSAR, air-water syringe, air polishing, extractions using motorised handpieces); moderate (slow-speed handpieces, prophylaxis, extractions) and lower (air-water syringe [water only] and hand scaling). CONCLUSION: Gaps in evidence, low sensitivity of measures and variable quality limit conclusions around contamination for procedures. A hierarchy of contamination from procedures is proposed for challenge/verification by future research which should consider standardised methodologies to facilitate research synthesis. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This manuscript addresses uncertainty around aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) in dentistry. Findings indicate a continuum of procedure-related aerosol generation rather than the common binary AGP or non-AGP perspective. The findings inform discussion around AGPs and direct future research to support knowledge and decision making around COVID-19 and dental procedures.","output":"A systematic review of droplet and aerosol generation in dentistry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a general opinion that extraverted people suffer more than introverted people in home-office arrangement and the social distancing regulation imposed by the government during the Corona Virus Disease 2019 pandemic (COVID-19) However, scarce research exists concerning how extraversion is associated with satisfaction with home-office arrangement, to what extent individuals miss their colleagues, level of stress, and whether they meet colleagues outside work during lockdown An online survey was distributed in six police districts in Norway during late May and beginning of June, right before the most stringent measures for constraining risk of COVID-infection was lifted 1133 out of 1472 reported that their work-situation was home-office, or combined home-office and physical attendance at work Contrary to what expected, extraversion was not related to satisfaction with home-office arrangement when controlling for other relevant variables (i e stress, home-office only, living alone, age, gender and civilian employment) As hypothesized, those with a higher score on extraversion missed their colleagues more than those with low scores There was a marginal, although significant, negative association between extraversion and stress, and a significant positive relationship between stress and the extent the respondents missed their colleagues during lockdown, independent of extraversion The results showed a dose-response relationship between extraversion and meeting colleagues outside the work during lockdown","output":"Police employees working from home during COVID-19 lockdown: Those with higher score on extraversion miss their colleagues more and are more likely to socialize with colleagues outside work"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alfred W.

Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) secondary to PSTT is an exceedingly rare complication. We hereby present a case of multiple PAVMs in the setting of metastatic PSTT. Case Presentation: A 34-year-old lady initially presented with abnormal uterine bleeding, high output cardiac failure and was found to have an elevated serum beta-hCG levels, a uterine mass on pelvic ultrasound, a pelvic AVM and multiple uterine AVMs. She underwent hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy which confirmed the diagnosis of PSTT with evidence of uterine AVMs. She received etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin, and cisplatin with favorable response but was later found to have pulmonary cystic metastases. She was treated with immunotherapy and additional chemotherapy, but failed to respond and subsequently developed embolic stroke leading to seizures. Her course was further complicated by secondary spontaneous pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement. Two years later, she was admitted with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and underwent chest CT with contrast that revealed progression of the cystic pulmonary metastases in addition to innumerable new PAVMs (image 1). The largest 2 PAVMs were treated with embolization with Amplatz II vascular plugs with improvement in her symptoms. She was ultimately admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia and subsequently developed refractory shock with evidence of diffuse multiple air emboli (image 1) on CT imaging. Despite aggressive resuscitation, the patient ultimately passed away. Discussion: PAVMs are abnormal vascular communications between pulmonary arterial and venous circulation without a normal intervening capillary network. The vast majority of PAVMs occur in the setting of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The direct communication between the pulmonary arteries and veins without the filtering capillary bed increases the risk paradoxical embolization of thrombi and bacteria leading to stroke and brain abscess. While AVMs are seen in the uterus in cases of PSTT, PAVMs are considered an exceedingly rare complication with very few cases reported in the literature. The development of AVMs in PSTT is thought to be secondary to proangiogenic effects of hCG in addition to the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by tumor cells. We hypothesize that the patient developed air embolism secondary to a ruptured cystic metastatic lesion into an adjacent PAVM leading to death. Clinicians need to be aware of the risk of developing PAVMs in patients with PSTT and the potential serious complications associated with them including refractory hypoxemia and paradoxical embolism.","output":"A Rare Case of Diffuse Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations Secondary to Placental Site Trophoblastic Tumor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier, a query instance is classified based on the most frequent class of its nearest neighbors among the training instances.

In this method, each neighbor of a query instance is considered as a piece of evidence from which we calculate the probability of class label given feature values to provide more preference to the minority instances. This is then discounted by the proximity of the neighbor to prioritize the closer instances in the local neighborhood. These evidences are then combined using Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. A rigorous experiment over 30 benchmark imbalanced datasets shows that our method performs better compared to 12 popular methods. In pairwise comparison of these 12 methods with our method, in the best case, our method wins in 29 datasets, and in the worst case it wins in least 19 datasets.

Operating within the NHS has largely been scaled back to emergency and cancer work, with elective services either on hold or transferred to independent hospitals. During this time, with NHS resources critically stretched, a number of patients presented with serious complications of private sector aesthetic surgery, which required emergency NHS treatment. This series characterises the nature and outcome of these cases. METHOD: A retrospective audit of patients referred to a UK Plastic Surgery Unit with complications arising from private aesthetic surgery performed during the Second Wave of Covid-19 in 2020. RESULTS: Eight patients presented. Two had surgery in the UK, five in Turkey and one in Lithuania. The primary procedures were abdominoplasty (n = 6), liposuction (n = 5). Presenting complications were Infection (n = 5) and wound dehiscence (n = 5). Two patients presented in septic shock and one developed necrotising panniculitis. One patient suffered perioperative death due to myocardial infarction. Mean hospital stay was 10 days (range 1-31) and median number of NHS surgical procedures was 2.5 (range 0-8). Three patients required removal of breast implants; four required topical negative pressure dressings and three underwent skin grafting. Up to 7 outpatient appointments were required per patient.

Consequently, strategies need to be explored to enable them to better maintain their competence. This article describes recent research investigating if nursing behaviours in the use of mobile technologies could be leveraged to better facilitate mobile learning. It addresses a gap in the existing literature around how nurses resource their own professional development and learning in the absence of appropriate learning resources in the workplace. METHODS: The research employed a classic grounded theory methodology which was conducted with 27 registered nurses from Public and Private Hospitals in Queensland and external postgraduate nursing students from Victoria, South Australia and the Northern Territory enrolled at the University of Southern Queensland. RESULTS: The Theory of Economising Learning describes how nurses maintain competence with limited resources. Unfavourable staffing levels and a fast-paced workplace mean that nurses rarely prioritise their professional learning while at work. Instead, it requires the nurse to contribute personal resources including time and money. Though the research revealed nurses were unconcerned about using mobile technologies, they were concerned about maintaining competence with limited resources. To counter this, nurses economised their learning by balancing personal resources against their motivation to maintain competence. The process of economising learning begins and ends with the development of the nurses personal curriculum in response to what they identify as being the most significant knowledge deficits at work that jeopardise their competence. A learning opportunity that addresses the knowledge deficit is sought. Nurses balance the opportunity to address the deficit against the cost of personal resources, to decide if they will engage with the opportunity and update their personal curriculum accordingly. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that workplaces need to create reasonable expectations within nurses to address knowledge deficits and provide the resources, including time, to allow them to do so without personal cost. It is also necessary for workplaces to moderate the flow of learning opportunities so as not to overwhelm and demotivate the nurses. Currently, nurses use several strategies to optimise their learning using mobile technologies which could be leveraged in the workplace.","output":"How registered nurses balance limited resources in order to maintain competence: a grounded theory study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: hospital level healthcare in the home guided by comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) might provide a less costly alternative to hospitalisation for older people.

INTRODUCTION: According to data collected by the World Health Organization, by the autumn of 2020, all regions of the world were affected by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. In Hungary, the first cases were detected in March 2020, and the epidemic, among several other patient rights issues, drew attention to the paramount importance of patient information, its compliance with the law, and the difficulties encountered in its application. During the last decades, the possibility of male partner involvement in birth has become increasingly popular in the process of family planning and starting a life together. Preparing fathers for childbirth and coordinating information restrictions that have changed due to the epidemic is a priority for obstetric departments. The full application of patient information requires a number of considerations to ensure that childbirth remains a positive memory for mother and father, even in a situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We wanted to analyze how the obstetric wards in Hungary were able to comply with the laws and procedures in force at the time of the pandemic, what measures became necessary for creating male partner involvement in births, and at the same time to ensure that the rights of the mother and the father are not violated. METHOD: We sent an online questionnaire to the head of the obstetrics department of all Hungarian state hospitals and clinics, using 14 multiple-choice questions. The data of the received questionnaires were also compared with the information related to male partner involvement in births published on the websites of the institutions. RESULTS: In the period from 20 March to 20 September 2020, in terms of informing pregnant couples, the service providers always followed the procedures in force, but in several cases this meant more financial expenditure and organization for them. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that those who give birth insist on the best possible information about conditions of male partner involvement in births, have the same expectations about the conditions of childbirth as during the epidemic-free period. If the information is satisfactory and detailed for them, they are more tolerant of adverse changes. In view of the epidemic, the possibility of father involvement in birth remained in all departments available, while maintaining appropriate epidemiological measures.

(ZSC-L) is a tree with thorny branches, belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and grows in the sub-tropics. The purpose of this research is to isolate and partially purify bioactive components from the crude ethanol extract of the stem bark of ZSC-L. Besides, bioassay-guided fractionation of ZSC-L stem bark was conducted using different solvents. The solvents were reutilized to minimize the production cost and environmental harm. In addition, the antimicrobial activities of the fractions were analyzed, followed by metabolic profiling using LC-HRMS. The n-butanol fraction showed the highest antimicrobial efficacy, so it was subjected to further purification. For the first time, two major compounds were isolated from the stem bark of ZSC-L and identified as lupane-type pentacyclic triterpenoids betulinic acid and betulin. Both compounds were used as antibacterial and anticancer agents and considered as a green product as the extraction procedure reduced the use of hazardous chemicals. Metabolic characterization of ZSC-L and its bioactive fractions were performed using LC-HR-ESI-MS and the results revealed the dereplication of 36 compounds belonging to different chemical classes. Flavonoids and triterpenes were the most prominent metabolite classes in the different fractions. The molecular docking results were obtained by studying the interaction of betulin and betulinic acid with antimicrobial receptors (4UYM, 1IYL, 1AJ2, 6J7L, 1AD4, 2VEG) to support the in vitro results. Our study highlights that Ziziphus spina-christi and its phytoconstituents, especially triterpenoids, act as a promising antimicrobial candidate in pharmaceutical and clinical applications.","output":"Isolation, Structure Elucidation and Antimicrobial Evaluation of Natural Pentacyclic Triterpenoids and Phytochemical Investigation of Different Fractions of Ziziphus spina-christi (L.)

The reduction in surgical training time raises concern over the ability of future surgeons to deliver safe and effective care. Methods This interview-based qualitative study was conducted within a tertiary referral centre in the United Kingdom. Nine consultant general surgeons were interviewed with the aim of investigating how surgical trainees can comply with the European Working Time Directive whilst gaining sufficient knowledge, skill and experience to be safe surgeons. Results Consultants felt that the European Working Time Directive has impacted surgical training, patient care, service provision, and the professional attitudes of trainees. They felt that current surgical trainees have a relative lack of experience compared to previous generations, which has impacted their ability to manage complex patients. The consultant-trainee relationship was felt to have suffered due to shorter working hours. Furthermore, the move towards shift work has resulted in a lack of continuity of care for patients. Consultants suggested reconfiguring theatre lists to maximise opportunities for trainees. They also recommended that trainees seek out alternative learning methodologies such as simulation, and consider clinical fellowships at the completion of their training to maximise their experience and surgical skills prior to consultancy. Conclusion This study highlights the concerns that senior surgeons working in a busy tertiary referral centre have towards the European Working Time Directive and modern surgical training. The authors recommend that both trainees and consultants have a responsibility to maximize opportunities during training, and that mentorship will need to continue at the consultant level. Further research in other centres can determine whether these sentiments are widespread, and whether institutional steps should be taken to change the way that modern surgeons are trained.","output":"The European Working Time Directive: Will Modern Surgical Training in the United Kingdom Be Sufficient?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) is one of the large mammals most spread worldwide, highly adaptable, and its population rapidly increased in many areas in Europe, including Italy, where Tuscany is considered particularly suitable for wild boar. Wild boars are potential hosts for different etiological agents, such as Brucella spp., Leptospira spp. and Pseudorabies virus and they can contribute to maintain and/or to disseminate some bacterial or viral pathogens to humans and domestic animals, above all-in free-range farms. In order to identify hypothetical genomic regions associated with these infection diseases, 96 samples of wild boars hunted in Tuscany during the 2018C2019 and 2019C2020 hunting seasons were considered. Diagnosis was achieved by serological tests and 42 Pseudorabies, 31 Leptospira and 15 Brucella positive animals were identified. All animals were genotyped with Geneseek Genomic Profiler Porcine HD (70 k) and a genome-wide scan was then performed. Significant markers were highlighted for Pseudorabies (two SNPs), Brucella (seven SNPs), and Leptospira (four SNPs) and they were located within, or nearby, 29 annotated genes on chromosome 6, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 18. Eight genes are implicated in viral (SEC14L1, JMJD6, SRSF2, TMPRSS2, MX1, MX2) or bacterial (COL8A1, SPIRE1) infections, seven genes (MFSD11, METTL23, CTTNBP2, BACE2, IMPA2, MPPE1 and GNAL) are involved in mental disorders and one gene (MGAT5B) is related to the Golgi complex.

OBJECTIVE: This study examines the content of COVID-19Crelated tweets posted by public health agencies in Texas and how content characteristics can predict the level of public engagement. METHODS: All COVID-19Crelated tweets (N=7269) posted by Texas public agencies during the first 6 months of 2020 were classified in terms of each tweets functions (whether the tweet provides information, promotes action, or builds community), the preventative measures mentioned, and the health beliefs discussed, by using natural language processing. Hierarchical linear regressions were conducted to explore how tweet content predicted public engagement. RESULTS: The information function was the most prominent function, followed by the action or community functions. Beliefs regarding susceptibility, severity, and benefits were the most frequently covered health beliefs. Tweets that served the information or action functions were more likely to be retweeted, while tweets that served the action and community functions were more likely to be liked. Tweets that provided susceptibility information resulted in the most public engagement in terms of the number of retweets and likes. CONCLUSIONS: Public health agencies should continue to use Twitter to disseminate information, promote action, and build communities.

METHODS: The clinical and CT data of 81 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. The texture features were extracted using LK2.1. The two-sample t test or MannCWhitney U test was used to find the significant features. Minimum redundancy and maximum relevance (MRMR) method was performed to find the features with maximum correlation and minimum redundancy. These features were then used to construct a radiomics texture model to discriminate the severe patients using multivariate logistic regression method. Besides, a clinical model was also built. ROC analyses were conducted to evaluate the performance of two models. The correlations of clinical features and textural features were analyzed using the Spearman correlation analysis. RESULTS: Of the total cases included, 60 were common and 21 were severe. (1) For textural features, 20 radiomics features selected by MRMR showed good performance in discriminating the two groups (AUC > 70%). (2) For clinical features, chi-square tests or MannCWhitney U tests identified 16 clinical features as significant, and 12 were discriminative (p < 0.05) between two groups analyzed by univariate logistic analysis. Of these, 10 had an AUC > 70%. (3) Prediction models for textural features and clinical features were established, and both showed high predictive accuracy. The AUC values of textural features and clinical features were 0.93 (0.86C1.00) and 0.95 (0.95C0.99), respectively. (4) The Spearman correlation analysis showed that most textural and clinical features had above-moderate correlations with disease severity (> 0.4). CONCLUSION: Texture analysis can provide reliable and objective information for differential diagnosis of COVID-19. KEY POINTS: ? CT texture analysis can well differentiate common and severe COVID-19 patients. ? Some textural features showed above-moderate correlations with clinical factors. ?

Vulnerable people often receive a patchwork of health and social care services that does not appropriately address their needs. The cost of health and social care services escalate when these individuals live without appropriate supports. Compassionate Communities apply a population health theory of practice wherein citizens are mobilized along with health and social care supports to holistically address the needs of persons experiencing vulnerabilities. AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation of a compassionate community intervention for vulnerable persons in Windsor Ontario, Canada. METHODS: This applied qualitative study was informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. We collected and analyzed focus group and interview data from 16 program stakeholders: eight program clients, three program coordinators, two case managers from the regional health authority, one administrator from a partnering community program, and two nursing student volunteers in March through June 2018. An iterative analytic process was applied to understand what aspects of the program work where and why. RESULTS: The findings suggest that the program acts as a safety net that supports people who are falling through the cracks of the formal care system. The little things often had the biggest impact on client well-being and care delivery. The big and little things were achieved through three key processes: taking time, advocating for services and resources, and empowering clients to set personal health goals and make authentic community connections. CONCLUSION: Compassionate Communities can address the holistic, personalized, and client-centred needs of people experiencing homelessness and/or low income and social isolation. Volunteers are often untapped health and social care capital that can be mobilized to promote the health of vulnerable persons. Student volunteers may benefit from experiencing and responding to the needs of a communitys most vulnerable members.

Alternative to the traditional disease surveillance data collected by the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), big data from Internet such as online search volumes has been previously shown to contain valuable information for tracking infectious disease dynamics. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of using Internet search volume of relevant queries to track and predict COVID-19 pandemic. We found strong association between COVID-19 death trend and the search volume of symptom-related queries such as\\"loss of taste\\". Then, we further develop an influenza-tracking model to predict future 4-week COVID-19 deaths on the US national level, by combining search volume information with COVID-19 time series information. Encouraged by the 20% error reduction on national level comparing to the baseline time series model, we additionally build state-level COVID-19 deaths models, leveraging the cross-state cross-resolution spatial temporal framework that pools information from search volume and COVID-19 reports across states, regions and the nation. These variants of ARGOX are then aggregated in a winner-takes-all ensemble fashion to produce the final state-level 4-week forecasts. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method steadily outperforms time series baseline models, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among the publicly available benchmark models. Overall, we show that disease dynamics and relevant public search behaviors co-evolve during the COVID-19 pandemic, and capturing their dependencies while leveraging historical cases/deaths as well as spatial-temporal cross-region information will enable stable and accurate US national and state-level forecasts.","output":"COVID-19 Forecasts Using Internet Search Information in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibody surveillance provides essential information for public health officials to work with communities to discuss the spread and impact of COVID-19 in communities.

The amount of evidence is increasing and study designs have changed over time. We conducted a living systematic review to address three questions: (1) Amongst people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? (2) What is the infectiousness of asymptomatic and presymptomatic, compared with symptomatic, SARS-CoV-2 infection? (3) What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a population is accounted for by people who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic? METHODS AND FINDINGS The protocol was first published on 1 April 2020 and last updated on 18 June 2020. We searched PubMed, Embase, bioRxiv and medRxiv, aggregated in a database of SARS-CoV-2 literature, most recently on 2 February 2021. Studies of people with PCR-diagnosed SARS-CoV-2, which documented symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up, or mathematical modelling studies were included. Studies restricted to people already diagnosed, of single individuals or families, or without sufficient follow-up were excluded. One reviewer extracted data and a second verified the extraction, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Risk of bias in empirical studies was assessed with a bespoke checklist and modelling studies with a published checklist. All data syntheses were done using random effects models. Review question (1): We included 94 studies. Heterogeneity was high and we could not reliably estimate values for the proportion of asymptomatic infections overall (interquartile range 13-45%, prediction interval 2-89%), or in studies based on screening of defined populations (interquartile range 18-59%, prediction interval 3-95%). In screening studies at low risk of information bias, the prediction interval was 4-69% (summary proportion 23%, 95% CI 14-35%). In 40 studies based on contact or outbreak investigations, the summary proportion asymptomatic was 18% (95% CI 14-24%, prediction interval 3-64%) and, in studies at low risk of selection bias, 25% (95% CI 18-33%, prediction interval 5-66%). (2) The secondary attack rate in contacts of people with asymptomatic infection compared with symptomatic infection was 0.43 (95% CI 0.05-3.44, 5 studies). (3) In 11 modelling studies fit to data, the proportion of all SARS-CoV-2 transmission from presymptomatic individuals was higher than from asymptomatic individuals. Limitations of the evidence include high heterogeneity in studies that were not designed to measure persistently asymptomatic infection, high risks of selection and information bias, and the absence of studies about variants of concern or in people who have been vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS This review does not provide a summary estimate of the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 across all study designs. In studies based on contact and outbreak investigation, most SARS-CoV-2 infections were not persistently asymptomatic. Summary estimates from meta-analysis may be misleading when variability between studies is extreme. Without prospective longitudinal studies with methods that minimise selection and measurement biases, further updates with the study types included in this living systematic review are unlikely to be able to provide a reliable summary estimate of the proportion of asymptomatic infections caused by wild-type SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Occurrence and transmission potential of asymptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections: a living systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Civets are small mammals belonging to the family Viverridae. The masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) served as an intermediate host in the bat-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 20031.

This study traced its diffusion from the global to national level and identified a few superspreaders that played a central role in the transmission of this disease in India. DATA AND METHODS: We used the travel history of infected patients from January 30 to April 6, 2020, as the primary data source. A total of 1386 cases were assessed, of which 373 were international, and 1013 were national contacts. The networks were generated in Gephi software (version 0.9.2). RESULTS: The maximum numbers of connections were established from Dubai (degree 144) and the UK (degree 64). Dubai's eigenvector centrality was the highest that made it the most influential node. The statistical metrics calculated from the data revealed that Dubai and the UK played a crucial role in spreading the disease in Indian states and were the primary sources of COVID-19 importations into India. Based on the modularity class, different clusters were shown to form across Indian states, which demonstrated the formation of a multi-layered social network structure. A significant increase in confirmed cases was reported in states like Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Andhra Pradesh during the first phase of the nationwide lockdown, which spanned from March 25 to April 14, 2020. This was primarily attributed to a gathering at the Delhi Religious Conference (DRC) known as Tabliqui Jamaat. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 got induced into Indian states mainly due to International travels with the very first patient travelling from Wuhan, China. Subsequently, the contacts of positive cases were located, and a significant spread was identified in states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Kerala, and Karnataka. The COVID-19's spread in phase one was traced using the travelling history of the patients, and it was found that most of the transmissions were local.","output":"Tracking the spread of COVID-19 in India via social networks in the early phase of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the German government released the Corona-Warn-App, a smartphone application that warns users if they have come into contact with other users tested posi- tive for SARS-CoV-2.

To determine the effective components, CHX, CPC, H2O2, and a combination of CHX and CPC, were tested against SARS-CoV-2 in addition. While a combination of CPC and CHX as well as CPC alone led to a significant reduction of infectious viral particles, H2O2 and CHX alone had no virucidal effect against SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS Observational study with confirmed COVID-19 patients. The primary endpoint was development of moderate-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Time to moderate-severe ARDS, the need for mechanical or non-invasive ventilation (MV/NIV), death, and a composite of death or MV/NIV were secondary endpoints. RESULTS Of 138 patients included, 27 (19.6%) were immunosuppressed (IS) and 95 (68.8%) were male, with a median (IQR) age of 68 (54-78) years. A significantly lower proportion of IS patients (25.9%) compared to non-IS patients (52.3%) developed moderate-severe ARDS, in both unadjusted (0.32 (95%CI, 0.13-0.83, p=0.017) and adjusted (aOR 0.25 [95%CI, 0.08-0.80], p=0.019) analyses. After stratifying by pathologies, only IS patients with autoimmune diseases remained significant (aOR 0.25 [95%CI, 0.07-0.98], p=0.046). Non-significant trends towards a longer time to moderate or severe ARDS, a lower need for MV/NIV, and a lower risk of death or MV/NIV were detected among IS.

The patients were divided into four groups according to age and into three groups (moderate, severe, and critical) according to the fifth edition of the Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of China.Measurements and Main Results: The incidence of comorbidities was higher in the severe (46.3%) and critical (67.1%) groups than in the moderate group (37.8%). More patients were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers in the moderate group than in the severe and critical groups. More patients had multiple lung lobe involvement and pleural effusion in the critical group than in the moderate group. More patients received antiviral agents within the first 4 days in the moderate group than in the severe group, and more patients received antibiotics and corticosteroids in the critical and severe groups. Patients >75 years old had a significantly lower survival rate than younger patients.Conclusions: Multiple organ dysfunction and impaired immune function were the typical characteristics of patients with severe or critical illness. There was a significant difference in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers among patients with different severities of disease.

The main aim was to evaluate whether LMI affected prevalence and incidence of antidepressants (ADs) use, and ADs treatment interruption (TI) in the general population. METHODS: Adults (18 years) with at least 1 dispensing of ADs between 01/01/2019-26/09/2020 were selected from a regional Italian healthcare administrative database. Patients presenting an AD dispensing in the year preceding the first observation were considered as prevalent otherwise as incident users. We divided the studied period into 3 parts: pre-lockdown (01/01/2019-08/03/2020), lockdown (09/03/2020-14/06/2020) and post-lockdown (15/06/2020-27/09/2020). The weekly prevalence (WP) and incidence (WI) per 10,000 inhabitants were compared among periods. Incidence of TI (no dispensing refill within 30 days of the end of its validity) was computed among prevalent AD users. RESULTS: The WP (mean of 552.3 per 10,000 pre-lockdown vs 505.5 lockdown phase; relative change: -9%) and WI (5.2 vs 3.7; -29%) of ADs use decreased after LMI. During the post-lockdown phase WP (505.5 vs 495.9; -2%) decreased whereas the WI (3.7 vs 4.3; 16%) slightly increased in relation to the lockdown period, although differences were not statistically significant. Conversely, the incidence of TI increased during lockdown (344.7 vs 384.3; 12%) and post-lockdown (384.3 vs 394.2; 3%) periods, even not always statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed a reduction of ADs use during the early phase of lockdown. Several factors might have impacted on the observed phenomenon (i.e, patient reluctance to start new AD treatment). Considering the mutation of the virus and the potential waves that might occur in the next months, a continuous monitoring of the impact of COVID19 on mental diseases onset and treatment adherence are suggested. KEY MESSAGES: In Italy, the implementation of lockdown measures was followed by a reduction in antidepressants use, even though evidences are that diagnoses of psychiatric disorders increased.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality and readability of online information about the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was a trending topic on the internet, using validated instruments and relating the quality of information to its readability. METHODS: The search was based on the term Wuhan Coronavirus on the Google website (February 6, 2020). At the search time, the terms COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) did not exist. Critical analysis was performed on the first 110 hits using the Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct (HONcode), the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark, the DISCERN instrument, and Google ranking. RESULTS: The first 110 websites were critically analyzed, and only 1.8% (n=2) of the websites had the HONcode seal. The JAMA benchmark showed that 39.1% (n=43) of the websites did not have any of the categories required by this tool, and only 10.0% (11/110) of the websites had the four quality criteria required by JAMA.

One option is to cease the sale of tobacco from convenience stores. However, tobacco companies and retail trade associations oppose this move and have argued that customers who purchase tobacco drive footfall and spend more than non-tobacco customers. The aim of this study is to test the validity of industry claims about the importance of tobacco to convenience stores. METHODS During November and December 2019, immediate postpurchase surveys were undertaken with customers on exit from a random sample of 100 convenience stores in two New Zealand cities. We estimated the mean number of items purchased, including tobacco and non-tobacco items, and mean expenditure on non-tobacco items. RESULTS Of the 3399 transactions recorded, 13.8% included tobacco, of which 8.3% comprised tobacco only and 5.5% included tobacco and non-tobacco items. The mean number of transactions containing both tobacco and non-tobacco items was 1.98, and 1.87 for those containing non-tobacco items only. Customers who purchased tobacco and non-tobacco items spent on average NZ$6.99 on non-tobacco items, whereas customers who purchased non-tobacco items only, spent on average NZ$5.07. CONCLUSIONS Our results do not support claims that tobacco drives one-quarter of footfall into stores or that customers who purchase tobacco spend almost twice as much as non-tobacco customers. Combined purchases of tobacco and non-tobacco items constituted 5.5% of transactions; the impact on a store's profitability of removing tobacco sales is unknown and could be the focus of future research.","output":"Is the tobacco 'footfall' argument justified for tobacco purchases in New Zealand convenience stores?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two core courses have been given for several years to senior chemical engineering undergraduate students in flipped format, combining pre-class online preparation by the students, class meetings with the lecturer, and active tutorials, in which groups of students solve exercises. In 2020/21, the COVID-19 lockdown imposed online teaching of these courses to the 54 enrolled students. The objective of work presented in this paper is to explore the impact of the remote flipped classroom design on students' learning experience and achievements, in comparison to the regular flipped class in which only the first preparation phase was online. Because the course was taught completely online, a plethora of data was for the first time made available to support a thorough study of the course teaching protocol, including data from Panopto Analytics?, Zoom and Moodle logs, extensive self-report surveys, as well as actual learning outcomes (exam results). Statistical analyses including multivariate regression were performed to determine which factors most affect learning outcomes. The student surveys indicate that of the three class steps, the active tutorial gives students the most confidence in their mastery. Furthermore, analysis indicates that active students think that they benefit more than do passive students, as reflected by both self-reporting and final exam performances. The importance of underlying ability, as indicated by the GPA is a principal conclusion from the regression model, which also identifies attendance of active tutorials as a dominant positive effect on exam grades. Two important conclusions of our work are that the online and face-to-face versions of our flipped approach achieve indistinguishable learning outcomes and that students perceived confidence in their mastery is highest after the active tutorial.","output":"The Flip Side of Teaching Process Design and Process Control to Chemical Engineering Undergraduates C and Completely Online to Boot"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with SARS\\\\CoV2 does not spare pregnant women and the possibility of vertical transmission which might lead to fetal damages is pending.

We evaluated protein expression of ACE2 both in placentas and fetal organs from non\\\\infected pregnancies across gestation. METHODS: Discovery study. Immunocytochemistry analysis for ACE2 in organs and placentas were performed in May 2020, in samples from a registered biobank. Five cases of medical termination of pregnancy performed at between 15 and 38 weeks in healthy women. Paraffin\\\\embedded tissues (kidneys, brain, lungs, intestinal tract, heart). Matching tissues from 8\\\\year\\\\old children (N=4) were tested as controls. Seven placentas including those of the 5 cases, 1 of a 7\\\\week miscarriage and 1 of a symptomatic SARS\\\\COV2 pregnancy at 34 weeks. Tissues sections were incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti\\\\ACE2. Protein expression of ACE2 was detected by immunochemistry. RESULTS: ACE2 expression was detected in fetal kidneys, rectum and ileum across gestation and similarly in the pediatric control. It was barely detectable in lungs at 15 weeks and not found thereafter. In the pediatric control, ACE2 was only detectable in type 2 pneumocytes. No ACE2 expression was found in the cerebral ependymal, parenchyma nor in cardiac tissues ACE2 was expressed in syncitiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast from 7th weeks onwards and across gestation but not in the amnion. Similar intensity and distribution of ACE2 staining were identified in the mother's SARS\\\\CoV2 placenta.

RESULTS: Only 19 patients (4.8%) were UAE nationals, while 372 (95.2%) were expatriates. Median age was 48 (interquartile range, 40C56) years; 22% were <40 years, and only 16.6% were female. Cough was the most common symptom (78.7%), fever was 77.4%, and gastrointestinal symptoms were least common (13.8%). Approximately 95% had elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimers (79%), lymphocytopenia 47.3%, and thrombocytopenia 13.8%. Mortality was 30% for the total sample and 50% in ICU patients. ICU patients were older than non-ICU (age; 49.6  10.9 vs. 46.7  12.7 years, p = 0.04). Eighty-five percent of ICU patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, 78% vasopressors, 88% sedation, 84% muscle paralysis, while none require any of these in the medical group. Survivors had fewer patients with sedatives (p = 0.01). The median length of stay in the hospital was 19 days, ICU stays 14 days, and ventilator 11 days. The Mann-Whitney test showed that survivors spent more days in the ICU (median [IQR] 18 [6.5C29.5] vs. 11 [4C18], p value 0.003) and the hospital (32 [14.5C49.5] vs. 14 [7C21], p value 0.001) than nonsurvivors.

Nurses on the frontlines are particularly vulnerable to the adversity of working under these conditions, particularly with regard to mental health. Thus, understanding risk and protective factors for this vulnerable and essential group is critical for identifying potential targets of interventions. We had two aims for the current study: (a) to examine work functioning and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress (PTSD) among nurses who did and did not care for patients with COVID-19; and (b) to determine if resilience and social support moderate these relationships. METHODS: For three weeks in July 2020, nurses across the United States were invited to participate in an online survey collecting data on demographics, resilience, social support, and screening measures of depression, PTSD, anxiety, and distracted practice. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and hierarchical regression for each outcome measure. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a growing body of research reporting that nurses are experiencing mental health sequelae during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially those providing direct care to patients with the virus. We found that compared to nurses who did not care for patients with COVID-19, those who did reported increased symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. A novel contribution is our finding that nurses providing direct COVID-19 care also experienced increased levels of distracted practice, a behavioral measure of distraction linking to a potential impact on patient care. We also found that resilience and social support acted as moderators of some of these relationships. Fostering resilience and social support may help buffer the effects of providing care to patients with COVID-19 and could potentially decrease nurse vulnerability to developing psychological symptoms and impairment on the job.","output":"Moderating Roles of Resilience and Social Support on Psychiatric and Practice Outcomes in Nurses Working During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has been introduced as a less invasive alternative to multi-port laparoscopic surgery (MLS). MLS is widely accepted for the treatment of colorectal cancer, but there remains minimal evidence for the use of SILS.

METHODS Some 910 patients had colorectal resections for cancer between 2006 and 2013, and 134 of them were operated on using SILS. Eighty of these SILS patients were compared to a cohort of patients who had open surgery that were matching in tumour stage and location, type of resection, sex, age and ASA Score. Disease-free survival at 5 years (5y-DFS) was the primary endpoint; morbidity and hospitalization were secondary parameters. The role of surgical training in SILS was also investigated. RESULTS Clavien Dindo  IIIb complications occurred in 13.8% in both groups. 5y-DSF were 82% after SILS and 70% after OS (p = 0.11).

Methods Skeletal muscle biopsies from 12 patients with IMNM, 7 patients with sIBM, and 8 patients with irMyositis were analyzed by immunostaining and immunofluorescence as well as by quantitative PCR. Eight biopsies from nondisease participants served as controls. Results CD3+CD8+ T cells in biopsies from IMNM, sIBM, and irMyositis were largely PD1-positive, while CD68+ macrophages were sparsely positive to the ligand of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-L1). The sarcolemma of myofibers was PD-L2+ and was colocalized with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. CD68+ macrophages were colocalized with PD-L2. Senescent T cells were strongly enriched in skeletal muscle of sIBM, revealing a distinct immunologic signature. Biopsies from patients with irMyositis showed mild signs of senescence and exhaustion. Conclusion Persistent exposure to antigens in IMNMs and sIBM may lead to T-cell exhaustion, a process controlled by the PD1 receptor and its cognate ligands PD-L1/PD-L2.

While it was initially regarded as a strictly respiratory illness, the impact of COVID-19 on multiple organs is increasingly recognized. The brain is among the targets of COVID-19, and it can be impacted in multiple ways, both directly and indirectly. Direct brain infection by SARS-CoV-2 may occur via axonal transport via the olfactory nerve, eventually infecting the olfactory cortex and other structures in the temporal lobe, and potentially the brain stem. A hematogenous route, which involves viral crossing of blood-brain barrier, is also possible. Secondary mechanisms involve hypoxia due to respiratory failure, as well as aberrant immune response leading to various forms of encephalopathy, white matter damage, and abnormal blood clotting resulting in stroke. Multiple neurological symptoms of COVID-19 have been described. These involve anosmia/ageusia, headaches, seizures, mental confusion and delirium, and coma. There is a growing concern that in a number of patients, long-term or perhaps even permanent cognitive impairment will persist well after the recovery from acute illness.

However, the extent to which hospitals are using these strategies and their association with DTN times have not been well studied. METHODS We surveyed 304 Get With The Guidelines-Stroke hospitals joining TARGET Stroke regarding their baseline use of strategies to reduce DTN times in the January 2008 to December 2009 time frame before the initiation of TARGET Stroke and determined the association between hospital strategies and DTN times. RESULTS Among 5460 patients receiving tissue-type plasminogen activator within 3 hours of symptom onset in surveyed hospitals, the median DTN time was 72 minutes (interquartile range, 55-94). Reported use of the different strategies varied considerably. Of 11 hospital strategies analyzed individually by multivariable analysis, 3 strategies were independently associated with shorter DTN times. These included rapid triage/stroke team notification (209/304 [69%] hospitals, 8.1-minute reduction in DTN time), single-call activation system (190/304 [63%] hospitals, 4.3 minutes), and tissue-type plasminogen activator stored in the emergency department (189/304 [62%] hospitals, 3.5 minutes). When analyzed incrementally, hospitals that used a greater number of strategies had shorter DTN times with 1.3 minutes (adjusted mean difference) saved for each strategy implemented (14 minutes if all strategies were used). CONCLUSIONS Although the majority of participating hospitals reported using some strategy to reduce delays in tissue-type plasminogen activator administration for acute ischemic stroke, the strategies applied vary considerably and those most strongly associated with shorter DTN times were applied relatively less frequently.","output":"Strategies used by hospitals to improve speed of tissue-type plasminogen activator treatment in acute ischemic stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Introduction: En Tunisie, comme ailleurs dans le monde, des formes graves de syndrome de dtresse respiratoire aigu (SDRA) lies au SARS-Covid19 ont t observes Quand les moyens habituels de ranimation ntaient plus suffisants, la mise en place de l Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ou ECMO a t ncessaire pour certains Objectif: Toute la problmatique de la prise en charge de ces malades en cette priode de pandmie a t de grer le fonctionnement de la machine dECMO habituellement rserve aux centres experts et spcialiss en la matire Mthodes: Le service de chirurgie cardio-vasculaire du CHU La Rabta de Tunis a tent lexprience de gestion  distance des ECMO implantes dans les diffrentes ranimations de Grand Tunis en utilisant la tlmdecine et les rseaux sociaux Ainsi un groupe de discussion Facebook- Messenger a t cr et a permis la rgie des malades sous ECMO via des vidoconfrences en temps rel et instantan faisant participer tous les intervenants Rsultats: Un appel tait lanc  chaque fois que le mdecin en charge du patient en avait besoin La vido a permis de discuter avec les chirurgiens et les perfusionnistes en temps rel des complications ou des problmes poss par ces malades Leur tat clinique et leurs constantes vitales taient partags en permanence sur le groupe de discussion Suite aux directives des chirurgiens experts et aux changes faits sur le groupe, le mdecin ranimateur pouvait alors intervenir sur tel ou tel paramtre Conclusion: Les rseaux sociaux ont envahi le quotidien de tous et les professionnels de sant n'chappent pas  cette tendance La pandmie de la Covid 19 na fait que renforcer cette alternative numrique dans un but defficacit et dintrt pour les patients Si leur utilisation dans un cadre professionnel offre de nombreux avantages, elle doit toutefois se faire dans le respect des rgles de dontologie et apporter une vraie plus-value  leur activit Introduction: In Tunisia, as elsewhere in the world, severe forms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to SARS-Covid19 have been observed When the usual means of resuscitation were no longer sufficient, the implementation of the Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ECMO was needed Aim: The whole problem of the management of these patients in this pandemic period has been to manage the operation of the ECMO machine, usually reserved for expert and specialized centers in the field Methods: The cardio-vascular surgery department of La Rabta teaching hospital of Tunis has tried the experience of management of ECMO implanted in the different reanimations of Tunis, remotely, using telemedicine and social networks Thus, a Facebook-Messenger discussion group was created and enabled the management of patients under ECMO via video conferencing in real time involving all stakeholders Results: A call was made whenever the physician needed it The video provided an opportunity to discuss with surgeons and perfusionists in real time the complications or problems of these patients Their clinical status was continuously shared on the focus group Following the instructions of the expert surgeons and the exchanges made on the group, the reanimator could then intervene on this or that parameter Conclusion: Social media have invaded everyones daily lives and health professionals are not exception to this trend The Covid-19 pandemic has only strengthened this digital alternative with the goal of efficiency and patient interest While their use in a professional setting offers many advantages, it must nevertheless be done in compliance with the rules of ethics and bring real added value","output":"La tlmdecine et des rseaux sociaux dans la gestion des ECMO  lre de COVID-19 : lexprience Tunisienne"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a novel syndrome known as a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) was reported in previously healthy children. A possible pro-inflammatory molecule, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), may be assumed to play an important role in the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of MIS-C. We described the clinical picture of patients with MIS-C and we also aimed to test and compare HMGB1 serum levels of MIS-C patients with those of patients with previous SARS-CoV2 infection and healthy children. STUDY DESIGN: We determined HMGB1 levels by Western blot in 46 patients and divided them into three groups, namely, five patients with MIS-C (median age: 8.36 years), 20 children with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection (median age: 10.45 years), and 21 healthy children (controls) (median age: 4.84 years), without evidence of respiratory infection in the last 3 months. RESULTS: The median level of HMGB1 in the serum of five patients with MIS-C was found to be significantly higher compared with both patients with a recent history of COVID-19 (1,151.38 vs. 545.90 densitometric units (DU), p = 0.001) and control (1,151.38 vs. 320.33 DU, p = 0.001) groups. The HMGB1 level in MIS-C patients with coronary involvement had a slightly higher value with respect to patients without coronary dilatation (1,225.36 vs. 1,030.49 DU, p = 0.248). In two of the five children with MIS-C that performed a follow-up, the HMGB1 value decreased to levels that were superimposable to the ones of the control group. CONCLUSION: The significantly high level of HMGB1 protein found in the serum of COVID-19 and patients with MIS-C supports its involvement in inflammatory manifestations, suggesting HMGB1 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in patients with severe illness.","output":"HMGB1 in Pediatric COVID-19 Infection and MIS-C: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Continuing to utilize healthcare as needed during an epidemic outbreak is significant, in general, and especially for cancer patients. Therefore, this study aimed to explore factors associated with health services utilization among breast cancer patients during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. METHOD: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 151 women with breast cancer. Participants completed measures of perceived health status, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, anxiety, coping resources, health services utilization (contact with healthcare professionals and cancellation of an appointment to the oncology/hematology clinic), and socio-demographic questionnaires. A multiple hierarchical regression was calculated; contact with healthcare professionals was the dependent variable. In addition, a logistic regression was calculated; cancellation of an appointment to the oncology/hematology clinic because of the COVID-19 was the dependent variable. RESULTS: Breast cancer patients' contact with healthcare professionals was lower than their contact prior to the pandemic. A higher extent of contact with healthcare professionals was related to patients' perception of health as bad/reasonable, lower perceived susceptibility, a lower sense of mastery, and higher social support. In addition, the odds of cancelling an appointment to the oncology/hematology clinic were higher in the presence of additional chronic illnesses and a higher sense of mastery. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The results could provide public health agencies with a more complete picture of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic among breast cancer patients. This is significant because, in the event that COVID-19 re-emerges, the findings of the current study could help guide public health officials and possibly prevent the future avoidance of health services' use among this high-risk population.","output":"Healthcare utilization among breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Patients, nowadays, prefer easy, low-risk, day-case procedures under local anesthesia for facial rejuvenation. Therefore, they favor facelift operations applied under local anesthesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 160 patients who underwent high superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) lamellar facelift under local anesthesia between 2010 and 2020 were included in this study. Patients operated under general anesthesia were excluded from this study. High SMAS lamellar facelift under local anesthesia was performed in all patients, consisting of 145 women and 15 men without any additional disease aged between 38 and 65 years. About 140 of these patients underwent primary facelift, whereas 20 of them had undergone SMAS plication more than 10 years ago. Lidocaine was used as a local anesthetic and the patients were not sedated. The duration of the operation was 80 minutes on average. The patients were left to rest for 1 hour after the operation and then sent home until their follow-up every other day for the first week. RESULTS: This study shows that high SMAS facelift operations for the mid-face can easily be performed under local anesthesia under operating room conditions without sedation. However, an important point to keep in mind is that although the results of this surgery satisfy the patients, the outcomes do not entirely match the expectations from total face and neck lift performed under general anesthesia. High SMAS facelift with local anesthesia should be considered as an alternative for patients who do not want to undergo general anesthesia or who are at risk of undergoing general anesthesia.

In this study, we aimed to compare the clinical course of COVID-19 in adult SCD patients under the organ injury mitigation and clinical care improvement program (BASCARE) with healthcare professionals without significant comorbid conditions. The study was planned as a retrospective, multicenter and cross-sectional study. Thirty-nine SCD patients, ages 18 to 64 years, and 121 healthcare professionals, ages 21 to 53, were included in the study. The data were collected from the Electronic Health Recording System of PRANA, where SCD patients under the BASCARE program had been registered. The data of other patients were collected from the Electronic Hospital Data Recording System and patient files. In the SCD group, the crude incidence of COVID-19 was 9%, while in healthcare professionals at the same period was 23%. Among the symptoms, besides fever, loss of smell and taste were more prominent in the SCD group than in healthcare professionals. There was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of development of pneumonia, hospitalization, and need for intubation (43 vs 5%, P < 0.00001; 26 vs 7%, P = 0.002; and 10 vs 1%, P = 0.002, respectively). Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin and salicylate were used more in the SCD group than in healthcare professionals group (41 vs 9% and 28 vs 1%; P < 0.0001 for both). The 3-month mortality rate was demonstrated as 5% in the SCD group, while 0 in the healthcare professionals group. One patient in the SCD group became continously dependent on respiratory support. The cause of death was acute chest syndrome in the first case, hepatic necrosis and multi-organ failure in the second case. In conclusion, these observations supported the expectation that the course of COVID-19 in SCD patients will get worse.

METHODS/CASE REPORT: The validation study for the Alinity m (Chicago IL) was performed in three parts 1) Method to method sample/patient correlation study, 2) precision study (at 250 virus copies/mL, 500 virus copies/mL and 1000 virus copies/mL versus 4 negatives), and 3) verification and confirmation of the accuracy of the assay at the lower limit of detection (LOD). For the validation study. The patient specimens were used side by side for both assays. The results from the Abbott m2000 (Chicago IL), which was already established in our lab, were used as a reference for validation. RESULTS (IF A CASE STUDY ENTER NA): The validation with a method to method correlation included 157 valid specimens from which concordant results were obtained for all 157 specimens on both the Alinity-m and Abbott m2000. The precision or reproducibility of the Alinity-m was verified at all concentrations. The limit of detection verification on diluted samples determined the limit of detection to be 20 virus copies/mL (>95% of dilution samples agreed with positive results at this level), which confirmed even below the manufacturer provided LOD of 100 virus copies/mL.

Psychological distress is considered a reliable proxy for psychopathology and can be negatively influenced by childhood trauma through sensitization effects. Emotion dysregulation has been proposed as a potential mediator of this mechanism. We aimed to test this hypothesis in a national Italian sample assessed in the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between psychological distress and childhood trauma in 500 healthy participants assessed through a survey-based study, after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic lockdown in Italy. Levels of psychological distress and history of childhood trauma were obtained using the Kessler-10 (K10) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, respectively. We used bootstrapped mediation analysis to test the mediator role of emotional dysregulation, measured through the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, on the effect of childhood trauma on psychological distress. RESULTS: In total, 190 (38%) reported psychological distress related to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Individuals with psychological distress experienced more childhood trauma, specifically emotional abuse (F = 23.51, df = 1, p < 0.001) and neglect (F = 10.98, df = 1, p = 0.001). After modelling the effect of emotional dysregulation, the impact of childhood trauma on coronavirus disease 2019-related psychological distress resulted in indirect effects and mediated by deficits in emotion regulation mechanisms (bootstrapped lower level of confidence interval = 0.345, upper level of confidence interval = 0.598). CONCLUSION: Childhood trauma is associated with increased vulnerability to the stressful effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak.

The aim of this study is to clarify how urological chief physicians assess the current situation and to present liability risks versus health risks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From July to October 2019, an anonymous online questionnaire was sent to 340 chief physicians by the Working Group Young Urologists of the German Society of Urology (DGU). The questionnaire asked about the risk assessment of the workplace, the timing of a pregnancy announcement, and the employment possibilities of pregnant employees in urology. In addition, a law firm was commissioned to prepare a brief legal opinion on the topic of medical work and surgery during pregnancy with specific reference to the field of urology, including any liability risks. RESULTS: In all, 62 chief physicians participated in the survey (18.2%): 93.5% of the respondents considered an anticipatory risk assessment of the workplace for pregnant women to be useful; 82.3% would appreciate an overlapping recruitment by the employer. Respondents (62.9%) were skeptical of pregnant employees operating. Taking into account the regulations of the Maternity Protection Act, the liability risk does not exceed that which the employer generally has to bear. CONCLUSION: The amendment of the Maternity Protection Act has not fundamentally changed the reality for female urologists. However, the individual risk assessment provides an opportunity to develop concrete protective measuresalso for the operating roomwith the employer. The aim must be to provide pregnant women with greater support in asserting their rights in the future.","output":"Schwanger in der Urologie!: Einsch?tzungen von Chef?rzt*innen und Darlegung haftungsrechtlicher Risiken"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to extensive use of virtual activities by means of electronic devices, which are made up of rare earth elements (REEs).

The concentration levels of REEs in South African coals ranged from 1.4 to 105 g g?1, suggesting that this coal can be a resource for REEs.","output":"Simultaneous Determination of REEs in Coal Samples Using the Combination of Microwave-Assisted Ashing and Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction Methods Followed by ICP-OES Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"National, regional and city leaders have been calling for a rapid expansion of cycling and walking infrastructure as a response to transport issues arising from COVID-19 Here, Dunning and Nurse explore how the expansion and introduction of active-travel networks can be rapidly facilitated as a by-product of the automobile obsession of twentieth-century planning","output":"The surprising availability of cycling and walking infrastructure through COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Highly effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been developed but variants of concerns are worrisome, especially B.1.617.2 (Delta) which has rapidly spread across the world. We aim to study if vaccination alters virological and serological kinetics in breakthrough infections. METHODS: We conducted a multi-centre retrospective cohort study of patients in Singapore who had received a licensed mRNA vaccine and been admitted to hospital with B.1.617.2 SARS-CoV-2 infection. We compared clinical features, virological and serological kinetics (anti-nucleocapsid, anti-spike and surrogate virus neutralization titres) between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. RESULTS: Out of 218 individuals with B.1.617.2 infection, 84 received a mRNA vaccine of which 71 were fully vaccinated, 130 were unvaccinated and 4 received a non-mRNA. Despite significantly older age in the vaccine-breakthrough group, only 2.8% (2/71) developed severe COVID-19 requiring oxygen supplementation compared to 53.1% (69/130) in the unvaccinated group (p<0.001). Odds of severe COVID-19 following vaccination were significantly lower (adjusted odds ratio 0.07 95%CI: 0.015-0.335, p=0.001). PCR cycle threshold values were similar between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups at diagnosis, but viral loads decreased faster in vaccinated individuals. Early, robust boosting of anti-spike protein antibodies was observed in vaccinated patients, however, these titers were significantly lower against B.1.617.2 as compared with wildtype vaccine strain. CONCLUSION: The mRNA vaccines are highly effective at preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19 associated with B.1.617.2 infection. Vaccination is associated with faster decline in viral RNA load and a robust serological response.

Effective vaccination against COVID-19 is therefore of great importance in this group, but little is known about the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in these patients. Objectives We studied humoral and cellular immune responses after mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccination in adult IEI patients. Methods In a prospective, controlled, multicenter study 505 IEI patients (common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), isolated or undefined antibody deficiencies, X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), combined immunodeficiency (CID), phagocyte defects) and 192 controls were included. All participants received two doses of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine. Levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, and T-cell responses were assessed at baseline, 28 days after first and 28 days after second vaccination. Results Seroconversion rates in patients with clinically mild antibody deficiencies and phagocyte defects were similar to healthy controls, but seroconversion rates in patients with more severe IEI, like CVID and CID, were lower. Binding antibody titers correlated well to the presence of neutralizing antibodies. T-cell responses were comparable to controls in all IEI cohorts, with the exception of CVID patients. The presence of non-infectious complications and the use of immunosuppressive drugs in CVID patients were negatively correlated with the antibody response. Conclusion COVID-19 vaccination with mRNA-1273 was immunogenic in mild antibody deficiencies and phagocyte defects and in most patients with CID and CVID. Lowest response was detected in XLA and in CVID patients with non-infectious complications. The assessment of longevity of immune responses in these vulnerable patient groups will guide decision-making for additional vaccinations.","output":"Immunogenicity of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine in adult patients with inborn errors of immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 led to a widespread lockdown that restricted human activities, particularly land, air, and maritime traffic. The \\"quietness\\" on land and ocean that followed presents an opportunity to measure an unprecedented reduction in human-related seismic activities and study its effect on the short-period range of ambient noise cross-correlation functions (NCFs). We document the variations in seismic power levels and signal quality of short-period NCFs measured by four seismographs located near Canadian cities across the pandemic-defined timeline. Significant drops in seismic power levels are observed at all the locations around mid-March. These drops coincide with lockdown announcements by the various Canadian provinces where the stations are located. Mean seismic power reductions of 24% and 17% are observed near Montreal and Ottawa, respectively, in eastern Canada. Similar reductions of 27% and 17% are recorded in western Canada near Victoria and Sidney, respectively. None of the locations show full recovery in seismic power back to the pre-lockdown levels by the end of June, when the provinces moved into gradual reopening. The overall levels of seismic noise during lockdown are a factor of 5-10 lower at our study locations in western Canada, relative to the east. Signal quality of NCF measured in the secondary microseism frequency band for the station pair in western Canada is maximum before lockdown (late February-early March), minimum during lockdown (mid- late March), and increased to intermediate levels in the reopening phase (late May). A similar pattern is observed for the signal quality of the eastern Canada station pair, except for a jump in levels at similar periods during the lockdown phase.

Riboflavin consisting of two important cofactors, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which are involved in multiple oxidative-reduction processes and energy metabolism. Besides maintaining human health, different sources reported that riboflavin can inhibit or inactivate the growth of different pathogens including bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, highlighting the possible role of riboflavin as an antimicrobial agent. Moreover, riboflavin and flavins could produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) when exposed to light, inducing oxidative damage in cells and tissues, and thus are excellent natural photosensitizers. Several studies have illustrated the therapeutic efficacy of photoactivated riboflavin against nosocomial infections and multidrug resistant bacterial infections as well as microbial associated biofilm infections, revealing the potential role of riboflavin as a promising antimicrobial candidate, which could serve as one of the alternatives in fighting the global crisis of the emergence of antimicrobial resistance seen in different pathogenic microbes. Riboflavin could also be involved in modulating host immune responses, which might increase the pathogen clearance from host cells and increase host defense against microbial infections. Thus, the dual effects of riboflavin on both pathogens and host immunity, reflected by its potent bactericidal effect and alleviation of inflammation in host cells further imply that riboflavin could be a potential candidate for therapeutic intervention in resolving microbial infections. Hence, this review aimed to provide some insights on the promising role of riboflavin as an antimicrobial candidate and also a host immune-modulator from a multi-perspective view as well as to discuss the application and challenges on using riboflavin in photodynamic therapy against various pathogens and microbial biofilm-associated infections.","output":"Riboflavin as a promising antimicrobial agent?

The majority of people who contract COVID-19 experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without special treatment. However, for many COVID-19 has proved to be fatal. Despite the global challenge, policy responses across different countries have varied considerably. This study explored the impact of policy decisions by comparing the transmission rates and COVID-19 related fatalities between 1st and 30th April 2020 within different countries, based on the government policies implemented. Methods: A predictive analytics algorithm was developed to identify factors impacting on the transmission and fatalities of COVID-19. This utilized data related to the disease spread and policy responses in 185 countries around the world from Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Bespoke algorithms were used for pre-processing the data for extracting relevant government policies, imputing missing values, eliminating less contributory factors, and selecting the most informative variables. Results: Stay at home policies, restriction on gathering and international travel controls were associated with a reduced number of confirmed cases and resulting fatalities. However, factors including the number of daily tests performed and contact tracing appeared to be less contributory compared against alternative measures implemented to contain the pandemic. Conclusions: Experimental results suggested that proactive approaches to implementing all policy decisions result in a greater impact on the outcomes achieved. This is particularly true for policies such as test and trace, which is more effective at the beginning of an outbreak when there are fewer chains of transmission. Once the COVID-19 cases rise significantly, the testing process becomes ineffective and has a minimal impact on the disease spread and therefore lockdown implementation becomes a more efficient way of controlling the pandemic.","output":"PIN49 Developing a Predictive Algorithm to Identify the Key Factors Impacting on the Transmission and Fatalities from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 differs substantially between individuals, ranging from mild to severe or even fatal. Heterogeneity in the immune response against SARS-COV-2 likely contributes to this. Therefore, we explored the temporal dynamics of key cellular and soluble mediators of innate and adaptive immune activation in relation to COVID-19 severity and progression. Forty-four patients with a PCR-proven diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. Extensive cellular (leukocytes and T-lymphocyte subsets) and serological immune profiling (cytokines, soluble cell surface molecules, and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies) was performed at hospital admission and every 3-4 days during hospitalization. Measurements and disease outcome were compared between patients with an unfavorable (IC admission and/or death) and favorable (all others) outcome. Patients with an unfavorable outcome had higher leukocyte numbers at baseline, mostly due to increased neutrophils, whereas lymphocyte and monocyte numbers were reduced. CRP, IL-6, CCL2, CXCL10, and GM-CSF levels were higher at baseline in the unfavorable group, whereas IL-7 levels were lower. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were more frequently absent in the unfavorable group. Longitudinal analysis revealed delayed kinetics of activated CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocyte subsets in the unfavorable group. Furthermore, whereas CRP, IL-6, CXCL10, and GM-CSF declined in the favorable group, these cytokines declined with delayed kinetics, remained increased, or even increased further in the unfavorable group. Our data indicate a state of increased innate immune activation in COVID19-patients with an unfavorable outcome at hospital admission, which remained over time, as compared with patients with a favorable outcome.","output":"Extensive longitudinal immune profiling reveals sustained innate immune activation in COVID-19 patients with unfavorable outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This reflective essay describes steps taken by Business faculty in a U.S. Midwestern mid-sized regional university to assist faculty in making the rapid transition to 100% online teaching. These steps include the development of an online course template within the universitys course management system made available to all faculty with tips and video tutorials specifically tailored to business courses. The coronavirus pandemic forced faculty members at institutions across the world into teaching online in about two weeks. Many tenure-track professors and full-time instructors, who were required to complete extensive training prior to teaching online courses, were relatively well-prepared. In spite of this training, some instructors felt overwhelmed when the pandemic forced an immediate transition online. Adjunct instructors and some junior faculty were particularly affected. Consistent with the conservation of resources theory which suggests that individuals conserve their limited resources (e.g., time, money, etc.) to ensure availability when they are most needed, many instructors, particularly adjunct and junior faculty, were constrained by competing demands. Adjunct instructors often teach limited courses while maintaining full-time employment in their respective fields. Junior faculty also have limited resources due to service and publishing demands. The availability of a special online course helped these vulnerable faculty members make the rapid transition to emergency online teaching. This reflective essay also describes the results of a survey about this transition among both faculty and center for teaching and learning (CTL) staff. Lastly, we recommend strategies for CTLs and academic departments to prepare for future crises. Deputizing power-users in each academic unit to redistribute workloads during emergencies and sharing tips and tricks customized for their departments is one such strategy.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if lung ultrasound (LUS) may provide valuable prognostic information in adult patients suspected of COVID-19. METHODS A prospective cohort study of adult patients in an ED was conducted. LUS was performed within one hour of the patients' arrival; COVID-19 was defined by a respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA positive test. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients suspected of COVID-19 and normal LUS with critical outcomes during follow-up, defined as one or more of the following: need of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), invasive mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay or death. Follow-up was 14 days. RESULTS A total of 83 patients were included between 9 March and 12 April 2020. In all, 47 (57%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 45.3-67.5%) had a normal LUS, 46 (98%; 95% CI: 88.7-99.9%) of whom had no critical outcomes.

The study examined 39 patients with EH (57.76.8 years, systolic blood pressure (SBP) 157.511.8 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 92.212.9 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure 113.912.6 mm Hg) and 30 healthy, normotensive controls (55.24.9 years). Blood was drawn from a peripheral vein, and serum levels of interferon-inducible protein (IP)-10 and interleukins (IL)-4, -7 and -13 were measured by a multiplexing assay. Hypertensive patients had significantly higher levels of IP-10, IL-4, IL-7 and IL-13 than control subjects. When the patients were classified into tertiles according to their serum IP-10 levels (T1: 41.2-94.1 pg ml(-1); T2: 103.4-162.5 pg ml(-1); T3: 171.7-443.5 pgml(-1)), the patients classified into the highest tertile also had the highest blood pressure.

We present a case of a rapidly growing appendiceal adenocarcinoma in an elderly patient. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of an 83-year-old-male who presented with a one-month history of abdominal pain. A computer tomography (CT) scan identified a lower pelvic mass measuring 7.39 cm  5.40 cm. A biopsy was done which revealed appendiceal carcinoma. A plan for radiotherapy to reduce the tumor size was made and the patient was discharged. However, the patient returned after three weeks due to worsening abdominal pain and a CT scan identified a significant enhancement in the tumor size. The patient underwent debulking surgery. Pathology of the specimen identified adenocarcinoma of the appendix. DISCUSSION: A rapidly growing carcinoma of the appendix is rare as they are known to have a slow growth rate. A swift diagnosis and intervention are required as these rapidly enhancing neoplasms in the abdomen can become unresectable and metastasize. Although there are various methods of treatment for appendiceal carcinomas, the rapid growth rate and lack of response to radiation required debulking surgery.

Cerebral malaria (CM) is a rapidly progressive and severe form of Plasmodium falciparum infection, characterized by a greater accumulation of red blood cells parasitized by Plasmodium falciparum in the brain. The diagnosis of malaria is usually made in living patients from a blood sample taken in the course of a fever on return from an endemic country, whereas CM, often associated with fatal outcomes even in treated subjects, is usually diagnosed at autopsy. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 36-year-old man who died a few days after returning from a business trip to the Ivory Coast. As a result of an unclear cause of death, a medicolegal autopsy was ordered. Autopsy findings revealed massive congestion and edema of the brain with no other macroscopic abnormalities at organ gross examination. Histology and laboratory tests were conducted revealing a Plasmodium falciparum infection, with numerous parasitized erythrocytes containing dots of hemozoin pigment (malaria pigment) in all examined brain sections and all other organs. Death was attributed to cerebral malaria with multiple organ failure. CONCLUSIONS: This report summarizes several features for the diagnosis of malaria and how postmortem investigations, as well as histology and laboratory diagnosis, may lead to a retrospective diagnosis of a fatal complicated form with cerebral involvement.","output":"Imported malaria in adults: about a case of cerebral malaria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA on nasopharyngeal swab is the standard for diagnosing active COVID-19 disease in asymptomatic cases and in symptomatic patients without the typical radiologic findings.

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused more than 4.5 million deaths worldwide. Despite unprecedented efforts, with vaccines being developed in a record time, SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread worldwide with new variants arising in different countries. Such persistent spread is in part enabled by public resistance to vaccination in some countries, and limited access to vaccines in other countries. The limited vaccination coverage, the continued risk for resistant variants, and the existence of natural reservoirs for coronaviruses, highlight the importance of developing additional therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. At the beginning of the pandemic it was suggested that countries with Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination programs could be associated with a reduced number and/or severity of COVID-19 cases. Preliminary studies have provided evidence for this relationship and further investigation is being conducted in ongoing clinical trials. The protection against SARS-CoV-2 induced by BCG vaccination may be mediated by cross-reactive T cell lymphocytes, which recognize peptides displayed by class I Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA-I) on the surface of infected cells. In order to identify potential targets of T cell cross-reactivity, we implemented an in silico strategy combining sequence-based and structure-based methods to screen over 13,5 million possible cross-reactive peptide pairs from BCG and SARS-CoV-2. Our study produced (i) a list of immunogenic BCG-derived peptides that may prime T cell cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2, (ii) a large dataset of modeled peptide-HLA structures for the screened targets, and (iii) new computational methods for structure-based screenings that can be used by others in future studies. Our study expands the list of BCG peptides potentially involved in T cell cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides, and identifies multiple high-density neighborhoods of cross-reactive peptides which could be driving heterologous immunity induced by BCG vaccination, therefore providing insights for future vaccine development efforts.","output":"Large-Scale Structure-Based Screening of Potential T Cell Cross-Reactivities Involving Peptide-Targets From BCG Vaccine and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking may increase the risk of COVID-19 complications, reinforcing the urgency of smoking cessation in populations with high smoking prevalence such as individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Whether the COVID-19 pandemic has altered perceptions, motivation to quit, or tobacco use among cigarette smokers and nicotine e-cigarette vapers with OUD is unknown. METHODS: A telephone survey was conducted in March-July 2020 of current cigarette smokers or nicotine vapers with OUD who were stable on buprenorphine treatment at five Boston (MA) area community health centers. The survey assessed respondents perceived risk of COVID-19 due to smoking or vaping, interest in quitting, quit attempts and change in tobacco consumption during the pandemic. RESULTS: 222/520 patients (43%) completed the survey, and 145 were asked questions related to COVID-19. Of these, 61% smoked cigarettes only, 13% vaped nicotine only, and 26% were dual users. Nearly 80% of participants believed that smoking and vaping increased their risk of COVID-19 infection or complications. Smokers with this belief reported an increased interest in quitting (AOR 4.6, 95% CI:1.7-12.4). Overall, 49% of smokers and 42% of vapers reported increased interest in quitting due to the pandemic; 24% and 20%, respectively, reported attempting to quit since the pandemic. However, 35% of smokers and 27% of vapers reported increasing smoking and vaping, respectively, during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with OUD believed that smoking and vaping increased their vulnerability to COVID-19, half reported increased interest in quitting, but others reported increasing smoking and vaping during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Perceived risk, attitudes, and behavior of cigarette smokers and nicotine vapers receiving buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Crops feed the world's population and shape human civilization. The improvement of crop productivity has been ongoing for almost 10,000 years and has evolved from an experience-based to a knowledge-driven practice over the past three decades.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We review amassing evidence to help guide the management and timing of brachytherapy for gynecologic, breast, and prostate cancers. Where concrete data could not be found, peer-reviewed expert opinion is provided. RESULTS: There may be a significant negative impact on oncologic outcomes for patients with gynecologic malignancies who have a delay in the timely completion of therapy. Delay of prostate or breast cancer treatment may also impact oncologic outcomes. If a treatment delay is expected, endocrine therapy may be an appropriate temporizing measure before delivery of radiation therapy. The use of shorter brachytherapy fractionation schedules will help minimize patient exposure and conserve resources. CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy remains a critical treatment for patients and may shorten treatment time and exposure for some. Reduced patient exposure and resource utilization is important during COVID-19. Every effort should be made to ensure timely brachytherapy delivery for patients with gynecologic malignancies, and endocrine therapy may help temporize treatment delays for breast and prostate cancer patients.

Exposures were classified using survey responses based on the most senior provider offering 24-h in-house coverage: NN, fellow, and no NN/fellow. Primary outcome was death and/or major morbidity (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe neurological injury, late-onset sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between exposures and outcomes and adjust for confounders. Results Among the 28 participating NICUs, most senior providers ensuring 24-h in-house coverage were NN (32%, 9/28), fellows (39%, 11/28), and no NN/fellow (29%, 8/28).

Methods The study enrolled 37 adolescents in stage 2-4 of the Tanner scale, aged from 10 to 14 years, 21 with type 1 diabetes and 16 without any chronic diseases. All subjects performed an incremental submaximal exercise test in a cycle ergometer. At the end of every test stage, glycemia and blood lactate levels were measured. During the test, heart rate was monitored and the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was used to assess fatigue. Results The two groups displayed no significant differences in anthropometric variables. The response to exercise, as evaluated by Borg RPE (p = 0.829), maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) (p = 0.977), heart rate (p = 0.998), maximum load (p = 0.977), absolute load at lactate threshold (p = 0.377) and relative load at lactate threshold (p = 0.282), was also similar between the control and the type 1 diabetes group.

(ii) In regard to safety/screening, guidelines are valuable for safe DM bank operation, but they differ between legislations. There is a surprisingly high rate of non-disclosed donor smoking (0.3%, p > 0.05) and of adulteration of delivered DM (up to 2%, p < 0.05) not detected by standard donor screening procedures. Frequencies differ between remunerated and non-remunerated programs. (iii) Neonatal caregivers should be aware of unpredictable composition of DM. They should be trained on how these can be overcome to avoid negative impact on growth and long-term outcomes like (a) measuring and disclosing nutrient contents of delivered DM batches to customers, (b) implementing certain types of donor pooling to reduce the risk of macronutrient depleted DM, (c) additional supplementation using 0.3-0.5 g protein/100 mL seems to be reasonable, (d) adjusted fortification may help to improve growth, but is not efficient in all preterm infants, (e) target fortification seems to improve growth (and probably also neurodevelopmental index) compared to standard fortification, (f) more research and clinical studies are needed.","output":"Donor Milk Banking - Safety, Efficacy, New Methodologies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Pediatric tuberculosis (TB) remains difficult to diagnose.

TLR3 and TLR7 gene expression was significantly up-regulated upon stimulation with all four dsRNA molecules. Furthermore, in a time course study, a significant increase was noted in the expression of TLR3, TLR7, interferon (IFN)-, IFN-, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 as well as 2,5-OAS in splenocytes treated with poly-UG.

An effective tool to measure HRCD in healthcare workers would help inform teams to undertake more locally led research. The objective of this systematic review is to identify tools measuring healthcare workers individual capacities to conduct research. DESIGN: Systematic review and narrative synthesis using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist for reporting systematic reviews and narrative synthesis and the Critical Appraisals Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for qualitative studies. DATA SOURCES: 11 databases were searched from inception to 16 January 2020. The first 10 pages of Google Scholar results were also screened. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included papers describing the use of tools/to measure/assess HRCD at an individual level among healthcare workers involved in research. Qualitative, mixed and quantitative methods were all eligible. Search was limited to English language only. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two authors independently screened and reviewed studies using Covidence software, and performed quality assessments using the extraction log validated against the CASP qualitative checklist. The content method was used to define a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: The titles and abstracts for 7474 unique records were screened and the full texts of 178 references were reviewed. 16 papers were selected: 7 quantitative studies; 1 qualitative study; 5 mixed methods studies; and 3 studies describing the creation of a tool. Tools with different levels of accuracy in measuring HRCD in healthcare workers at the individual level were described. The Research Capacity and Culture tool and the Research Spider tool were the most commonly defined. Other tools designed for ad hoc interventions with good generalisability potential were identified. Three papers described health research core competency frameworks. All tools measured HRCD in healthcare workers at an individual level with the majority adding a measurement at the team/organisational level, or data about perceived barriers and motivators for conducting health research. CONCLUSIONS: Capacity building is commonly identified with pre/postintervention evaluations without using a specific tool. This shows the need for a clear distinction between measuring the outcomes of training activities in a team/organisation, and effective actions promoting HRCD. This review highlights the lack of globally applicable comprehensive tools to provide comparable, standardised and consistent measurements of research competencies.

CXR and to describe CXR findings and clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with positive and negative CXR. METHODS: Retrospective two-center study on consecutive patients admitted to the emergency department of two north-western Italian hospitals in March 2020 with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR and who underwent CXR within 24 h of the swab execution. 260 patients (61% male, 62.8  15.8 year) were enrolled. CXRs were rated as positive (CXR+) or negative (CXR?), and features reported included presence and distribution of airspace opacities, pleural effusion and reduction in lung volumes. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. Statistical analysis was performed with nonparametric tests, binary logistic regression (BLR) and ROC curve analysis. RESULTS: Sensitivity of CXR was 61.1% (95%CI 55C67%) with a typical presence of bilateral (62.3%) airspace opacification, more often with a lower zone (88.7%) and peripheral (43.4%) distribution. At univariate analysis, several factors were found to differ significantly between CXR+ and CXR?. The BLR confirmed as significant predictors only lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) and interval between the onset of symptoms and the execution of CXR. The ROC curve procedure determined that CRX+ was associated with LDH > 500 UI/L (AUC = 0.878), CRP > 30 mg/L (AUC = 0.830) and interval between the onset of symptoms and the execution of CXR > 4 days (AUC = 0.75). The presence of two out of three of the above-mentioned predictors resulted in CXR+ in 92.5% of cases, whereas their absence in 7.4%. CONCLUSION: CXR has a low sensitivity. LDH, CRP and interval between the onset of symptoms and the execution of CXR are major predictors for a positive CXR.","output":"Baseline chest X-ray in coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients: association with clinical and laboratory data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the role of human behavior in the spread of disease, it is vital to understand what drives people to engage in or refrain from health-related behaviors during a pandemic. This paper examines factors associated with the adoption of self-protective health behaviors, such as social distancing and mask wearing, at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in the USA. These behaviors not only reduce an individual's own risk of infection but also limit the spread of disease to others. Despite these dual benefits, universal adoption of these behaviors is not assured. We focus on the role of socioeconomic differences in explaining behavior, relying on data collected in April 2020 during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. The data include information on income, gender and race along with unique variables relevant to the current pandemic, such as work arrangements and housing quality. We find that higher income is associated with larger changes in self-protective behaviors. These gradients are partially explained by the fact that people with less income are more likely to report circumstances that make adopting self-protective behaviors more difficult, such as an inability to tele-work. Both in the USA and elsewhere, policies that assume universal compliance with self-protective measures-or that otherwise do not account for socioeconomic differences in the costs of doing so-are unlikely to be effective or sustainable.","output":"Socio-demographic factors associated with self-protecting behavior during the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The interleukin-6 (IL-6) membrane receptor and its circulating soluble form, sIL-6R, can be targeted by antibody therapy to reduce deleterious immune signaling caused by chronic overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6.

We found that conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), defined in mice via expression of the transcription factor Zbtb46, were a major source of circulating sIL-6R and, thus, systemically regulated IL-6 signaling. This was uncovered through identification of a cDC-dependent but T cell-independent modality that naturally adjuvants plasma cell differentiation and antibody responses to protein antigens. This pathway was then revealed as part of a broader biological buffer system in which cDC-derived sIL-6R set the in-solution persistence of IL-6.

The total scores for health literacy, adherence, and pandemic impact on hypertension control were calculated and compared across all independent variables. In a total of 144 study participants, controlled blood pressure was reported in 77% (N = 111). There were good levels of adherence and health literacy scores but moderate levels of pandemic impact scores. The total adherence scores showed a statistically significant difference between age groups ((2) = 6.48, p = 0.039) and those who reported having controlled and uncontrolled blood pressure (U = 1116, p = 0.001).

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTSWe conducted a parallel-grouped, stratified, blinded randomized trial including 1000 adults with confirmed COVID-19 receiving at least 10 l/min of oxygen or mechanical ventilation in 26 hospitals in Europe and India from August 2020 to May 2021. INTERVENTIONSPatients were randomized 1:1 to masked intravenous dexamethasone 12 mg or dexamethasone 6 mg daily for up to 10 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESThe primary outcome was the number of days alive without life support (i.e. invasive mechanical ventilation, circulatory support or renal replacement therapy) at 28 days. The primary analysis was adjusted for stratification variables (site, age below 70 years and invasive mechanical ventilation). RESULTSAfter exclusion of 18 patients who withdrew consent, there were 982 patients (613 in Europe, 369 in India) in the intention-to-treat population. We had primary outcome data for 971 patients; 491 assigned to dexamethasone 12 mg and 480 assigned to dexamethasone 6 mg. The median number of days alive without life support was 22.0 days (interquartile range 6.0-28.0) in the 12 mg group and 20.5 days (4.0-28.0) in the 6 mg group (adjusted mean difference 1.3 days, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.0-2.6; P=0.066).

Nasopharyngeal, blood, urine, and stool samples were obtained from each participant at the time of hospital admission, upon discharge, 1 week after discharge, and every 2 weeks until all samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. A survival analysis was also performed to identify the duration of viral persistence. RESULTS: The median duration of viral RNA persistence in the nasopharyngeal samples was 8 days from the first positive RT-PCR result upon admission (95% CI 6.91C9.09); the maximum duration of viral shedding was 25 days from admission. Positive blood, urine, and stool RT-PCR results were detected in 24%, 7%, and 6% of the patients, respectively. The median duration of viral persistence in the blood, urine, and stool samples was 7 days (95% CI 6.07C7.93), 6 days (95% CI 4.16C8.41), and 13 days (95% CI 6.96C19.4), respectively. Also, the maximum duration of viral persistence in the blood, urine, and stool samples was 17, 11, and 42 days from admission, respectively. CONCLUSION: According to the present results, immediately after the hospitalized patients were discharged, no evidence of viral genetic materials was found. Therefore, appropriate treatments were selected for the patients at this hospital. However, we recommend further investigations on a larger sample size in multi-center and prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effects of different drugs on the shedding of the virus through body secretions.","output":"Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal, blood, urine, and stool samples of patients with COVID-19: a hospital-based longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To mitigate the spread of COVID-19, Saudi Arabia (SA) implemented strict precautionary measures including a prolonged nationwide lockdown that lasted for approximately 3 months. Due to the limited availability of telemedicine and cancellation of routine in-person visits, many people with diabetes (PWD) in SA lost access to their diabetes care professionals. Here, we examined the impact of lockdown on cardiometabolic health in PWD and how this may have differed between those who utilized a simplified diabetes telemedicine clinic during lockdown versus those who did not. Methods: Body weight, Hemoglobin A1C, serum lipids, and other cardiometabolic parameters were retrospectively reviewed in 384 PWD (57% type 2 diabetes, 39% type 1 diabetes, and 4% other types) who attended routine clinic visits at King Saud University-Medical City, SA in the pre-lockdown (September 2019 to March 2020) and post-lockdown (Aug to Dec 2020) periods. Changes in cardiometabolic parameters from pre- to post-lockdown were compared across 3 groups according to the type of visit that they had during the lockdown period (April to July 2020): no visit (n=215), in-person visit(n=44), or virtual visit(n=125). Of the virtual visits, 68% were real-time audio calls and 32% were realtime video visits. Results: PWD who attended a virtual visit during lockdown were the youngest and most likely to have had type 1 diabetes (39 years-old and 56%, respectively);followed by those who attended an in-person visit (43 years-old and 39%, respectively) and those who had no visit (50 years-old and 30%, respectively). A significant reduction in A1C from pre- to post-lockdown was noted in PWD who attended a virtual visit(9.02 to 8.27%, respectively, p< 0.01) and those who attended an in-person visit(9.18 to 8.43%, respectively< 0.05) during lockdown but not in those who had no visit (8.75 to 8.57%, p >0.05). A statistically significant reduction in LDL was noted only in those who had a virtual visit during lockdown. Finally, the no visit group had a reduction in weight (77.83 to 76.82kg, p< 0.05) and an increase in urine albumin:creatine (65 to 98mg/gm, p< 0.05) during the lockdown. No significant changes were noted in serum random glucose, blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides in any of the groups. Discussion/Conclusion: Simplified telemedicine visits, including real-time audio calls, were as effective as in-person visits in improving cardiometabolic health in PWD during lockdown in a country where telemedicine is not well-established. Older adults and those with type 2 diabetes were more likely to not utilize telemedicine;a finding that suggests a potential digital divide among subgroups of PWD and warrants greater attention in the future.","output":"Abstract #1088588: The Impact of a Prolonged Lockdown and Utilization of a Simplified Diabetes Telemedicine Clinic on Cardiometabolic Health in People With Diabetes During The COVID-19 Outbreak in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of the virus around the globe, the widespread introduction of restrictions on freedom of movement and declarations by governments about the great threat to public health on a global scale, have had a serious impact on migration processes in the world The European legal space has some regulation of migration processes, developed within the framework of the EU, the Council of Europe and the OSCE However, COVID-19 presented him with some additional challenges The purpose of the article is to analyze the legal regulation of migration processes within the European legal area in the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic The main method to study this problem is the comparative analysis, which allows to compare the legal regulation of migration processes during COVID-19 in three organizations: the European Union, the Council of Europe and the OSCE In conclusion, the pandemic once again demonstrated the tendencies of national isolation, which exist in the European continent The EU closes internal borders, the members of the Council of Europe make an exception to the rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights, but they do not notify the Secretary General of the Council of Europe","output":"COVID-19: Regulation of Migration Processes in The European Legal Area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To determine changes in clinical and radiologic findings associated with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from diagnosis to recovery, we retrospectively reviewed the diagnosis and treatment records of the first patient cured of COVID-19 in Guangzhou.

In this series, we will present three cases of AWE and discuss the diagnostic challenge in this uncommon disease. PRESENTATION OF CASES: These case series describe the different presentations of the entity and the various methods of diagnosing them. Many other reviews have discussed the possible preventative methods to decrease the chances of developing abdominal wall endometrioma. DISCUSSION: Women of childbearing age, with a previous C-section or hysterectomy, who present with chronic abdominal pain and bulging related to their wound should raise the suspicion and further go an abdomen pelvic CT scan at the time of menstruation. Diagnosis of abdominal wall endometriomas is usually delayed, as symptoms are non-specific, cyclical, and slowly progressive. After imaging, the patient must undergo surgical excisional biopsy to have a definitive diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Abdominal wall endometriomas are only visualized on a CT scan during menstruation, increasing the challenge of diagnosing this entity significantly. To minimize the error in diagnosis, a raised suspicion of this pathology is the key to identifying this issue.","output":"The challenge in diagnosing abdominal wall endometriosis; a series of three cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a systemic infection. Patients with cancer are immunocompromised and may be vulnerable to COVID-related morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this study were to determine if patients with cancer have worse outcomes compared with patients without cancer and to identify demographic and clinical predictors of morbidity and mortality among patients with cancer. METHODS We used data from adult patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to two New York-Presbyterian hospitals between March 3 and May 15, 2020. Patients with cancer were matched 1:4 to controls without cancer in terms of age, sex, and number of comorbidities. Using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test, we compared morbidity (intensive care unit admission and intubation) and mortality outcomes between patients with cancer and controls. Among those with cancer, we identified demographic and clinical predictors of worse outcomes using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS We included 585 patients who were COVID-19 positive, of whom 117 had active malignancy, defined as those receiving cancer-directed therapy or under active surveillance within 6 months of admission. Presenting symptoms and in-hospital complications were similar between the cancer and noncancer groups. Nearly one half of patients with cancer were receiving therapy, and 45% of patients received cytotoxic or immunosuppressive treatment within 90 days of admission. There were no statistically significant differences in morbidity or mortality (P = .894) between patients with and without cancer. CONCLUSION We observed that patients with COVID-19 and cancer had similar outcomes compared with matched patients without cancer. This finding suggests that a diagnosis of active cancer alone and recent anticancer therapy do not predict worse COVID-19 outcomes and therefore, recommendations to limit cancer-directed therapy must be considered carefully in relation to cancer-specific outcomes and death.","output":"COVID-19 Severity and Outcomes in Patients With Cancer: A Matched Cohort Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We use the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) model to develop the systemic contagion index (SCI) for cryptocurrencies and examine their spillover effects.

The effects of temperature on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in China are unknown. Data on COVID-19 daily confirmed cases and daily mean temperatures were collected from 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China between Jan. 20 and Feb. 29, 2020. Locally weighted regression and smoothing scatterplot (LOESS), distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs), and random-effects meta-analysis were used to examine the relationship between daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 and temperature conditions. The daily number of new cases peaked on Feb. 12, and then decreased. The daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 had a biphasic relationship with temperature (with a peak at 10 C), and the daily incidence of COVID-19 decreased at values below and above these values. The overall epidemic intensity of COVID-19 reduced slightly following days with higher temperatures with a relative risk (RR) was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.99).

As SCV2 is related to previously-studied coronaviruses that have been shown to have the capability for brain invasion, it seems likely that SCV2 may be able to do so as well. To date, although there have been many clinical and autopsy-based reports that describe a broad range of SCV2-associated neurological conditions, it is unclear what fraction of these have been due to direct CNS invasion versus indirect effects caused by systemic reactions to critical illness. Still critically lacking is a comprehensive tissue-based survey of the CNS presence and specific neuropathology of SCV2 in humans. We conducted an extensive neuroanatomical survey of RT-PCR-detected SCV2 in 16 brain regions from 20 subjects who died of COVID-19 disease. Targeted areas were those with cranial nerve nuclei, including the olfactory bulb, medullary dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve and the pontine trigeminal nerve nuclei, as well as areas possibly exposed to hematogenous entry, including the choroid plexus, leptomeninges, median eminence of the hypothalamus and area postrema of the medulla. Subjects ranged in age from 38 to 97 (mean 77) with 9 females and 11 males. Most subjects had typical age-related neuropathological findings. Two subjects had severe neuropathology, one with a large acute cerebral infarction and one with hemorrhagic encephalitis, that was unequivocally related to their COVID-19 disease while most of the 18 other subjects had non-specific histopathology including focal -amyloid precursor protein white matter immunoreactivity and sparse perivascular mononuclear cell cuffing. Four subjects (20%) had SCV2 RNA in one or more brain regions including the olfactory bulb, amygdala, entorhinal area, temporal and frontal neocortex, dorsal medulla and leptomeninges. The subject with encephalitis was SCV2-positive in a histopathologically-affected area, the entorhinal cortex, while the subject with the large acute cerebral infarct was SCV2-negative in all brain regions. Like other human coronaviruses, SCV2 can inflict acute neuropathology in susceptible patients. Much remains to be understood, including what viral and host factors influence SCV2 brain invasion and whether it is cleared from the brain subsequent to the acute illness.","output":"Mapping of SARS-CoV-2 Brain Invasion and Histopathology in COVID-19 Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Older people living in residential aged care homes experience frequent emergency transfers to hospital. These events are associated with risks of hospital acquired complications and invasive treatments or interventions. Evidence suggests that some hospital transfers may be unnecessary or avoidable. The Early Detection of Deterioration in Elderly residents (EDDIE) program is a multi-component intervention aimed at reducing unnecessary hospital admissions from residential aged care homes by empowering nursing and care staff to detect and manage early signs of resident deterioration. This study aims to implement and evaluate the program in a multi-site randomised study in Queensland, Australia. METHODS: A stepped-wedge randomised controlled trial will be conducted at 12 residential aged care homes over 58 weeks. The program has four components: education and training, decision support tools, diagnostic equipment, and implementation facilitation with clinical systems support. The integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework will be used to guide the program implementation and process evaluation. The primary outcome measure will be the number of hospital bed days used by residents, with secondary outcomes assessing emergency department transfer rates, admission rates, length of stay, family awareness and experience, staff self-efficacy and costs of both implementation and health service use. A process evaluation will assess the extent and fidelity of program implementation, mechanisms of impact and the contextual barriers and enablers. DISCUSSION: The intervention is expected to improve outcomes by reducing unnecessary hospital transfers. Fewer hospital transfers and admissions will release resources for other patients with potentially greater needs. Residential aged care home staff might benefit from feelings of empowerment in their ability to proactively manage early signs of resident deterioration. The process evaluation will be useful for supporting wider implementation of this intervention and other similar initiatives.

Nonetheless, this academic discussion is worth having as valid and invalid literature increasingly gets mixed through citations, and as the grey zone between predatory/non-predatory and scholarly/unscholarly becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish.","output":"The right to refuse unwanted citations: rethinking the culture of science around the citation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: There has been widespread concern that so-called lockdown measures, including social distancing and school closures, could negatively impact childrens mental health. However, there has been little direct evidence of any association due to the paucity of longitudinal studies reporting mental health before and during the lockdown. This present study provides the first longitudinal examination of changes in childhood mental health, a key component of an urgently needed evidence base that can inform policy and practice surrounding the continuing response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Mental health assessments on 168 children (aged 7.6C11.6 years) were taken before and during the UK lockdown (AprilCJune 2020). Assessments included self-reports, caregiver reports, and teacher reports. Mean mental health scores before and during the UK lockdown were compared using mixed linear models. RESULTS: A significant increase in depression symptoms during the UK lockdown was observed, as measured by the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) short form. CIs suggest a medium-to-large effect size. There were no significant changes in the RCADS anxiety subscale and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire emotional problems subscale. CONCLUSIONS: During the UK lockdown, childrens depression symptoms have increased substantially, relative to before lockdown. The scale of this effect has direct relevance for the continuation of different elements of lockdown policy, such as complete or partial school closures. This early evidence for the direct impact of lockdown must now be combined with larger scale epidemiological studies that establish which children are most at risk and tracks their future recovery.","output":"Longitudinal increases in childhood depression symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging coronaviruses from zoonotic reservoirs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been associated with human-to-human transmission and significant morbidity and mortality.

In a MERS-CoV challenge, all immunized rhesus macaques exhibited reduced clinical symptoms, lowered viral lung load, and decreased severity of pathological signs of disease compared with controls. Intradermal vaccination was dose sparing and more effective in this model at protecting animals from disease.

According to past studies, supplementing with vitamin D has been shown to minimize or even prohibit respiratory infections in some situations, according to some studies. Recent research has also demonstrated an association concerning vitamin D imbalance and adverse COVID-19 outcomes. It is a debatable situation because vitamin D deficiency is an important health issue worldwide. There may be a benefit in supplementing the low vitamin D levels in COVID-19 infected persons to assist in preventing the disease from more complicating matters. Covid-19 may benefit from vitamin D's immunomodulatory properties, and a comprehensive examination of the effects of vitamin D on Covid-19 is outlined in this brief review.","output":"Vitamin D significance in Combating;Progression and Austerity of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) have suddenly become part of routine care in many hospitals. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated the use of new technologies and new processes to care for hospitalized patients, including diabetes patients. The use of CGMs to automatically and remotely supplement or replace assisted monitoring of blood glucose by bedside nurses can decrease: the amount of necessary nursing exposure to COVID-19 patients with diabetes; the amount of time required for obtaining blood glucose measurements, and the amount of personal protective equipment necessary for interacting with patients during the blood glucose testing. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is now exercising enforcement discretion and not objecting to certain factory-calibrated CGMs being used in a hospital setting, both to facilitate patient care and to obtain performance data that can be used for future regulatory submissions. CGMs can be used in the hospital to decrease the frequency of fingerstick point of care capillary blood glucose testing, decrease hyperglycemic episodes, and decrease hypoglycemic episodes. Most of the research on CGMs in the hospital has focused on their accuracy and only recently outcomes data has been reported. A hospital CGM program requires cooperation of physicians, bedside nurses, diabetes educators, and hospital administrators to appropriately select and manage patients. Processes for collecting, reviewing, storing, and responding to CGM data must be established for such a program to be successful.

Social media posts provide a record of the public's attention to an outbreak. To measure the attention of Chinese netizens to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pre-established nationally representative cohort of Weibo users was searched for COVID-19-related key words in their posts. METHODS: COVID-19-related posts (N = 1101) were retrieved from a longitudinal cohort of 52 268 randomly sampled Weibo accounts (December 31, 2019-February 12, 2020). RESULTS: Attention to COVID-19 was limited prior to China openly acknowledging human-to-human transmission on January 20. Following this date, attention quickly increased and has remained high over time. Particularly high levels of social media traffic appeared around when Wuhan was first placed in quarantine (January 23-24, 8-9% of the overall posts), when a scandal associated with the Red Cross Society of China occurred (February 1, 8%), and, following the death of Dr Li Wenliang (February 6-7, 11%), one of the whistleblowers who was reprimanded by the Chinese police in early January for discussing this outbreak online.

BACKGROUND: T2D increases the risk of heart failure (HF) and cardiovascular mortality. The long-term impact of T2D on cardiac phenotype in the absence of cardiovascular disease and other clinical events is unknown. METHODS: Patients with T2D (n = 100) with no history of cardiovascular disease or hypertension were recruited at baseline. Biventricular volumes, function, and myocardial extracellular volume fraction (ECV) were assessed by CMR, and blood biomarkers were taken. Follow-up CMR was repeated in those without interim clinical events after 6 years. RESULTS: Follow-up was successful in 83 participants. Of those, 29 experienced cardiovascular/clinical events (36%). Of the remaining 59, 32 patients who experienced no events received follow-up CMR. In this cohort, despite no significant changes in blood pressure, weight, or glycated hemoglobin, significant reductions in biventricular end-diastolic volumes and ejection fractions occurred over time. The mean ECV was unchanged. Baseline plasma high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) was significantly associated with a change in left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. Patients who experienced MACE had higher LV mass and greater LV concentricity than those who remained event free.

Understanding the possible socioeconomic and ethnic health inequities is particularly important given the diverse population and fragile political and economic situation. We aimed to characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and assess variations in mortality according to region, ethnicity, comorbidities, and symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of COVID-19 hospital mortality using data from the SIVEP-Gripe (Sistema de Informao de Vigilancia Epidemiolgica da Gripe) dataset to characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. In the study, we included hospitalised patients who had a positive RT-PCR test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and who had ethnicity information in the dataset. Ethnicity of participants was classified according to the five categories used by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics: Branco (White), Preto (Black), Amarelo (East Asian), Indgeno (Indigenous), or Pardo (mixed ethnicity). We assessed regional variations in patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital by state and by two socioeconomically grouped regions (north and central-south). We used mixed-effects Cox regression survival analysis to estimate the effects of ethnicity and comorbidity at an individual level in the context of regional variation. FINDINGS: Of 99 557 patients in the SIVEP-Gripe dataset, we included 11 321 patients in our study. 9278 (820%) of these patients were from the central-south region, and 2043 (180%) were from the north region. Compared with White Brazilians, Pardo and Black Brazilians with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital had significantly higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 145, 95% CI 133C158 for Pardo Brazilians; 132, 115C152 for Black Brazilians). Pardo ethnicity was the second most important risk factor (after age) for death. Comorbidities were more common in Brazilians admitted to hospital in the north region than in the central-south, with similar proportions between the various ethnic groups. States in the north had higher HRs compared with those of the central-south, except for Rio de Janeiro, which had a much higher HR than that of the other central-south states. INTERPRETATION: We found evidence of two distinct but associated effects: increased mortality in the north region (regional effect) and in the Pardo and Black populations (ethnicity effect). We speculate that the regional effect is driven by increasing comorbidity burden in regions with lower levels of socioeconomic development. The ethnicity effect might be related to differences in susceptibility to COVID-19 and access to health care (including intensive care) across ethnicities. Our analysis supports an urgent effort on the part of Brazilian authorities to consider how the national response to COVID-19 can better protect Pardo and Black Brazilians, as well as the population of poorer states, from their higher risk of dying of COVID-19.

This study is a quantitative analysis investigating the educational and psychological effects of the pandemic on US medical students and their reactions to the AAMC recommendation in order to inform medical education policy. METHODS: The authors sent a cross-sectional survey via email to medical students in their clinical training years at six medical schools during the initial peak phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey questions aimed to evaluate students' perceptions of COVID-19's impact on medical education; ethical obligations during a pandemic; infection risk; anxiety and burnout; willingness and needed preparations to return to clinical rotations. RESULTS: Seven hundred forty-one (29.5%) students responded. Nearly all students (93.7%) were not involved in clinical rotations with in-person patient contact at the time the study was conducted. Reactions to being removed were mixed, with 75.8% feeling this was appropriate, 34.7% guilty, 33.5% disappointed, and 27.0% relieved. Most students (74.7%) agreed the pandemic had significantly disrupted their medical education, and believed they should continue with normal clinical rotations during this pandemic (61.3%). When asked if they would accept the risk of infection with COVID-19 if they returned to the clinical setting, 83.4% agreed. Students reported the pandemic had moderate effects on their stress and anxiety levels with 84.1% of respondents feeling at least somewhat anxious. Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) (53.5%) was the most important factor to feel safe returning to clinical rotations, followed by adequate testing for infection (19.3%) and antibody testing (16.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the education of US medical students in their clinical training years.

METHOD: A discrete event simulation was used to explore the impact of different permutations of staff roster, including the number of shifts per day, the number of staff on duty per shift, overall number of staff accessible to work in the laboratory (i.e. overall staff pool), the frequency of shift changes (i.e. number of consecutive days worked), fixed work-rest days and split team arrangement on workplace transmission of COVID-19 by a simulated index staff who acquired the infection from the community over 21 days. Additionally, the impact of workplace social distancing (physical distancing) and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were investigated. RESULTS: A higher rate of transmission was associated with smaller overall staff pool (expressed as multiples of the number of staff per shift), higher number of shifts per day, higher number of staff per shift, and longer consecutive days worked. Having fixed work-rest arrangement did not significantly reduce the transmission rate unless the workplace outbreak was prolonged. Social distancing and PPE use significantly reduced the transmission rate. CONCLUSION: Laboratories should consider organizing the staff into smaller teams/shift and reduce the number of consecutive days worked. Additionally, our observation aligns with the IFCC biosafety recommendation of monitoring staff health (to detect early infection), split team arrangement, workplace social distancing and use of PPE.","output":"Staff rostering, split team arrangement, social distancing (physical distancing) and use of personal protective equipment to minimize risk of workplace transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic: a simulation study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Islamic boarding school is a unit of educational institutions that functions as a Islamic education.

METHODS This was a descriptive cross-sectional study undertaken in the Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia from April 2011 to March 2012. S. maltophilia isolated from various clinical specimens were included in the study. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done using the epsilometer test (E-test) and interpreted according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. In the synergy test, the isolates were tested against six different antimicrobial combinations. RESULTS In total, 84 S. maltophilia isolates were collected and analysed. According to the E-test, the antimicrobial susceptibility of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), tigecycline, and ciprofloxacin was 100%, 91.1%, and 88.9% respectively.

Es istjedoch dringend erforderlich, die Todesf?lle von Covid 19, insbesondere bei Risikogruppen, zuverringern.Schon frh berichteten Forscher ber drei auff?llige Muster. Erstens wird das angeboreneImmunsystem durch Vitamin-D-Mangel beeintr?chtigt, was die Betroffenen fr Virusinfektionenwie COVID-19 anf?llig macht. Ein Vitamin-D-Mangel erh?ht auch die Aktivit?t des XChromosomal-gebundenen \\"Renin-Angiotensin\\"-Systems, wodurch Personen mit Vitamin-DMangel (besonders, M?nner) anf?lliger fr den t?dlichen \\"Zytokinsturm\\" (dramatischeberreaktion des Immunsystems) bei COVID-19 werden. Zweitens entsprechen die Gruppen mitdem h?chsten Risiko fr einen schweren COVID-19-Verlauf den Gruppen mit dem h?chstenRisiko fr einen gro?en Vitamin-D-Mangel. Dazu geh?ren ?ltere Leute, M?nner, Volksgruppen,deren Haut von Natur aus reich an Melanin ist (wenn sie au?erhalb der Tropen leben), Menschen,die aus kulturellen und gesundheitlichen Grnden die Sonne meiden, Menschen, die in Heimenleben, sehr bergewichtige Menschen und Personen, die an Bluthochdruck, Herz-KreislaufErkrankungen oder Diabetes leiden. Und drittens spiegelt das Muster der geographischenVerbreitung von COVID-19 einen st?rkeren Vitamin-D-Mangel in der (betroffenen) Bev?lkerungwider. Sowohl in den USA als auch weltweit verl?uft die Sterblichkeitsrate von COVID-19parallel zu der Rate des Vitamin-D-Mangels.Um den Zusammenhang zu erforschen, wurde eine Literaturrecherche ber PubMed, GoogleScholar und RSMLDS durchgefhrt, wobei gezielte Google-Recherchen zus?tzliche Quellenlieferten. Obwohl randomisierte, kontrollierte Studienergebnisse wahrscheinlich irgendwannverfgbar sein werden, sind die aktuellen Korrelations- und Kausalstudien, die einenZusammenhang zwischen Vitamin-D-Mangel und COVID-19-Risiken belegen, bereits soberzeugend, dass sie Ma?nahmen zur Behebung des Vitamin D Mangels untersttzen.Die 141 Autorengruppen, die in erster Linie ber biologische Plausibilit?t schrieben, erl?utertenausfhrlich, wie Vitamin-D-Mangel jeden Risikofaktor und jede Komplikation von COVID-19erkl?ren kann, stimmten aber darin berein, dass andere Faktoren zweifellos auch eine Rollespielen.

The clear common thread among the top risk groups - vitamin D deficiency C may be being overlooked because of previous overstated claims of vitamin D benefits. However, the need to decrease COVID-19 fatalities among high-risk populations is urgent.Early researchers reported three striking patterns. Firstly, the innate immune system is impaired by vitamin D deficiency, which would predispose sufferers to viral infections such as COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency also increases the activity of the X-chromosome-linked Renin-Angiotensin System, making vitamin D deficient individuals (especially men) more susceptible to COVID-19s deadly cytokine storm (dramatic immune system overreaction). Secondly, the groups who are at highest risk for severe COVID-19 match those who are at highest risk for severe vitamin D deficiency. This includes the elderly, men, ethnic groups whose skin is naturally rich in melanin (if living outside the tropics), those who avoid sun exposure for cultural and health reasons, those who live in institutions, the obese, and/or those who suffer with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes. And thirdly, the pattern of geographical spread of COVID-19 reflects higher population vitamin D deficiency. Not only within the USA but throughout the world, COVID-19 fatality rates parallel vitamin D deficiency rates.A literature search was performed on PubMed, Google Scholar, and RSMLDS, with targeted Google searches providing additional sources. Although randomized controlled trial results may be available eventually, the correlational and causal study evidence supporting a link between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 risks is already so strong that it supports action.The 141 authorial groups writing primarily about biological plausibility detailed how vitamin D deficiency can explain every risk factor and every complication of COVID-19, but agreed that other factors are undoubtedly at work. COVID-19 was compared with dengue fever, for which oral vitamin D supplements of 4000IU for 10 days were significantly more effective than 1000IU in reducing virus replication and controlling the cytokine storm (dramatic immune system over-reaction) responsible for fatalities. Among the 47 original research studies summarized here, chart reviews found that serum vitamin D levels predicted COVID-19 mortality rates (16 studies) and linearly predicted COVID-19 illness severity (8 studies). Two causal modeling studies and several analyses of variance strongly supported the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is a causal, rather than a bystander, factor in COVID-19 outcomes. Three of the four studies whose findings opposed the hypothesis relied upon disproven assumptions.The literature review also found that prophylactically correcting possible vitamin D deficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic is extremely safe. Widely recommending 2000IU of vitamin D daily for all populations with limited ability to manufacture vitamin D from the sun has virtually no potential for harm and is reasonably likely to save many lives.","output":"Translation of A Basic Review of the Preliminary Evidence that COVID-19 Risk and Severity is Increased in Vitamin D Deficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Apart from its magnificent effect against the tuberculosis disease, the BCG vaccine has other nonspecific beneficial effects on the immune system that protect against a wide range of other infections Scientific Community around the globe is linking this non-specific immunity raised by BCG with incidence of the morbidity and mortality associated with Corona Virus infection Research is going on to find its role in shielding effect towards respiratory infection secondary to COVID-19 infection Authors are presenting a review of literature available for the same along with possible mechanism of action of BCG against SARS-COVID and reporting the incidence of COVID infections in countries with and without BCG as Standard Immunization","output":"A review on connection between BCG vaccination and COVID 19 cases: Facts and figures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Information about the clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 at different ages is limited.

In the United States, inactivated and subunit PEDV vaccines for pregnant sows are available, but fail to induce sufficient protection in neonatal piglets farrowed from PEDV na?ve sows. A safe and efficacious live attenuated vaccine that can prime mucosal immune responses is urgently needed. In this study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of two attenuated PEDV vaccine candidates, the emerging non-S INDEL PEDV strain PC22A at the 100th cell culture passage level - Clone no. 4 (P100C4) and at the 120th passage level (P120), in weaned pigs. RESULTS: Four groups of 40-day-old weaned pigs were inoculated orally with PEDV PC22A-P3 (virulent), -P100C4, -P120, and mock, respectively, and challenged with the P3 virus at 24 days post-inoculation (dpi). After inoculation, P3 caused diarrhea in all pigs with a high level of fecal viral RNA shedding. P100C4 and P120 did not cause diarrhea in pigs, although viral RNA was detected in feces of all pigs, except for one P100C4-inoculated pig. Compared with the P120 group, P3- and P100C4-inoculated pigs had higher serum PEDV-specific IgG and viral neutralizing (VN) antibody (Ab) titers at 14 dpi. After the challenge, no pigs in the P3 group but all pigs in the P100C4, P120, and mock groups had diarrhea. Compared with the P120 group, pigs in the P100C4 group had a more rapid decline in fecal PEDV RNA shedding titers, higher titers of serum PEDV-specific IgG, IgA, and VN Abs, and higher numbers of intestinal IgA Ab-secreting cells. CONCLUSIONS: PEDV PC22A P100C4 and P120 were fully attenuated in weaned pigs but failed to elicit protection against virulent P3 challenge. P100C4 induced higher PEDV-specific antibody responses than P120 post inoculation resulting in a greater anamnestic response post challenge. Therefore, P100C4 potentially could be tested as a priming vaccine or be further modified using reverse genetics. It also can be administered in multiple doses or be combined with inactivated or subunit vaccines and adjuvants as a PEDV vaccination regimen, whose efficacy can be tested in the future.

Recent advancements in therapeutic treatments for melanoma patients, such as targeted therapies and immunotherapy, have improved the survival of patients without advanced disease. However, an important subset of patients remains refractory or develops resistance. Melanomagenesis, disease progression, and resistance to therapies are epigenetically regulated processes. Emerging preclinical and clinical research elucidates the mechanisms by which epigenetic drugs can prevent resistance or enhance the therapeutic efficacy of the aforementioned therapies in addition to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and others. In this review, we assess the role of epigenetics in melanoma progression and resistance to targeted and immune therapies. Additionally, we discuss recent preclinical and clinical reports evaluating the use of epigenetic drugs as adjuvants to enhance the current therapeutic approaches for melanoma patients. ABSTRACT: Melanoma is the least common but deadliest type of skin cancer. Melanomagenesis is driven by a series of mutations and epigenetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that allow melanomas to grow, evolve, and metastasize. Epigenetic alterations can also lead to immune evasion and development of resistance to therapies. Although the standard of care for melanoma patients includes surgery, targeted therapies, and immune checkpoint blockade, other therapeutic approaches like radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immune cell-based therapies are used for patients with advanced disease or unresponsive to the conventional first-line therapies. Targeted therapies such as the use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 only improve the survival of a small subset of patients. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify alternative standalone or combinatorial therapies. Epigenetic modifiers have gained attention as therapeutic targets as they modulate multiple cellular and immune-related processes. Due to melanomas susceptibility to extrinsic factors and reversible nature, epigenetic drugs are investigated as a therapeutic avenue and as adjuvants for targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors, as they can sensitize and/or reverse resistance to these therapies, thus enhancing their therapeutic efficacy. This review gives an overview of the role of epigenetic changes in melanoma progression and resistance. In addition, we evaluate the latest advances in preclinical and clinical research studying combinatorial therapies and discuss the use of epigenetic drugs such as HDAC and DNMT inhibitors as potential adjuvants for melanoma patients.","output":"Enhancing Therapeutic Approaches for Melanoma Patients Targeting Epigenetic Modifiers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to cause a huge impact on the wellbeing of the global population The first case of COVID-19 in the world was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and since then, it has spread worldwide As the cases kept on increasing exponentially, the WHO declared COVID-19 as global pandemic on 11 March 2020 Fight against such health crisis required an exceptional response from the healthcare system and administrators In India, it was always anticipated to be a daunting task to control the spread of infection due to a large and dense population and overburdened healthcare system Healthcare workers, police personnel, defence personnel, sanitation workers, local administrators, etc , have been the frontline warriors in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic Healthcare workers have been playing a pivotal role in the hospitals as well as community settings in management of the disease outbreak In hospital set up, planning, preparedness and the optimal management of resources and manpower have been emphasized The fight against COVID-19 pandemic has been long and continuing In this long fight, physical and mental exhaustion leading to burnout among healthcare workers can be a major concern Burnout can result from long term involvement in the work which is demanding and can lead to emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment Multiple factors like fear of acquiring infection, lack of social support, discrimination and distancing behaviour from society, long working hours, inadequate work condition, inadequate protective measures have been identified 1,2 ? 2020, Journal of Indian Academy of Forensic Medicine All Rights Reserved","output":"Healthcare workers and COVID-19 pandemic: A fight amidst fear of burnout"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is currently facing the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus The br pandemic is causing the death of people around the world and public and social health measures to br slow or prevent the spread of COVID-19 are being implemented with the involvement of all br members of society Research institutions are accelerating the discovery of vaccines and therapies br for the COVID-19 In this work, molecular docking was used to study (in silico) the interaction of br twenty-four ligands, divided into four groups, with four important SARS-CoV-2 receptors The br results showed that Metaquine (grou01), antimalarial substance and the anti-HIV antiretroviral br Saquinavir (grou03), presented interaction with all the studied receptors, indicating them as br potentials candidates for muti-target drugs for COVID-19","output":"Interaction of drugs candidates with various SARS-CoV-2 receptors: an in silico study to combat COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely impacting modern human civilization. A global view using a systems science approach is necessary to recognize the close interactions between health of animals, humans and the environment. DISCUSSION: A model is developed initially by describing five sequential or parallel steps on how a RNA virus emerged from animals and became a pandemic: 1. Origins in the animal kingdom; 2. Transmission to domesticated animals; 3. Inter-species transmission to humans; 4. Local epidemics; 5. Global spread towards a pandemic. The next stage identifies global level determinants from the physical environments, the biosphere and social environment that influence these steps to derive a generic conceptual model. It identifies that future pandemics are likely to emerge from ecological processes (climate change, loss of biodiversity), anthropogenic social processes (i.e. corporate interests, culture and globalization) and world population growth. Intervention would therefore require modifications or dampening these generators and prevent future periodic pandemics that would reverse human development. Addressing issues such as poorly planned urbanization, climate change and deforestation coincide with SDGs such as sustainable cities and communities (Goal 11), climate action (Goal 13) and preserving forests and other ecosystems (Goal 15). This will be an added justification to address them as global priorities. Some determinants in the model are poorly addressed by SDGs such as the case of population pressures, cultural factors, corporate interests and globalization. The overarching process of globalization will require modifications to the structures, processes and mechanisms of global governance. The defects in global governance are arguably due to historical reasons and the neo-liberal capitalist order. This became evident especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 when the vaccination roll-out led to violations of universal values of equity and right to life by some of the powerful and affluent nations.

A biopsychosocial-spiritual approach to health management may be beneficial. Primary Study Objective * To assess the effect of gentle yoga and mindfulness meditation on spiritual well-being in cancer survivors. Methods/Design * This is a mixed methods, quasiexperimental pilot study providing 10 weeks of gentle yoga and mindfulness meditation twice per week to cancer survivors. Setting * The intervention was provided at a South Florida university in the summer months. Participants * Ten cancer survivors self-selected to participate in the 10-week study;2 participants did not complete the post-test data collection. Intervention * Each class opened and closed with 5 to 6 minutes of nonmoving mindfulness meditation. The mindfulness meditation techniques included body scan, breath awareness, visualization, affirmation, and compassion meditations. The gentle yoga practice was a series of beginner yoga postures and stretches. The mindfulness meditation techniques of breath and body awareness during yoga created what is referred to as a \\"moving meditation\\" with yoga postures encompassing the movement portion. Primary Outcome Measures * The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Spiritual Well-Being 12 Item Scale (FACIT-Sp-12) and 2 open-ended questions. Results * The FACIT-Sp-12 pre- and post-test data were analyzed using a paired samples t test.

Patient stressors can interfere with their ability to make reasoned and timely decisions about survivorship care and lead to poor quality of life and low physical and social functioning. This pilot effectiveness-implementation study examined the impact and feasibility of offering the Bright IDEAS system of Problem-Solving Skills Training (PSST) to adult cancer survivors to help them and their caregivers cope more successfully with decision making and distress. Methods: Patients with breast (21), prostate (9) or colorectal (20) cancer who completed their definitive cancer treatment within the last 6 months and had their cancer survivorship visit were recruited from two regional cancer centers and affiliated community oncology clinics. Patients with an NCCN distress level &gt; 2 were randomly assigned to either care as usual (CAU) or 8 weekly PSST sessions provided by a trained therapist in person or remotely. Patients were invited but not required to include a supportive other (n = 17). Patient and caregiver assessments at baseline (T1), end of intervention/3 months (T2), and 3 months post intervention/6 months (T3) focused on problem-solving skills (SPSI-25), distress (HADS) and quality of life (FACT). We also collected healthcare utilization data. We compared outcome changes T1-T2 and T1-T3, by study arm, using t-tests. Multivariate regression analysis identified subgroups of patients with positive and negative responses to skills training. Results: Average age of the participants was 63 years (45 to 87) with racial and ethnic distributions representative of the local population (88% white). Two thirds were women (n = 32), one third of the patients were recruited and received therapy fully remotely due to COVID-19-related protocol changes. Patients who received PSST reported a reduction in dysfunctional problemsolving style and improvement in constructive style while problem-solving skills of CAU patients trended in the opposite direction. Patients in the PSST arm also reported significant reduction in anxiety and depression and improvement in cancer-specific quality of life (p &lt; 0.05) that was sustained at 6 months. Patients in the PSST arm reported lower use of hospital and ED services compared to CAU patients (p = 0.07). Better improvement in outcomes was driven by lower problem-solving skills at baseline. Conclusions:Despite the logistical complexity of running a clinical trial during quarantine, patients and caregivers in the PSST arm demonstrated meaningful improvement in distress and quality of life. The evidence from this pilot study will help guide development of a future multi-site randomized clinical trial of the effect of PSST on cancer survivorship care and outcomes.","output":"Problem-solving skills training in adult cancer survivors: Bright IDEAS-AC"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evoker is a narrative-based facial expression game.

A magnetic Fe3O4-kaolin composite (denoted by FKC) with high specific surface area (133.7a?m2/g) was successfully synthesized via a simple and low-cost technique for Tl(I) removing from various water media. The HRTEM images confirmed the existence of lattice fingers Fe3O4 and displayed that a large number of Fe3O4 nanoparticles dispersed on the surface of kaolin sheets. Compared with kaolin or Fe3O4 alone, FKC enhanced obviously the adsorption rate and capacity of Tl(I) over a wide pH range (4.5-9.0). The maximum adsorption capacity of FKC for Tl(I) was 19,347a?mg/kg (calculated by Langmuir model), which was almost one hundred times and two times higher than those of kaolin and Fe3O4, respectively. Importantly, FKC was observed to have a great potential in removing Tl(I) from surface water, groundwater, and tap water in more alkaline conditions. By applying the external magnetic field, FKC could be recovered efficiently (99%) and rapidly (20a?s). Moreover, Tl L3-edge XANES spectra revealed that Tl(I) was adsorbed on the FKC and would not be converted to more toxic Tl(III). The cations (CaCl2, NaCl, and KCl) and the ionic strength with concentrations of 0.001-1.0a?mol/L showed a great influence on the adsorption of Tl(I) by FKC, implying that this adsorption was dominated by outer-sphere surface complexation at investigated pH values.

All links from November 2019 through April 2020 were assessed by 2 of 3 independent raters using a coding system to classify the content source and primary topic of discussion. The top 5 primary topics were retrospectively evaluated to identify prevalent subcategories. Content viewing restrictions were documented. RESULTS: 526 links were accessed.

Specifically, we asked about experiences of the grief process as related to choice of music. Our results indicate that the role of music in farewell rituals is important for the grieving process in several ways. Firstly, music was associated with positive memories of the loved one and gave rise to experiences of recognition. Secondly, music facilitated active participation in the grieving process through choosing farewell music together with a relative. Thirdly, selecting music for the funeral in advance, together with their loved ones, was also experienced as hopeful, comforting and consoling before, during and after the bereavement.","output":"Music as Consolation-The Importance of Music at Farewells and Mourning."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM To determine the efficacy of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a marker of the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia in the South-Asian population. METHODS This was a prospective, cross-sectional, analytic study conducted at HDU/ICU of District Headquarter Hospital, Faisalabad, Pakistan, from May through July 2020. Sixty-three eligible patients, admitted to the HDU/ICU, were prospectively enrolled in the study. Their NLR, C-reactive protein, serum albumin, and serum fibrinogen were measured. Patients' demographic characteristics, comorbidities, clinical manifestations of COVID-19 infection, medication use, and history of lung malignancy were retrieved from their medical history. Patients were categorized into either a general group (with mild COVID-19) or a heavy group (with moderate to severe COVID-19). RESULTS There were significant differences between the two groups in diabetes prevalence, NLR, C-reactive protein, and serum albumin. NLR and C-reactive protein were positively correlated (P < 0.001, P = 0.04 respectively) whereas serum albumin was negatively correlated (P = 0.009) with severe COVID-19. NLR was found to be an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the heavy group (OR = 1.264, 95% CI: 1.046~1.526, P = 0.015). The calculated AUC using ROC for NLR was 0.831, with an optimal limit of 4.795, sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.75, which is highly suggestive of NLR being a marker for early detection of deteriorating severe COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION NLR can be used as an early warning signal for deteriorating severe COVID-19 infection and can provide an objective basis for early identification and management of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"Neutrophil/Lymphocyte Ratio - A Marker of COVID-19 Pneumonia Severity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction 'Preparedness for practice' refers to a multifaceted concept, encompassing not only clinical skills, but also broader, non-clinical skills, such as communication and professionalism. Previous graduates have reported feeling less prepared for complex procedures, such as molar endodontics and surgical extractions. Dental students typically utilise their final year to refine their clinical skills, however, the COVID-19 pandemic has meant that newly qualified dentists will have had around six months where they have not performed clinical dentistry before beginning dental foundation training (DFT). Aims This study aimed to explore final year students' self-reported preparedness for practice, identify areas of relative weakness that may influence future training needs and to highlight any perceived impact of the pandemic on final year experience and potential impact on DFT. Materials and methods The current Graduate Assessment of Preparedness for Practice (GAPP) questionnaire was adapted for our specific research aims and piloted and the PreGAPP questionnaire distributed via the social media channels of dental school student societies. Analysis was carried out using IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software using descriptive statistics and the Mann-Whitney U test for two unrelated variables. Results Responses were received from final year students across all 16 UK dental schools. Students reported increased preparedness across domains in which they had the most experience; for example, providing preventative advice and administering local anaesthesia. Male students reported feeling significantly more prepared than female students, mature students significantly more than younger students, and students on four-year courses significantly more than traditional five-year courses. The COVID-19 pandemic was expected to have a major-to-severe impact on undergraduate experience and future DFT prospects. Conclusion Dental graduates in the COVID-19 era may have significantly different training needs to those before them. Complex clinical procedures remain the areas where students feel they are least prepared for practice. The importance of a clinical passport to highlight current experience level to trainers, alongside the creation of a personal development plan at the beginning of DFT, will ensure that targeted and personalised training can be implemented where required.

Affect and sleep, academic, and social behavior showed substantial changes from school semesters to school breaks and from weekdays to weekends. Three student clusters were identified with behavioral and affective dissociations and varying levels of distress throughout the year. While academics were a common stressor for all, the cluster with highest distress stood out by frequent report of social stress. Moreover, the frequency of reporting social, but not academic, stress predicted subsequent clinical symptoms. Two years later, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the first-year cluster with highest distress again stood out by frequent social stress and elevated clinical symptoms.

This was a cross-sectional study. The participants in this study were patients who visited an outpatient clinic of cardiovascular surgery to administer anticoagulants after mechanical valve replacement surgery at a tertiary hospital in Seoul. Responses of 154 participants on questionnaires were analyzed from 10 September to 26 December 2020. Multiple regression analyses were performed to assess the factors influencing medication adherence among the patients with anticoagulation control. Factors influencing medication adherence were consuming warfarin for 3 to 5 years, awareness of target prothrombin time international normalized ratio, knowledge of warfarin, and depression. Medication beliefs and self-efficacy had no significant influence on medication adherence. The most important factors associated with medication adherence in patients with mechanical heart valves were knowledge about warfarin and depression. In the control of oral anticoagulants that require continuous management, education and providing accurate guidance is more important than personal preferences. Clinical nurses should facilitate educational programs tailored to the characteristics of the patient, including their purpose and method of taking warfarin, specific diets, their knowledge on warfarins interaction with other drugs, symptoms of adverse events, and self-management.

Considering that the pandemic is a recent event, no large clinical trials have been possible and since coronavirus specific drug are not yet available, there is no strong consensus on how to treat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated viral pneumonia. Coronaviruses code for an important multifunctional enzyme named papain-like protease (PLP), that has many roles in pathogenesis. First, PLP is one of the two viral cysteine proteases, along with 3-chymotripsin-like protease, that is responsible for the production of the replicase proteins required for viral replication. Second, its intrinsic deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities serve to antagonize the hosts immune response that would otherwise hinder infection. Both deubiquitinating and deISGylating functions involve the removal of the small regulatory polypeptides, ubiquitin and ISG15, respectively, from target proteins. Ubiquitin modifications can regulate the innate immune response by affecting regulatory proteins, either by altering their stability via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway or by directly regulating their activity. ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like modifier with pleiotropic effects, typically expressed during the host cell immune response. PLP inhibitors have been evaluated during past coronavirus epidemics, and have showed promising results as an antiviral therapy in vitro. In this review, we recapitulate the roles of PLPs in coronavirus infections, report a list of PLP inhibitors and suggest possible therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment, using both clinical and preclinical drugs.","output":"Deubiquitinating Enzymes in Coronaviruses and Possible Therapeutic Opportunities for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we propose a new mathematical model and analyze it to understand the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangkok, Thailand.

Effective infection prevention and control (IPC) in HHC is essential to keeping both healthcare workers and patients safe, especially in the event of an emerging infectious disease outbreak. Prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, we explored successes and challenges with IPC from the perspectives of HHC staff. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: From May to November 2018, we conducted in-depth telephone interviews with 41 staff from 13 agencies across the nation. METHODS: Transcripts were coded by a multidisciplinary coding team, and several primary and subcategories were identified using directed content analysis. RESULTS: Four primary categories were generated including (1) uniqueness of HHC; (2) IPC as a priority; (3) importance of education; and (4) keys to success and innovation. Participants perceived that IPC plays a big part in patient safety and reducing rehospitalizations, and protection of patients and staff was a major motivator for compliance with IPC. The identified challenges included the unpredictability of the home environment, patient/family dynamics, the intermittent nature of HHC, and staffing issues. Education was seen as a tool to improve staff, patient, caregiver and families' compliance with IPC. Keys to success and innovation included a leadership focus on quality, using agency infection data to improve quality, and a coordinated approach to patient care. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This qualitative work identified barriers to effective IPC in HHC, as well as important facilitators that HHC agencies can use to implement policies and procedures to improve patient care and keep staff safe.

However, no study focused on the psychological status of recovered COVID-19-infected patients in China. Our study aims to investigate sleep and mood status, and detect the influencing factors of the psychological status of the COVID-19 patients after recovery. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-five COVID-19 patients were enrolled from February to April 2020. The social demographic information of all participants was collected by a self-designed questionnaire. Insomnia and depression symptoms were evaluated through the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D). RESULTS: The rates of insomnia and depression were 26.45% and 9.92% in the COVID-19 patients after recovery. There were significant differences in physical, mental impairment, and the need for psychological assistance between the COVID-19 recovered patients with depression and the patients without depression. In addition, age and health status may be the influencing factors for insomnia, and care about the views of others may be the influencing factor of depression (P < 0.05).

While structural similarities between poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2 could have major implications for the COVID-19 response worldwide, polio-induced immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 have not been confirmed in prospective clinical trials. Objective: To evaluate whether immune sera from adults who recently received inactivated poliovirus vaccination (IPV) can block SARS-CoV-2's ability to synthesize RNA. Intervention: IPV intramuscular injection. Measurements: Pre-inoculation and 4-weeks post-inoculation sera were tested for anti-3Dpol (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp) antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). To assess IPV's ability to induce antibodies that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis, immune-based detection assays tested RdRp enzymatic activity in polio-immune sera. Results: 298 of the 300 enrolled participants completed both on-site visits. Comparing pre-inoculation to 4-week samples, 85.2% of participants demonstrated an increase in anti-3Dpol antibodies against RdRp proteins. Among tested post-inoculation samples, 94.4% demonstrated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis. Few inoculation-related side effects were reported (2.0%), all were minor. Limitations: Participants were not systematically tested for COVID-19, though known exposures were reported and positive results (1.7%) were documented. Conclusion: IPV can induce antibodies that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis, minimizing the risk of viral replication in infected individuals.

We did a statistical analysis between voltage and respiratory status of the patient, stay or not in the intensive care unit (ICU), days of stay in the ICU, sedative drugs, pharmacological treatment, type of symptoms predominating, and outcome. Results. We found EEG abnormalities in all patients studied. We observed the amplitude of background <20 V at 93% of acute EEG, versus only 21.4% of follow-up EEG. The average voltage went from 12.33  5.09 V in the acute EEGs to 32.8  20.13 V in the follow-up EEGs. A total of 60% of acute EEGs showed an intermittent focal rhythmic.

Conclusions. Nonspecific diffuse slowing EEG pattern in COVID-19 is the most common finding reported, but we found in addition to that, as a distinctive finding, low voltage EEG, that could explain the low prevalence of epileptic activity published in these patients. A metabolic/hypoxic mechanism seems unlikely on the basis of our EEG findings. This pattern in other etiologies is reminiscent of severe encephalopathy states associated with poor prognosis.

We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 enters the subfornical organ (SFO) through the above routes and the circulating blood since circumventricular organs (CVOs) such as the SFO lack the blood-brain barrier, and infection of the SFO causes dysfunction of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON), leading to hydroelectrolytic disorder. SARS-CoV-2 can readily enter SFO-PVN-SON neurons because these neurons express angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptors and proteolytic viral activators, which likely leads to neurodegeneration or neuroinflammation in these regions. Considering the pivotal role of SFO-PVN-SON circuitry in modulating hydroelectrolyte balance, SARS-CoV-2 infection in these regions could disrupt the neuroendocrine control of hydromineral homeostasis.

To resolve causal variants, meta-analysis studies typically apply summary statistics-based fine-mapping methods as they are applied to single-cohort studies. However, it is unclear whether heterogeneous characteristics of each cohort (e.g., ancestry, sample size, phenotyping, genotyping, or imputation) affect fine-mapping calibration and recall. Here, we first demonstrate that meta-analysis fine-mapping is substantially miscalibrated in simulations when different genotyping arrays or imputation panels are included. To mitigate these issues, we propose a summary statistics-based QC method, SLALOM, that identifies suspicious loci for meta-analysis fine-mapping by detecting outliers in association statistics based on ancestry-matched local LD structure. Having validated SLALOM performance in simulations and the GWAS Catalog, we applied it to 14 disease endpoints from the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative and found that 68% of loci showed suspicious patterns that call into question fine-mapping accuracy. These predicted suspicious loci were significantly depleted for having likely causal variants, such as nonsynonymous variants, as a lead variant (2.8x; Fisher's exact P = 6.2 x 10-4).

OBJECTIVE To get a precise evaluation and to update the association, a meta-analysis on GST (GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1) polymorphism with CAD was performed. Moreover, the combined effect of GSTM1/GSTT1 null genotypes on CAD risk which is not yet studied so far but it has the highest risk of developing diseases. MATERIALS AND METHOD PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were systematically searched for eligible studies. Case-control studies with genotypic frequency, provide data to calculate odds ratio (OR) and in English language were selected. OR with 95% C.I was calculated and random effect model was used. NOS scale was used to asses the qulity of the included studies. RESULTS Meta-analysis indicated that the GSTM1 null genotype and GSTP1 (Ile105Val) polymorphism is significantly associated with CAD risk with a pooled OR-1.38, p=0.01 for GSTM1 and OR-1.19, p=0.04 for GSTP1. Dual null genotype of GSTM1-GSTT1 has highest risk for CAD development (OR-1.59, p=0.003) and there is no significant association for GSTT1 null genotype with CAD. In the subgroup analysis, GSTM1 showed the increased risk for Asians (OR-1.68, p=<0.01) and smokers (OR-1.98, p=<0.01). Publication bias was not observed. CONCLUSION The findings suggests that the GSTM1/GSTP1 polymorphism can be a predictive factor for CAD risk and a larger sample size is required further to confirm the association.","output":"Contribution of Glutathione-S-Transferases Polymorphism and Risk of Coronary Artery Diseases: A Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pada masa pandemi COVID-19 saat ini, pemerintah memberlakukan peraturan yaitu ketika akan masuk ke dalam ruangan (khususnya gedung publik) diharuskan mematuhi protokol kesehatan berupa menggunakan masker dan dilakukan pengukuran suhu tubuh.

Games for adults that require physical activity, known as exergames, offer opportunities here. In particular, the output of the gaming industry nowadays offers computer games with extended reality (XR) which combines real and virtual environments and refers to human-machine interactions generated by computers and wearable technologies. For example, playing the game in front of a computer screen while standing or walking on a force plate or treadmill allows the user to react to certain infrastructural changes and obstacles within the virtual environment. Recent developments, optimization, and minimizations in wearable technology have produced wireless headsets and sensors that allow for unrestricted whole-body movement. This makes the virtual experience more immersive and provides the opportunity for greater engagement than traditional exercise. Currently, XR serves as an umbrella term for current immersive technologies as well as future realities that enhance the experience with features that produce new controllable environments. Overall, these technology-enhanced exergames challenge the adult user and modify the experience by increasing sensory stimulation and creating an environment where virtual and real elements interact. As a therapy, exergames can potentially create new environments and visualizations that may be more ecologically valid and thus simulate real activities of daily living that can be trained. Furthermore, by adding telemedicine features to the exergame, progress over time can be closely monitored and feedback provided, offering future opportunities for cognitive-motor assessment. To more optimally serve and challenge adults both physically and cognitively over time in future lockdowns, there is a need to provide long-term remote training and feedback. Particularly related to activities of daily living that create opportunities for effective and lasting rehabilitation for elderly and sufferers from chronic non-communicable diseases (CNDs).

Even if measures taken in this respect have had significant impacts on reducing the incidence rate of COVID-19, a large number of other problems have arisen. Following this situation, people have been also drawn against many concerns, especially Iranian population with their own previous socioeconomic and cultural problems. Therefore, this nation-wide project aimed to investigate common concerns regarding COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. Methods This qualitative study was conducted in Iran from February to March 2020 via an online open-ended questionnaire. The participants were also selected using convenience and snowball sampling methods. As well, the data collection process continued until data saturation was achieved. In addition, thematic content analysis was utilized to analysis the transcribed texts. Results The statements retrieved also represented the most challenging psychological stress experienced by the participants. Four themes were accordingly recognized based on the content analysis including stressful conditions, health concerns, social and political concerns, and economic concerns. Throughout the study, a major proportion of the participants commented that psychological disorders such as fear, anxiety, stress, and ennui were their main challenges regarding this pandemic. Furthermore, lack of social responsibility, worries about high-risk and susceptible groups, decreased economic power of the public, financial hardships for low-income groups, shortage of healthcare facilities, and adverse effects of disinfectants were expressed as the main concerns. Conclusions As a whole, it is evident that people have confronted with several challenges and need help together with effective policies and strategies during and after this pandemic to reduce their current concerns. The study findings provided a favorable ground to develop and adopt the required policies in Iran and other countries.

However, almost all these studies were conducted in high-income countries. The overall aim of the present study was to explore the effect of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes (UNODC) Treatnet Family (TF) in reducing substance consumption, drug-related activities, reducing mental health problems, and in improving family interaction among adolescents with substance-use problems. METHOD: Nineteen adolescents who had been referred to a community counselling clinic because of substance-use problems and their parents/family members participated in TF. They completed a set of questionnaires to measure substance use, family functioning, mental health problems, and life events at pre-, post-intervention as well as at a one month-follow-up assessment. RESULTS: TF had a positive significant impact in reducing alcohol use among adolescents with substance-use problems. The number of adolescents who smoked cigarettes and marijuana, and used amphetamines reduced across time. After participating in TF, the adolescents were involved with significantly fewer friends who consumed substances and participated in antisocial behaviours. Furthermore, parent/family member reported a significant decrease in mental health problems, and positive changes in adolescents behaviours.

This study aimed to investigate Danish endocrinologists use of thyroid hormones in hypothyroid and euthyroid patients. METHODS: An e-mail with an invitation to participate in an online survey investigating practices about substitution with thyroid hormones was sent to all members of the Danish Endocrine Society (DES). RESULTS: Out of 488 eligible DES members, a total of 152 (31.2%) respondents were included in the analysis. The majority (94.1%) of responding DES members use LT4 as the treatment of choice. Other treatment options for hypothyroidism are also used, as 58.6% prescribe combination therapy with liothyronine (LT3) + LT4 in their clinical practice. LT4 + LT3 combination is preferred in patients with persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism despite biochemical euthyroidism on LT4 treatment. Over half of the respondents answered that thyroid hormone therapy is never indicated for euthyroid patients, but 42.1% will consider it for euthyroid infertile women with high antibody levels. In various conditions that could interfere with the absorption of LT4, most responding Danish endocrinologists prefer tablets and do not expect a significant difference when switching from one type of tablet formulation to another. CONCLUSION: The treatment of choice for hypothyroidism is LT4. Combination therapy with LT4 + LT3 is considered for patients with persistent symptoms.

The TEACHES-Learning Electronic Module (TEACHES-LEM) is an e-learning platform that was developed to teach opticians to perform TEST. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of TEACHES-LEM with face-to-face training (F2FT) in the training and assessment of knowledge among opticians. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned in this experimental study to receive either the intervention group ((TEACHES-LEM, n = 60) or the control group (F2FT, n = 57). The conceptual knowledge of TEST was assessed with a 20-item clinical scenario-based multiple choice question (MCQ) test before and after teaching (immediately post-teaching and 1-month post-teaching). The MCQ test was developed by three ophthalmologists to give face validity. RESULTS: The pre-teaching test scores (TS), indicating prior knowledge, were comparable in both groups (10.02  2.79 versus 10.40  4.17, p = 0.563, independent t test). The mean immediate post teaching score for TEACHES-LEM was 13.3  4.01 versus 12.3  3.29 in the F2FT group (p = 0.170, independent t test). The mean post 1-month teaching score for TEACHES-LEM and F2FT groups were also comparable, 14.5  4.19 versus 13.4  3.90 respectively (p = 0.295, independent t test), indicating non-inferiority of TEACHES to F2FT. CONCLUSION: The TEACHES-LEM e-learning tool is as effective as F2FT in teaching opticians to perform TEST. It is an alternative to face-to-face teaching in delivering knowledge and assessment.

The secondary objectives of the presented study are to evaluate different outcomes of the rehabilitation program in comparison to standard of care regarding: functional performance at 4-week and 12-week post- discharge mark; health-related quality of life, the impact on the health services (namely days of hospitalization), the cost-effectiveness of the intervention proposed. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, double-arm clinical trial of treatment, with an allocation ratio 1:1 and framework of superiority. PARTICIPANTS: The study will be conducted at Centro Hospitalar Entre Douro e Vouga, Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal. Potential participants will be adult patients (&#8805;18 years old) hospitalized in ICU with respiratory insufficiency due to COVID-19, who are referred to respiratory and functional rehabilitation. Only patients approved by physical rehabilitation doctors to perform respiratory and functional rehabilitation will be considered potential participants. To be eligible for inclusion participants must have been independent in their activities of daily living before the onset of critical illness (verbal statement by their proxy) and have to meet the safety criteria defined by the Portuguese Society of Physical Rehabilitation Medicine. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Both groups will receive usual medical and nursing care in the ICU, which involves assessment and treatment of the respiratory system and may include positioning, hyperinflation techniques and suctioning. The physical function of the patient is assessed, and active bed exercises and mobility are encouraged as soon as possible and may include sitting out of bed. The intervention group will receive a functional and respiratory multidisciplinary rehabilitation protocol (that includes medical, nursing, physiotherapy and occupational therapy interventions) during their entire hospital stay. After reassurance that the patients fulfil the safety criteria, they will initiate the rehabilitation protocol, individualized to each patient based on the clinical status. The rehabilitation interventions and exercises implemented will be consistent with recommendations from the Portuguese Society of Physical Rehabilitation Medicine. The intervention will occur 6 days per week (Monday to Saturday), fifteen minutes, twice per day for each participant. Throughout all activities, progression will be increased successively, depending on the individual's tolerance and stability. After discharge, the intervention group will continue with rehabilitation exercises, prescribed by physical rehabilitation doctors. These exercises are designed for the patient to do at home, and then report their execution to rehabilitation nurses through teleconsultation, until 12 weeks after ICU discharge. MAIN OUTCOMES: Baseline descriptive data collection will include age, sex, comorbidities and date of admission to ICU. The need of mechanical ventilation and length of use, as well as the need for oxygen therapy, length of ICU stay (days/hours), incidence of ICU readmission, discharge destination and survival will also be recorded. Prior to intervention, every two days and at discharge, participants will be evaluated using the following scales: Glasgow Coma Scale, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment, 5 standardized questions for cooperation, Medical Research Council Sum-Score, Handgrip strength test and Medical Research Council dyspnea scale. At discharge, Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion will be evaluated. The primary outcome measure will be functional capacity using the 6-Minute Walk Test, and it will be measured at discharge and at the 4-week and 12-week mark. Medical Research Council Sum-Score, Handgrip strength test, Medical Research Council dyspnea scale and Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion will also be re-evaluated at the 4-week and 12-week mark. The health related quality of life will also be used as an outcome measure, using the 12-Item Short Form Survey, at 12 weeks of follow-up. RANDOMISATION: Participants will be divided into two groups, standard care and intervention, by means of balanced randomization at a 1:1 ratio using blocks of 10 participants. The randomization sequence is going to be created using a free software ( http://www.randomized.org/ ). In order to ensure the confidentiality of the randomisation sequence, this process will be conducted by an assessor external to the study. BLINDING (MASKING): The evaluators in the study will be blinded during the entire process. The evaluators will be unaware of the study objectives and the randomized distribution of patients to study groups and will not have access to the randomization sequence. Although blinding for patients will not be possible to achieve completely, subjects will be unaware of other treatment modalities, and they will not know if they belong to the intervention or standard group. As for the treating physiotherapists and ICU staff, blinding will not be possible to achieve, but they will not be responsible for assessing outcomes. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): We plan to randomise 40 participants to each group. 80 participants in total.

However, there is a lag of several months in the reporting of vital statistics mortality data for many jurisdictions, including across Canada. In Ontario, a Canadian province, certification by a coroner is required before cremation can occur, creating real-time mortality data that encompasses the majority of deaths within the province. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to validate the use of cremation data as a timely surveillance tool for all-cause mortality during a public health emergency in a jurisdiction with delays in vital statistics data. Specifically, this study aimed to validate this surveillance tool by determining the stability, timeliness, and robustness of its real-time estimation of all-cause mortality. METHODS: Cremation records from January 2020 until April 2021 were compared to the historical records from 2017 to 2019, grouped according to week, age, sex, and whether COVID-19 was the cause of death. Cremation data were compared to Ontarios provisional vital statistics mortality data released by Statistics Canada. The 2020 and 2021 records were then compared to previous years (2017-2019) to determine whether there was excess mortality within various age groups and whether deaths attributed to COVID-19 accounted for the entirety of the excess mortality. RESULTS: Between 2017 and 2019, cremations were performed for 67.4% (95% CI 67.3%-67.5%) of deaths. The proportion of cremated deaths remained stable throughout 2020, even within age and sex categories. Cremation records are 99% complete within 3 weeks of the date of death, which precedes the compilation of vital statistics data by several months. Consequently, during the first wave (from April to June 2020), cremation records detected a 16.9% increase (95% CI 14.6%-19.3%) in all-cause mortality, a finding that was confirmed several months later with cremation data. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of Ontarians cremated and the completion of cremation data several months before vital statistics did not change meaningfully during the COVID-19 pandemic period, establishing that the pandemic did not significantly alter cremation practices. Cremation data can be used to accurately estimate all-cause mortality in near real-time, particularly when real-time mortality estimates are needed to inform policy decisions for public health measures. The accuracy of this excess mortality estimation was confirmed by comparing it with official vital statistics data. These findings demonstrate the utility of cremation data as a complementary data source for timely mortality information during public health emergencies.","output":"The Use of Cremation Data for Timely Mortality Surveillance During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ontario, Canada: Validation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following publication of the original article [1], two errors were found in the article: In the Conclusion section of the Abstract, the sentence \\"early case identification and prompt medical care\\" need to be deleted, the whole sentence should be: Our study showed the risk factors for developing severe COVID-19 with large sample size, which included being male, older age, fever, cough, fatigue, delayed diagnosis, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease.

CONTENT COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 disease a pandemic principally contaminating the respiratory tract and bringing about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome is liable for significant mortality around the world. Far-fetched, there is no exact treatment accessible till today. Consequently, it is critical to discover the alternative methodology which can decrease the weight of illness. Trikatu powder recommended by authorities for the management of mild cases of COVID-19 is a conventional ayurvedic formulation containing three spices; Zingiber officinale, Piper nigrum, and Piper longum. A comprehensive search of the articles published since inception to 01/08/2020 on Trikatu was carried out. Major electronic medical databases such as Pub Med/MEDLINE and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were used for the literature search. SUMMARY A total of 21 records were identified by electronic searches between since inception to 01/08/2020 of which 13 records were included for review. The reviewed articles highlight Trikatu as a safe, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulatory property by suppression of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-17, alteration in levels of circulating immune complexes, anti-dyslipidaemia agent by reduced triglycerides and LDL cholesterol and increased HDL cholesterol, enhancing bio-availability of co-drug by reducing the elimination half-life (t1/2) and zero time intercept of the elimination phase.

The virus contains five major protein classes viz., four structural proteins [nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelop (E) and spike glycoprotein (S)] and replicase polyproteins (R), synthesized as two polyproteins (ORF1a and ORF1ab). Due to the severity of the pandemic, most of the SARS-CoV-2-related research are focused on finding therapeutic solutions. However, studies on the sequences and structure space throughout the evolutionary time frame of viral proteins are limited. Besides, the structural malleability of viral proteins can be directly or indirectly associated with the dysfunctionality of the host cell proteins. This dysfunctionality may lead to comorbidities during the infection and may continue at the post-infection stage. In this regard, we conduct the evolutionary sequence-structure analysis of the viral proteins to evaluate their malleability. Subsequently, intrinsic disorder propensities of these viral proteins have been studied to confirm that the short intrinsically disordered regions play an important role in enhancing the likelihood of the host proteins interacting with the viral proteins. These interactions may result in molecular dysfunctionality, finally leading to different diseases. Based on the host cell proteins, the diseases are divided in two distinct classes: (i) proteins, directly associated with the set of diseases while showing similar activities, and (ii) cytokine storm-mediated pro-inflammation (e.g. acute respiratory distress syndrome, malignancies) and neuroinflammation (e.g. neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases).

This study illustrates strategies used when the ophthalmic artery is difficult to catheterize or not visible, and it ascertains the effectiveness and safety of these strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study was performed on a series of 108 eyes affected by intraocular retinoblastoma and selected for intra-arterial chemotherapy (follow-up range, 6-82 months). We recognized 3 different patterns of drug delivery: a fixed pattern through the ophthalmic artery, a fixed pattern through branches of the external carotid artery, and a variable pattern through either the ophthalmic or the external carotid artery. RESULTS We performed 448 sessions of intra-arterial chemotherapy, 83.70% of them through the ophthalmic artery and 16.29% via the external carotid artery. In 24.52% of eyes, the procedure was performed at least once through branches of the external carotid artery. In 73 eyes, the pattern of drug delivery was fixed through the ophthalmic artery; for 9 eyes, it was fixed through branches of the external carotid artery; and for 17 eyes, the pattern was variable. Statistical analysis did not show any significant difference in the clinical outcome of the eyes (remission versus enucleation) treated with different patterns of drug delivery. Adverse events could not be correlated with any particular pattern. CONCLUSIONS Alternative routes of intra-arterial chemotherapy for intraocular retinoblastoma appear in the short term as effective and safe as the traditional drug infusion through the ophthalmic artery.","output":"Hemodynamic and Anatomic Variations Require an Adaptable Approach during Intra-Arterial Chemotherapy for Intraocular Retinoblastoma: Alternative Routes, Strategies, and Follow-Up."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Physical activity has been shown to be fundamental in the prevention of numerous diseases and disorders. Achieving and maintaining physical activity levels can be particularly challenging in those with impairments, such as those experiencing a lower limb amputation. To slow the spread of the virus, COVID-19 lockdown mandates imposed by the US state governments may have inadvertent consequences on physical activity levels of those dependent on specific forms of exercise. Understanding how physical activity levels may have affected persons with limb loss can inform intervention strategies for this vulnerable population. OBJECTIVES: Examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity levels in persons with limb loss. STUDY DESIGN: Mixed-method design. METHODS: A 20-item logic web-based survey and semistructured interviews were administered to individuals who were 18 years or older, spoke English, and had a history of lower limb loss. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS v25, whereas qualitative data were analyzed using constant comparison to formulate themes. RESULTS: There were a significant effect on the amount of physical activity minutes performed per day, a negative effect on the ability to exercise and participate in societal engagements, and a series of barriers to performing physical activity because of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Physical activity was reduced significantly in persons with limb loss during the COVID-19 pandemic.

For COPD, the benefit appears to be limited to individuals with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels <25 nmol/L. We performed a post hoc analysis of data from a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the effect that monthly, high-dose vitamin D supplementation (versus placebo) had on older adults with asthma and/or COPD. Specifically, we investigated whether vitamin D supplementation prevented exacerbations of these conditions. Participants were randomly assigned either to an initial oral dose of 200,000 IU vitamin D3 followed by 100,000 IU monthly or to placebo, with an average follow-up period of 3.3 years. Among the 5110 participants, 775 had asthma or COPD at the beginning of the study, and were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Exacerbations were defined by the prescription of a short-burst of oral corticosteroids. The mean age of the participants was 67 years old, and 56% were male. The mean baseline blood 25OHD level was 63 nmol/L; 2.3% were <25 nmol/L. Overall, we found that vitamin D supplementation did not affect the exacerbation risk (hazard ratio 1.08; 95%CI 0.84C1.39).

When examining the predominant diseases of the twenty first century landscape, widening health disparities, and significant changes in the United States healthcare system, it is imperative to view wellness and sickness in a broader public health context rather than a singular focus of the biomedical model. While undergraduate opportunities to study public health are on the rise in the United States, there is a parallel urgency for medical curricula to recognize the importance of the complex interrelated socio-ecological root causes of health, well-being, and illness. In order to reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases and increase health equity, it is necessary for medical education to integrate core public health knowledge and competencies. Contemporary health challenges require a public health approach, in addition to clinical skills, for physicians to provide equitable care. The COVID-19 pandemic further underscores the necessity to mitigate the effects of socio-ecological determinants of health. Seven key recommendations are presented from a training to practice timeline emphasizing the important linkages between medical education, socio-ecological influences on health, and public health.

METHODS: We investigated the prevalence and genetic characteristics of colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae (COLR-KP) in clinical isolates using genomic sequencing. RESULTS: In total, 53 K. pneumoniae isolates (4.5%, 53/1,171) were confirmed as COLR-KP, of which eight isolates carried mobile colistin-resistant (mcr) gene. Although the overall prevalence rate (0.7%, 8/1,171) of mcr-like genes in clinical K. pneumoniae remained relatively low, the presence of mcr (15.1%, 8/53) among the COLR-KP isolates indicated that the mobile resistance gene was already widespread among K. pneumoniae isolates in hospital setting. We randomly selected 13 COLR-KP isolates (four mcr-bearing and nine non-mcr-bearing isolates) for whole-genome sequencing, including two pandrug-resistant and four sequence type 11 (ST11) isolates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all COLR-KP isolates were genetically diverse. Among the four mcr-bearing isolates, three (KP4, KP18, and KP30) were positive for mcr-1 and one (KP23) for mcr-8; none of the other mcr genes were detected. The mcr-1 in the KP4 and KP30 isolates were located in an IncX4 plasmid (approximately 33 kb) and could be successfully transferred to Escherichia coli J53AZ(R). In contrast, for the mcr-8-bearing plasmid in KP23 (IncFII), colistin resistance could not be transferred by conjugation. The mcr-1-producing isolate KP18 coexists a novel plasmid-carried tigecycline resistance gene tmexCD1-toprJ1. The most common chromosomal mutation associated with colistin resistance was a T246A amino acid substitution in PmrB, which was identified in most COLR-KP isolates (11/13, 84.6%). All ST11 isolates additionally had an R256G amino acid substitution. Critical virulence factors associated with hypervirulent K. pneumoniae were detected in four COLR-KP isolates; these virulence factors included aerobactin, salmochelin, and yersiniabactin. CONCLUSION: We found that mcr-bearing COLR-KP emerged in our hospital and was growing at an increasing rate.

This is because: (1) ruptured bAVMs have not been considered as catastrophic as ruptured cerebral aneurysms, (2) surgical resection is aided by waiting for brain edema to resolve and clot to liquefy and (3) fear exists that partially treated bAVMs may be more dangerous than those untreated. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and safety of acute embolization in patients with ruptured bAVMs. METHODS 21 consecutive patients who underwent acute embolization of ruptured bAVMs from 2007 to 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. All treatments consisted of embolization exclusively using Onyx liquid embolic agent. Neurological outcomes were assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at hospital discharge following initial treatment. RESULTS Nine patients (43%) were male, mean age was 38 years (range 8-75) and initial embolization was performed at a median of 4 days after ictus (mean 5.8, range 0-19). Spetzler-Martin grades ranged from I to VI (mean 3, median 3). In seven patients (33%) the AVM was completely occluded with a single treatment. With subsequent embolizations, complete occlusion occurred in four additional patients (19%). Six patients (29%) had post-embolization AVM resection and one patient (5%) had post-embolization gamma knife irradiation. None has suffered subsequent hemorrhages (mean follow-up 7.5 months). The mean discharge GOS of all patients was 4.4 (range 1-5).

This phenomenon of ripple effect, immensely existing in practice, has received great interest in recent years. Moreover, forward and backward disruption propagations became major stressors for SCNs during the COVID-19 pandemic triggered by simultaneous and sequential supply and demand disruptions. However, current literature has paid less attention to the different impacts of the directions of disruption propagation. This study examines the disruption propagation through simulating simple interaction rules of firms inside the SCN. Specifically, an agent-based computational model is developed to delineate the supply chain disruption propagation behavior. Then, we conduct multi-level quantitative analysis to explore the effects of forward and backward disruption propagation, moderated by network structure, network-level health and node-level vulnerability. Our results demonstrate that it is practically important to differentiate between forward and backward disruption propagation, as they are distinctive in the associated mitigation strategies and in the effects on network and individual firm performance. Forward disruption propagation generally can be mitigated by substitute and backup supply and has greater impact on firms serving the assembly role and on the supply/assembly networks, whereas backward disruption propagation is normally mitigated by flexible operation and distribution and has bigger impact on firms serving the distribution role and on distribution networks. We further analyze the investment strategies in a dual-focal supply network under disruption propagation.

Direct acting antivirals eliminate HCV, unless it is drug resistant, and partially reverse liver disease, but they cannot cure HCV-related cancer. A possible remedy could be a multi-component immunotherapeutic vaccine targeting both HCV-infected and malignant cells, but also those not infected with HCV. To meet this need we developed a two-component DNA vaccine based on the highly conserved core protein of HCV to target HCV-infected cells, and a renowned tumor-associated antigen telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) based on the rat TERT, to target malignant cells. Their synthetic genes were expression-optimized, and HCV core was truncated after aa 152 (Core152opt) to delete the domain interfering with immunogenicity. Core152opt and TERT DNA were highly immunogenic in BALB/c mice, inducing IFN-/IL-2/TNF- response of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Additionally, DNA-immunization with TERT enhanced cellular immune response against luciferase encoded by a co-delivered plasmid (Luc DNA). However, DNA-immunization with Core152opt and TERT mix resulted in abrogation of immune response against both components. A loss of bioluminescence signal after co-delivery of TERT and Luc DNA into mice indicated that TERT affects the in vivo expression of luciferase directed by the immediate early cytomegalovirus and interferon- promoters. Panel of mutant TERT variants was created and tested for their expression effects. TERT with deleted N-terminal nucleoli localization signal and mutations abrogating telomerase activity still suppressed the IFN- driven Luc expression, while the inactivated reverse transcriptase domain of TERT and its analogue, enzymatically active HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, exerted only weak suppressive effects, implying that suppression relied on the presence of the full-length/nearly full-length TERT, but not its enzymatic activity. The effect(s) could be due to interference of the ectopically expressed xenogeneic rat TERT with biogenesis of mRNA, ribosomes and protein translation in murine cells, affecting the expression of immunogens. HCV core can aggravate this effect, leading to early apoptosis of co-expressing cells, preventing the induction of immune response.","output":"Reciprocal Inhibition of Immunogenic Performance in Mice of Two Potent DNA Immunogens Targeting HCV-Related Liver Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Apart from the issues surrounding COVID-19 itself, care for existing patients has met many challenges. One such challenge is caring for patients who are on clozapine treatment and have been confirmed positive for COVID-19. Schizophrenia has been considered to have a deep connection with the immune system, and clozapine can induce further changes in this system. COVID-19 can ravage the compromised immune system and aggravate tissue damage. The intricate relations between schizophrenia, clozapine, and COVID-19 make it difficult to predict the clinical course of COVID-19 in clozapine-treated patients. However, the rigid prohibition on using clozapine if COVID-19 is confirmed may harm patients. Patients who have to use clozapine are often refractory cases with no alternatives. Therefore, the decision to maintain or stop clozapine must be made after a comprehensive review of the patients unique situation. To do this, theoretical and practical issues surrounding the use of clozapine in COVID-19 should be reviewed and discussed. In this review, we gather useful information surrounding this issue and present an overview. Focusing on the immune system, various theoretical possibilities that could arise from schizophrenia, clozapine, and COVID-19 were carefully examined, and practical checklists for the care of these patients were explored.

Parastomal hernia was defined radiologically by a CT scan performed after 12 months of surgery. The usefulness of subcutaneous fat thickness measured by CT to discriminate patients at risk of parastomal hernia was assessed by ROC curve analysis. RESULTS Thirty-six patients were randomized, 19 to the mesh group and 17 to the control group. Parastomal hernia was detected in 50 % of patients in the mesh group and in 93.8 % of patients in the control group (P = 0.008). The AUC for thickness of the subcutaneous abdominal was 0.819 (P = 0.004) and the optimal threshold 23 mm. Subcutaneous fat thickness 23 mm was a significant predictor of parastomal hernia (odds ratio 15.7, P = 0.010), whereas insertion of a mesh was a protective factor (odds ratio 0.06, P = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS Use of prophylactic large-pore lightweight mesh in the intraperitoneal/onlay position by a purely laparoscopic approach reduced the incidence of parastomal hernia formation. Subcutaneous fat thickness 23 mm measured by CT was an independent predictor of parastomal hernia.","output":"Use of a prosthetic mesh to prevent parastomal hernia during laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection: a randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Additive manufacturing, enabling rapid prototyping and so\\\\called on\\\\demand production, has become a common method of creating parts or whole devices.

Regulators of G-protein signaling (RGSs) are the key controllers of G-protein signaling pathways. GPCRs, G-proteins, and RGSs are the primary upstream components of the G-protein signaling pathway, and they are highly conserved in most filamentous fungi, playing diverse roles in biological processes. Recent studies characterized the G-protein signaling components in the opportunistic pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus.

The synthetic analogue poly I:C is frequently used to mimic anti-viral innate immune responses in models of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders including schizophrenia, autism, Parkinsons disease and Alzheimers disease. Many studies perform limited analysis of innate immunity despite these responses potentially differing as a function of dsRNA molecular weight and age. Therefore fundamental questions relevant to impacts of systemic viral infection on brain function and integrity remain. Here, we studied innate immune-inducing properties of poly I:C preparations of different lengths and responses in adult and aged mice. High molecular weight (HMW) poly I:C (1C6 kb, 12 mg/kg) produced more robust sickness behavior and more robust IL-6, IFN-I and TNF- responses than poly I:C of < 500 bases (low MW) preparations. This was partly overcome with higher doses of LMW (up to 80 mg/kg), but neither circulating IFN nor brain transcription of Irf7 were significantly induced by LMW poly I:C, despite brain Ifnb transcription, suggesting that brain IFN-dependent gene expression is predominantly triggered by circulating IFN binding of IFNAR1. In aged animals, poly I:C induced exaggerated IL-6, IL-1 and IFN-I in the plasma and similar exaggerated brain cytokine responses. This was associated with acute working memory deficits selectively in aged mice. Thus, we demonstrate dsRNA length-, IFNAR1- and age-dependent effects on anti-viral inflammation and cognitive function. The data have implications for CNS symptoms of acute systemic viral infection such as those with SARS-CoV-2 and for models of maternal immune activation.","output":"Double stranded RNA drives anti-viral innate immune responses, sickness behavior and cognitive dysfunction dependent on dsRNA length, IFNAR1 expression and age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The revascularization of carotid stenosis can increase ipsilateral cerebral blood flow (CBF). Occasionally, elevated CBF is also evident on the contralateral side, but this phenomenon is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE To analyze retrospectively the relationship between a contralateral CBF increase and several clinical and radiologic features. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 40 patients with unilateral cervical carotid stenosis treated by carotid artery stenting (CAS). Using 123I-iodamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT); we compared pre- and postoperative hemispheric CBF on both sides. We investigated the influence of the following five factors on the increase of the contralateral hemispheric CBF: stenosis grade (50% or <50%, according to the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria); age; the presence of anterior and posterior communicating arteries; postoperative hyperperfusion on the stenotic side; and the presence of cerebral steal phenomenon during preoperative acetazolamide-challenge SPECT. RESULTS Following unilateral CAS, mean hemispheric CBF increased significantly on both sides: from 33.45.6 (mean  SD) to 38.77.8 mL/min on the operated side (paired t test, p<0.001) and f35.45.4 to 39.27.2 mL/min on the contralateral side (p<0.001). In a general linear model, stenosis grade (50%) alone was significantly correlated with the increase of the CBF on the contralateral side (p=0.03).

Among all open reading frames (orfs) of this virus, the orf3a is the largest, and encodes a protein of 274 amino acids, named as 3a protein. Sequence analysis suggests that the orf3a aligned to one calcium pump present in Plasmodium falciparum and the enzyme glutamine synthetase found in Leptospira interrogans. This sequence similarity was found to be limited only to amino acid residues 209C264 which form the cytoplasmic domain of the orf3a. Furthermore, this region was predicted to be involved in the calcium binding. Owing to this hypothesis, we were driven to establish its calcium binding property in vitro. Here, we expressed and purified the cytoplasmic domain of the 3a protein, called Cyto3a, as a recombinant His-tagged protein in the E. coli. The calcium binding nature was established by performing various staining methods such as ruthenium red and stains-all. (45)Ca overlay method was also done to further support the data. Since the 3a protein forms ion channels, we were interested to see any conformational changes occurring in the Cyot3a upon calcium binding, using fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism. These studies clearly indicate a significant change in the conformation of the Cyto3a protein after binding with calcium.

There is hence an urgent need to educate healthcare undergraduates early in their professional careers on the importance of and complexities involved in cooperating with counterparts from other allied healthcare professions. In conjunction with this, a milestone student-led conference for undergraduate students, the 9th Student Medical-Nursing Education Conference (SMEC), was organised in 2013 to provide a unique opportunity for shared learning among the entire cohort of undergraduate medical and nursing students in Singapore matriculating in that year. METHODS: This study evaluated the effectiveness of the 9th SMEC 2013 as a shared conference experience in improving the attitudes of undergraduate medical and nursing students in Singapore towards inter-professional education (IPE). A 19-point Readiness for Inter-Professional Learning Scale (RIPLS) questionnaire comprising three subscales was administered to participants both before and after the conference. 352 responses were collected, giving a response rate of 75.1 %. Results were analysed using paired-samples t-tests with statistical significance set at p = 0.05. RESULTS: Improvements in overall scores for both medical and nursing students were reported for all three RIPLS subscales. Examining the RIPLS items individually, significant improvement in scores for both medical and nursing students was obtained in all 19 items. Prior exposure to IPE activities was not a predictor of improvement in IPE attitudes. CONCLUSION: The authors propose that student-led jointly-organised conference experiences are effective in improving healthcare students attitudes towards IPE. This study provides valuable insights to facilitate the development of further IPE programs to allow for the rapid and effective promotion of cooperation and collaboration between students across various healthcare disciplines.","output":"The effectiveness of a shared conference experience in improving undergraduate medical and nursing students attitudes towards inter-professional education in an Asian country: a before and after study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical Information Patient Initials or Identifier Number: SY Relevant Clinical History and Physical Exam: ? 65Years old Male ?

Chest-CT is an essential diagnostic and prognostic tool to evaluate the disease, and findings of Covid-19 pneumonia are well established. However, vascular abnormalities have been reported in a vast majority of patients, such as irregularities and enlargement of the distal pulmonary vessels, and they are not yet well-known or recognised by most radiologists. Recent findings : Histological studies have shown vascular mural infiltration and multiple abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature. These can be correlated to the chest-CT findings, and may raise the diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia when there is a biological doubt or progression of ground-glass opacities of unknown origin. They suggest that the alveolo-interstitial lesions, which are not associated with bronchial abnormalities, could be secondary to the vascular damages. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the prognostic value of the extent of pulmonary vascular abnormalities on chest-CT.

A recent study finds the same obesity paradox with the number of healthcare visits. Whether empirical biases and confounding lead to this paradox is yet to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in the relationship between BMI and number of visits in diabetic vs nondiabetic populations, controlling for confounding risk factors. METHODS: Using adults in the nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) from 2008 to 2016, N = 210,317, we examine the proposed relationship using six measures of healthcare visits with zero-inflated negative binomial regressions controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, education, region, health insurance, chronic conditions, and smoking. We excluded persons with type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes. RESULTS: We find an obesity paradox among people with diabetes for three measures. That is, relative to people without diabetes, normal weight people with diabetes have more emergency room visits, inpatient, and office-based physician visits than do the obese with diabetes. However, we do not find an obesity paradox in any of the six measures once we exclude smokers and persons ever diagnosed with cancer or cardiovascular disease.

An intriguing new development is the virtual physician, which can diagnose and treat patients independently. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This qualitative study of advanced degree students aimed to assess their perceptions of using a virtual primary care physician as a patient. Four focus groups were held: first year medical students, fourth year medical students, first year engineering/data science graduate students, and fourth year engineering/data science graduate students. The focus groups were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and content analyses of the transcripts was performed using a data-driven inductive approach. Themes identified concerned advantages, disadvantages, and the future of virtual primary care physicians. Within those main categories, 13 themes emerged and 31 sub-themes. DISCUSSION: While participants appreciated that a virtual primary care physician would be convenient, efficient, and cost-effective, they also expressed concern about data privacy and the potential for misdiagnosis. To garner trust from its potential users, future virtual primary physicians should be programmed with a sufficient amount of trustworthy data and have a high level of transparency and accountability for patients.","output":"Perceptions of virtual primary care physicians: A focus group study of medical and data science graduate students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has swept the whole world since 2019. Chest computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in clinical diagnosis, management and progression monitoring of COVID-19 patients. In order to decrease the cost of manual segmentation, weakly supervised segmentation methods, such as class activation maps (CAM) based methods, have been applied to achieve COVID-19-related lesion segmentation. Such methods could be used to localize the lesion preliminarily, but it is not precise enough to segment the lesion. In this paper, we propose a double weakly supervised segmentation method to achieve the segmentation of COVID-19 lesions on CT scans. A self-supervised equivalent attention mechanism with neighborhood affinity module is proposed for accurate segmentation. Multi-instance learning is adopted for training using annotations weaker than image-level. A simple pre-training process is also proved to be effective.

In the present study, in-silico approach of drug development was used to search for potential antiviral plant-derived compounds as inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 replication proteins. Eight plant-derived compounds of which the antiviral activity was known and available, and two reported drugs against SARS-CoV-2 selected for the molecular docking analysis. The docking results suggested that bisdemethoxycurcumin, demethoxycurcumin, scutellarin, quercetin and myricetin showed least binding energy, i.e., greater than -6.5 Kcal/mol against 3CLpro and endoribonuclease of SARS-CoV-2. Further studies of ADME-Tox and bioavailability of drugs were also performed that exhibited efficient parameters of drug likeness. Molecular dynamics simulation calculations were performed for the most negative binding affinity of the compound to evaluate the dynamic behavior,and stability of protein-ligand complex. Our findings suggest that these compounds could be potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease and endoribonuclease.

Malta is a small Mediterranean country with a population of circa half a million with free healthcare at point-of-care. This paper reviews the adaptations made to cope with mass vaccination. METHODS Permission was obtained to tour hospital facilities. Photographs were taken with and edited on a mobile phone, a previously utilised methodology. RESULTS Vaccination commenced on 27/12/20 with priorities as above. Malta Medical School lecture halls were initially used, followed by outpatients at the country's regional hospital, as well as other lecture halls, and National Health Service clinics. Virtually all medically vulnerable individuals have had their first doses as well as most individuals 60 years of age, with the 55-60 year age group currently targeted. Malta is well ahead of the European Union average. DISCUSSION Exacting logistics and cooperation by all local authorities (such as the University of Malta) has resulted in a highly successful vaccine rollout.

On Jan 23, 2020, the Chinese government instituted mitigation strategies to control spread. Most modeling studies have focused on projecting epidemiological outcomes throughout the pandemic. However, the impact and optimal timing of different mitigation approaches have not been well-studied. METHODS: We developed a mathematical model reflecting SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in an age-stratified population. The model simulates health and economic outcomes from Dec 1, 2019 through Mar 31, 2020 for cities including Wuhan, Chongqing, Beijing, and Shanghai in China. We considered differences in timing and duration of three mitigation strategies in the early phase of the epidemic: city-wide quarantine on Wuhan, travel history screening and isolation of travelers from Wuhan to other Chinese cities, and general social distancing. RESULTS: Our model estimated that implementing all three mitigation strategies one week earlier would have averted 35% of deaths in Wuhan (50% in other cities) with a 7% increase in economic impacts (16-18% in other cities). One weeks delay in mitigation strategy initiation was estimated to decrease economic cost by the same amount, but with 35% more deaths in Wuhan and more than 80% more deaths in the other cities. Of the three mitigation approaches, infections and deaths increased most rapidly if initiation of social distancing was delayed. Furthermore, social distancing of working-age adults was most critical to reducing COVID-19 outcomes versus social distancing among children and/or the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: Optimizing the timing of epidemic mitigation strategies is paramount and involves weighing trade-offs between preventing infections and deaths and incurring immense economic impacts. City-wide quarantine was not as effective as city-wide social distancing due to its much higher daily cost than social distancing. Under typical economic evaluation standards, the optimal timing for the full set of control measures would have been much later than Jan 23, 2020 (status quo).

These systems are prone to replay attacks and eavesdropping. During the Coronavirus pandemic, most of the important transactions take place online. Hence we require a more secure method like one-time password generation to avoid any online frauds. one-time password generation has multiple techniques. With one-time password generation it has become possible to overcome the drawbacks posed by the traditional username and password systems. The one-time password is a two-way authentication technique and hence secure one-time password generation is very important. The current method of one-time password generation is time-consuming and consumes a lot of memory on backend servers. The 4-digit one-time password system limits its uses to 9999 users and with advance deep learning approaches and faster computing it is possible to break through the existing one-time password generation method. Hence we need a system that is not vulnerable to predictive learning algorithms. We propose a 6-digit one-time password generation technique based on a B-exponential chaotic map. The proposed 24-bit (6-digit) long one-time password system offers 120 times higher security as compared traditional 4-digit systems, with a faster backend computing system that selects 24-bits out of 10 8 bits in 89 seconds at 1.09 Kilo-bits per milliseconds.

A major hindrance in making apt decisions by health control systems is the fact that protocols tested in other epidemics are no guarantee of success to control the COVID-19 epidemic, given its singular nature and complexity. The occurrence of two or more waves of infections all over the world poses an even greater challenge. An effective way to assist health authorities in adopting public policies to face the COVID-19 pandemic depends on smart analytics and visualization. Purpose: We present the software Modinterv as a tool to monitor, in an automated and user-friendly manner, the evolution and trend of COVID-19 epidemic curves, both for cases and deaths. Methods: The Modinterv software uses parametric generalized growth models, together with machine learning algorithms, to fit epidemic curves with one or two waves of infec- tions of cases and deaths for countries around the world as well as for states and cities in Brazil and the USA. The richness of the implemented models lies in the possibility of detecting the distinct acceleration regimes of the disease in places where there are one or two waves of infections. Results: We show how growth models can be combined with machine learning algorithms in an automated software that can identify the current stage of the COVID-19 epidemic curve in the selected place.

Herein, we aimed to evaluate prognostic factors and clinical scores for confirmed COVID-19 patients in a tertiary-care hospital in the Bursa region of Turkey. METHODOLOGY Patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 microbiologically and/or radiologically between March and October 2020 in a tertiary-care university hospital were enrolled retrospectively. Adult patients ( 18 years) with a clinical spectrum of moderate, severe, or critical illness were included. The dependent variable was 30-day mortality and logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate any variables with a significant p value (< 0.05) in univariate analysis. RESULTS A total of 257 patients were included in the study. The mortality rate (30-day) was 14.4%. In logistic regression analysis, higher scores on sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) (p < 0.001, odds ratio (OR) = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.42-2.45) and CURB-65 pneumonia severity criteria (p = 0.001, OR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.47-4.57) were found to be significant in predicting mortality at admission.

Plants are sessile organisms that can be exposed to environmental stress. Plants alter their cellular processes to survive under potentially unfavorable conditions. Protein ubiquitination is an important post-translational modification that has a crucial role in various cellular signaling processes in abiotic stress response. In this study, we characterized Oryza sativa salt-induced RING finger protein 4, OsSIRP4, a membrane and cytosol-localized RING E3 ligase in rice. OsSIRP4 transcripts were highly induced under salt stress in rice. We found that OsSIRP4 possesses E3 ligase activity; however, no E3 ligase activity was observed with a single amino acid substitution (OsSIRP4C269A). The results of the yeast two hybrid system, in vitro pull-down assay, BiFC analysis, in vitro ubiquitination assay, and in vitro degradation assay indicate that OsSIRP4 regulates degradation of a substrate protein, OsPEX11-1 (Oryza sativa peroxisomal biogenesis factor 11-1) via the 26S proteasomal system. Phenotypic analysis of OsSIRP4-overexpressing plants demonstrated hypersensitivity to salt response compared to that of the wild type and mutated OsSIRP4C269A plants. In addition, OsSIRP4-overexpressing plants exhibited significant low enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase, and accumulation of proline and soluble sugar, but a high level of H2O2. Furthermore, qRT data on transgenic plants suggest that OsSIRP4 acted as a negative regulator of salt response by diminishing the expression of genes related to Na+/K+ homeostasis (AtSOS1, AtAKT1, AtNHX1, and AtHKT1;1) in transgenic plants under salt stress. These results suggest that OsSIRP4 plays a negative regulatory role in response to salt stress by modulating the target protein levels.","output":"E3 ligase, the Oryza sativa salt-induced RING finger protein 4 (OsSIRP4), negatively regulates salt stress responses via degradation of the OsPEX11-1 protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article analyses the features of the application of the current criminal procedural legislation in practice in the context of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) after recognizing it as a disease that poses a danger to others, the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation of April 08, 2020 and Reviews on certain issues of judicial practice related to the application of legislation and measures to counter the spread of the new coronavirus infection in the Russian Federation of April 21, 2020 and April 30, 2020.

Size-resolved percent penetration of each material by particles with diameters ranging from 25 to 500 nm was measured at three face velocities (0.72 cm s(-1), 4.30 cm s(-1), 13.0 cm s(-1)). The allergen filter performed best, only allowing the penetration of 5% +/- 3% of the 300 nm particles through the material at a face velocity of 13.0 cm s(-1), comparable to human breathing during heavy physical work. In comparison, the surgical mask and the cotton bandana allowed 39 +/- 1% and 51% +/- 1% of the 300 nm particles to pass through at the same face velocity, respectively.

A PHEIC is defined as an extraordinary event that constitutes a public health risk to other states through international spread and requires a coordinated international response. The WHO Director-General convenes Emergency Committees (ECs) to provide their advice on whether an event constitutes a PHEIC. The EC rationales have been criticised for being non-transparent and contradictory to the International Health Regulations (IHR). This first comprehensive analysis of EC rationale provides recommendations to increase clarity of EC decisions which will strengthen the IHR and WHO's legitimacy in future outbreaks. METHODS: 66 EC statements were reviewed from nine public health outbreaks of influenza A, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, polio, Ebola virus disease, Zika, yellow fever and coronavirus disease-2019. Statements were analysed to determine which of the three IHR criteria were noted as contributing towards the EC's justification on whether to declare a PHEIC and what language was used to explain the decision. RESULTS: Interpretation of the criteria were often vague and applied inconsistently. ECs often failed to describe and justify which criteria had been satisfied. DISCUSSION: Guidelines must be developed for the standardised interpretation of IHR core criteria. The ECs must clearly identify and justify which criteria have contributed to their rationale for or against PHEIC declaration.

Biological disasters like this can generate immense prejudice, xenophobia, stigma and othering, all of which have adverse consequences on health and well-being. In a country as diverse and populous in India, such crisis can trigger communalism and mutual blame. Keeping this in context, this study explored the relationship between well-being and xenophobic attitudes towards Muslims, collectivism and fear of COVID-19 in India. METHODS: The study was carried out on 600 non-Islamic Indians (231 males, 366 females and 3 others; mean age: 38.76 years), using convenience sampling. An online survey containing Fear of Coronavirus scale, Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale and Collectivism Scale was used. Xenophobia was assessed using two scales: generalized prejudice towards Muslims and specific xenophobic tendencies towards Muslims during COVID-19. The data were analysed using correlational methods and multiple regression. RESULTS: The findings showed that positively significant relationship exists between well-being and age as well as with collectivism, while an inversely significant relationship between well-being and fear of COVID-19 was found. The results of the multiple regression analysis shows that fear of COVID-19, age, collectivism and generalized xenophobia, in the order of their importance, together contributed to nearly 20% of variance in well-being. CONCLUSION: The findings are reflective of the importance of collectivism in enhancing well-being in these times of uncertainty.

The network pharmacology data identified potential, merged CIRI-associated targets of calycosin including tumor protein p53 (TP53), protein kinase B (AKT1), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1). Molecular docking analysis indicated the binding efficacy of calycosin with three of the targets, namely TP53, AKT1, and VEGFA. The biological processes of calycosin for the treatment of CIRI are mainly involved in the improvement of endothelial cell proliferation and growth, inflammatory development, and cellular metabolism. In addition, the anti-CIRI actions of calycosin were primarily through suppression of the toll-like receptor, PI3K-AKT, TNF, MAPK, and VEGF signaling pathways.

METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated the medical data of 206 pediatric COVID-19 and 411 pediatric seasonal influenza A or B patients. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients were older than seasonal influenza patients (median [interquartile range], 7.75 [2C14] years vs. 4 [2C6] years). The frequency of fever and cough in COVID-19 patients was lower than that of seasonal influenza patients (80.6% vs. 94.4%, P<0.001 and 22.8 % vs. 71.5%, P<0.001, respectively). Ageusia (4.9%) and anosmia (3.4%) were present in only COVID-19 patients. Leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were encountered more frequently in influenza patients than in COVID-19 patients (22.1% vs. 8.5%, P=0.029; 17.6% vs. 5.6%, P=0.013; and 13.2% vs. 5.6%, P= 0.048, respectively). Both groups showed significantly elevated monocyte levels in the complete blood count (70.4% vs. 69.9%, P=0.511). Major chest x-ray findings in COVID-19 patients included mild diffuse ground-glass opacity and right lower lobe infiltrates. There were no statistically significant intergroup differences in hospitalization or mortality rates; however, the intensive care unit admission rate was higher among COVID-19 patients (2.4% vs. 0.5%, P=0.045). CONCLUSION: In this study, pediatric COVID-19 patients showed a wide range of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic/mild to severe illness. We found no intergroup differences in hospitalization rates, oxygen requirements, or hospital length of stay; however, the intensive care unit admission rate was higher among COVID-19 patients.","output":"Comparison of clinical features and laboratory findings of coronavirus disease 2019 and influenza A and B infections in children: a single-center study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPNM) is a major cause of weakness in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, but current diagnostic tests are limited. We evaluated the generalizability and validity of single nerve conduction studies (NCS) and muscle ultrasound testing to identify CIPNM, and we also assessed the ability of muscle ultrasound to prognosticate patient outcomes. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated medical, cardiac, surgical, and neurosurgical ICU patients. We performed weekly strength testing, NCS, electromyography (EMG), and muscle ultrasound. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and other test characteristics of single NCS and muscle ultrasound, and we used multivariable regression models to assess the prognostic ability of muscle ultrasound. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were enrolled. The incidence of probable CIPNM was 18% and did not differ significantly by type of ICU (p = 0.49). For diagnosing probable CIPNM, the peroneal motor NCS had a sensitivity of 94% (95% confidence interval (CI) 71C100%) and specificity of 91% (95% CI 82C96%), the sural sensory NCS had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 80C100%) and specificity of 42% (95% CI 31C54%), and abnormal muscle ultrasound echogenicity had a sensitivity of 82% (95% CI 48C98%) and specificity of 57% (95% CI 43C70%). Abnormal echogenicity was associated with reduced likelihood of discharge to home (9% vs 50%, p = 0.0001), fewer ICU-free days (median 3 (interquartile range 0C15) days vs 16 (9.3C19.3) days, p = 0.0002), and increased ICU mortality (42% vs 12%, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: In a diverse cohort of critically ill patients, single NCS and muscle ultrasound achieved diagnostic accuracy for patients at risk for CIPNM. The routine utilization of these tests could be beneficial for all critically ill patients at risk for CIPNM.

Methods: We searched the Medline, as well as BioRxiv and MedRxiv preprint servers for original research published in English from January 1, to May 20, 2020. We used the search terms COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND, animal models, hamsters, nonhuman primates, macaques, rodent, mice, rats, ferrets, rabbits, cats, and dogs. Inclusion criteria were the establishment of animal models of COVID-19 as an endpoint. Other inclusion criteria were assessment of prophylaxis, therapies, or vaccines, using animal models of COVID-19. Findings: 13 peer-reviewed studies and 14 preprints met inclusion criteria. The animals used were nonhuman primates (n=13), mice (n=7), ferrets (n =4), hamsters (n= 4), and cats (n =1). All animals supported high viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract associated with mild clinical manifestations, lung pathology and full recovery. Older animals displayed relatively more severe illness than the younger ones. No animal models developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction, culminating in death. All species elicited a specific IgG antibodies response to the spike proteins, which were protective against a second exposure. Transient systemic inflammation was observed occasionally in Rhesus macaques, hamsters, and mice. Notably, none of the animals unveiled cytokine storm or coagulopathy. Conclusions: Most of the animal models of COVID-19 recapitulated mild pattern of human COVID-19 with full recovery phenotype.

METHODS: This case-control study nested within a cohort of cDMARD users was conducted in the Lombardy, Veneto, Tuscany and Lazio regions and Reggio Emilia province. Claims databases were linked to COVID-19 surveillance registries. Risk of COVID-19-related outcomes was estimated using a multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis, comparing HCQ/CLQ vs methotrexate, vs other cDMARDs and vs non-use of these drugs. Presence of rheumatic diseases vs their absence in a non-nested population was investigated. RESULTS: 1275 cases hospitalized due to COVID-19 were matched to 12 734 controls. Compared with recent use of methotrexate, no association between HCQ/CLQ monotherapy and COVID-19 hospitalization (OR 0.83 [95%CI, 0.69C1.00]) or mortality (OR 1.19 [95%CI, 0.85C1.67]) was observed. A lower risk was found when comparing HCQ/CLQ use to the concomitant use of other cDMARDs and glucocorticoids. HCQ/CLQ was not associated with COVID-19 hospitalization as compared with non-use. An increased risk for recent use of either methotrexate monotherapy (OR 1.19 [95% CI, 1.05C1.34]) or other cDMARDs (OR 1.21 [95% CI, 1.08C1.36]) vs non-use was found. Rheumatic diseases were not associated with COVID-19-related outcomes. CONCLUSION: HCQ/CLQ use in rheumatic patients was not associated with a protective effect against COVID-19-related outcomes. Use of other cDMARDs was associated with an increased risk when compared with non-use, and, if concomitantly used with glucocorticoids, also vs HCQ/CLQ, probably to be ascribed to immunosuppressive action.","output":"Risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality in rheumatic patients treated with hydroxychloroquine or other conventional DMARDs in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resident and fellow selection carried out via \\"the Match\\" has historically relied upon in-person interviews to evaluate and rank candidates.

Efforts in this area have, however, been fraught with challenges. The handful of existing broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies has provided information on some of the virus' sites of vulnerability, fueling a decade of structure-informed vaccine design. The fact that very few bnmAbs have been recovered to date illustrates the poor immunogenicity of these epitopes. Recognizing that progress may require more basic information, there has been a notable shift in the field toward identifying new chinks in HIV-1's armor. These efforts are based on the observation that some infected patients develop exceptionally broad serum neutralizing antibodies responses, a better understanding of which would be valuable for vaccine efforts aimed at eliciting similar specificities. RECENT FINDINGS New mapping methodologies are now providing an appreciation of the incidence of specificities similar to the existing known bnmAbs as well as some intriguing insights into novel specificities.

In the following, the produced new plasmid, pTX-V, was transformed into E. coli ER(2566) strain, and the expression accuracy was confirmed using electrophoresis and Western blotting. In addition, the effects of medium, inducer, and temperature on the enhancement of protein production were studied using the Taguchi method. Finally, the V antigen was purified by a chitin affinity column using INT and CBD tag. The expression was induced by 0.05 mM IPTG at 25 C under optimal conditions including TB medium. It was observed that the expression of the V-INTCCBD fusion protein was successfully increased to more than 40% of the total protein. The purity of V antigen was as high as 90%.

This is particularly important as COVID-19 has made such an impact on the United States healthcare system. Thus, there is a need to develop strategies to find multiple levels of information while minimizing the number of tests performed, shifting the balance of testing to more proactive than reactive.

Additionally, the heterogeneous burden in nursing homes and variable reporting of deaths in elderly individuals can hamper direct comparisons across countries of the underlying level of transmission and mortality rates3. Here we use age-specific COVID-19 death data from 45 countries and the results of 22 seroprevalence studies to investigate the consistency of infection and fatality patterns across multiple countries. We find that the age distribution of deaths in younger age groups (<65 years) is very consistent across different settings and demonstrate how this data can provide robust estimates of the share of the population that has been infected. We estimate that the infection-to-fatality ratio (IFR) is lowest among 5-9 years old, with a log-linear increase by age among individuals older than 30 years. Population age-structures and heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes explain some but not all of the heterogeneity between countries in infection-fatality ratios. Among the 45 countries included in our analysis, we estimate approximately 5% of these populations had been infected by the 1st of September 2020, with much higher transmission likely to have occurred in a number of Latin American countries.

Although low-rank constraint on coefficient tensors are computationally efficient, they might appear to be restrictive in some real data applications. Motivated by this, we propose a novel class of regularization or shrinkage priors for the symmetric tensor coefficients. Our modeling framework a-priori expresses a symmetric tensor coefficient as sum of low rank and sparse structures, with both these structures being suitably regularized using Bayesian regularization techniques. The proposed framework allows identification of tensor nodes significantly influenced by each scalar predictor. Our framework is implemented using an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm.

Brain imaging studies have shown that the ensuing immune response from these viral infections could lead to disruption of the development of brain regions and structures. Hence, long-term follow up is necessary for infants whose mothers report an inflammatory event due to viral infection at any time during pregnancy to monitor for signs of autism.

However, water security has been conceptualized under different perspectives, including various aspects and dimensions. Since public health is also an integral part of water security, it is necessary to understand how health has been incorporated as a dimension in the existing water security frameworks. While supply-demand and governance narratives dominated several popular water security frameworks, studies that are specifically designed for public health purposes are generally lacking. This research aims to address this gap, firstly by assessing the multiple thematic dimensions of water security frameworks in scientific disclosure;and secondly by looking into the public health dimensions and evaluating their importance and integration in the existing water security frameworks. For this, a systematic review of the Scopus database was undertaken using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A detailed review analysis of 77 relevant papers was performed. The result shows that 11 distinct dimensions have been used to design the existing water security framework. Although public health aspects were mentioned in 51% of the papers, direct health impacts were considered only by 18%, and indirect health impacts or mediators were considered by 33% of the papers. Among direct health impacts, diarrhea is the most prevalent one considered for developing a water security framework. Among different indirect or mediating factors, poor accessibility and availability of water resources in terms of time and distance is a big determinant for causing mental illnesses, such as stress or anxiety, which are being considered when framing water security framework, particularly in developing nations. Water quantity is more of a common issue for both developed and developing countries, water quality and mismanagement of water supply-related infrastructure is the main concern for developing nations, which proved to be the biggest hurdle for achieving water security. It is also necessary to consider how people treat and consume the water available to them. The result of this study sheds light on existing gaps for different water security frameworks and provides policy-relevant guidelines for its betterment. Also, it stressed that a more wide and holistic approach must be considered when framing a water security framework to result in sustainable water management and human well-being.","output":"Nexus between Water Security Framework and Public Health: A Comprehensive Scientific Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emerging of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates globally. One of the most prominent characteristics of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is lymphopenia which is in contrast to other viral infections. This controversy might be explained by the evaluation of impaired innate and adaptive immune responses during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the innate immune response, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) hyperactivated due to virus entry and extensive DNA damage sequentially leading to NAD+ depletion, ATP depletion and finally cell death. In contrast to the immune response against viral infections, cytotoxic T lymphocytes decline sharply in SARS-CoV-2 infection which might be due to infiltration and trapping in the lower respiratory tract. In addition, there are more factors proposed to involve in lymphopenia in COVID-19 infection like the role of CD38 which functions as NADase and intensifies NAD depletion which in turn affects NAD+ dependent Sirtuin proteins, as the regulators of cell death and viability. Lung tissue sequestration following cytokine storm supposed to be another reason for lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients. Protein 7a as one of the virus-encoded proteins induces apoptosis in various organ-derived cell lines.

Various tools including FTIR, XRD, SEM, BET, Zeta potential and XPS were applied to characterize the composite microbeads. The results revealed that the adsorption of TC was augmented with rising TC proportion up to 15 wt% in the microbeads matrix. In addition, the adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order and well-fitted to Freundlich and Langmuir models with a maximum adsorption capacity of 294.12 mg/g at 25 ?C, while the adsorption process was endothermic, randomness and spontaneous.

Two reviewers conducted study screening, data abstraction and quality assessment independently and in duplicate. Observational studies describing laboratory-confirmed paediatric (0C19 years old) COVID-19 were considered for inclusion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The pooled proportions of clinical findings, treatment and outcomes were compared according to World Bank country income level and reported disease severity. RESULTS: 129 studies were included from 31 countries comprising 10 251 children of which 57.4% were hospitalised. Mean age was 7.0 years (SD 3.6), and 27.1% had a comorbidity. Fever (63.3%) and cough (33.7%) were common. Of 3670 cases, 44.1% had radiographic abnormalities. The majority of cases recovered (88.9%); however, 96 hospitalised children died. Compared with high-income countries, in low-income and middle-income countries, a lower proportion of cases were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) (9.9% vs 26.0%) yet pooled proportion of deaths among hospitalised children was higher (relative risk 2.14, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.20). Children with severe disease received antimicrobials, inotropes and anti-inflammatory agents more frequently than those with non-severe disease. Subgroup analyses showed that a higher proportion of children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) were admitted to ICU (47.1% vs 22.9%) and a higher proportion of hospitalised children with MIS-C died (4.8% vs 3.6%) compared with the overall sample.

We performed a multi-center cross-section survey to investigate prevalence of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) and predictors for FCR in patients referred to RT during pandemic. METHODS: 542 patients were consecutively enrolled from three regions in China including Yangtze Delta River Region, Guangdong and Shanxi province. Patients characteristics were collected using an information sheet, Fear of progression questionnaire-short form, Hospital Anxiety/Depression Scale and EORTC QLQ-C30. The hierarchical multiple regression models were performed. RESULTS: 488 patients with complete data were eligible. The RT strategy was affected in 265 (54.3%) patients, including 143 with delayed RT initiation, 66 believing to have delayed RT initiation but actually not, 24 with RT interruptions, 19 shifting to local hospitals for RT and the remaining 13 influenced on both RT schedule and hospital level. The model explained 59.7% of observed variances in FCR (p<0.001) and showed that influence of RT strategy had significantly impacted on FCR (R2 = 0.01, F=2.966, p=0.019).

We identified published articles on SARS-COV efficacy experiments in which some selected compounds were used to test the reduction of the virus load in mice. METHODS: A systematic search of articles was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. We then developed a combined model based on a systematic review, meta-analyses, and molecular docking studies to evaluate the effect size of preclinical studies of compounds that have been tested against SARS-COV. Because substantial heterogeneity was expected, random effect model meta-analyses were carried out to estimate the overall pooled disease's prevalence. All meta-analyses were performed with Stata version 15.0. Subgroup analyses on therapies were conducted as well. Molecular docking studies of the inhibitors in the active pocket of COVID-19 protease were also performed. RESULTS: From all screened articles, six studies were appropriate for ultimate meta-analysis and systematic review. The residual amount of heterogeneity was high (tau2 =0.02;heterogeneity I2 =85.5 % with heterogeneity chi-square =103.57, a degree of freedom =15, and p &lt;0.001). The overall random pooled prevalence of infected mice treated with the selected compounds was 78.1 % [95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 14.7-17.0 %]. Prophylactic has a significantly higher pooled prevalence than therapeutic, with 21.8 % (95 % CI: 16.4 % to 28.8 %). Our results indicated that most of the SARS-COV inhibitors analyzed were less effective in reducing the lung virus titer of SARS-COV infection in animal models. The findings from molecular docking studies also identified COVID-19 inhibitors that are good for optimization and drug development to fight against COVID-19 infection.

We aimed to investigate serial changes in serum ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) concentrations after OT in AHF patients with reduced ejection fraction (EF). Methods: ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) concentrations were measured in 68 AHF patients with reduced EF immediately after admission and 1 and 3 months after OT.

For this purpose, we employ a combination of novel statistical techniques, including Vector Autoregressive (VAR), Markov-switching GJR-GARCH, and vine copula methods. Using a data set consisting of daily stock and world crude oil prices, we find evidence of a structure break in the volatility process, consisting of high and low persistence volatility processes, with a high persistence in the probabilities of transition between lower and higher volatility regimes, as well as the presence of leverage effects. Furthermore, our results based on the C-vine copula confirm the existence of two types of tail dependence: symmetric tail dependence between South Africa and China, South Africa and Russia, and South Africa and India, and asymmetric lower tail dependence between South Africa and Brazil, and South Africa and crude oil. For the purpose of diversification in these markets, we formulate an asset allocation problem using raw returns, MS GARCH returns, and C-vine and R-vine copula-based returns, and optimize it using a Particle Swarm optimization algorithm with a rebalancing strategy. The results demonstrate an inverse relationship between the risk contribution and asset allocation of South Africa and the crude oil market, supporting the existence of a lower tail dependence between them. This suggests that, when South African stocks are in distress, investors tend to shift their holdings in the oil market. Similar results are found between Russia and crude oil, as well as Brazil and crude oil. In the symmetric tail, South African asset allocation is found to have a well-diversified relationship with that of China, Russia, and India, suggesting that these three markets might be good investment destinations when things are not good in South Africa, and vice versa. ? 2021 by the authors.

Independent Student's t-test, Pearson's linear correlation, logistic regression analysis, and multiple linear regression correlation were performed to assess the association between these factors and the expression of ACE2. Results: Higher level of ACE2 was observed in females, older subjects, subjects with hypertension, subjects with a cardiocerebrovascular disease, male smokers, and subjects with cancer (p < 0.05) than in other subjects. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that there is a statistically significant correlation between being a female and ACE2 expression ( = 0.550, p < 0.001), between older age and ACE2 expression ( = 0.197, p = 0.003), between smoking and ACE2 expression ( = 0.163, p = 0.037), and between cancer and ACE2 expression ( = 0.265, p < 0.001).

This apparently unique presentation, sometimes called happy hypoxemia or hypoxia but better described as silent hypoxemia, has led to the speculation of underlying pathophysiological differences between COVID-19 lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from other causes.

Sample: Twenty-four teachers from English state schools were interviewed, representing mainstream primary and secondary schools and a range of years of experience and seniority. Methods: Participants were asked to tell stories of three key scenes during the first 5-6 weeks of lockdown: a low point, a high point and a turning point. A reflexive thematic analysis of their narratives was conducted.Results and Conclusions: Six themes were identified: uncertainty, finding a way, worry for the vulnerable, importance of relationships, teacher identity and reflections. Teachers narratives suggest that, after an initial period of uncertainty they settled into the situation and found a way forward, supported by strong relationships. However, they remain extremely worried about the most vulnerable pupils and want more joined up thinking from the government on how to support them effectively, along with clarity from policymakers to enable planning ahead. Teachers reflected on how to use their learning during this period to improve pupils experiences of education post COVID-19, and on how aspects of shared teacher identity have worked as stressors and coping mechanisms.

We compared these cases with 36 cases of conventional single-port laparoscopic abdominal hysterectomy (SP-aH) performed by the same surgeon from November 1st 2011 to July 31th 2012 (historic control). In the SP-rH cases, the retroperitoneal space was developed to identify the uterine artery; then, it was ligated where it originates from the internal iliac artery. RESULTS Estimated blood loss (EBL) was decreased in the SP-rH group compared with the SP-aH group (100 mL vs 200 mL; P = .023). The median total operative time was shorter in the SP-rH group (75 minutes vs 93 minutes; P < .05). The operative time of the Scope I phase, including ligation of the utero-ovarian (or infundibulopelvic) ligament, round ligament, uterine artery, and detachment of the bladder, was longer in the SP-rH group compared with that in the SP-aH group (26.0 minutes vs 24 minutes; P = .043). However, the operative time of the Scope II phase, including detachment of the uterosacral-cardinal ligament, vaginal cutting, and uterus removal, was shorter in the SP-rH group (19.5 minutes vs 30 minutes; P < .05).

However, further evidence about how T-cell subsets may be affected in infants during severe RSV bronchiolitis is needed to understand the mechanisms through which immunological memory may be altered. There is increasingly convincing evidence that RSV may be associated with the development of atopy and asthma. Surrogates of Th1, Th2 and regulatory T-lymphocyte populations were measured in blood from children with acute RSV bronchiolitis and in convalescence using the cell surface receptors CXCR3, CCR4 and CD25, respectively. Samples were also obtained from healthy age-matched controls. Plasma levels of the chemokines interferon- inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), which are known ligands for CXCR3 and CCR4, were also measured. Free plasma DNA was measured using quantitative PCR. CXCR3-positive cells were significantly decreased during acute infection (p = 0.013), while CCR4 and CD25 T-cell populations were unchanged. Plasma levels of IP-10 were markedly elevated in acute infection (p = 0.001). Convalescent samples were not significantly different to control samples for lymphocyte phenotypes or plasma chemokines. Elevated free plasma DNA was detected during acute infection compared with convalescence and controls. A profound reduction in the Th1, but not Th2, and CD25-positive lymphocyte populations associated with exaggerated IP-10 production occurs in severe RSV bronchiolitis. Free DNA is detectable in plasma.

Design/Methodology/Approaeh: Assessing the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 on all aspects of human civilization is an urgent scientific challenge today. However, it is already clear that it is human potential that will be impacted most by the pandemic. Using artificial neural networks with radial basis functions, the article predicts the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on staff turnover, which is one of the most important indicators ofpersonnel security. Findings: The network architecture is built and its mathematical description is made. The main factors influencing staff turnover as one of the main components ofpersonnel security have been defined. Staff turnover in the EU in 2020 and its dependence on the GDP change value has been analyzed. Practical Implications: Personnel security of enterprises and organizations is the basis of economic security nationwide. Nowadays, the Covid-19 pandemic first and foremost hits staff, especially their mental and physical health, thus having a direct impact on the level of personnel security. That is why, in order to effectively prevent a decline in the level of economic security, the impact of the pandemic on key personnel security indicators should be monitored in a timely manner. This is possible then using our metod. Originality/Value: The value of the research is to test the adequacy of the artificial neural network with RBF in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on personnel security.

Several models to predict mortality have been developed but often require data not immediately available during routine clinical care. The HOSPITAL score and the LACE index were previously validated to predict 30-day readmissions but may also help to assess mortality risk. We assessed their performance to predict 1-year and 30-day mortality in hospitalized older multimorbid patients with polypharmacy. METHODS We calculated the HOSPITAL score and LACE index in patients from the OPERAM (OPtimising thERapy to prevent Avoidable hospital admissions in the Multimorbid elderly) trial (patients aged  70 years with multimorbidity and polypharmacy, admitted to hospital across four European countries in 2016-2018). Our primary and secondary outcomes were 1-year and 30-day mortality. We assessed the overall accuracy (scaled Brier score, the lower the better), calibration (predicted/observed proportions), and discrimination (C-statistic) of the models. RESULTS Within 1 year, 375/1879 (20.0%) patients had died, including 94 deaths within 30 days. The overall accuracy was good and similar for both models (scaled Brier score 0.01-0.08). The C-statistics were identical for both models (0.69 for 1-year mortality, p = 0.81; 0.66 for 30-day mortality, p = 0.94). Calibration showed well-matching predicted/observed proportions. CONCLUSION The HOSPITAL score and LACE index showed similar performance to predict 1-year and 30-day mortality in older multimorbid patients with polypharmacy. Their overall accuracy was good, their discrimination low to moderate, and the calibration good. These simple tools may help predict older multimorbid patients' mortality after hospitalization, which may inform post-hospitalization intensity of care.","output":"HOSPITAL Score and LACE Index to Predict Mortality in Multimorbid Older Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Electromyography (EMG) signals are biomedical signals that measure electrical currents generated during muscle contraction.

Proangiogenic TEMs in macrophage HIF-2-deficient tumors presented significantly more CD31+ microvessel density but exacerbated hypoxia and tissue necrosis. Reduced numbers of proangiogenic TEMs in macrophage HIF-1-deficient tumors presented significantly less microvessel density but tumor vessels that were more functional as lectin injection revealed more perfusion, and functional electron paramagnetic resonance analysis revealed more oxygen in those tumors. Macrophage HIF-1-deficient tumors also responded significantly to chemotherapy.

We conducted a multicenter evaluation of kidney biopsy findings in living patients to identify various kidney disease pathology findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: We identified 14 native and 3 transplant kidney biopsies performed for cause in patients with documented recent or concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection treated at 7 large hospital systems in the United States. OBSERVATIONS: Men and women were equally represented in this case series, with a higher proportion of Black (n=8) and Hispanic (n=5) patients. All 17 patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, but only 3 presented with severe COVID-19 symptoms. Acute kidney injury (n=15) and proteinuria (n=11) were the most common indications for biopsy and these symptoms developed concurrently or within 1 week of COVID-19 symptoms in all patients. Acute tubular injury (n=14), collapsing glomerulopathy (n=7), and endothelial injury/thrombotic microangiopathy (n=6) were the most common histologic findings. 2 of the 3 transplant recipients developed active antibody-mediated rejection weeks after COVID-19. 8 patients required dialysis, but others improved with conservative management. LIMITATIONS: Small study size and short clinical follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Cases of even symptomatically mild COVID-19 were accompanied by acute kidney injury and/or heavy proteinuria that prompted a diagnostic kidney biopsy. Although acute tubular injury was seen among most of them, uncommon pathology such as collapsing glomerulopathy and acute endothelial injury were detected, and most of these patients progressed to irreversible kidney injury and dialysis.","output":"Multicenter Clinicopathologic Correlation of Kidney Biopsies Performed in COVID-19 Patients Presenting With Acute Kidney Injury or Proteinuria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular complications of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), resulting from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been documented. Endothelium-induced cytokine storm in critically ill COVID-19 patients is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Vascular endothelial damage caused by COVID-19 emphasizes the crucial role of endothelium in COVID-19 clinical impact. PURPOSE: To examine the mid-term (1-month) impact of COVID-19 in endothelial function. METHODS: In this case control study, 20 consecutive patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 either on Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or non-ICU were examined one month following hospital discharge. In the control group we recruited 12 consecutive subjects from the outpatient cardiology clinic. Demographic and clinical data were collected, and endothelial function was evaluated by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). RESULTS: There was no difference in age between COVID-19 patients and control subjects (6612 years vs. 715 years, p<0.17), in male sex (63% vs. 54%, p=0.66) in history of diabetes mellitus (27% vs. 36%, p=0.64), hypertension (36% vs. 54%, p=0.39), cardiovascular disease (27% vs.18%, p=0.61). From the COVID-19 subjects 65% were overweight or obese. During their hospitalization [3 ICU (15%)/17 non-ICU (85%), mean days: 176.7], 4 (20%) of COVID-19 patients developed ARDS, while single cases of stress-induced cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, and acute coronary syndrome were detected. One month post discharge D-dimers (0.710.55 g/ml) levels were above upper reference limit. Importantly, FMD one month after hospital discharge date, was significantly impaired in the COVID-19 group (3.591.63% vs. 9.312.98%, p<0.001) compared to control group. CONCLUSION: Post COVID-19 subjects one month post discharge have significant impaired endothelial function compared to control subjects. These findings highlight the significant interaction of COVID-19 with arterial endothelium and merit further research to conclude on the exact impact of vascular endothelium in physical history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Hypertension (HT) and age are the two principal determinants of arterial stiffness (AS). The objective of this study is to estimate AS in COVID-19 patients requiring hospital admission and analyze its association with all-cause mortality. Design and method: This cross-sectional, observational, retrospective multicenter study includes 122170 patients who required hospital admission in 150 Spanish centers, included in the nationwide SEMI-COVID-19 Network. We compared estimated AS as pulse pressure &gt; 60 mmHg and compared clinical characteristics between survivors and nonsurvivors. Results: Mean age was 67.516.1 years, 42.5% were women. Most patients were white (90.0%). Globally, 2606 (21.4%) subjects died. Blood pressure (BP) &lt; 120 mmHg and BP &gt; 140 at admission predicted higher all-cause mortality (23.5% and 22.8%, respectively, p&lt;0.001), compared to BP between 120-140 mmHg (18.6%). 4379 patients with AS (36.0%) were older and had higher systolic and lower diastolic BP.

Current naloxone delivery systems are effective in mitigating the opioid effects only for hours. Naloxone-loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microparticles were prepared as quick- and long-acting naloxone delivery systems to extend the naloxone effect as an opioid antidote. METHODS: The naloxone-PLGA microparticles were made using an emulsification solvent extraction approach with different formulation and processing parameters. Two PLGA polymers with the lactide:glycolide (L:G) ratios of 50:50 and 75:25 were used, and the drug loading was varied from 21% to 51%. Two different microparticles of different sizes with the average diameters of 23 m and 50 m were produced using two homogenization-sieving conditions. All the microparticles were critically characterized, and three of them were evaluated with -arrestin recruitment assays. RESULTS: The naloxone encapsulation efficiency (EE) was in the range of 70C85%. The EE was enhanced when the theoretical naloxone loading was increased from 30% to 60%, the L:G ratio was changed from 50:50 to 75:25, and the average size of the particles was reduced from 50 m to 23 m. The in vitro naloxone release duration ranged from 4 to 35 days. Reducing the average size of the microparticles from 50 m to 23 m helped eliminate the lag phase and obtain the steady-state drug release profile. The cellular pharmacodynamics of three selected formulations were evaluated by applying DAMGO, a synthetic opioid peptide agonist to a -opioid receptor, to recruit -arrestin 2. CONCLUSIONS: Naloxone released from the three selected formulations could inhibit DAMGO-induced -arrestin 2 recruitment. This indicates that the proposed naloxone delivery system is adequate for opioid reversal during the naloxone release duration.","output":"Engineering Quick- and Long-acting Naloxone Delivery Systems for Treating Opioid Overdose"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study analyzed the effects of urban governance and city size on COVID-19 prevention and control measures.

BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has infected over a million people, with over 65,000 deaths as of the first quarter of 2020. The current limitation of effective treatment options with no approved vaccine or targeted therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 has posed serious global health threats. This has necessitated several drug and vaccine development efforts across the globe. To date, the farthest in the drug development pipeline so far is Remdesivir. OBJECTIVES We perform molecular dynamics simulation, quantify the energy contributions of binding site residues using per-residue energy decomposition calculations, and subsequently generate a pharmacophore model for the identification of potential SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors. METHODS Integrative molecular dynamics simulations and thermodynamic calculations coupled with advanced postmolecular dynamics analysis techniques were employed. RESULTS Our analysis showed that the modulatory activity of Remdesivir is characterized by an extensive array of highaffinity and consistent molecular interactions with specific active site residues that anchor Remdemsivir within the binding pocket for efficient binding. These residues are ASP452, THR456, ARG555, THR556, VAL557, ARG624, THR680, SER681, and SER682. Results also showed that Remdesivir binding, induces minimal individual amino acid perturbations, subtly interferes with deviations of C- atoms and restricts the systematic transition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from the \\"buried\\" hydrophobic region to the \\"surface-exposed\\" hydrophilic region. We also mapped a pharmacophore model based on observed high-affinity interactions with SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which showcased the crucial functional moieties of Remdesivir and was subsequently employed for virtual screening. CONCLUSION The structural insights and the optimized pharmacophoric model provided would augment the design of improved analogs of Remdesivir that could expand treatment options for COVID-19.","output":"The Binding of Remdesivir to SARS-CoV-2 RNA-Dependent RNA polymerase May Pave The Way Towards the Design of Potential Drugs for COVID-19 Treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this report, we describe the development and initial validation of novel SARS-COV-2 Omicron-specific reactions that enable the identification of Omicron (BA.1) and BA.2 variants.

To this model we add a rate at which individuals are tested, and once an infectious individual tests positive it is isolated and each of their contacts are traced and tested independently with some fixed probability. If such a traced individual tests positive it is isolated, and the contact tracing is iterated. This model is analysed using large population approximations, both for the early stage of the epidemic when the\\"to-be-traced components\\"of the epidemic behaves like a branching process, and for the main stage of the epidemic where the process of to-be-traced components converges to a deterministic process defined by a system of differential equations. These approximations are used to quantify the effect of testing and of contact tracing on the effective reproduction numbers (for the components as well as for the individuals), the probability of a major outbreak, and the final fraction getting infected. Using numerical illustrations when rates of infection and natural recovery are fixed, it is shown that Test-and-Trace strategy is effective in reducing the reproduction number. Surprisingly, the reproduction number for the branching process of components is not monotonically decreasing in the tracing probability, but the individual reproduction number is conjectured to be monotonic as expected. Further, in the situation where individuals also self-report for testing, the tracing probability is more influential than the screening rate (measured by the fraction infected being screened).","output":"Analysing the Effect of Test-and-Trace Strategy in an SIR Epidemic Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the first case of tuberculosis with COVID-19 from South Asia.

An imbalance of vasculogenic/angiogenic mechanisms has been proposed as one possible disease aspect. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (cEPCs) have been hypothesized to contribute to vascular remodeling of MA, but it remains unclear whether they might be considered a disease effect or have a role in disease pathogenesis. The aim of the present study was to provide a morphological, phenotypical, and functional characterization of the cEPCs from MA patients to uncover their role in the disease pathophysiology. cEPCs were identified from whole blood as CD45dimCD34+CD133+ mononuclear cells. Morphological, biochemical, and functional assays were performed to characterize cEPCs. A significant reduced level of cEPCs was found in blood samples collected from a homogeneous group of adult (mean age 46.86  11.7; 86.36% females), Caucasian, non-operated MA patients with respect to healthy donors (HD; p = 0.032). Since no difference in cEPC characteristics and functionality was observed between MA patients and HD, a defective recruitment mechanism could be involved in the disease pathophysiology. Collectively, our results suggest that cEPC level more than endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) functionality seems to be a potential marker of MA. The validation of our results on a larger population and the correlation with clinical data as well as the use of more complex cellular model could help our understanding of EPC role in MA pathophysiology.","output":"Vascular Remodeling in Moyamoya Angiopathy: From Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells to Endothelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate whether fluvoxamine reduces clinical deterioration in adult patients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to identify risk factors for clinical deterioration in patients admitted to a community treatment center (CTC).

The purpose of this study was to compare multiple deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) technique with subsequent additional classifiers in terms of accuracy and characteristics in each histology. METHODS: Lung cancer cytological images were classified into ADC, SCC, and SCLC with four fine-tuned DCNN models consisting of AlexNet, GoogLeNet (Inception V3), VGG16 and ResNet50 pretrained by natural images in ImageNet database. For more precise classification, the figures of 3 histological probabilities were further applied to subsequent machine learning classifiers using Na?ve Bayes (NB), Support vector machine (SVM), Random forest (RF), and Neural network (NN). RESULTS: The classification accuracies of the AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG16 and ResNet50 were 74.0%, 66.8%, 76.8% and 74.0%, respectively.

Descriptive, bivariate analysis was performed with odds ratio (OR) calculations and a data mining methodology. Sociodemographic variables (from the General Health Questionnaire), health conditions and perception, symptoms, and variables related to contact and preventive measures regarding COVID-19 were analyzed. As compared to other countries, less affectation of mental health and increased use of preventive measures were observed.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 691 Japanese patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LADC), of whom 54 had UIP and 637 did not, was studied for driver oncogene aberrations. Whole-exome analysis was performed for 296 cases, including 51 with UIP, to deduce mutagenic processes and identify commonly affected genes. Logistic regression analysis was used to detect associations of gene aberrations with clinicopathological factors. RESULTS: The EGFR mutation was markedly less prevalent in patients with LADC with UIP than in those without (1.9% [one of 54] v. 49.9% [318 of 637]; P < .001), even in heavy smokers (25.3% [38 of 150] of patients with > 40 pack-years; P < .001).

Pulmonary surfactant system genes (PSSGs) NKX2-1/TTF1, SFTPA1, SFTPA2, SFTPB, and SFTPC were identified as targets for mutations (preferentially indels), and mutations were specifically associated with shorter overall survival of patients with UIP-positive LADC, independent of pathologic stage (hazard ratio, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.7 to 14.4; P = .0037). CONCLUSION: LADCs with UIP develop through mutational events caused by smoking, independently of EGFR mutation.

METHODS: A systematic review of studies published from inception to May 2020 using Embase, Google Scholar, Medline, PubMed and Scopus. Prospective studies, which pre-operatively assessed any imaging modality for the presence of bladder DE, and correlated with the gold standard surgical data as a reference were included. The QUADAS-2 tool was used to assess quality. This review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017059872). RESULTS: Of the 1,977 references identified, 8 studies (n = 1,052) were included in the analysis. The overall pooled sensitivity and specificity, from which the likelihood ratio of a positive test (LR+), likelihood ratio of a negative test (LR-) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated, for all transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) techniques were 55 % (95 % CI 28-79%), 99 % (95 % CI 98-100%), 54.5 (95 % CI 18.9-157.4), 0.46 (95 % CI 0.25 - 0.85) and 119 (95 % CI 24-577), and for only two-dimensional (2D) TVS 53 % (95 % CI 23-82%), 99 % (96 % CI 97-100%), 48.8 (95 % CI 13.1-181.4), 0.47 (95 % CI 0.23 - 0.98), and 104 (95 % CI 15-711), respectively. Meta-analyses of the other modalities, namely magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal endoscopic sonography (RES), were not possible due to the limited number of studies. There was significant heterogeneity and the studies were considered poor methodologically according to the QUADAS-2 tool. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst the sensitivity of TVS was limited, the specificity was excellent. Given that there is a paucity of literature for other imaging modalities, until more studies are performed, TVS should be considered as the first-line tool given it is the only modality with sufficient evidence.","output":"Meta-analysis and systematic review to determine the optimal imaging modality for the detection of bladder deep endometriosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemic outbreaks are one of the important sources of the risk in the global supply chains. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, global industries that were unprepared for disruptions experienced a decline due to the pandemic. A global supply chain is a complex system set of dynamics that could be analyzed by the system dynamics approach. In this article, the impact of the recent pandemic on the global supply chain is simulated in different scenarios. A system dynamic model is developed to carry out the simulations. In order to consider the impact of the pandemic on the exogenous and endogenous variables, a force majeure factor is defined in the model. Global features considered in this article are the export and import operations, the exchange rate and the rate of tariff. In this article, a scenario analysis is performed to analyze two important factors of the global supply chain: force majeure factor and delivery delay. Results showed that improving the flexibility of production capacity is one of the important strategies that global supply chain managers should pursue.JEL Codes: F23, P45, C15, C63, E37, F17","output":"The Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Global Supply Chain Operations: A System Dynamics Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome can affect the gene encoding the Spike (S) antigen, which interacts with the host cell specific receptor, selecting mutant variants with changes in their infective capacity, pathogenic potential and resistance to neutralizing antibodies.

However, real-time PCR techniques have already been developed for the detection of specific mutations that can facilitate their presumptive identification. The impact of these variants on global vaccination programs has raised concern. It is generally thought that, since the response evoked by the vaccine against the S antigen is directed at the entire protein and the mutations only affect specific regions, the escape effect of the vaccine antibodies will be limited. Among the future strategies proposed for immuno-protection, the increase in the number of doses, the alternation of vaccines and the development of specific vaccines against different variants has been suggested.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 variants, a still unfinished story Variantes de SARS-CoV-2, una historia todava inacabada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with unknown origin spread rapidly to 222 countries, areas or territories.

Main outcomes are pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals, likelihood ratios (LRs), area under the curve (AUC) of lung auscultation for different pulmonary pathologies and breath sounds. A meta-regression analysis is performed to reduce observed heterogeneity. For 34 studies the overall pooled sensitivity for lung auscultation is 37% and specificity 89%. LRs and AUC of auscultation for congestive heart failure, pneumonia and obstructive lung diseases are low, LR- and specificity are acceptable. Abnormal breath sounds are highly specific for (hemato)pneumothorax in patients with trauma. Results are limited by significant heterogeneity. Lung auscultation has a low sensitivity in different clinical settings and patient populations, thereby hampering its clinical utility. When better diagnostic modalities are available, they should replace lung auscultation.

However, although cognitive screening has been recommended in recovered individuals, little is known about which instruments are suitable to this scope by also accounting for clinical status. This study thus aimed at comparatively assessing the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in detecting cognitive deficits in post-COVID-19 patients premorbidly/contextually being or not at risk for cognitive deficits (RCD + ; RCD-). METHODS: Data from N = 100 COVID-19-recovered individuals having been administered both the MMSE and the MoCA were retrospectively analyzed separately for each group. RCD  classification was performed by taking into consideration both previous and disease-related conditions. Equivalent scores (ESs) were adopted to examine classification performances of the two screeners. RESULTS: The two groups were comparable as for most background and cognitive measures. MMSE or MoCA adjusted scores were mostly unrelated to disease-related features. The two screeners yielded similar estimates of below-cut-off performancesRCD + : MMSE: 20%, MoCA: 23.6%; RCD-: MMSE: 2.2%, MoCA: 4.4%. However, agreement rates dropped when also addressing borderline, low-end normal, and normal ability categorieswith the MoCA attributing lower levels than the MMSE (RCD + : Cohens k = .47; RCD-: Cohens k = .17). DISCUSSION: Although both the MMSE and the MoCA proved to be equally able to detect severe cognitive sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in both RCD + and RCD- patients, the MoCA appeared to be able to reveal sub-clinical defects and more sharply discriminate between different levels of ability.","output":"Screening for cognitive sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a comparison between the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Accurate methods of identifying patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk of poor outcomes has become especially important with the advent of limited-availability therapies such as monoclonal antibodies. Here we describe development and validation of a simple but accurate scoring tool to classify risk of hospitalization and mortality. METHODS: All consecutive patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 from March 25-October 1, 2020 within the Intermountain Healthcare system were included. The cohort was randomly divided into 70% derivation and 30% validation cohorts. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted for 14-day hospitalization. The optimal model was then adapted to a simple, probabilistic score and applied to the validation cohort and evaluated for prediction of hospitalization and 28-day mortality. RESULTS: 22,816 patients were included; mean age was 40 years, 50.1% were female and 44% identified as non-white race or Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. 6.2% required hospitalization and 0.4% died. Criteria in the simple model included: age (0.5 points per decade); high-risk comorbidities (2 points each): diabetes mellitus, severe immunocompromised status and obesity (body mass index30); non-white race/Hispanic or Latinx ethnicity (2 points), and 1 point each for: male sex, dyspnea, hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrythmia, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic neurologic disease. In the derivation cohort (n = 16,030) area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.82 (95% CI 0.81C0.84) for hospitalization and 0.91 (0.83C0.94) for 28-day mortality; in the validation cohort (n = 6,786) AUROC for hospitalization was 0.8 (CI 0.78C0.82) and for mortality 0.8 (CI 0.69C0.9).

However, urban destinations can also offer outdoor winter sports and an integrated set of urban tourism product bundles not only sports-related. Previous research has strongly focused on highly developed rural winter sports destinations but has barely explored the case of urban destinations offering winter sports as an integrated activity in their urban tourism product bundles. This paper, therefore, investigates the potential for market innovations that combine urban assets with winter sports activities by segmenting urban winter sports tourists and extending the understanding of urban tourism attractiveness. This paper identifies skiers motivation factors for visiting urban destinations with a winter sports infrastructure. It builds on a three-step quantitative approach (N = 338) with factor analysis, cluster analysis and posthoc testing to compare cluster means. The results highlight five push (exciting, knowledge, relaxation, achievement and family) and six pull factors (basic assets, urban assets, natural scenery, social events, economic aspects and winter sports activities), which can be clustered into three unique and statistically different groups: moderate skiers, urban recreational skiers and focused skiers. Addressing these identified clusters highlights the market potential of bundling winter sports and urban tourism, thereby addressing customers who have not been of strategic relevance for winter destinations. Additionally, urban winter destinations can gain a unique selling proposition and help to counteract crowding tendencies in rural alpine winter sports while also improving urban destination attractiveness post-COVID-19. Management implications Our findings deliver empirical support for destination managers' efforts in establishing urban destinations as alternative skiing hotspots (cf. Grenoble and Innsbruck). Urban destination managers should evaluate destinations' profiles and consider including (winter) sports as an integrated activity in their urban tourism product bundles. Winter sports can help to diversify urban destinations and improve their strategic positioning. Segmentation studies help marketers to address specific target groups;in the urban winter tourism context, these often include moderate skiers, urban recreational skiers and focused skiers. Empirical findings show that skiers' request multi-optional holidays with urban assets and not only sports-related activities. An innovative combination of urban tourism with winter sports offers new experiences and helps to increase visibility and customer satisfaction in competitive markets. Urban areas offer touristic infrastructure and authentic local assets which contribute to the overall tourism experience of winter sports tourists","output":"Winter sports tourism to urban destinations: Identifying potential and comparing motivational differences across skier groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in B-cell hematological malignancies (HM). Prophylaxis for recurrent infections in HM patients with antibody deficiency consists of first-line antibiotics and when unsuccessful, gammaglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT). Recent knowledge of trained immunity-based vaccines (TIbV), such as the sublingual polybacterial formulation MV130, has shown a promising strategy in the management of patients with recurrent infections. We sought to determine the clinical benefit of MV130 in a cohort of HM patients with recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTIs) who underwent immunization with MV130 for 3 months. Clinical information included the frequency of infections, antibiotic use, number of visits to the GP and hospitalizations previous and after MV130 immunotherapy. Improvement on infection rate was classified as: clear (>60% reduction of infection), partial (26%C60%) and low (25%) improvement. Fifteen HM patients (aged 42 to 80 years; nine females) were included in the study. All patients reduced their infection rate. Analysis of paired data revealed that the median (range, min - max) of respiratory infectious rate significantly decreased from 4.0 (8.0C3.0) to 2.0 (4.0C0.0) (p<0.001) at 12 months of MV130. A clear clinical improvement was observed in 53% (n = 8) of patients, partial improvement in 40% (n = 6) and low improvement in 7% (n = 1). These data correlated with a decrease on antibiotic consumption from 3.0 (8.0C1.0) to 1.0 (2.0C0.0) (p = 0.002) during 12 months after initiation of treatment with MV130. The number of infectious-related GP or emergency room visits declined from 4.0 (8.0C2.0) to 2.0 (3.0C0.0) (p<0.001), in parallel with a reduction in hospital admissions due to infections (p = 0.032). Regarding safety, no adverse events were observed. On the other hand, immunological assessment of serum IgA and IgG levels demonstrated an increase in specific antibodies to MV130-contained bacteria following MV130 immunotherapy. In conclusion, MV130 may add clinical benefit reducing the rate of infections and enhancing humoral immune responses in these vulnerable patients.","output":"Trained Immunity-Based Vaccine in B Cell Hematological Malignancies With Recurrent Infections: A New Therapeutic Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to analyze the effectiveness of three successive nationwide lockdown enforced in India, we present a data-driven analysis of four key parameters, reducing the transmission rate, restraining the growth rate, flattening the epidemic curve and improving the health care system.

The incidence data of the COVID-19 (during the period of 2nd March 2020 to 31st May 2020) outbreak in India was analyzed for the best fit to the epidemic curve, making use of the exponential growth, the maximum likelihood estimation, sequential Bayesian method and estimation of time-dependent reproduction. The best fit (based on the data considered) was for the time-dependent approach. Accordingly, this approach was used to assess the impact on the effective reproduction rate. The period of pre-lockdown to the end of lockdown 3, saw a $45\\\\%$ reduction in the rate of effective reproduction rate. During the same period the growth rate reduced from $393\\\\%$ during the pre-lockdown to $33\\\\%$ after lockdown 3, accompanied by the average doubling time increasing form $4$-$6$ days to $12$-$14$ days. Finally, the death-to-recovery ratio dropped from $0.28$ (pre-lockdown) to $0.08$ after lockdown 3. In conclusion, all the four metrics considered to assess the effectiveness of the lockdown, exhibited significant favourable changes, from the pre-lockdown period to the end of lockdown 3.

This is due in part to a lack of therapeutics that increase host defense to the virus. Replication of SARS-CoV-2 in lung tissue is associated with marked infiltration of macrophages and activation of innate immune inflammatory responses that amplify tissue injury. Antagonists of the androgen (AR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors have shown efficacy in models of COVID-19 and in clinical studies because the cell surface proteins required for viral entry, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), are transcriptionally regulated by these receptors. We postulated that the GR and AR modulator, PT150, would reduce infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent inflammatory lung injury in the Syrian golden hamster model of COVID-19 by down-regulating expression of critical genes regulated through these receptors. Animals were infected intranasally with 2.5  10(4) TCID(50)/ml equivalents of SARS-CoV-2 (strain 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020) and PT150 was administered by oral gavage at 30 and 100 mg/Kg/day for a total of 7 days. Animals were examined at 3, 5 and 7 days post-infection (DPI) for lung histopathology, viral load and production of proteins regulating the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results indicated that oral administration of PT150 caused a dose-dependent decrease in replication of SARS-CoV-2 in lung, as well as in expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Lung hypercellularity and infiltration of macrophages and CD4(+) T-cells were dramatically decreased in PT150-treated animals, as was tissue damage and expression of IL-6. Molecular docking studies suggest that PT150 binds to the co-activator interface of the ligand-binding domain of both AR and GR, thereby acting as an allosteric modulator and transcriptional repressor of these receptors. Phylogenetic analysis of AR and GR revealed a high degree of sequence identity maintained across multiple species, including humans, suggesting that the mechanism of action and therapeutic efficacy observed in Syrian hamsters would likely be predictive of positive outcomes in patients. PT150 is therefore a strong candidate for further clinical development for the treatment of COVID-19 across variants of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"A Novel Glucocorticoid and Androgen Receptor Modulator Reduces Viral Entry and Innate Immune Inflammatory Responses in the Syrian Hamster Model of SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Northern Brazilian state of Amazonas is one of the most heavily affected country regions by the COVID-19 epidemic and experienced two exponential growing waves in early and late 2020.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) achieved response rates around 20% in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with 8% of patients becoming long-term survivors. Outcomes have improved with the addition of chemotherapy to immunotherapy or the combination of anti-PD(L)1 with anti-CTLA-4 agents. Areas covered. The incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients with NSCLC treated with ICIs varied across clinical trials and real-life studies. The onset of irAEs was 10 weeks. Toxic deaths from irAEs following anti-PD(L)1 administration resulted mainly from pneumonitis. Some irAEs such as rash and thyroiditis were probably associated with better clinical outcomes, though confounding biases exist. Investigations are on-going to determine ideal biomarkers to predict the occurrence, to screen for and to diagnose irAEs. Expert opinion. Prevention, anticipation, detection, treatment and careful monitoring are the five principles that characterize our management of irAEs. Distinguishing immune-induced pneumonitis from progression, pseudo progression, hyper progression or other etiologies (COVID-19) can be particularly challenging in lung cancer due to the baseline vulnerable pulmonary function and thus requires caution and teamwork. We treat patients according to institutional and international guidelines and we only rechallenge them with ICIs after resolution of the AE and corticosteroid tapering.","output":"Safety of current immune checkpoint inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peningkatan virus COVID-19 terus meningkat dalam kurun waktu terakhir ini dan kita lakukan sinergitas semua elemen bangsa dalam menekan laju penambahan kasus positif COVID-19. vaksinasi segera dilakukan kepada seluruh warga masyarakat Pemerintah Pusat melalui Kementerian Kesehatan telah menyusun langkah-langkah terkait pelaksanaan vaksinasi tersebut.

An observational study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of specific procedures and of a serial testing approach adopted for the COVID-19 prevention in an Italian correctional facility (Bari, Apulia) for inmates affected by chronic diseases. Methods: Two SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing campaigns were carried out for all the prisoners and correctional workers, including correctional officers (CO), administrative staff (AS), correctional health care workers (HCW), and operators working with people completing their sentence outside the prison (OOP). Antigen testing was conducted on nasopharyngeal swab specimens, using a fluorescence immunoassay for the qualitative detection of nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 antigen. All subjects positive to the antigen test underwent confirmation by rRT-PCR test. Results: In total, 426 new and residential inmates were tested during the first campaign and 480 during the second campaign. Only two new inmates resulted positive at the first campaign, while no positive cases were observed at the second campaign or outside of the testing campaigns. In total, 367 correctional workers were tested at the first campaign and 325 at the second. At the first, 4 CO and 2 HCW showed positive test results, while no new positive cases were observed at the second. Moreover, 1 CO and 1 HCW resulted positive outside of the testing campaigns for the onset of symptoms while at home.

This analysis sought to quantify the nurse resource released from national level transition. METHODS: The annual number of noradrenaline support days for hypotensive shock was determined and the administration of noradrenaline was simulated over 24 h using a decision tree. A best-practice ready-to-administer strategy (RtA) of volumetrically pumped noradrenaline was compared to a nil uptake strategy (AfC) of bedside prepared solution delivered either volumetrically or using a double syringe pump. A mix of noradrenaline concentrations, flow rates, product sizes, and preferences for ampoule pooling, preparation volume, and sterility were included. The consumption of nurse days and product units was then projected over 1 year for a population of adults in critical care in England. RESULTS: Noradrenaline was administered over 231,011 days per year across 4123 critical care beds in England. Implementing a transition from AfC to RtA strategies on this scale released 35,791 nurse days or 176 whole-time nurse equivalents at 50/50 NHS band 5 and 6, a monetised release of 11.6 million. There was an increase in drug acquisition cost of 2.1 million using the licensed commercial product Sinora(?). Annual net monetary benefit was + 9.5 million, or + 65,961 per critical care unit (CCU) of 29 beds, equivalent to one nurse released per unit for patient care.

However, the variable proximity to failure does not have a consistent quantification method, despite being defined as the number of repetitions in reserve (RIR) upon completion of a resistance training set. Further, there is between-study variability in the definition of failure itself. Studies have defined failure as momentary (inability to complete the concentric phase despite maximal effort), volitional (self-termination), or have provided no working definition. Methods to quantify proximity to failure include percentage-based prescription, repetition maximum zone training, velocity loss, and self-reported RIR; each with positives and negatives. Specifically, applying percentage-based prescriptions across a group may lead to a wide range of per-set RIR owing to interindividual differences in repetitions performed at specific percentages of 1 repetition maximum. Velocity loss is an objective method; however, the relationship between velocity loss and RIR varies set-to-set, across loading ranges, and between exercises. Self-reported RIR is inherently individualized; however, its subjectivity can lead to inaccuracy. Further, many studies, regardless of quantification method, do not report RIR. Consequently, it is difficult to make specific recommendations for per-set proximity to failure to maximize hypertrophy and strength. Therefore, this review aims to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the current proximity to failure quantification methods. Further, we propose future directions for researchers and practitioners to quantify proximity to failure, including implementation of absolute velocity stops using individual average concentric velocity/RIR relationships. Finally, we provide guidance for reporting self-reported RIR regardless of the quantification method.","output":"Methods for Controlling and Reporting Resistance Training Proximity to Failure: Current Issues and Future Directions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aim of this study is to evaluate the rate of progression of stenosis and development of symptoms in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (aCAS) treated with contemporary medical therapy over a prolonged time interval. METHODS This study is a retrospective review of consecutive patients diagnosed with moderate or severe aCAS at our institution between 2000 and 2001. Data were gathered from both carotid arteries for each patient excluding vessels operated within 1 year of diagnosis and occlusions. Multivariate analysis was performed to analyze factors associated with ipsilateral transient ischemic attack (TIA)/stroke. RESULTS We identified 214 patients (58.8% men; median age 70 years) and collected data on 349 vessels. Degree of stenosis was severe (>70%) upon diagnosis in 92 (26.4%) vessels. Median length of follow-up was 13 years (interquartile range 10-14), and mean number of time points for follow-up imaging were 8.1  3.9. Progression of stenosis was observed in 237 (67.9%) vessels, and 72 (20.6%) patients developed symptoms ipsilateral to the stenosis (TIA in 14.4%, non-disabling stroke in 4%, disabling stroke in 2.2%). Median time to appearance of first symptom was 6 years (range 1-13). On multivariate analysis, degree of baseline stenosis, intracranial stenosis >50%, plaque ulceration, silent infarction and previous history of TIA/stroke were associated with ipsilateral TIA/stroke, but progression of stenosis was not. CONCLUSIONS There was a substantial rate of progression of stenosis in patients with aCAS over time despite adequate medical therapy, but progression of stenosis did not increase the risk of ipsilateral TIA/stroke.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is the receptor responsible for coronavirus binding, while subsequent cell entry relies on priming by the serine protease TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease, serine 2). Although renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) blockers have been suggested to upregulate ACE2, their use in COVID-19 patients is now considered well tolerated. The aim of our study was to investigate parameters that determine COVID-19 severity, focusing on RAAS-components and variation in the genes encoding for ACE2 and TMPRSS2. METHODS: Adult patients hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2 infection between May 2020 and October 2020 in the Haga Teaching Hospital were included, and soluble ACE2 (sACE2), renin, aldosterone (in heparin plasma) and polymorphisms in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes (in DNA obtained from EDTA blood) were determined. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Out of the 188 patients who were included, 60 were defined as severe COVID-19 (ICU and/or death). These patients more often used antidiabetic drugs, were older, had higher renin and sACE2 levels, lower aldosterone levels and a lower aldosterone/renin ratio. In addition, they displayed the TMPRSS2-rs2070788 AA genotype less frequently. No ACE2 polymorphism-related differences were observed. Multivariate regression analysis revealed independent significance for age, sACE2, the aldosterone/renin ratio, and the TMPRSS2 rs2070788 non-AA genotype as predictors of COVID-19 severity, together yielding a C-index of 0.79. Findings were independent of the use of RAAS blockers. CONCLUSION: High sACE2, a low aldosterone/renin ratio and having the TMPRSS2 rs2070788 non-AA genotype are novel independent determinants that may help to predict COVID-19 disease severity.

Patients vulnerable to severe COVID-19 are at risk of hydroxychloroquine interactions with co-morbidities and co-medications contributing to detrimental, including fatal, adverse treatment effects. METHODS: A retrospective survey was undertaken of health conditions and co-medications of patients with COVID-19 who were pre-screened for enrolment in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled hydroxychloroquine multi-centre trial. RESULTS: The survey involved 305 patients [median age 71 (interquartile range 59-81) years]. The majority of patients (n = 279, 92%) considered for inclusion in the clinical trial were not eligible, mainly due to safety concerns caused by health conditions or co-medications. The most common were QT-prolonging drugs (n = 188, 62%) and haematologic/haemato-oncologic diseases (n = 39, 13%) which prohibited the administration of hydroxychloroquine. In addition, 165 (54%) patients had health conditions and 167 (55%) patients were on co-medications that did not prohibit the use of hydroxychloroquine but had a risk of adverse interactions with hydroxychloroquine.

We generated an nsp1 mutant (nsp1-mt) that neither promoted host mRNA degradation nor suppressed host protein synthesis in expressing cells. Both a SARS-CoV mutant virus, encoding the nsp1-mt protein (SARS-CoV-mt), and a wild-type virus (SARS-CoV-WT) replicated efficiently and exhibited similar one-step growth kinetics in susceptible cells. Both viruses accumulated similar amounts of virus-specific mRNAs and nsp1 protein in infected cells, whereas the amounts of endogenous host mRNAs were clearly higher in SARS-CoV-mt-infected cells than in SARS-CoV-WT-infected cells, in both the presence and absence of actinomycin D. Further, SARS-CoV-WT replication strongly inhibited host protein synthesis, whereas host protein synthesis inhibition in SARS-CoV-mt-infected cells was not as efficient as in SARS-CoV-WT-infected cells. These data revealed that nsp1 indeed promoted host mRNA degradation and contributed to host protein translation inhibition in infected cells. Notably, SARS-CoV-mt infection, but not SARS-CoV-WT infection, induced high levels of beta interferon (IFN) mRNA accumulation and high titers of type I IFN production.

METHODS: International experts, representing each member group within the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG), met to define long-term survival, propose guidelines for long term follow-up and propose ways to implement long term survivorship follow-up in clinical trials involving gynecological cancers. RESULTS: Long-term survival with/from gynecological cancers was defined as survival of at least five years from diagnosis, irrespective of disease recurrences. Review of the literature showed that more than 50% of cancer survivors with gynecological cancer still experienced health concerns/long-term side effects. Main side effects included neurologic symptoms, sleep disturbance, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, bowel and urinary problems and lymphedema. In this article, long-term side effects are discussed in detail and treatment options are proposed. Screening for second primary cancers and lifestyle counselling (nutrition, physical activity, mental health) may improve quality of life and overall health status, as well as prevent cardiovascular events. Clinical trials should address cancer survivorship and report patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) for cancer survivors. CONCLUSION: Long-term survivors after gynecological cancer have unique longer term challenges that need to be addressed systematically by care givers. Follow-up after completing treatment for primary gynecological cancer should be offered lifelong. Survivorship care plans may help to summarize cancer history, long-term side effects and to give information on health promotion and prevention.","output":"GCIG-Consensus guideline for Long-term survivorship in gynecologic Cancer: A position paper from the gynecologic cancer Intergroup (GCIG) symptom benefit committee"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging contagious disease that has led to the global epidemic and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome, Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Zoonotic is an infection that is transmitted from animals to humans. Significantly changing animal infection is the best amplifying mask of pathogens. The power of animal infection is a contagious virus that usually spreads from vertebrate animals to humans and vice versa. The physical health of an animal depends on the normal vulnerability of its population and the change in actual animal health against infection over time, and is assessed based on previous circumstances in the population. After compiling the effect of virulence of the animal infection on the size of the susceptible, exposed and infected subjects, an investigation was made using MAPLE 18 with RK Fehlberg technique. This study discusses the stimulation of animal influences on the novel coronavirus infection that is reliable to be infectious. It analyzes all incoming and outgoing air passengers worldwide and in the country is keen on spreading the abnormally degenerate coronavirus. The zoonotic strength was applied to coronavirus infection and the rates of SEIR individuals terminated by secondary coronavirus infection were estimated. The transmission ability of coronavirus infection is associated with a lack of the perceived respiratory system in conservative people and global warming.","output":"Mathematical Modeling: Zoonotic Strength of Infectivity on COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is increasingly being recognized due to improved understanding of the disease and its criteria for diagnosis.

We are especially interested in how the availability of medication could change the necessary quarantine measures for effective control of the disease. We model the transmission by extending the SEIR model to include asymptomatic, quarantined, isolated and medicated population compartments. We calculate the basic reproduction number R_0 and show that for R_0<1 the disease dies out and for R_0>1 the disease is endemic. Using sensitivity analysis we establish that R_0 is most sensitive to the rates of quarantine and medication. We also study how the effectiveness and the rate of medication along with the quarantine rate affect R_0. We devise optimal quarantine, medication and isolation strategies, noting that availability of medication reduces the duration and severity of the lock-down needed for effective disease control. Our study also reinforces the idea that with the availability of medication, while the severity of the lock downs can be eased over time some social distancing protocols need to be observed, at least till a vaccine is found. We also analyze the COVID-109 outbreak data for four different countries, in two of these, India and Pakistan the curve is still rising, and in he other two, Italy and Spain, the epidemic curve is now falling due to effective quarantine measures.

Owing its name to the T-shape of nodes in diagram notation of Tensor Rings, T-Basis is simply a list of equally shaped three-dimensional tensors, used to represent Tensor Ring nodes. Such representation allows us to parameterize the tensor set with a small number of parameters (coefficients of the T-Basis tensors), scaling logarithmically with each tensor's size in the set and linearly with the dimensionality of T-Basis. We evaluate the proposed approach on the task of neural network compression and demonstrate that it reaches high compression rates at acceptable performance drops. Finally, we analyze memory and operation requirements of the compressed networks and conclude that T-Basis networks are equally well suited for training and inference in resource-constrained environments and usage on the edge devices.","output":"T-Basis: a Compact Representation for Neural Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 severity is heterogeneously distributed over age strata, but current mitigation strategies are homogeneously applied to all population. Social-distancing and stay-home are effective conservative approaches but lack economical sustainability on long term. Conversely, herd-immunity is a nonrestrictive strategy which can cost remarkable number of human lives and can melt the healthcare system down.Here I propose an Age Adaptive Social Distancing (AASD) engineering strategy to mitigate COVID-19 outbreak. AASD is based on the scientific evidence that the fatality rate grows nonlinearly with age, hence also the containing strategy should adapt nonlinearly. Essentially, AASD suggests that silent spreaders(age 0-39) should avoid/minimize direct and indirect contacts with individuals in dangerous zone(age 40+). The rationale is: 0-19 should follow parents strategy, healthy 20-39 (low fatality rate) might conduct screened life under active surveillance, to sustain economy and acquire rational immunity;40-59 should respect social distancing (waiting a therapy);60+ should stay at home (waiting a vaccine). This might save human lives, reduce healthcare demand and improve economical sustainability.

Bronchiolitis is the most common acute respiratory infection in children under 1 year of age, and the most common cause of hospitalization in this age group. RSV accounts for approximately 70% of all these cases, followed by rhinovirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus and bocavirus. The association between bronchiolitis caused by RSV and the development of recurrent wheezing and/or asthma was first described more than 40 years ago, but it is still unclear whether bronchiolitis causes chronic respiratory symptoms, or if it is a marker for children with a genetic predisposition for developing asthma in the medium or long term. In any case, sufficient evidence is available to corroborate the existence of this association, which is particularly strong when the causative agent of bronchiolitis is rhinovirus. The pathogenic role of respiratory viruses as triggers for exacerbations in asthmatic patients has not been fully characterized. However, it is clear that respiratory viruses, and in particular rhinovirus, are the most common causes of exacerbation in children, and some type of respiratory virus has been identified in over 90% of children hospitalized for an episode of wheezing.

Standard qualitative analysis techniques, consisting of both inductive and deductive approaches, were used to identify and characterize the effects of COVID-19 on participants. RESULTS: Among the 30 PWID interview participants, 14 reported barriers to accessing health and addiction services due to COVID-19. As facilities decreased appointment availability or transitioned to telemedicine, PWID reported being unable to access services. Social distancing led to isolation or loneliness during hospital stays and in the community. Recovery meetings and support groups, critical to addiction recovery, were particularly affected. Other participants reported that uncertainty and fear of contracting the virus generated changes in behavior that led them to avoid seeking services. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has disrupted health systems and social services, leading PWID to experience unprecedented barriers to accessing and maintaining health and addiction services in both inpatient and outpatient settings.

Due to increased barriers to care, providers increasingly used telemedicine for contraceptive care, curbside services, mail-order pharmacies, and on-line or home delivery of contraceptive methods, including self-administration of subcutaneous depo medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SQ). To better understand how reproductive health providers adapted service provision during the pandemic, this study assessed clinical practice changes and strategies providers adopted throughout the United States to maintain contraceptive care, particularly when clinics closed on-site, and the challenges that remained in offering contraceptive services, especially to marginalized patient populations. METHODS: We surveyed U.S. providers and clinic staff (n = 907) in April 2020CJanuary 2021, collecting data on contraceptive service delivery challenges and adaptations, including telemedicine. We assessed clinical practice changes with multivariate regression analyses using generalized linear models with a Poisson distribution and cluster robust standard errors, adjusting for clinic patient volume, practice setting, region, Title X funding, and time of survey. RESULTS: While 80% of providers reported their clinic remained open, 20% were closed on-site. Providers said the pandemic made it more difficult to offer the full range of contraceptive methods (65%), contraceptive counseling (61%) or to meet the needs of patients in marginalized communities (50%). While only 11% of providers offered telemedicine pre-pandemic, most offered telemedicine visits (79%) during the pandemic. Some used mail-order pharmacies (35%), curbside contraceptive services (22%), and DMPA-SQ for self-administration (10%). Clinics that closed on-site were more likely to use mail-order pharmacies (aRR 1.83, 95% CI [1.37C2.44]) and prescribe self-administered DMPA-SQ (aRR 3.85, 95% CI [2.40C6.18]). Clinics closed on-site were just as likely to use telemedicine as those that remained open. Among clinics using telemedicine, those closed on-site continued facing challenges in contraceptive service provision.

This host defense is strictly regulated to eliminate the infection while limiting tissue damage that is associated with virus pathogenesis. Post-translational modifications, most notably phosphorylation, are key regulators of the antiviral defense implying an important role of protein phosphatases. Here, we investigated the role of the dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) in the host defense against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a pathogenic virus of the Pneumoviridae family, and Sendai virus (SeV), a model virus being developed as a vector for anti-RSV vaccine. We found that DUSP1 is upregulated before being subjected to proteasomal degradation. DUSP1 does not inhibit the antiviral response, but negatively regulates virus-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Interaction with the JNK-interacting protein 1 scaffold protein prevents dephosphorylation of JNK by DUSP1, likely explaining that AP-1 activation and downstream cytokine production are protected from DUSP1 inhibition. Importantly, DUSP1 promotes SeV-induced apoptosis and suppresses cell migration in RSV-infected cells. Collectively, our data unveil a previously unrecognized selective role of DUSP1 in the regulation of tissue damage and repair during infections by RSV and SeV.","output":"DUSP1 regulates apoptosis and cell migration, but not the JIP1-protected cytokine response, during Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Sendai Virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the novel coronavirus spread globally, a growing public panic was expressed over the internet.

Using the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) framework, we analyzed parallel and divergent factors associated with COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS and the prevalence of disparate disease in diverse communities. We utilized PRISMA guidelines to identify relevant literature (N = 210 articles) that resulted in a review of 125 articles included in our synthesis. RECENT FINDINGS: With racial health inequities as a core contributor to disease vulnerability, we also identified other factors such as economic stability, social and community support, the neighborhood and built environment, healthcare access and quality, and education access and quality as important socioecological considerations toward achieving health equity. Our review identifies structural and systematic factors that drive HIV and COVID-19 transmission.

Here, we examined the possible association between BCG vaccination with prevalence and mortality by COVID-19 by using publicly available data of COVID-19 in 199 countries/regions and the BCG World Atlas. By using linear regression modeling, we found that the number of total cases and deaths per one million population were significantly associated with the country's policy concerning BCG vaccine administration. The amount of variance in cases and deaths explained by BCG vaccination policy ranged between 12.5% and 38%. Importantly, this effect remained significant after controlling for the country's life expectancy and the average temperature in February and March 2020, which themselves are significantly correlated with the cases and deaths indices, respectively. By contrast, the ratio between deaths and cases was weakly affected. This latter outcome suggested that BCG vaccination may have hindered the overall spread of the virus or progression of the disease rather than reducing mortality rates (i.e., deaths/cases ratio). Finally, by roughly dividing countries into three categories showing high, middle, or low growth rate of the cases, we found a highly significant difference between the slope categories among the BCG groups, suggesting that the time since the onset of the spread of the virus was not a major confounding factor. While this study potentially suffers from a number of unknown confounding factors, these associations support the idea that BCG vaccination may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2, which, together with its proven safety, encourages consideration of further detailed epidemiological studies, large-scale clinical trials on the efficacy of this vaccine on COVID-19, and/or re-introduction of BCG vaccination practice in the countries which are currently devoid of the practice.","output":"Association of BCG vaccination policy with prevalence and mortality of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We performed a retrospective study of cardiology telemedicine visits at a large academic pediatric center between 2016 and 2019 (pre COVID-19).

We developed a novel Zfp36l2-lacking mouse model (L2-fKO) to identify factors governing this tissue specificity. We found 549 upregulated genes in the L2-fKO spleen by RNA-seq. These upregulated genes were enriched in ARE motifs in the 3UTRs, which suggests that they are ZFP36L2 targets, however the precise sequence requirement for targeting was not evident from motif analysis alone. We therefore used gel-shift mobility assays on 12 novel putative targets and established that ZFP36L2 requires a 7-mer (UAUUUAU) motif to bind. We observed a statistically significant enrichment of 7-mer ARE motifs in upregulated genes and determined that ZFP36L2 targets are enriched for multiple 7-mer motifs. Elavl2 mRNA, which has three 7-mer (UAUUUAU) motifs, was also upregulated in L2-fKO spleens. Overexpression of ZFP36L2, but not a ZFP36L2(C176S) mutant, reduced Elavl2 mRNA expression, suggesting a direct negative effect. Additionally, a reporter assay demonstrated that the ZFP36L2 effect on Elavl2 decay is dependent on the Elavl2-3UTR and requires the 7-mer AREs. Our data indicate that Elavl2 mRNA is a novel target of ZFP36L2, specific to the spleen.

A mixed (qualitative and quantitative) online survey was responded to by 93 educators. Responses denote emotionally charged views and a sense of learned helplessness. Most special schools were unable to implement social distancing measures in full or provide adequate protective equipment. The main challenges the respondents mentioned included lack of guidance from Governmental authorities, staff shortages, work overload, challenging relationship with parents and issues in meeting childrens complex needs. Professionals working for less than 3 years in a special school were more likely to say they would change jobs if they could, when compared to professionals with more years of experience. No effects of demographic characteristics were found in relation to professionals ratings of their own wellbeing during lockdown. Findings are discussed in light of the concept of learned helplessness and suggest that there is a need to reform provision in special schools in England to foster its sustainability and positive outcomes for children.

In Sweden, and Europe in general, online gambling has more than doubled since 2007. METHOD: The paper studies online gambling venues (OGVs) as relational actors of addiction. By drawing on the actor-network theory (ANT) and assemblage thinking, we examine how OGVs, as actors in specific networks of attachment, enable the development of gambling addiction and facilitate its continuation. The data consists of life story interviews with 34 online gamblers. RESULTS: Online gambling venues extend the scope of gambling opportunities through space, providing an easy portable 24-hours-a-day access to gambling online and on smartphones. This increases the spatial mobility of gambling to diverse contexts. By linking gambling to more unpredictably evolving patterns of relations, online gambling venues also increase gambling's temporal mobility to intrude in the habitual trajectories of everyday life. By enhancing the gambling mobility through space and time, OGVs simultaneously extend the scope of situations in which gambling may transform from a controlled activity into an addiction. It is then that the actor-networks of gambling infiltrate in the actor-networks of work, domestic life and leisure, and start to feed processes where they are translated to serve the interests of gambling. CONCLUSION: By giving us tools to challenge simplistic and taken-for-granted explanations of gambling addiction and by allowing us to grasp the flux and changing nature of addiction as a relational pattern of heterogeneous contextual attachments, the actor-network theory can help us to understand the complexity and multiplicity of gambling problems. The knowledge on what kinds of contextual attachments in diverse actor-networks enable harmful gambling and sustain unhealthy relations helps practitioners to focus treatment interventions especially on these contextual linkages and their configurations.","output":"Online gambling venues as relational actors in addiction: Applying the actor-network approach to life stories of online gamblers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT In the spring of 2020, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\\"COVID-19\\") evolved into a worldwide pandemic, forcing traditional face-to-face healthcare to a stand-still. Telemedicine was quickly adopted as a major tool for pediatric rehabilitation services. This paper describes the national legislative response of the United States to the COVID-19 pandemic and the opportunities and challenges of implementing telemedicine in pediatric rehabilitation outpatient settings, consultations, as well as physician and patient education. The feasibility of performing a remote pediatric musculoskeletal and neurological tele-evaluation is also discussed. Although challenges exist, telemedicine has demonstrated its potential and has proven to be a practical system. Future developments in technology and accessibility, in addition to support from government and third-party payers, have the potential to make telemedicine an effective and vital platform in a coordinated healthcare system.","output":"Telemedicine in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: A Pediatric Rehabilitation Perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction & Objectives: The TMPRSS2 protein has been found to be involved as a critical host cell factor in severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2). The production of this protein is regulated by the androgen receptor (AR), also in non-prostatic tissues, including the lung. There is the speculation that androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may protect patients affected by prostate cancer (PC) from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our goal is to analyze the severity of COVID-19 in PC patients and the possible influence of ADT on this infection. Materials & Methods: Retrospective study of patients treated for COVID-19 between March 15th and May 15th 2020 in our institution who had previous diagnosis of PC. Patients were divided into two: Those treated with ADT during the infection or the year before, and those who were not treat with ADT on that period. Differences between groups in demographic characteristics, parameters of PC disease, risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, the presence of severe COVID-19 and mortality rates were analyzed. Results: During the study period, a total of 1365 patients were treated in our center for COVID-19 documented with positive PCR. From a total of 1349 subjects registered in our PC database, 156 were on ADT treatment and 1193 were not. Out of the total, 61 (4.52%) PC patients suffered from COVID-19, 11 (18.0%) belonged to the ADT group and 50(82.0%) to the non-ADT group. The mean age of the series was 77.6 years (SD:7.7). The cumulative incidence recorded of COVID-19 in total PC patients was 4.5% (95%CI: 3.5-5.8). Demographic variables, comorbidities and risk factors for infection were quite homogeneous in both groups. Although a worse tendency was observed in the non-ADT group, no statistically significant differences were found in any of the variables analyzed. Regarding the influence of ADT on the course of the disease, no statistically significant differences were found neither in the exitus rate (27.3% vs. 34.0%;p 0.481), nor in the presence of severe COVID-19: need for intubation or ICU admission(0% vs 6.3%;p 0.561) and need for corticoid treatment, interferon beta or tocilizumab (60% vs. 34.7%;p 0.128). In the univariate analysis, treatment with ADT was not found to be a protective factor for worse clinical evolution (RR 1.11;95%CI 0.67-1.85;p=0.68) or exitus (RR 0.8;95%CI 0.28-2.27;p=0.68). We also found no statistically significant differences when multivariate analysis adjusted for clinically relevant comorbidities was performed. Conclusions: In our study, the use of ADT has not been shown to be a protective factor against serious COVID-19. In view of the results published to date, more research in this area is definitely needed to draw firm conclusions.","output":"P0848 Severity of COVID-19 infection in prostate cancer patients and effect of ADT on disease presentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Prior bilioenteric anastomosis (BEA) has been associated with elevated risk of abscess formation after thermal ablation of hepatic tumors. We assessed the incidence of hepatic abscess after thermal ablation in a BEA cohort treated with extended antibiotic regimens following ablation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective review was performed to identify patients with BEA who underwent percutaneous hepatic thermal ablation between January 1, 2003-September 1, 2016. Fifteen patients with BEA underwent 18 percutaneous thermal ablation procedures. Patient and procedural characteristics were reviewed, as well as the antibiotic regiment utilized post ablation. Complications were characterized via standardized nomenclature [Common Terminology for Clinically Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03]. RESULTS Fifteen patients with BEA underwent treatment of 49 liver lesions during 18 ablation sessions. Mean follow-up in these patients was 39 months (range 3-138 months). Two patients (11%) developed hepatic abscesses, both of which occurred within 45 days of the ablation procedure while the patients were still on extended prophylactic antibiotic therapy. No additional CTCAE clinically significant complications were observed. CONCLUSION Thermal ablation of hepatic tumors can be accomplished safely in patients with BEA. Long-term post-procedural antibiotics may mitigate the risk of hepatic abscess formation. Due to the high number of patients who are deemed surgically unresectable, patients with BEA may have limited alternate treatment modalities and percutaneous hepatic thermal ablative treatments warrant consideration.","output":"Evaluation of infectious complications following percutaneous liver ablation in patients with bilioenteric anastomoses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted the global community.

This essay specifically builds on interviews conducted with Korean educators throughout the 2020 school year during COVID-19. First, we discuss ownership of educational change as reflected in educators narratives. We then explore three driving forces behind the transformation of the grammar of Korean schooling: policy discourse about future education, professional teaching culture, and administration for creativity. Based on our analysis, we offer several suggestions for policymakers, district leaders, and educators around the world for how to leverage and sustain the educational changes catalyzed by COVID-19. We conclude by arguing that educators desires to achieve change must be actualized in schools and policies through collaborative foresight and system-level support.","output":"Owning educational

of awake prone positioning (PP) in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and acute hypoxic respiratory failure on oxygenation, escalation to ICU, and mortality METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted on a dedicated COVID-19 respiratory step-down unit within an urban, tertiary care, teaching hospital from 4/30/20-5/31/20 The unit was managed by internal medicine residents and hospitalists Inpatients with documented COVID-19 pneumonia and those under investigation who required supplemental oxygen (nasal cannula, non-rebreather face mask, high flow nasal cannula, non-invasive ventilation) were encouraged to self-prone for at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours per day (in 2, 2 hour sessions) for 3 to 5 days Exclusion criteria: inability to provide verbal consent, inability to self-prone or change position, primary teams safety concerns, inability to protect airway, impending intubation, acute VTE diagnosed in the past 48hr, hypotension, recent intubation or ICU stay during the current admission SpO2, oxygen delivery modality, and S/F ratios were monitored during PP and until discharge All patients received usual COVID-19 care according to local institutional guidance RESULTS: 22 patients were screened for study inclusion, 14 patients were enrolled, 1 could not tolerate PP due to back pain and 2 were transferred to the ICU within 24 hours of enrollment Of the 11 subjects ultimately analyzed, 55% were male, 45% were female, median age was 55 2 had underlying lung disease and 2 had no comorbid conditions 2 died during admission (both DNI), 9 were discharged home, and none were intubated Only one required home oxygen on discharge 9 of 11 patients (82%) successfully completed at least 3 days of PP The median cumulative time spent prone was 10 hours, the mean was 10 3 hours (range: 4 hours-13 5 hours) Of the 9 who survived, 100% demonstrated an improvement in S/F ratio with PP and 8 of 9 patients (89%) continued to maintain improved S/F ratios after completing the PP intervention CONCLUSIONS: PP is generally well tolerated, and no patients experienced desaturation with PP Our experience is similar to others who proned patients with ARDS who required HFNC or NIV While the optimal duration of PP remains unclear, patients who can tolerate at least 4 hours of PP appeared to maintain their S/F ratio gains through discharge A non-sustained or lack of S/F response to PP appeared associated with worse outcomes The impact of PP on escalation to ICU in our study remains unclear CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: PP is an easily implemented, low cost, and low risk intervention that could potentially aid in improving oxygenation in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who have not been intubated and require varying levels of supplemental oxygen support A lack of improvement in oxygenation with PP may also aid in identifying patients with worse outcomes DISCLOSURES: No relevant relationships by Jacob

simulation contributed to improved safety through identification and prompt resolution of latent safety threats (LSTs) METHODS: A QI initiative involving front-line stakeholders in two large community hospitals was launched focusing on protected code blue and pre-code scenarios In-situ simulations were adapted to multiple wards, including the emergency department, labour and delivery, general medicine, intensive care, diagnostic imaging, the operating room and post anesthetic care unit, the coronary catheterization lab, and renal dialysis LSTs included concerns related to the protected code blue resuscitation and those unique to individual department environments Real-time solutions were adopted and rapidly disseminated through both institutions RESULTS: Over a three-month period (March to May, 2020), we conducted over 30 in-situ simulations LSTs included breaches in donning and doffing, lack of clarity in roles and responsibilities, gaps in strategies to minimize aerosolization, barriers for effective team communication, and patient transfer logistics Institution-wide policies were developed in real-time and distributed to hospital staff after each cycle to

This trend is more pronounced in females. Although the aetiology is still unclear, there is mounting evidence that genetic syndromes can play a key role in development of oral cancers in this patient group. We report the first case of oral squamous cell carcinoma (oSCC) in a young adult with an MYH9-related disorder (MYH9-RD). CASE PRESENTATION: A 19-year-old female with a germline MYH9 variant (missense variant in exon 2: c.287C > T, (p.Ser96Leu)) was referred to the head and neck surgery department for investigation of a painful, thick right tongue ulcer. She was diagnosed with Epstein syndrome, an MYH9-RD, at 12 years of age. Her main phenotypic features were profound thrombocytopenia and marked renal impairment. The tongue biopsy confirmed SCC. Preoperative positron emission tomography (PET) revealed avidity in the right tongue and ipsilateral level 2A neck lymph node. With substantial preoperative multidisciplinary input, she underwent cancer ablation and microvascular free flap reconstruction. Her pathology showed a 35 mm diameter, 14 mm thick moderately differentiated SCC with perineural and lymphovascular invasion. Two out of 38 right neck nodes were positive for metastasis with extranodal extension. None of the 34 left neck nodes was involved. She had an uneventful recovery and was discharged home on day 6 postoperative day. On day 15 postoperative day, she had catastrophic bleeding in the neck with a respiratory arrest after a forceful cough. She required an emergency tracheostomy and returned to the theatre for haemostasis. Following a short inpatient stay, she was again discharged home and underwent adjuvant therapy consisting of external beam radiotherapy of 60Gy in 30 fractions. On clinical examination and PET at 6 months after surgery, she had no evidence of disease recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: MYH9-RD can present with advanced locoregional oral cavity malignancy at an early age. The combination of profound thrombocytopenia and marked renal impairment can impact heavily on routine major head and neck cancer surgery and adjuvant treatment. This rare and challenging condition underlines the importance of early detection of cancer and multidisciplinary team input.","output":"MYH9 mutation and squamous cell cancer of the tongue in a young adult: a novel case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article describes the impact of the economic crisis caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic on enterprises from the service outsourcing industry operating in 11 European countries.

Although the resultant reduction in vascular permeability is initially protective against pulmonary oedema, the process becomes maladaptive causing a restrictive lung syndrome with impaired gas exchange. This pathological process may also contribute to PH (pulmonary hypertension) due to LHD.

The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the molecular and serological prevalence of influenza A virus (IAV) in backyard swine populations globally. RESULTS: We identified 34 full-text research articles in NCBI-PubMed and Google Scholar databases that have reported IAV sero- and/or virological prevalence in backyard swine up to 11 July 2021. The highest number of studies were reported from Asia (n = 11) followed by North America (n = 10), South America (n = 6), Africa (n = 6), and Europe (n = 1). While the maximum number of studies (44.12%) reported human-to-swine transmission of IAV, swine-to-human (5.88%), poultry-to-swine (5.88%), and wild birds-to-swine (2.94%) transmissions were also reported. An overall higher IAV seroprevalence (18.28%) in backyard swine was detected compared to the virological prevalence (1.32%). The human-origin pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 virus clade 1A.3.3.2 was the more frequently detected IAV subtype in virological studies (27.27%) than serological studies (18.92%). In addition, the avian-origin highly pathogenic H5N1 and H5N8 viruses were also detected, which further substantiated the evidence of avianCswine interactions in the backyards.

These actions are involved in onset and progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, simultaneous removal of cytokines and activated neutrophils, including PNCs by blood purification may prevent development of ARDS and enhance drug effects. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of a newly developed adsorption column (NOA-001) that eliminates cytokines and activated neutrophils in a lung injury model. RESULTS: Adsorption of cytokines, such as IL-8, IL-6 and HMGB-1, and PNCs was first measured in vitro. Lung injury was induced by HCl and lipopolysaccharide intratracheal infusion in rabbits ventilated at a low tidal volume (7C8 mL/kg) and PEEP (2.5 cmH(2)O) for lung protection. Arterial blood gas, hematologic values, plasma IL-8, blood pressure and heart rate were measured, and lung damage was evaluated histopathologically in animals treated with 8-h direct hemoperfusion with or without use of NOA-001. The in vitro adsorption rates for IL-8, IL-6, HMGB-1, activated granulocytes and PNCs were 99.5 (99.4C99.5)%, 63.9 (63.4C63.9)%, 57.6 (57.4C62.1)%, 9.9 (-4.4C21.3)% and 60.9 (49.0C67.6)%, respectively. Absorption of PNCs onto fibers was confirmed microscopically. These adsorption effects were associated with several improvements in the rabbit model. In respiratory function, the PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratios at 8 h were 314  55 mmHg in the NOA-001 group and 134  41 mmHg in the sham group. The oxygenation index and PaCO(2) at 8 h were 9.6  3.1 and 57.0  9.6 mmHg in the sham group and 3.0  0.8 and 40.4  4.5 mmHg in the NOA-001 group, respectively (p < 0.05).

Therefore, the way we manage our food systems needs to be urgently changed if the goal is to achieve food security and sustainable development more quickly. This review paper analyzes the nexus climate-smart agriculture-food systems-sustainable development in order to draw sound ways that could allow rapid transformation of food systems in the context of climate change pressure. We followed an integrative review approach based on selected concrete example-experiences from ground-implemented projects across Africa (Ghana, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, in West Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania in East Africa). Mostly composed of examples from the Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security (CCAFS) Research Program of the CGIAR (former Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) and its partners, these also included ground initiatives from non-CGIAR that could provide demonstrable conditions for a transformative agriculture and food systems. The lessons learnt from the ground implementation of climate-smart agriculture (CSA), in the African context, were instrumental to informing the actions areas of the food-system transformation framework suggested in this paper (reroute, de-risk, reduce, and realign). Selected CSA example-cases to inform these action areas included 24 initiatives across Africa, but with a focus on the following studies for an in-depth analysis: (1) the climate-smart village approach to generate knowledge on climate-smart agriculture (CSA) technologies and practices for their scaling, (2) the use of climate information services (CIS) to better manage climate variability and extremes, and (3) the scienceCpolicy interfacing to mainstream CSA into agricultural development policies and plans. The analysis of these examples showed that CSA can contribute driving a rapid change of food systems in Africa through: (1) the implementation of relevant climate-smart technologies and practices to reroute farming and rural livelihoods to new climate-resilient and low-emission trajectories;(2) the development and application of weather and climate information services (WCIS) that support de-risking of livelihoods, farms, and value chains in the face of increasing vagaries of weather and extreme events;(3) the use of climate-smart options that minimize waste of all the natural resources used for growing, processing, packaging, transporting, and marketing food, and therefore mitigating the carbon footprint attached to this food loss and waste;and (4) the realignment of policies and finance that facilitate action in the four proposed action areas through the identification of news ways to mobilize sustainable finance and create innovative financial mechanisms and delivery channels.","output":"Transforming Food Systems in Africa under Climate Change Pressure: Role of Climate-Smart Agriculture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has required health services to rapidly respond to the needs of people diagnosed with the virus.

However, returning to hospital impacts the family in many ways. We hypothesized that in-person follow-up is not necessary after an uncomplicated procedure, and that caregivers would prefer an alternate follow-up. METHODS We surveyed caregivers of children less than 17 years of age who underwent a simple appendectomy, pyloromyotomy, cholecystectomy, or repair of an inguinal or umbilical hernia. With REB approval and caregiver consent, surveys were completed in-person during clinic visits and by telephone for alternate follow-up plans. RESULTS Despite interruptions due to COVID-19, 24 surveys were completed (clinic visit group N = 7, alternate plan group N = 17). Thirteen families resided in Winnipeg. The majority rated their overall satisfaction with follow-up as good-excellent (6/7 clinic group, 17/17 alternate group). The most frequent impacts to attend clinic were time off work (18/24), parking (17/24), gas costs (17/24), time from school (13/24) and childcare arrangements (12/24). The median estimated cost to attend clinic was 142 CAD$. Most families preferred an alternate plan (18/24) (i.e. call surgeon only if concerned, follow-up with their primary care provider or attend virtually). Only 4 children having an alternate follow-up plan required medical treatment for minor issues. DISCUSSION We conclude there is significant impact on families to attend a post-operative in-person clinic visit. Although all respondents rated their satisfaction highly, the majority preferred the option of an alternate plan.

It aimed to decrease emergency call-outs, improve patient flow and improve timeliness of assessment and treatment. Literature relating to the efficacy of emergency and weekend physiotherapy services in the UK is limited due to inter-service variation. Local factors serve as barriers and facilitators to the provision of these services, justifying the need to evaluate services individually.AimsTo determine the viability and staff acceptability of the RWLS. Viability was defined as the success of the RWLS in meeting its three main aims, staff acceptance was defined as its perceived success.MethodMixed-methods design. Quantitative data was collected prospectively using a bespoke data collection form completed by staff at the end of their shift. Data included;number of patients seen, area of speciality, emergency calls attended and number of discharges per shift. An online semi-structured focus group with staff who worked the RWLS explored staff perceptions of the success and future acceptability of the RWLS, in depth.ResultsThe RWLS successfully reduced emergency call-outs by a mean of 1.06 call-outs per shift. Patient flow, measured by the number of interventions facilitating discharge was not directly improved, although staff felt discharge planning was initiated sooner. Staff felt the RWLS improved timeliness of assessment and treatment, but reported inefficiencies related to handover. The RWLS was well accepted by staff due to the shifts perceived benefits to patients, COVID-19 socialisation restrictions and overtime pay. Junior staff felt working the RWLS aided transition to emergency on-call work. Concerns included maintaining staff commitment and lone-working.Conclusion and RecommendationsThe RWLS appears viable, two of three main aims were met. Further investigations into patient benefit and flow, cost and handover efficiency would potentially improve the justification for implementing the service long-term. Staff accepted continuing the RWLS following the trial period. Maintenance of the service may require opt-in rostering, and promotion of the benefits to staff in light of the potential easing of COVID-19 restrictions.","output":"The viability and acceptability of a respiratory physiotherapy weekend late shift service: a service evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Faecal sludge (FS) management is pertinent to the achievement of sustainable development goal 6.2 around the world; yet it is constrained by urbanisation challenges, waste management complexities, and defective attitudes. These deny communities of the plausible supply of resources from FS. This paper assesses the perception underpinning the occurrence of nonfaecal matter in FS in Ghana. Primary data were obtained from 400 respondents in four communities in Brong Ahafo and Greater Accra Regions of Ghana, using a structured questionnaire. Data were analysed by using STATA software version 15. Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression were conducted on all independent variables and statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. The study identified the following as the most perceived frequently disposed nonfaecal matter into FS: sanitary pads and diapers (38.5%), fabrics/rags (23.2%), toilet rolls (20.8%), razor/shaving sticks (10.3%), and others (7.2%). Gender, state of toilet facility (roof or unroofed), presence of container for collecting other types of waste in the toilet room, and state of container in toilet room either covered or uncovered were the factors found to be significantly associated with the disposal of solid waste (SW) into FS at 95% confidence level. The fear of exposing used sanitary materials for rituals, the use of fabric as an alternative to toilet rolls, and the desire to conceal aborted pregnancies from the public were some of the reasons alluded to the disposal acts. Education and awareness campaigns on proper SW disposal practices, appropriate use of toilet facilities, and the resource potentials of FS were found to be the best way forward to discourage indiscriminate disposal of SW into FS.","output":"Conceptual Behaviour Underpinning the Occurrence of Nonfaecal Matter in Faecal Sludge in Some Urban Communities, Ghana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text].","output":"Broad betacoronavirus neutralization by a stem helix-specific human antibody"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND This study aimed to compare laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair with conventional laparoscopic TEP repair for the treatment of inguinal hernias. To date, no other studies have compared the LESS and conventional laparoscopic TEP approaches for the treatment of inguinal hernia in a prospective randomized study setting. METHODS For this study, 100 patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair were prospectively randomized into either the LESS TEP group or the conventional laparoscopic TEP group. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative factors were recorded. The primary end point was postoperative pain. The patients were interviewed at outpatient clinics at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS The demographic data were comparable between the two groups. The median operative time was longer in the LESS TEP group (63.5 min) than in the conventional TEP group (50.5 min) (p = 0.001). No conversion was performed in either group. The mean pain score 2 h postoperatively during rest was significantly higher in the conventional TEP group than in the LESS TEP group (3.9 vs. 2.6; p = 0.02).

Several factors may influence a person's willingness to report symptoms and their ability to access healthcare services. Understanding these factors has become urgent during the COVID-19 pandemic. To determine which factors influence symptom reporting during an emerging infectious disease outbreak, we conducted a rapid review of the evidence. Studies included in the review were based on primary research, published in a peer-reviewed journal, written in English, included factors associated with symptom reporting or accessing healthcare, and were related to a major public health incident involving an infectious disease outbreak. Five themes were identified as facilitators of symptom reporting or accessing healthcare: accurate and informative communication about the disease and the need to seek help, symptom severity, concern about disease exposure, ease of access to healthcare facilities, and relationship with the healthcare provider. Seven themes were identified as barriers to symptom reporting or accessing healthcare: lack of knowledge of the disease and its treatment, fear of the disease and fear of subsequent treatments or requirements, stigmatization attached to having a disease, invasion of privacy, low concern about symptoms, economic consequences of disease diagnosis, and challenges related to attending a healthcare facility. For contract tracing services to be effective, members of the public need to have the capability, opportunity, and motivation to use them.

Methods: Analysis of procedures in dealing with a residential unit affected by SARS-CoV-2, accommodating a risk group of 60 seniors with dementia is presented as well as a detailed presentation of post-mortem examination results of all 8 deceased tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Out of 60 residents, 39 were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Due to preventive procedures it was possible to stop further spreading of the infection to other residential areas. In all 8 fatal cases, the autopsy diagnosis was death due to COVID-19. Autopsies revealed all COVID-19 patients to have a fatal (broncho)pneumonia and signs of relevant pre-existing cardiac, renal and pulmonary conditions in all cases.

The seriousness of the disease has led many healthcare professionals plagued by stigma as well as discrimination. In this study, depressive symptomatology, levels of anxiety, and related psychosocial and occupational factors experienced by healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka during COVID -19 were investigated. METHODS: A total of 512 healthcare professionals were surveyed using an online survey. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised-10, and psychosocial and occupational factors predictive of depression and anxiety were included in the survey questionnaire. Logistic regression determined the factors associated with the presence of depressive symptoms and anxiety. RESULTS: Results showed that elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety were experienced by 53.3% and 51.3%, respectively, of the participants. No differences in the prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety were found between those who were exposed and non-exposed to COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients. Having a fear of being infected with COVID-19 and spreading it among family members were associated with increased risk of depression. Among those exposed to COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients, poor occupational safety (OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.25C3.39), stigmatization (OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.29C3.72), and heavy workload (OR = 2.45, 95% CI 1.53C3.92) were associated with increased risk of elevated depressive symptoms, whilst poor self-confidence (OR = 2.53, 95% CI 1.56C4.09) and heavy workload (OR = 1.94. 95% CI 1.22C3.12) were associated with increased risk of anxiety.

An important result was the mediating role of perceived utility of e-learning methods, perceived utility mediated the associations between compatibility of online methods and satisfaction toward the use of e-learning methods. The perceived compatibility of e-Learning methods with online music education led to a higher perceived utility which, in turn, predicted a higher satisfaction toward e-Learning Although this period accentuated the fear of interaction with others, the anxiety related to the unknown, the intolerance of uncertainty did not predict the satisfaction toward the use of e-learning platforms.

Consolidation in this market will have notable effects on the delivery and cost of orthopaedic services. In this study, we identified major trends in orthopaedic practice acquisitions over the past decade. METHODS: A list of acquisition deals between 2010 and 2019 was compiled from four business databases: S&P Capital IQ, CB Insights, Thomson ONE, and Zephyr. Deals were categorized as PE-backed or not PE-backed. Headquarter locations of the buying and selling companies and transaction value were obtained for each deal when available. RESULTS: A total of 68 deals were obtained of which 5 (7.4%) were PE-backed. The buyer and seller were located in the same state in 50 (73.5%) of the deals. Transaction values were available for only four deals ranging from $2.52 million to $35 million. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that consolidation of orthopaedic practices from 2010 to 2019 was driven by large healthcare entities rather than PE firms.

The flow rate, type, and severity of cases presented to emergency departments varied during the pandemic in comparison to the past years. However, this change has not been well-described among the cases of hospital admission due to toxic exposure. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Recognition of the pattern of toxic exposure among the cases refereed to Tanta Poison Control Center (TPCC; Tanta, Egypt) during the past five years, and furthermore, exploration of the impact of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the pattern of presented cases. METHODS: The current study is a five-year retrospective, comparative cross-sectional study carried out among acutely intoxicated patients admitted to TPCC during the spring months (March through May) of 2016-2020. A total of 1,916 patients with complete medical records were recruited. The type and manner of toxic exposure, demographic, clinical data, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The current study noted that there were delays in time from toxic exposure to emergency services during the lockdown period. This was reflected in significant lower recovery rates (884.8/1,000 population; z = -3.0) and higher death rates (49.4/1,000 population; z = 2.1) despite the marked decrease in the total number of hospital admissions in comparison to the past four years. The lockdown period showed significantly higher phosphides (z = 3.5; &#967;2 = 34.295; P <.001) and antipsychotics exposure (z = 3.6; &#967;2 = 21.494; P <.001) than the previous years. However, predominance of female exposure and intentional self-poisoning was maintained over the past five years, including the lockdown. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-associated lockdown greatly reformed the usual intoxication pattern of the cases admitted to emergency room. Also, it played a role in delaying time of hospital arrival, which was reflected as lower recovery rates and higher death rates.","output":"Impact of Lockdown due to COVID-19 on the Modalities of Intoxicated Patients Presenting to the Emergency Room"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lockdown declared to prevent the spread of Covid 19 in India created unforeseen problems, including severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms and the need to manage them.

Current procedures involve collection of venous blood at MVP enrollment sites. To examine home specimen collection options, MVP performed a pilot study comparing two blood specimen collection devices and evaluated SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays to determine known COVID-19 infection or vaccination. METHODS: A sub-sample of MVP Veteran participants were asked to self-collect a capillary blood specimen using the Neoteryx Mitra Clamshell (up to 120uL dried blood) or Tasso-SST (up to 200uL liquid blood) per the vendor instructions. Veterans were randomly assigned to a device prior to consent. Eligibility included 30% of Veterans with known COVID-19 diagnosis or vaccination and sampling time was variable from these events. Veterans rated their device experience and shipped collected specimens directly to an MVP laboratory. Mitra tip (4) blood was eluted in 1 mL of 0.9% normal saline for 1 hour at room temperature shaking at 300 rpm. Tasso tubes were centrifuged per vendor instructions. All samples were stored at -80C until tested with SARS-Cov-2 antibody (Ab) assays (InBios Spike IgG, BioRad Nucleocapsid (NC) Total Ab, Abbott NC IgG, and Abbott Spike IgG II) per vendor instructions. RESULTS: 312 MVP participants consented to the pilot (52%) of which 136 (43.6%) were sent Mitra and 176 (56.4%) were sent Tasso-SST (Table 1). Participants rated the Mitra Tasso-SST equally on average as 4.4 on a 0-5 usability scale. The Abbott IgG II assay had the highest sensitivity across both devices (87% Mitra and 98% Tasso-SST) for detecting known COVID infection and/or vaccination.

This study was initiated by the Norwegian Army to evaluate potential outcomes during failure of oxygen supply, and to explore physiology during acute severe hypobaric hypoxia. A simulated HAHO without supplemental oxygen was carried out in a hypobaric chamber with decompression to 30,000 ft (9,144 m) and then recompression to ground level with a descent rate of 1,000 ft/min (305 m/min). Nine subjects were studied. Repeated arterial blood gas samples were drawn throughout the entire hypoxic exposure. Additionally, pulse oximetry, cerebral oximetry, and hemodynamic variables were monitored. Desaturation evolved rapidly and the arterial oxygen tensions are among the lowest ever reported in volunteers during acute hypoxia. PaO2 decreased from baseline 18.4 (17.3-19.1) kPa, 138.0 (133.5-143.3) mmHg, to a minimum value of 3.3 (2.9-3.7) kPa, 24.8 (21.6-27.8) mmHg, after 180 (60-210) s, [median (range)], N = 9. Hyperventilation with ensuing hypocapnia was associated with both increased arterial oxygen saturation and cerebral oximetry values, and potentially improved tolerance to severe hypoxia.

The arterial oxygen tensions reported in this hypobaric chamber study are among the lowest ever reported during acute hypoxia.","output":"Acute hypoxia in a simulated high-altitude airdrop scenario due to oxygen system failure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Mechanical ventilation, especially large tidal volume (Vt) one-lung ventilation (OLV), can cause ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) that can stimulate cytokines. Meanwhile, cytokines are considered very important factor influencing coronary heart disease (CHD) patient prognosis. So minimization of pulmonary inflammatory responses by reduction of cytokine levels for CHD undergoing lung resection during OLV should be a priority. Because previous studies have demonstrated that lung-protective ventilation (LPV) reduced lung inflammation, this ventilation approach was studied for CHD patients undergoing lung resection here to evaluate the effects of LPV on pulmonary inflammatory responses. Methods This is a single center, randomized controlled trial. Primary endpoint of the study are plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and C-reactive protein (CRP). Secondary endpoints include respiratory variables and hemodynamic variables. 60 CHD patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic lung resection were randomly divided into conventional ventilation group [10 mL/kg Vt and 0 cmH2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), C group] and protective ventilation group (6 mL/kg Vt and 6 cmH2O PEEP, P group; 30 patients/group). Hemodynamic variables, peak inspiratory pressure (Ppeak), dynamic compliance (Cdyn), arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) and arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) were recorded as test data at three time points: T1-endotracheal intubation for two-lung ventilation (TLV) when breathing and hemodynamics were stable; T2-after TLV was substituted with OLV when breathing and hemodynamics were stable; T3-OLV was substituted with TLV at the end of surgery when breathing and hemodynamics were stable. The concentrations of TNF-, IL-6, IL-10 and CRP in patients' blood in both groups at the very beginning of OLV (beginning of OLV) and the end moment of the surgery (end of surgery) were measured. Results The P group exhibited greater PaO2, higher Cdyn and lower Ppeak than the C group at T2, T3 (P<0.05). At the end moment of the surgery, although the P group tended to exhibit higher TNF- and IL-10 values than the C group, the differences did not reach statistical significance(P=0.0817, P=0.0635). Compared with C group at the end moment of the surgery, IL-6 and CRP were lower in P group, the differences were statistically significant (P=0.0093, P=0.0005). There were no significant differences in hemodynamic variables between the two groups (P>0.05). Conclusions LPV can effectively reduce the airway pressure, improve Cdyn and PaO2, reduce concentrations of IL-6 and CRP during lung resection of CHD patients.Trial registration: The trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry.","output":"Effect of lung protective ventilation on coronary heart disease patients undergoing lung cancer resection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Resilience is the capability, resources, and processes that are available to a person or system to adapt successfully in the face of stress or adversity. Given that resilience can be enhanced, using advances in technology to deliver and evaluate the impact of resilience interventions is warranted. Evidence supports the effectiveness of the resilience-building JoyPop app in improving resilience-related outcomes after use; however, experiential data from users is also needed to provide a more comprehensive account of its utility. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore users experiences with the JoyPop app and their perspectives on its utility. METHODS: This qualitative description study involved a combination of group and one-on-one semistructured interviews with a subset of first-year undergraduate students who participated in a larger evaluation of the JoyPop app. Participants used the app for a 4-week period and were subsequently asked about their frequency of app use, most and least used features (and associated reasons), most and least helpful features (and associated reasons), barriers to use, facilitators of use and continuation, and recommendations for improvement. Data were coded and categorized through inductive content analysis. RESULTS: The sample of 30 participants included 24 females and 6 males, with a mean age of 18.77 years (SD 2.30). App use ranged from 1 to 5 times daily (mean 2.11, SD 0.74), with the majority indicating that they used the app at least twice daily. The Rate My Mood, Journal, and SquareMoves features were reported to be used most often, while the Rate My Mood, Journal, and Breathing Exercises features were identified as the most helpful. A number of themes and subthemes pertaining to facilitators of app use (prompts, creating routine, self-monitoring opportunities, expressive opportunities), barriers to app use (editing, lack of variety, student lifestyle), outcomes of app use (increased awareness, checking in with oneself, helpful distraction, emotional control), and recommendations for app improvement (adding more features, enhancing existing features, enhancing tracking abilities, providing personalization) were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the aspects of the JoyPop app that motivated and benefitted users, as well as measures that can be taken to improve user experiences and promote longer-term uptake. Users were willing to engage with the app and incorporate it into their routine, and they valued the ability to self-monitor, express emotion, and engage in distraction.","output":"User Perspectives on a Resilience-Building App (JoyPop): Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the search for digital approaches in mental health treatment, particularly due to patients and clinicians practicing social distancing.

ALI is partly caused by host immune responses. Under the inspiration of unsuccessful treatment in COVID-19, recent insights into pathogenChost interactions are leading to identification and development of a wide range of host-directed therapies with different mechanisms of action. The interaction unit consisting of macrophages and the alveolar epithelial cells has recently revealed as the therapeutic basis targeting ALI. Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule is the most effective and commonly-used clinical formula in treating respiratory infection for thousands of years in China. However, little is known about its relevance with ALI, especially its protective role against ALI-induced alveolar tissue damages. Aiming to evaluate its contribution in antibiotics-integrating therapies, this study pharmacologically verified whether LHQW could alleviate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and explore its potential mechanisms in maintaining the physiology of macrophage-epithelial unit. In ALI mouse model, the pathological parameters, including the anal temperature, inflammation condition, lung edema, histopathological structures, have all been systematically analyzed. Results consistently supported the effectiveness of the combined strategy for LHQW and low-dose antibiotics. Furthermore, we established the macrophages-alveolar epithelial cells co-culture model and firstly proved that LHQW inhibited LPS-induced ER stress and TRAIL secretion in macrophages, thereby efficiently protected epithelial cells against TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, results showed that LHQW significantly deactivated NF-B and reversed the SOCS3 expression in inflammatory macrophages. Furthermore, we proved that the therapeutic effects of LHQW were highly dependent on JNK-AP1 regulation. In conclusion, our data proved that LHQW is an epithelial protector in ALI, implying its promising potential in antibiotic alternative therapy.","output":"Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsules, a Potent Epithelial Protector in Acute Lung Injury Model, Block Proapoptotic Communication Between Macrophages, and Alveolar Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents an ongoing doctoral study exploring the entrepreneurial intention of pilot public vocational high school students in entrepreneurship development programs in Jakarta, Indonesia.

As of early December 2021, 75.1% of the whole Veneto population has been fully vaccinated. Vaccine efficacy has been demonstrated in many clinical trials, but reports on real-world contexts are still necessary. We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 2,233,399 residents in the Veneto region to assess the reduction in the COVID-19 burden, taking different outcomes into consideration. First, we adopted a non-brand-specific approach borrowed from survival analysis to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in preventing infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. We used t-tests and multivariate regressions to examine vaccine impact on breakthrough infections, in terms of the persistence of positivity and the length of hospital stays. Evidence emerging from this study suggests that unvaccinated individuals are significantly more likely to become infected, need hospitalization, and are at a higher risk of death from COVID-19 than those given at least one dose of vaccine. Cox models indicate that the effectiveness of full vaccination is 88% against infection, 94% against hospitalization, and 95% against death. Multivariate regressions suggest that vaccination is significantly correlated with a shorter period of positivity and shorter hospital stays, with each step toward completion of the vaccination cycle coinciding with a reduction of 3.3 days in the persistence of positivity and 2.3 days in the length of hospital stay.","output":"The Effectiveness of a Diverse COVID-19 Vaccine Portfolio and Its Impact on the Persistence of Positivity and Length of Hospital Stays: The Veneto Regions Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Review meetings are critical activities aiding successful implementation of mass administration of medicines (MAM) for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) control.

Despite their many benefits, biometric devices are potential sources of transmission due to contamination from multiple touches by various users. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been massive shift in infection control practices specially hand hygiene. This study was conducted to understand the attitude and practices of healthcare workers (HCWs) they are likely to follow when biometric devices come to use again. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted using a self-designed questionnaire given to HCWs in different departments of the hospital in the form of a written form by our infection control nurses. The study was conducted for 5 days. The questionnaire was based on various attitudes and practices before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Results: Overall 304 participants filled the questionnaire, which comprised 85 (28%) doctors, 117 (38.4%) nurses and 102 (33.6%) other staff. Before the emergence of COVID-19, 114 (37.5%) participants felt touching biometric devices is more dangerous than touching other common items such as doorknobs, elevator buttons, countertops and staircase railings which now increased to 183 (60.2%) after the COVID-19. Earlier 77% of participants felt that hand sanitisers should be installed near biometric devices, but now 95.7% feel the need of hand sanitisers near the biometric devices and want to use them. Conclusion: This improvement in hand hygiene might be a result of increased awareness through educational programmes and mass media during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here, we analyze the socioeconomic effects - defined as health gains, lockdown-easing benefit, and supply-chain rebuilding benefit - of a set of idealized vaccine distribution scenarios, by coupling an epidemiological model with a global trade-modeling framework. We find that overall a perfectly equitable vaccine distribution across the world (Altruistic Age-informed Distribution Strategy) would increase global economic benefits by 11.7% ($950 billion) per year, compared to a strategy focusing on vaccinating the entire population within vaccine-producing countries first and then distributing vaccines to non-vaccine-producing countries (Selfish Distribution Strategy). With limited doses among mid- and low-income countries, prioritizing the elderly who are at high risk of dying, together with the key workforce who are at high risk of exposure, is found to be economically beneficial. We further show that such a strategy would cascade the protection to other production sectors while rebuilding the supply chains.

We aimed to analyse the clinical presentation, treatment modalities, outcomes, and prognostic factors of adenoviral TTS, as well as identify predictors for mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched and the resulting articles were reviewed. A total of 6 case series and 13 case reports (64 patients) of TTS after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination were included. We performed a pooled analysis and developed a novel scoring system to predict mortality. The overall mortality of TTS after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination was 35.9% (23/64). In our analysis, age 60 years, platelet count <25  10(3)/L, fibrinogen <150 mg/dL, the presence of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), and the presence of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) were significantly associated with death and were selected as predictors for mortality (1 point each). We named this novel scoring system FAPIC (fibrinogen, age, platelet count, ICH, and CVT), and the C-statistic for the FAPIC score was 0.837 (95% CI 0.732C0.942). Expected mortality increased with each point increase in the FAPIC score, at 2.08, 6.66, 19.31, 44.54, 72.94, and 90.05% with FAPIC scores 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The FAPIC scoring model was internally validated through cross-validation and bootstrapping, then externally validated on a panel of TTS patients after Ad26.COV2.S administration. CONCLUSIONS: Fibrinogen levels, age, platelet count, and the presence of ICH and CVT were significantly associated with mortality in patients with TTS, and the FAPIC score comprising these risk factors could predict mortality. The FAPIC score could be used in the clinical setting to recognize TTS patients at high risk of adverse outcomes and provide early intensive interventions including intravenous immunoglobulins and

strict on HSE issue The onset and prevalence of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an example of a lack of attention to such standards and guidelines Adherence to such standards is much more important in all organizations, especially in health-oriented organizations such as hospitals, and they increases safety and improves the efficiency of hospitals and the community (environment) Because health and safety factors are closely related to ergonomic factors (E), attention to this factor has led to the evolution of HSE and the emergence of HSEE Much research has been done on HSE management, related evaluations, and other related issues However, due to the novelty of HSEE, such models have rarely been researched in HSEE In addition, in previous models, the weight of all factors was considered the same, and the evaluations were practically turned into checklists While in any organization or in any situation, the importance of observing some factors may be more or less than others, and at the same time the ergonomic factor should be considered in this model The purpose of this study is to provide a quantitative model for measuring the performance of organizational units based on the observance of the usual HSE criteria and consider the ergonomic factor (HSEE) Numerous studies have shown that ergonomics play a major role in increasing human performance in all areas Developing such a model can lead to more accurate information to managers and their better decision-making in order to reduce harm in the organization as well as organization environment It will also provide more accurate feedback to the organization's units for self-assessment and calculation of any points for them, and ultimately ranking the units Research Method: Since the result of this research is a model that can be used in practice by organizations (especially hospitals), this research is an applied research It is also a descriptive study because it explores the current situation and tries to describe and clarify it and present the result in the form of a quantitative model Finally, because the data in this study is collected through a questionnaire, it is a survey study In the first phase, studies related to the HSE and HSEE models were reviewed In each model, the main variables (health, safety, environment and ergonomics) were collected along with the following variables for each Then, by combining them into one large model, all variables entered the model and overlaps were eliminated Because this model is made for a hospital, the variables were redefined based on the characteristics of the hospital and the model was modified Finally, a model including the main variables of safety, health, environment and ergonomics and 12 sub-variables were designed and a research questionnaire was developed To calculate the reliability of this questionnaire, Cronbach's alpha method with 11 samples were used This sample was selected by emphasizing on people's familiarity with HSE and HSEE models The alpha value was calculated to be greater than 0 8 and the reliability of the questionnaire was confirmed In order to discover the relationship between the 4 main factors and 12 sub-factors, the DEMATEL method with 8 samples was used DEMATEL's method is a well-known method used to the models with independent variables Using the initial classification of factors as well as HSE(E), the decision tree was designed based on ANP method and also the weight of the indicators was obtained The ANP method is based on pairwise comparisons and a subset of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques used to discover the weight of criteria simultaneously with ranking alternatives Because each of the ANP and DEMATEL questionnaires requires a lot of patience and concentration, the YungLan method was used to combine DEMATEL and ANP In this method, the data collection is required only once by he questionnaire and this data is reused in both models At this stage, the weight of 12 factors was calculated and the research model was completely architectural The designed model was implemented in ArabNia Hospital in Qom The goal is to determine how well each of the eight units in the hospital complies with HSEE ArabNia Hospital is the first hospital in Iran, Qom, where patients with COVID-19 were quarantined in February 2020 Because there was no information on how well each of the HSEE components were observed in the hospital, a simple questionnaire using the Likert's spectrum was designed to collect this information This questionnaire was published in a total of 8 units and 11 questionnaires were completed This data was entered into the model as input, and after analysis, hospital units were ranked based on compliance with safety, health, environmental and ergonomic criteria Results: The most important achievement of this research is a quantitative model including 4 areas of safety, health, environment and ergonomics with 12 sub-variables The results showed a correlation between the main domains as well as the research variables Identifying these connections revealed that the decision hierarchy is network type and the model governing the problem is ANP type However, in some research the AHP model was used for this purpose The premise of this model is that the variables are sufficiently independent of each other, which was rejected in this study The results of using this model in the study area also showed that ergonomic factor has the greatest impact on other macro factors, and employee factor has the greatest impact on other 11 sub-variables of research This model was used to evaluate all 8 units of the hospital The goal is to determine how well each of these units complies with HSEE If there is data related to the observance of each sub-variable by each unit in the hospital documents, the relevant data can be entered into the model and after analysis, the amount of HSEE observance by each unit can be determined Because many cases are not recorded in organizations, access to the necessary data is not possible through the hospital's databases Since the organization's staff are the only ones who have a lot of data and metadata in their mental history (albeit to some extent, vague and erroneous), a questionnaire was used to solve this problem For ease of response, the Likert range was used in qualitative measurements This questionnaire was distributed in 8 units and 11 questionnaires were completed and received The required data were analyzed by the research model and 8 hospital units were ranked based on HSEE compliance The results showed that, firstly, the weight of each of the 12 factors of the HSEE model is not the same, and secondly, there is a relationship between them, and finally, the ranking of the units is not the same Conclusion: The results proved the power of model differentiation Using the results obtained in this study, the extent to each components of the HSEE model is affected and differ from each other The use of the model in ArabNia Hospital in Qom showed that the medical, financial and administrative equipment units are ranked first to third in the field of HSEE, respectively With the development of the HSEE measurement model, including the determination of indicators, sub-indicators, their relationship and the weight of each of them, it was found that the weight of the employee invoice is higher than other sub-factors This study provides a framework for measuring hospital performance in terms of HSEE compliance This model can be used in other hospitals as well The point to keep in mind is that it is necessary to recalculate the weight of the variables and sub-variables, which is very simple This model can also be used in other organizations Provided that all sub-variables are redefined in accordance with the same organization and replaced in the model It should be noted that the main foundation and architecture of the model is fixed, but due to the difference in th nature of organizations, such a change in the details of the model is necessary In addition, the relationship between the factors and their weight must be recalculated The results of this study are consistent with many studies conducted in the field of HSE, Including the fact that the human factor is very important in establishing HSE in organizations and complying with the relevant rules and regulations The difference between the model presented in this study and other research is that the relationship between the factors in this model is considered Although this is not explicitly stated, the use of AHP in some studies is due to the fact that independent HSE variables have been considered and the relationship between them have not been considered Some recent research has shown that the combination of DEMATEL and ANP has been used in the HSE model, which indicates an increase in accuracy in such research However, ergonomic factors are absent in these studies In the present study, an attempt has been made to pay attention to all these aspects ? 2020 Iran University of Medical Sciences All rights reserved","output":"Using the

When in excess, the truncated construct 285C422 inhibits the homodimerization of full-length N protein by forming a heterodimer with the full-length N protein. These results suggest that the N protein oligomerization involves the C-terminal residues 285C422, and this region is a good target for mutagenic studies to disrupt N protein self-association and virion assembly.","output":"Recombinant Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein Forms a Dimer through Its C-terminal Domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic situation due to COVID-19 is seriously affecting our daily work and life.

To mitigate this issues, we propose a Privacy-preserving contact Tracing scheme in 5G-integrated and Blockchain-based Medical applications, named PTBM. In PTBM, the 5G-integrated network is leveraged as the underlying infrastructure where everyone can perform location checking with his mobile phones or even wearable devices connected to 5G network to find whether they have been in possible contact with a diagnosed patient without violating their privacy. A trusted medical center can effectively trace the patients and their corresponding close contacts. Thorough security and performance analysis show that the proposed PTBM scheme achieves privacy protection, traceability, reliability, and authentication, with high computation & communication efficiency and low latency.","output":"Privacy-Preserving Contact Tracing in 5G-Integrated and Blockchain-Based Medical Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: While the debate regarding the usefulness of the lockdown goes on in research, it has been highlighted that this debate is pointless unless studies demonstrate to what extent people are actually abiding by the lockdown. Studies on factors associated with adherence of COVID-19-related lockdowns have largely been conducted in western countries. However, similar studies are still lacking in low income countries like Uganda. This study fills this gap by investigating factors associated with adherence to lockdown in Uganda. Methods A qualitative cross sectional survey was conducted online via the AfriSight platform with a sample size of 1249. These participants were selected randomly from all across Uganda. The data was analyzed descriptively and for inferential statistics we analyzed the data using probit regression. This allowed us to investigate the various motivations, socioeconomic, and demographic factors that help predict adherence or lack thereof to lockdown measures. Based on this probit analysis, we further generated marginal effects to ascertain the probabilities of adhering to lockdown. Results Our study reports the complexity that characterizes adherence to the lockdown in Uganda. Various socioeconomic and demographic factors particularly, age, gender, size of household, religion, income level, and employment status all seem to uniquely interact in shaping adherence behavior. Conclusion This study demonstrates that any lockdown-related efforts to minimize the spread of COVID-19 must pay attention to how these factors playout in the context of Uganda. Whereas most of the factors observed can more easily be handled in wealthier countries which provide social benefits during lockdowns, Uganda must rethink the uncritical adoption of such measures without localizing them. There is a need for Uganda to invest in a COVID-19 response that is alive to local context and reality, and one which commands wide support and adherence.","output":"Factors Associated With Adherence to Lockdown Measures in Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanomedicines (NMs) have emerged as an efficient approach for developing novel treatment strategies against a variety of diseases. Over the past few decades, NM formulations have received great attention, and a large number of studies have been performed in this field. Despite this, only about 60 nano-formulations have received industrial acceptance and are currently available for clinical use. Their in vivo pharmaceutical behavior is considered one of the main challenges and hurdles for the effective clinical translation of NMs, because it is difficult to monitor the pharmaceutic fate of NMs in the biological environment using conventional pharmaceutical evaluations. In this context, non-invasive imaging modalities offer attractive solutions, providing the direct monitoring and quantification of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behavior of labeled NMs in a real-time manner. Imaging evaluations have great potential for revealing the relationship between the physicochemical properties of NMs and their pharmaceutical profiles in living subjects. In this review, we introduced imaging techniques that can be used for in vivo NM evaluations. We also provided an overview of various studies on the influence of key parameters on the in vivo pharmaceutical behavior of NMs that had been visualized in a non-invasive and real-time manner.

Epipharyngeal abrasive therapy (EAT) is a treatment for epipharyngitis in Japan which involves applying zinc chloride to the epipharyngeal mucosa. In this study, we evaluated the expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in tissue samples from patients before and after EAT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study subjects were seven patients that had not been treated with EAT and 11 patients that had. For immunohistochemical assessment of the epipharyngeal mucosa, the staining intensity of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was described as an immunohistochemical score (IHC score). RESULTS: The IHC scores for ACE2 and TEMPRSS2 in the EAT-treated group were 3.40-fold and 1.81-fold lower, respectively, than those in the non-treated group (p=0.0208 and p=0.0244, respectively). CONCLUSION: EAT down-regulates the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Thus, EAT has potential as a novel COVID-19 preventative method.","output":"Epipharyngeal Abrasive Therapy Down-regulates the Expression of SARS-CoV-2 Entry Factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: While the number of COVID\\\\19 cases is increasing day by day, there is limited information known about the hematological and laboratory findings of the disease. We aimed to investigate whether serum ferritin level predicts mortality, is a marker for rapid progression for inpatients. METHODS: Our study included 56 patients who were died due to COVID\\\\19 as the study group, and 245 patients who were hospitalized and recovered as the control group. The laboratory data of the patients were evaluated from the first blood tests (pre) taken from the first moment of admittion to the hospital and the blood tests taken from before the patient's discharge or exitus (post) were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: The mean age of the nonsurvivor group was 62.0  15.7 and the mean age of the control group was 54.34  13.03. Age and length of stay are significantly higher in the nonsurvivor group. When comparing the pre and post values of ferritin, according to the two groups separately, there was no significant difference in the control group and a high level of significance was observed in the nonsurvivor group (p <0.01). CONCLUSION: COVID\\\\19 disease caused by SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 causes high mortality with widespread inflammation and cytokine storm.

We aim to identify which POC-tests (POCTs) of laboratory parameters are known, employed, and rated as useful by general practitioners (GPs). METHODS: A questionnaire with 27 POCTs was posted to a random selection of GPs (n = 451) in Saxony, Germany. RESULTS: A total of 208 GPs replied (response rate 46.1%). Out of 27 POCTs, each GP knew an average of 20.3 as laboratory parameters and 9.2 as POCTs. Urine test strips (99.0%), blood glucose test (98.1%), and Troponin I/T (86.4%) were the best-known, followed by INR/Quick (82.5%), Microalbumin (79.1%), and D-dimer (78.6%) POCTs. Yet, solely 0 to 13 POC tests were actually used (mean value 4.6). Urine test strips were employed most frequently (97.6%), followed by blood glucose test (94.7%), Troponin I/T (57.8%), Microalbumin (57.3%), and INR/Quick POCTs (41.7%). Heart fatty binding protein (H-FABP), Syphilis, Coeliac disease, and Malaria appeared as the least frequently used POCTs. The majority of the GPs declared 14 of the 27 POCTs to be useful. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The most recurrently employed POCTs are those for diagnosing or monitoring diabetes mellitus, ensued by POCTs addressing acute cardiovascular diseases (Troponin I/T, D-dimer) or monitoring the therapy of infectious diseases or the anticoagulant therapy. POCTs most often rated as useful by GPs are also widely known and frequently used. Nonetheless, the majority of GPs rate only a very limited number of POCTs as useful. Frequent concerns might be low economic benefit, over-reliance, and test accuracy coming along with the complex implementation of the tests requiring technical skills, accurate storage, and the correct interpretation of test results.

However, previous studies have indicated possible cross-reactivity of these assays, including in areas where malaria is endemic. We tested 213 well-characterized prepandemic samples from Nigeria using two SARS-CoV-2 serological assays, Abbott Architect IgG and Euroimmun NCP IgG assay, both targeting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. To assess antibody binding strength, an avidity assay was performed on these samples and on plasma from SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive persons. Thirteen (6.1%) of 212 samples run on the Abbott assay and 38 (17.8%) of 213 run on the Euroimmun assay were positive. Anti-Plasmodium IgG levels were significantly higher among false positives for both Abbott and Euroimmun; no association was found with active Plasmodium falciparum infection. An avidity assay using various concentrations of urea wash in the Euroimmun assay reduced loosely bound IgG: of 37 positive/borderline prepandemic samples, 46%, 86%, 89%, and 97% became negative using 2 M, 4 M, 5 M, and 8 M urea washes, respectively. The wash slightly reduced avidity of antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 patients within 28 days of PCR confirmation; thereafter, avidity increased for all urea concentrations except 8 M. This validation found moderate to substantial cross-reactivity on two SARS-CoV-2 serological assays using samples from a setting where malaria is endemic.

It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality because of mediastinal contamination and difficulty of access. Surgery in such septic patients exacts a heavy physiological price, mandating consideration of more conservative measures. We review our experience with transgastric drainage for esophageal perforation and high-risk anastomotic dehiscence. PATIENTS AND METHODS A select cohort of patients presenting with esophageal perforation, or complex anastomotic leaks, over 10 years were considered for transgastric drainage (TGD). A modified 36F chest drainage tube was inserted by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy technique, either endoscopically or at open surgery, and a negative pressure (-10 cmH2O) was applied until the leak had sealed. Endpoints include, length of stay, restoration of gastrointestinal tract continuity and mortality. RESULTS Of 14 patients treated, 10 had perforations and 4 had complex anastomotic leaks. Ten patients had drainage alone, while 4 required concomitant operative intervention. The median duration of drainage was 19.5 days. Complete restoration of gastrointestinal tract continuity was achieved in all patients. There was no procedure-related morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSION These results show that TGD is a safe and effective management strategy. We advocate its use alone or as an adjunct to operative treatment for esophageal perforation or anastomotic leaks. This is the first report of completely endoscopic TGD for esophageal perforation.","output":"Transgastric Drainage for Esophageal Injuries: A Dynamic Strategy for a Heterogenous Patient Cohort."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The major threat of COVID-19 has become a priority to education and health systems worldwide.

COVID-19 was declared a universal pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization and is a severe health issue with unprecedented morbidity and mortality rates. Both surgical and mediastinal emphysema have been seen in cases of critically ill COVID-19 patients in several hospitals in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional, multicentric study involving several hospitals in the Saudi Arabian Eastern Province. Data were collected from intensive care units (ICUs) in these hospitals from March 2 to August 2, 2020. The inclusion criteria consisted of all patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were admitted to a critical care unit. RESULTS: Thirty patients required thoracic consultation and management, including 26 males (81.3%) and 4 females (12.5%) (1:0.15) who developed surgical and mediastinal emphysema requiring thoracic surgery intervention. Most of the patients were on high ventilation settings, and the mean duration of ventilator support was 16.50  13.98 days. Two patients (6.3%) required reintubation. The median positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 12  2.80 cmH(2)O with a median FiO2 of 70%  19.73. On average, thoracic complications occurred on day 3 (6.29 days) postintubation. Ten patients (33.33%) experienced a pneumothorax associated with surgical emphysema (SE), 1 patient (3.33%) presented with only mediastinal emphysema; 17 patients (56.66%) with only SE, and 1 (3.33%) had mediastinal emphysema associated with SE. We noted a correlation between the duration of ventilator support, the length of ICU stay (P < 0.001), and the total length of stay (LOS) in the hospital (P < 0.001). Total length of hospital stay showed significant association with the onset of complications (P = 0.045) and outcomes (P = 0.006). A significant association between PEEP and the duration of ventilator support was also evident with a P value = 0.009 and the onset of complications (P = 0.043). In addition, we found a significant association between the group with pneumothorax in combination with SE, and their outcomes, with a P = 0.002. CONCLUSION: Surgical and mediastinal emphysema in the critically ill patients are usually attributed to barotrauma and high ventilations settings. During COVID-19 pandemic, these entities were seen and the pathogenesis was revisited and some attributed its presence to the disease process and destruction on lung parenchyma. The associated with extended LOS and delayed recovery in addition to poor prognosis were seen. Their presence is an indicator to higher morbidity and mortality.","output":"Surgical and mediastinal emphysema in critically ill COVID-19 patients: A multicentric experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for health care providers to abandon volume-based payments in favor of models that give them financial stability in volatile times.","output":"COVID-19 and Healthcare's Productivity Shock"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic, being the greatest challenge to our healthcare system for over a century, has its greatest impact on older patients This subgroup has higher morbidity and mortality than younger age groups Superimposed on this, the major preventative intervention resulting in social isolation has negative consequences Prof Bernard Isaacs described the \\"Geriatric Giant Symptoms\\" in 1965 and encouraged the development of interventions for immobility, instability, incontinence and impaired intellect/memory with careful management of these symptoms resulting in better outcomes for older patients including reduced admissions to Nursing Homes and mortality The author's explore the impact of the current pandemic and, most particularly its aftermath on the provision of such interventions In the context of a major economic crisis, resources for highly effective interventions such as joint replacement surgery, urological interventions, cataract surgery will be all be limited after this crisis Moreover delayed access to day patient services with suboptimal access to assessments for conditions such as cognitive decline and falls as well as social care will likewise militate against addressing the \\"Geriatric Giant Symptoms\\" Thus the \\"Founding Fathers\\" of Geriatric Medicine including Prof Isaacs would be justifiably concerned regarding our ability to deliver interventions to address the \\"Geriatric Giant Symptoms\\" Current leaders in geriatric medicine, healthcare workers, funders and providers as well as advocacy groups must redouble their efforts to ensure gains made in management of older patients over 2 generations are not lost in the aftermath of this pandemic Copyright ? 2020, Serdi and Springer-Verlag International SAS, part of Springer Nature","output":"Back to Basics: Giant Challenges to Addressing Isaac's \\"Geriatric Giants\\" Post COVID-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare connective tissue disease characterised by immune dysfunction, vascular damage and fibrosis affecting the skin and multiple internal organs. The clinical spectrum of SSc is wide and its manifestations may lead to severe morbidity and mortality, in addition to a great impact on patients quality of life. Due to the multifaceted clinical manifestations of SSc, its management requires a combined expertise of different medical specialists to guarantee an adequate disease control and prevent organ complications. Multi-disciplinary teams (MDT), which are composed by physicians and other specialized health professionals, represent therefore a key element for the comprehensive management of SSc patients. Moreover, MTD can improve communication and patients empowerment while the presence of dedicated nurses can help patients to ask questions about their condition. The scope of this narrative review is to analyse the available evidences regarding the role of MDT in the management of SSc patients, and how this holistic approach may improve different disease domains and the overall prognosis. MDT regarding the cardiovascular and lung complication are the more represented in literature, given the great impact in prognosis. Nonetheless, MDT have been shown to be fundamental also in other disease domains as they can intercept early manifestations, thus stratifying patients based on the individual risks in order to personalize patients follow-up. MDTs may also minimize the treatment delay, enabling fast-track specialist referral.
