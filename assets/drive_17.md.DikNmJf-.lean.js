It included studies on vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) that mentioned the term value in any part and which were conducted in advanced economies. An in-depth analysis was performed on studies addressing value as key element. RESULTS: Overall, 107 studies were considered. Approximately half of the studies addressed value as a key element but in most of cases (83.3%) only a single pillar was assessed. Furthermore, the majority of papers addressed the technical value by looking only at classical methods for economic assessment of vaccinations whereas very few dealt with societal and allocative pillars.

The assessment of the whole value of vaccines and vaccinations is still limited to some domains and should encompass the wider impact on economic growth and societies.","output":"The Value(s) of Vaccination: Building the Scientific Evidence According to a Value-Based Healthcare Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High nitrogen (N) fertilizer inputs accelerate soil acidification and degradation in tea plantations, thus posing a threat to soil microbial diversity, species composition, and ecosystem service functions. The effects of organic fertilizer and biochar applications on improving soil fertility have been extensively studied on cropland;however, little is known about their effectiveness in promoting soil multifunctionality on rapidly expanding acidic soils in tea plantations. In this study, we conducted a two\\\\year field experiment in a subtropical tea plantation to investigate the effects of organic fertilizer substitution and biochar amendment on soil microbial communities and multifunctionality. The results showed that soil multifunctionality was enhanced in plots amended with organic fertilizer and biochar. Soil multifunctionality was significantly and positively correlated with alpha\\\\diversity of bacteria but not fungi. We also found that organic fertilizer substitution and biochar amendment improved soil multifunctionality by altering the abundance of keystone species. The abundance of keystone species classified as module hubs in the bacterial co\\\\occurrence network contributed significantly and positively to soil multifunctionality. In contrast, the keystone species categorized as module hubs in the fungal co\\\\occurrence network negatively affected soil multifunctionality. Soil pH was a key driver of soil microbial community composition, indicating that the increase in soil pH under organic fertilizer and biochar amendment had a crucial role in biological processes. These results suggest that organic substitution and biochar amendment are beneficial in preventing soil degradation and maintaining soil multifunctionality in subtropical tea plantations.","output":"Microbial diversity and the abundance of keystone species drive the response of soil multifunctionality to organic substitution and biochar amendment in a tea plantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protecting Health Care Workers (HCWs) during routine care of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients is of paramount importance to halt the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2) pandemic. The WHO, ECDC and CDC have issued conflicting guidelines on the use of respiratory filters (N95) by HCWs. We searched PubMed, Embase and The Cochrane Library from the inception to March 21, 2020 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing N95 respirators versus surgical masks for prevention of COVID-19 or any other respiratory infection among HCWs. The grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the quality of evidence. Four RCTs involving 8736 HCWs were included. We did not find any trial specifically on prevention of COVID-19. However, wearing N95 respirators can prevent 73 more (95% CI 46-91) clinical respiratory infections per 1000 HCWs compared to surgical masks (2 RCTs; 2594 patients; low quality of evidence). A protective effect of N95 respirators in laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR = 0.41; 95%CI 0.28-0.61) was also found. A trend in favour of N95 respirators was observed in preventing laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza like illness. We found no direct high quality evidence on whether N95 respirators are better than surgical masks for HCWs protection from SARS-CoV-2. However, low quality evidence suggests that N95 respirators protect HCWs from clinical respiratory infections.

Finding predictors for it affects implants, operative techniques and allows for preventive measures. METHODS Prospectively collected data from 932 outpatient open inguinal hernia operations between 2003 and 2010 were subjected to regression analysis. Visual analogue scale score (VAS) at least a year after operation and a measurement of chronic pain at one year were the target variables. RESULTS Chronic pain was present in 99 (11.5%) patients one year after operation. Independent predictors for the occurrence of chronic pain were positively recurrence (Odds ratio, OR 6.77 vs. no recurrence, P = 0.005), complication (OR 5.16 vs. no complication, P = 0.002), mid-density mesh (OR 2.28 vs. lightweight mesh, P = 0.012), higher preoperative VAS score (OR 1.15, P = 0.006) and negatively higher age (OR 0.98, P = 0.027). Predictors for a higher postoperative VAS score were recurrence (regression coefficient, RC, 1.49 vs. no recurrence, P = 0.001), complication (RC 0.76 vs. no complication, P = 0.016), heavyweight mesh (RC 0.50 vs. lightweight mesh, P = 0.046) and higher preoperative VAS level (RC 0.10, P < 0.001).

This is an innovative vaccination approach employing a DNA vector expressing a mutated HIV-1 Nef protein (Nefmut) that has lost the anti-cellular effects typical of the wild-type isoform, meanwhile showing an unusual efficiency of incorporation into EVs. This function persists even when foreign antigens are fused to its C-terminus. In this way, Nefmut traffics large amounts of antigens fused to it into EVs spontaneously released by cells expressing the Nefmut_based DNA vector. We previously provided evidence that the inoculation in mice of a DNA vector expressing the Nefmut/HPV16-E7 fusion protein induced an E7-specific CTL immune response as detected 2 weeks after the second immunization. In an effort to optimize the anti-HPV16 CD8+ T cell immune response, we found that the co-injection of DNA vectors expressing Nefmut fused with E6 and E7 generated a stronger anti-HPV16 immune response compared to that we observed in mice injected with the single vectors. When TC-1 cells, i.e., a tumor cell line co-expressing E6 and E7, were implanted before immunization, all mice survived until day 44, whereas no mice injected with either void or Nefmut_expressing vectors survived until day 32 after tumor implantation. A substantial part of mice (7 out of 12) cleared the tumor. When cured mice were re-challenged with a second sub cute implantation of TC-1 cells, and followed for additional 135 days, whereas none of them developed tumors. Both E6- and E7-specific CD8+ T immunity was still detectable at the end of the observation time. Hence, the immunity elicited by engineered EVs, besides curing already developed tumors, is strong enough to guarantee the resistance to additional tumor attack. This results is of relevance for therapy against both metastatic and relapsing tumors.","output":"Long-term antitumor CD8+ T cell immunity induced by endogenously engineered extracellular vesicles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Singapore implements a school closure policy for institutional hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) outbreaks, but there is a lack of empirical evidence on the effect of closure on HFMD transmission.

The effects of school closure due to 1) institutional outbreaks, 2) public holidays, and 3) school vacations were assessed using a Bayesian time series modeling approach. School closure was associated with a reduction in HFMD transmission rate. During public holidays, average numbers of secondary cases having onset the week after dropped by 53% (95% credible interval 44C62%), and during school vacations, the number of secondary cases dropped by 7% (95% credible interval 3C10%). Schools being temporarily closed in response to an institutional outbreak reduced the average number of new cases by 1,204 (95% credible interval 1,140C1,297).

Heat shock protein A5 (HSPA5), termed also GRP78, is a host cell chaperone protein responsible for the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum. Under stress, HSPA5 is upregulated and becomes cell-surface exposed. Recent studies report the association of cell-surface HSPA5 with EBOV glycoproteins GP1 and GP2. In this study, structural and sequence analysis and molecular docking are used to predict the possible binding site between the cell-surface HSPA5 and EBOV GP1. The results show a promising binding site that supports the hypothesis of HSPA5 selectivity for binding to a specific peptide sequence (pep42).

This paper reports the findings of a qualitative study examining how lockdown policies impacted upon the lives of those caring for community-based patients. The study involved nationwide surveys and ethnographic interviews with 15 registered nurses (RN) employed in community settings, two community midwives, and five personal care assistants (PCAs). During the strict lockdown levels 4 and 3, RNs and PCAs in the community showed considerable courage in answering their 'call to duty' by taking on heightened care responsibilities and going 'the extra mile' to help others. They faced significant risks to personal and professional relationships when they were required to take on additional and complex responsibilities for community-based patients. Despite, and sometimes due to the hypervigilant monitoring of their personal protective equipment (PPE), the need to safeguard family and community members generated considerable stress and anxiety. Many also faced personal isolation and loneliness as a result of lockdown restrictions. Although 'care' and 'kindness' became social expectations throughout Aotearoa New Zealand during the lockdown, RNs and PCAs who were already doing care work in patient homes had to do more. This article makes five core service delivery and policy recommendations for supporting community-based nurses and PCAs in respiratory disease pandemics: acknowledging the crucial role played by community-based carers and the associated stress and anxiety endured, through championing respect and compassion; demystifying the 'heroism' or 'self-sacrifice' projected onto care workers to facilitate boundary setting; the timely provision of adequate protective equipment; improving remuneration with adequate provision for time off; and regular counselling, peer support groups, and education on work-life balance delivered by support workers in recognition of stressors arising from these complex and isolated working conditions.","output":"Community healthcare workers' experiences during and after COVID-19 lockdown: a qualitative study from Aotearoa New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surgery in patients with hemophilia is a serious challenge.

The approved MPP inhibitors against HIV and HCV were prioritized, while RNA dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor remdesivir including Favipiravir, alpha-ketoamide were studied as control groups. The target drug surface hotspot was also investigated through the molecular docking technique. Molecular dynamics was performed to determine the binding stability of docked complexes. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion analysis was conducted to understand the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness of the screened MPP inhibitors. The results of the study revealed that Paritaprevir (-10.9 kcal/mol) and its analog (CID 131982844) (-16.3 kcal/mol) showed better binding affinity than the approved MPP inhibitors compared in this study, including remdesivir, Favipiravir, and alpha-ketoamide.

Purpose To assess the incidence, patterns, and severity of injuries in victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, compared with the prior three years. Materials and Methods The demographics, clinical presentation, injuries, and radiological findings of patients reporting physical abuse arising from IPV during the statewide COVID-19 pandemic between March 11th and May 3rd, 2020 were compared with the same period over the past three years. Pearson's chi-squared and Fischer's exact have been used for analysis. Results 26 physical IPV victims from 2020 (37+/-13 years, 25 women) were evaluated and compared with 42 physical IPV victims (41+/-15 years, 40 women) from 2017-2019. While the overall number of patients reporting IPV decreased during the pandemic, the incidence of physical IPV was 1.8 times greater (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 3.0, p = 0.01). The total number of deep injuries was 28 during 2020 versus 16 from 2017-2019; the number of deep injuries per victim was 1.1 during 2020 compared with 0.4 from 2017-2019 (p<0.001).

General practitioners (GPs) provide the vast majority of patient care, and knowledge of their experiences with providing care for regular health issues during a pandemic is scarce. Hence, in a Danish context we explored how GPs experienced reorganising their work in an attempt to uphold sufficient patient care while contributing to minimizing the spread of COVID-19. Further, in relation to this, we examined what guided GPs choices between telephone, video and face-to-face consultations. METHODS: This study consisted of qualitative interviews with 13 GPs. They were interviewed twice, approximately three months apart in the initial phase of the pandemic, and they took daily notes for 20 days. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and inductively analysed. RESULTS: The GPs re-organised their clinical work profoundly. Most consultations were converted to video or telephone, postponed or cancelled. The use of video first rose, but soon declined, once again replaced by an increased use of face-to-face consultations. When choosing between consultation forms, the GPs took into account the need to minimise the risk of COVID-19, the central guidelines, and their own preference for face-to-face consultations. There were variations over time and between the GPs regarding which health issues were dealt with by using video and/or the telephone. For some health issues, the GPs generally deemed it acceptable to use video or telephone, postpone or cancel appointments for a short term, and in a crisis situation. They experienced relational and technical limitations with video consultation, while diagnostic uncertainty was not regarded as a prominent issue CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates how the GPs experienced telephone and video consultations as being useful in a pandemic situation when face-to-face consultations had to be severely restricted. The GPs did, however, identify several limitations similar to those known in non-pandemic times. The weighing of pros and cons and their willingness to use these alternatives shifted and generally diminished when face-to-face consultations were once again deemed viable.

The included variables were clinical and demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients. The case fatality rate (CFR), incidence rates, and R were estimated based on the daily reported data. For estimating R, generation time was assumed on multi scenarios. R was estimated by R0-package. Moreover, Chi square test was applied. All the analyses were performed in STATA, Excel, ArcMap and R. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: CONCLUSION: As R is slightly high, the risk of epidemic has reduced gradually. However, observing social distance and related guidelines are still recommended.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Reproduction Number of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Cases in Markazi Province in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA can alter the expression of endogenous genes and can be used to express therapeutic proteins.

This study evaluated whether veliparib, a brain-penetrant poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, acts synergistically with radiation and temozolomide. METHODS: VERTU was a multicenter 2:1 randomized phase II trial in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and MGMT-unmethylated promotor status. The experimental arm consisted of veliparib and radiotherapy, followed by adjuvant veliparib and temozolomide. The standard arm consisted of concurrent temozolomide and radiotherapy, followed by adjuvant temozolomide. The primary objective was to extend the progression-free survival rate at six months (PFS-6m) in the experimental arm. RESULTS: A total of 125 participants were enrolled, with 84 in the experimental arm and 41 in the standard arm. The median age was 61 years, 70% were male, 59% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, and 87% underwent macroscopic resection. PFS-6m was 46% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 36%-57%) in the experimental arm and 31% (95% CI: 18%-46%) in the standard arm. Median overall survival was 12.7 months (95% CI: 11.4-14.5 months) in the experimental arm and 12.8 months (95% CI: 9.5-15.8 months) in the standard arm. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, with no new safety signals. CONCLUSION: The veliparib-containing regimen was feasible and well tolerated. However, there was insufficient evidence of clinical benefit in this population.

Unprotected exposure to a COVID-19 patient is a key risk factor for HCWs. Transmission mainly occurs by droplet transmission, or by aerosol generating procedures. Respirators such as filtering face piece masks (FFP2), also called respirators, are required to prevent transmission during aerosol generating procedures, as part of the personal protective equipment (PPE) for HCWs. However, many HCW were infected due to lack of PPE, or failure to use them. Therefore, the worldwide shortage of respirators triggered the development of reprocessing used FFP2 respirators or N95 respirators as standard in the US. Our proposal with H2O2 plasma sterilization for decontamination allows to reprocess FFP2, while they still meet the filtration efficiency required by EN 149. The protocol is simple, uses available resources in hospitals and can be rapidly implemented to decrease the shortage of respirators during this crisis. The goal of the study was the evaluate if respirators can be reprocessed and still fulfill the requirements for filtration efficiency outlined by EN 149. Methods Used FFP2 respirators - Model 3 M Aura? 1862+ - were sterilized using a low temperature process hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), V-PRO? maX Low Temperature, a FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved method to decontaminate FFP2 respirators. Decontaminated respirators were further checked for residual peroxide by a single-gas detector for H2O2. The total inward leakage of the protective respirators was quantitatively tested with 10 test persons in an atmosphere charged with paraffin aerosol according to the European Standard EN 149. The fit factor was calculated as the inverse of the total inward leakage. Results Ten new and ten decontaminated FFP2 respirators were tested for filtration efficiency. None of the respirators exceeded the maximum acceptable concentration of peroxide. More than 4000 respirators have been reprocessed so far, at cost of approximately 0.3 Euro/piece. Conclusions FFP2 respirators can be safely reprocessed once after decontamination with plasma peroxide sterilization, whereafter they still fulfill EN 149 requirements. This allows to almost double the current number of available FFP2 respirators.","output":"Proposal for a EN 149 acceptable reprocessing method for FFP2 respirators in times of severe shortage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Explicit knowledge of total community-level immune seroprevalence is critical to developing policies to mitigate the social and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2. Publicly available vaccination data are frequently cited as a proxy for population immunity, but this metric ignores the effects of naturally-acquired immunity, which varies broadly throughout the country and world. Without broad or random sampling of the population, accurate measurement of persistent immunity post natural infection is generally unavailable. To enable tracking of both naturally-acquired and vaccine-induced immunity, we set up a synthetic random proxy based on routine hospital testing for estimating total Immunoglobulin G (IgG) prevalence in the sampled community. Our approach analyzes viral IgG testing data of asymptomatic patients who present for elective procedures within a hospital system. We apply multilevel regression and poststratification to adjust for demographic and geographic discrepancies between the sample and the community population. We then apply state-based vaccination data to categorize immune status as driven by natural infection or by vaccine. We have validated the model using verified clinical metrics of viral and symptomatic disease incidence to show the expected biological correlation of these entities with the timing, rate, and magnitude of seroprevalence. In mid-July 2021, the estimated immunity level was 74% with the administered vaccination rate of 45% in the two counties.

Five databases were searched in February 2022, yielding 24 peer-reviewed studies reporting on vaccine hesitancy or acceptance in ethnic minority groups. Data were extracted using a standardised form, and quality assessment was carried out using the Standard Quality Criteria. There were three key themes: (1). Prevalence of vaccine hesitancy; (2). Reasons for vaccine hesitancy and acceptance; and (3). Recommendations to address vaccine concerns. Vaccine hesitancy, which was more common among some ethnic minority groups, is a complex phenomenon, driven by misinformation, mistrust, concerns about safety and efficacy, and structural and systemic inequities. Community engagement and tailored communication may help to address vaccine concerns. Robust data disaggregated by ethnicities are needed to better understand barriers and facilitators for COVID-19 vaccine delivery in ethnic minority communities.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have a high risk of symptomatic infection and severe respiratory symptoms because of chronic inflammation, uremic toxins accumulation, endothelial dysfunction and an impaired immune response. Even though the presence of one or more comorbidities increases the risk of mortality, information of the outcome of COVID-19 in CKD patients is not yet available. The aim of the study is to present the incidence and outcome of COVID-19 in patients referring to our Nephrology Unit considering CKD patients, dialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients. METHOD: This study is prospective single centre carried out considering patients referring to the Nephrology Unit of St. Orsola University Hospital in Bologna with COVID 19 diagnosis from 15(TH)March to 30(TH)May 2020. RESULTS: Our cohort included 52 patients admitted to our Nephrology Unit because of Sars Cov2 infection confirmed by positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal swab. The mean age was 67.2  13.8 years (range, 33-88 years). Demographic, clinical and radiological features in Table 1. Forty-eight patients (92.3%) underwent chest TC. The main findings were: several bilateral interstitial pneumonia (39 patients, 81.2%), monolateral peripheral ground-glass opacities (6 patients, 12.5%), no signs of pneumonia (3 patients, 6.2 %). Clinical course is highly variable: 18 patients (34.6 %) were asymptomatic, 23 patients (44 %) had a mild course requiring low flux oxygen therapy and 11 patients (21%) presented severe pneumonia and respiratory distress that requires ventilatory support in intensive care unit. Forty patients (70%) had hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin dual therapy, 3 patients (6%) had antiviral therapy in addiction. Sixteen patients (31%) with P/F <150 mmHg were treated with Tocilizumab. Heparin Therapy, to prevent the thromboembolic risk of Sars-Cov2 infection, was administered according to the body weight in forty patients (70%);, but not in patients in warfarin therapy (12 patients, 30%). Twenty-six patients (50%) needed antibiotics for bacterial infections combined to the Sars-Cov2 infection. Steroid therapy was added in 40% of cases. The average time of negativization for Sars Cov2, tested with two nasopharyngeal swab specimens made seven days apart, was 3115 day. Fifty-one patients, 98% of diagnosed cases, required hospitalization with an average stay of 35  26 days. Thirty patients (25%) died. Mean age of non-survivors was 72  11years while mean age of survivors was 64 11years. No differences in pre-existing comorbidities were observed between survivors and non survivors; oxygen saturation on presentation was statistically lower in non survivors. CONCLUSION: CKD is an independent risk factor for COVID-19 associated in-hospital mortality. The mortality rate (25%), much higher than in general population (1.8-8%) may be explained by the older age of patients and the presence of more pathological conditions, especially cardiovascular disease.","output":"MO520 SARS-COVID19 INFECTION AT VARIOUS STAGES OF KIDNEY DISEASE: A SINGLE CENTRE EXPERIENCE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection is required for COVID-19, but many signs and symptoms of COVID-19 differ from common acute viral diseases Currently, there are no pre- or post-exposure prophylactic COVID-19 medical countermeasures Clinical data suggest that famotidine may mitigate COVID-19 disease, but both mechanism of action and rationale for dose selection remain obscure We explore several plausible avenues of activity including antiviral and host-mediated actions We propose that the principal famotidine mechanism of action for COVID-19 involves on-target histamine receptor H 2 activity, and that development of clinical COVID-19 involves dysfunctional mast cell activation and histamine release","output":"COVID-19: Famotidine, Histamine, Mast Cells, and Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 to date has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths in the world, becoming one of the worst pandemics in history.

To determine the co-segregation patterns of RVA segments, we generated time-scaled phylogenetic trees for each of the 11 segments of 789 complete RVA genomes isolated from mammalian hosts and compared the segments geodesic distances. We found that segments 4 (VP4) and 9 (VP7) occupied significantly different tree spaces from each other and from the rest of the genome.

Bayesian Skyride plots were generated for each segment to compare relative genetic diversity among segments over time. All segments showed a dramatic decrease in diversity around 2007 coinciding with the introduction of RVA vaccines. To assess selection pressures, codon adaptation indices and relative codon deoptimization indices were calculated with respect to different host genomes.

The most severe symptoms are associated with overactive inflammatory immune responses, leading to a cytokine storm, tissue damage, and death, if not balanced and controlled. Hypotheses within Evolutionary Medicine, including the Hygiene/Old Friends Hypothesis, provide an important lens through which to understand and possibly control this overactive immune response. In this paper, we explore the role that infection with soil-transmitted helminths (STHs; i.e., intestinal parasitic worms) may play in dampening SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and mitigating the worst COVID-19 outcomes. Specifically, STHs stimulate the immunosuppressive and regulatory T-helper 2 (T(H)2) branch of the immune system, which decreases ACE2-receptor expression (i.e., receptors SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect host cells), balances the inflammatory T(H)1/T(H)17 branches of the immune system triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and reduces inflammation through the release of anti-inflammatory/regulatory cytokines. Because STHs are common and affect the most vulnerable and marginalized members of society, it is especially important to consider how these parasites may impact COVID-19 outcomes. Areas experiencing endemic STH infections are often characterized by a lack of preventative infrastructure and medical care, which may further exacerbate risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 development. For this reason, we also explore biocultural factors that contribute to disease outcomes for both SARS-CoV-2 and STH infections. Biocultural and Evolutionary Medicine perspectives on COVID-19 are crucial for understanding the global impact of the disease.

The majority of the species showed intermediate responses to the change in visitor presence that varied in valence; however, some responses were more pronounced. ABSTRACT: Although reptiles are commonly housed in zoos and aquariums, their welfare is understudied for the diversity of species housed and the taxons current captive population size.

METHODS: With the aim of describing the impact of the first and second waves of COVID-19 on PAP adherence during 2020 in France, we designed a cross-sectional study of Sleep-Apnea (SA)-patients under PAP telemonitoring. To examine PAP adherence in adult SA patients, we assessed de-identified data from a non-profit healthcare provider database during the period January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Included patients met the following criteria: (i) PAP-treated for at least 4 months before January 1, 2019 and with continuous PAP during both 2019 and 2020; (ii)  360 daily PAP telemonitored data per year. For PAP adherence, data were collected using the PAP-software.

By recognising the risk factors for infection and implementing suitable measures to reduce these risks, all reasonable efforts should be taken to control the spread of infection to them. The aim of the present study was to determine the level of infection prevention and control practises used by primary healthcare nurses in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods Cross-sectional design to examine the preventive practices of COVID-19 among healthcare professionals and community health nurses (n = 198) who worked in primary healthcare facilities in southwest Riyadh. Staff were randomly recruited, and a self-administered questionnaire was employed to collect demographic data, sources of COVID-19 information, and COVID-19 infection prevention and control measures. Results Most of participants were male (57.6%), aged 30_39 years (50.5%), married (61.6), with monthly income of more than10,000 SAR, and more than half (74.0%) of the participants hold a diploma degree. Social media was the most prevalent source of information about COVID-19 (69.25%). About 91.4% used facemask in crowds and 65.2% of the participants wore medical Personal Protective Equipment during prescribing drugs. Furthermore, 94.5% of the participants wore a simple facemask and 32.8% washed their hands with running water and handwashing liquid. Females were most users of gloves and simple mask;who had a monthly income of 5000 SAR or more were the most who wore goggle mask and apron;non-nurse staff, aged 40_49 years and who had more than 10 years of experience were the most users of N95 respirator;while nurses, aged 30_39 years and with 6_10 years of experience were the most who used gowns.

SARS-CoV-2 remains dormant in the CNS leading to neurological complications. The wide expression of ACE2 in the brain raises concern for its involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Though, the mechanistic insights about blood-brain barriers (BBB) crossing by SARS-CoV-2 and further brain infection are still not clear. Moreover, the mechanism behind dormant SARS-CoV-2 infections leading to chronic neurological disorders needs to be unveiled. There is an urgent need to find out the risk factor involved in COVID-19-associated neurological disease. Therefore, the role of immune-associated genes in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 associated neurological diseases is presented which could contribute to finding associated genetic risk factors. METHOD: The search utilizing multiple databases, specifically, EMBASE, PubMed (Medline), and Google Scholar was performed. Moreover, the literature survey on the involvement of COVID-19, neuropathogenesis, and its consequences was done. DESCRIPTION: Persistent inflammatory stimuli may promote the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. An increased expression level of cytokine, chemokine, and decreased expression level of immune cells has been associated with the COVID-19 patient. Cytokine storm was observed in severe COVID-19 patients. The nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be neuroinflammatory. Genes of immune response could be associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

While intuitively, these steps sound straightforward, as the complexity of the risk increases, effectively monitoring and determining appropriate triggers for risks can be challenging. We discuss setting thresholds for risks that rely on the value of information concept from decision analysis and the example of a traditional warning system (like a fire alarm).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: ENMGs performed for evaluation of diffuse weakness in patients who could not be discharged from semi-intensive care COVID unit because of difficulties in ventilation weaning were reviewed. Patients with severe COVID-19 infection who had undergone endotracheal intubation and able to co-operate were considered. ENMG protocol was focused on neurophysiological items that excluded or confirmed critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), myopathy (CIM), or polyneuromyopathy (CIPM). Standardized clinical evaluation was performed using Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score. RESULTS: Eight patients were included in the study. All presented known risk factors for intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW), and none of them had history of underlying neuromuscular disorders. ENMG findings were normal in two patients, while only two patients had an altered MRC sum score (< 48). Neuromuscular involvement was diagnosed in 6/8 patients (75%): 2 had CIP, 1 had possible CIM, 1 had CIPM, while 1 patient, with clinically evident weakness but equivocal ENMG findings, was classified as ICU-AW. Finally, 1 patient was diagnosed with acute demyelinating neuropathy. Patients with neuromuscular involvement were those with longer intubation duration and higher levels of IL-6 at admission. CONCLUSION: Neuromuscular complications are frequent in severe COVID-19 and cannot be excluded by MRC sum scores above 48. Standardized ENMG is helpful in guiding diagnosis when clinical evaluation is not reliable or possible.

Aim To examine the impact of COVID-19 on clinical management within three months of an episode of self-harm. Design and setting Prospective cohort study using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Method We compared cohorts of patients with an index self-harm episode recorded during a pre-pandemic period (10th March-10th June, 2010-2019) versus the COVID-19 first-wave period (10th March-10th June 2020). Patients were followed up for three months to capture psychotropic medication prescribing, GP/practice nurse consultation and referral to mental health services. Results 48,739 episodes of self-harm were recorded during the pre-pandemic period and 4,238 during the first-wave COVID-19 period. Similar proportions were prescribed psychotropic medication within 3 months in the pre-pandemic (54.0%) and COVID-19 first-wave (54.9%) cohorts. Likelihood of having at least one GP/practice nurse consultation was broadly similar (83.2% vs. 80.3% in the COVID-19 cohort). The proportion of patients referred to mental health services in the COVID-19 cohort (3.4%) was around half of that in the pre-pandemic cohort (6.5%). Conclusion Despite the challenges experienced by primary healthcare teams during the initial COVID-19 wave, prescribing and consultation patterns following self-harm were broadly similar to pre-pandemic levels. However, the reduced likelihood of referral to mental health services warrants attention.

Here, we compare B-cell and serum auto-antibody profiles between patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), CCLE, and overlap conditions. METHODS B-cells were compared by flow cytometry amongst healthy controls, CCLE without systemic lupus (CCLE+/SLE-) and SLE patients with (SLE+/CCLE+) or without CCLE (SLE+/CCLE-). Serum was analyed for autoreactive 9G4+, anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-chromatin and anti-RNA antibodies by ELISA and for anti-RNA binding proteins (RBP) by luciferase immunoprecipitation. RESULTS Patients with CCLE+/SLE- share B-cell abnormalities with SLE including decreased unswitched memory and increased effector B-cells albeit at a lower level than SLE patients. Similarly, both SLE and CCLE+/SLE- patients have elevated 9G4+ IgG autoantibodies despite lower levels of anti-nucleic acid and anti-RBP antibodies in CCLE+/SLE-. CCLE+/SLE- patients could be stratified into those with SLE-like B-cell profiles and a separate group with normal B-cell profiles. The former group was more serologically active and more likely to have disseminated skin lesions. CONCLUSION CCLE displays perturbations in B-cell homeostasis and partial B-cell tolerance breakdown. Our study demonstrates that this entity is immunologically heterogeneous and includes a disease segment whose B-cell compartment resembles SLE and is clinically associated with enhanced serological activity and more extensive skin disease. This picture suggests that SLE-like B-cell changes in primary CCLE may help identify patients at risk for subsequent development of SLE.

Methods: We retrospectively evaluated all COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted to the COVID-19 general wards of a medium-size Italian hospital, from March 6 to May 7, 2020. Healthcare workers (HCWs) caring for COVID-19 patients were monitored, undergoing naso-pharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 in case of onset of COVID-19 symptoms, and periodic SARS-CoV-2 screening serology. Results: Overall, 50 of 143 patients (mean age 74.6 years) were treated with NIPPV, and 22 (44%) were successfully weaned. Due to limited life expectancy, 25 (50%) of 50 NIPPV-treated patients received a do not intubate order. Among these, only 6 (24%) were weaned from NIPPV. Of the remaining 25 NIPPV-treated patients, 16 (64%) were successfully weaned, 9 (36%) underwent delayed endotracheal intubation and, among these, 3 (33.3%) died. NIPPV success was predicted by the use of corticosteroids (OR 15.4, p 0.013), the PaO2/FiO2 ratio measured 24-48 hours after NIPPV initiation (OR 1.02, p 0.015), and the presence of a do not intubate order (OR 0.03, p 0.020).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred patients on angiotensin II receptor antagonist [losartan] scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery were enrolled into this prospective randomized controlled study. Anesthetic technique, surgical technique, and cardiopulmonary bypass management were standardized for all patients. With the start of rewarming, patients were randomized to receive either terlipressin infusion 1.3 g.kg(?1).hour(?1), or normal saline infusion. Incidence of vasoplegic syndrome score was used as primary outcome. Hemodynamic parameters, inotropic score, and vasopressor dependency index were used as secondary outcome. RESULTS: Incidence of vasoplegic syndrome was significantly lower in terlipressin group compared to placebo group. Norepinephrine was required in 2 patients of terlipressin versus 15 patients of placebo group. Mean arterial blood pressure was significantly higher in terlipressin group compared to placebo group (81.7  18.5 versus 69.3  20.2 at 60 min after weaning from CBP).

Looking at gender differences, the authors found that this was only the case for females.Originality/valueThe findings extend research by capturing an external shock concerning the coronavirus pandemic to better understand how transformational leadership style, its dimensions and employee gender, influence well-being. While the authors expected COVID-19 anxiety to weaken the positive effects of transformational leadership style on well-being, paradoxically the authors also expected differential effects when examining individual dimensions.","output":"The resilient effects of transformational leadership on well-being: examining the moderating effects of anxiety during the COVID-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 causes blood hypercoagulability and severe inflammation resulting in an increased risk of thrombosis.

COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and was declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. The virus has been linked to a wide range of respiratory illnesses, ranging from mild symptoms to acute pneumonia and severe respiratory distress syndrome. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to COVID-19 complications owing to the physiological and immunological changes caused by pregnancy. According to the CDC, pregnant patients with COVID-19 are commonly hospitalized and often require admission to ICUs and ventilator support. Therefore, it is especially important for pregnant women to adhere to disease prevention measures to lower the risk of contracting the disease. In addition, the guidelines of several clinical societies and local health authorities should be followed when caring for pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. In this review article, we discuss the epidemiology of COVID-19 during delivery, its effect on the physiological and immunological changes during pregnancy, the classification of COVID-19 severity, maternal and fetal risks, antenatal care, respiratory management, treatment/medication safety, timing and mode of delivery, anesthetic considerations, and the outcome of critically ill pregnant patients with COVID-19, as well as their post-delivery care and weaning from mechanical ventilation.","output":"Critical Care Management of Severe COVID-19 in Pregnant Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of The Vulva Diaries podcast as a novel learning tool for vulvovaginal disease education. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical students and residents were invited to participate in the study using social media advertisements. Online pretests and posttests, one based on a podcast episode regarding genital herpes and the other on lichen sclerosus, were used to assess changes in knowledge level preC and postCpodcast listening in medical students and residents respectively. A second posttest was sent out 2 weeks after the first to assess knowledge retention. Results were analyzed using paired t tests comparing mean scores before and after podcast. RESULTS: In medical students, the average test score increased by 20% (n = 56, p < .001). Similarly, in residents the average test score increased by 23.1% (n = 22, p < .001). Medical students and residents rated their average preference for using podcasts as compared with other resources at 3.6 and 3.7/5, respectively. Furthermore, in both groups, there was no significant difference between average scores for posttest 1 versus posttest 2 written 2 weeks later suggested excellent knowledge retention.

Sepsis patients' demographics, biochemical indexes, medical histories, infection information were recorded. Besides, comprehensive disease scores (APACHE II score and SOFA score) were assessed within 24 h after admission. According to the survival status, 28-day mortality was calculated. Decreased circ-PRKCI expression and increased miR-545 expression were observed in sepsis patients compared to HCs, both of which had close correlations with sepsis risk. Besides, circ-PRKCI was negatively correlated with miR-545 in sepsis patients and HCs, respectively. Circ-PRKCI was negatively correlated with serum creatinine, white blood cell, C-reactive protein, APACHE II score, SOFA score, but positively correlated with albumin, which also related to blood stream infection (as primary infection site) and anaerobes infection in sepsis patients. Whereas the miR-545 showed a roughly opposite tendency. Decreased circ-PRKCI and increased miR-545 expressions were discovered in deaths compared to survivors, and both of them had values for predicting 28-day mortality risk in sepsis patients, which were slightly lower than the predictive values of APACHE II score and SOFA score for predicting 28-day mortality risk.

Subclinical depression increases the risk of peripartum depression, maternal neuro-endocrine dysregulations, and adverse birth and infant outcomes. Current treatments often comprise face-to-face psychological or pharmacological treatments that may be too intensive for women with subclinical depression leading to drop-out and moderate effectiveness. Therefore, easily accessible, resilience enhancing and less stigmatizing interventions are needed to prevent the development of clinical depression. This paper describes the protocol of a prospective cohort study with an embedded randomized controlled trial (RCT) that aims to improve mental resilience in a sample of pregnant women through a self-help program based on the principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Maternal and offspring correlates of the trajectories of peripartum depressive symptoms will also be studied. METHODS: Pregnant women ( 18 years) receiving care in Dutch midwifery practices will participate in a prospective cohort study (n ~ 3500). Between 12 and 18 weeks of pregnancy, all women will be screened for depression with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Women with an EPDS score  11 will be evaluated with a structured clinical interview. Participants with subclinical depression (n = 290) will be randomized to a 9-week guided self-help ACT-training or to care as usual (CAU). Primary outcomes (depressive symptoms and resilience) and secondary outcomes (e.g. anxiety and PTSD, bonding, infant development) will be collected via online questionnaires at four prospective assessments around 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation and at 6 weeks and 4 months postpartum. Maternal hair cortisol concentrations will be assessed in a subsample of women with a range of depressive symptoms (n = 300). The interventions feasibility will be assessed through qualitative interviews in a subsample of participants (n = 20). DISCUSSION: This is the first study to assess the effectiveness of an easy to administer intervention strategy to prevent adverse mental health effects through enhancing resilience in pregnant women with antepartum depressive symptomatology. This longitudinal study will provide insights into trajectories of peripartum depressive symptoms in relation to resilience, maternal cortisol, psychological outcomes, and infant developmental milestones.

Despite the advent and emergency use listing (EUL) of mRNA- and adenovirus-based vaccines to prevent the further transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the pandemic burden is still significant worldwide as new cases are being reported daily. It is the first time in vaccine history that vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been rapidly designed, developed, and clinically evaluated and surprisingly, they have worked better than clinical trial data predicted. However, this EUL of vaccines prior to full approvals stems from the perception of inadequate testing and experience with benefitCrisk balance. Similarly, the emergence of superspreader SARS-CoV-2 mutant virus strains at the end of 2020 has also raised concerns about the efficacies of approved vaccines in real-world clinical scenarios. The inconclusive, murky, and anecdotal reports about vaccine hesitancy, antibody-dependent enhancement of disease risk in vaccine injectors, and certain severe adverse events have also frightened a large segment of the worlds population, preventing them from receiving the vaccine.

The goal was to achieve a complete remission in association with systemic chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. We retrospectively evaluated the prognostic factors associated with 1- and 2-year local control and the 1- and 2-year DFS rates. RESULTS The 1- and 2-year local control rates were 83.0 and 76.1 %, respectively. Tumor burden was associated with a poorer outcome for local control after PTA (HR 1.027 by additional millimeter, p = 0.026; >4 cm HR 3.90). The 1- and 2-year DFS rates were 54.2 and 30.4 %, respectively. In multivariate analysis, triple-negative histological subtype and increased size of treated metastases were associated with a poorer DFS (HR 2.22; 95 % CI [1.13-4.36]; p = 0.02 and HR 2.43; 95 % CI [1.22-4.82]; p = 0.011, respectively).

But the subsequent spread of the virus across countries all over the world adversely impacted the day-to-day functioning of major industries, corporations, and economies. This adverse impact was amplified by the lockdown measures by governments who were justifiably concerned about the potential devastating effect of the pandemic. As the outbreak intensified, so did oil prices plunge into historic lows (at some point, negative). Is the precipitous drop in oil prices due to the COVID-19 pandemic or are there potentially other factors at play? In this paper, we investigate this question using a pentavariate structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model. Specifically, we identify an exogenous oil price shock arising from the pandemic together with the traditional underlying supply, demand, and financial market shocks to global crude oil markets. We find that a pandemic shock causes a delayed adverse effect on oil prices. In addition, our findings lend support to the view that changes in financial market conditions that affect financial investment decisions also play a significant role in oil price movements. There is however no evidence of a strong impact emanating from the brief Russia-Saudi price war. We also compute the forecast error variance decomposition and find that the impact of a pandemic shock together with aggregate demand and financial market shocks are not trivial in the short run. Taken together, the findings underscore the fruitfulness of research aimed at better understanding the effects of a pandemic shock on oil price movements and highlight the need for policymakers and market stakeholders to explicitly consider global health conditions when analyzing the causes and consequences of oil price shocks.","output":"Pandemics and Oil Shocks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On Thursday 27th March 2003 the decision had been made to stop all clinical teaching and all non-elective patient care at the Prince Philip Dental Hospital, the teaching hospital of the Faculty of Dentistry of the University of Hong Kong.

The effect of lockdowns in low-income and middle-income countries must be understood to ensure safe deployment of these interventions in less affluent settings. We aimed to determine the immediate impact of COVID-19 lockdown orders on women and their families in rural Bangladesh. METHODS: An interrupted time series was used to compare data collected from families in Rupganj upazila, rural Bangladesh (randomly selected from participants in a randomised controlled trial), on income, food security, and mental health a median of 1 year and 2 years before the COVID-19 pandemic to data collected during the lockdown. We also assessed women's experiences of intimate partner violence during the pandemic. RESULTS: Between May 19 and June 18, 2020, we randomly selected and invited the mothers of 3016 children to participate in the study, 2424 of whom provided consent. 2414 (999%, 95% CI 996-999) of 2417 mothers were aware of, and adhering to, the stay-at-home advice. 2321 (960%, 952-967) of 2417 mothers reported a reduction in paid work for the family. Median monthly family income fell from US$212 at baseline to $59 during lockdown, and the proportion of families earning less than $190 per day rose from five (02%, 00-05) of 2422 to 992 (473%, 452-495) of 2096 (p<00001 comparing baseline with lockdown period). Before the pandemic, 136 (56%, 47-66) of 2420 and 65 (27%, 21-34) of 2420 families experienced moderate and severe food insecurity, respectively. This increased to 881 (365%, 345-384) of 2417 and 371 (153%, 139-168) of 2417 during the lockdown; the number of families experiencing any level of food insecurity increased by 517% (481-554; p<00001). Mothers' depression and anxiety symptoms increased during the lockdown. Among women experiencing emotional or moderate physical violence, over half reported it had increased since the lockdown. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 lockdowns present significant economic, psychosocial, and physical risks to the wellbeing of women and their families across economic strata in rural Bangladesh.

Attempts to reduce LLF have led to the development of various anti-fogging fluids and warming devices. Limited literature exists directly comparing these techniques. We constructed a model peritoneum to simulate LLF and to compare the efficacy of various anti-fogging techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS Intraperitoneal space was simulated using a suction bag suspended within an 8 L container of water. LLF was induced by varying the temperature and humidity within the model peritoneum. Various anti-fogging techniques were assessed including scope warmers, FREDTM, ResoclearTM, chlorhexidine, betadine and immersion in heated saline. These products were trialled with and without the use of a disposable scope warmer. Vision scores were evaluated by the same investigator for all tests and rated according to a predetermined scale. Fogging was assessed for each product or technique 30 times and a mean vision rating was recorded. RESULTS All products tested imparted some benefit, but FREDTM performed better than all other techniques. Betadine and ResoclearTM performed no better than the use of a scope warmer alone. Immersion in saline prior to insertion resulted in decreased vision ratings. The robotic scope did not result in LLF within the model. CONCLUSIONS In standard laparoscopes, the most superior preventative measure was FREDTM utilised on a pre-warmed scope. Despite improvements in LLF with other products FREDTM was better than all other techniques.

Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of PNX/PMD. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: PNX/PMD occurred in a total of 28 patients (24.1%), with 22 patients developing PNX (19.0%) and 13 developing PMD (11.2%). Mean time to development of PNX/PMD was 14  11 days from intubation. The authors found no significant difference in mechanical ventilation parameters between patients who developed PNX/PMD and those who did not. Mechanical ventilation parameters were within recommended limits for protective ventilation in both groups. Ninety-five percent of patients with PNX/PMD had the Macklin effect (linear collections of air contiguous to the bronchovascular sheaths) on a baseline computed tomography scan, and tended to have a higher lung involvement at intensive care unit (ICU) admission (Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema score 32.2  13.4 v 18.7  9.8 in patients without PNX/PMD, pa?=a?0.08). Time from symptom onset to intubation and time from total bilirubin on day two after ICU admission were the only independent predictors of PNX/PMD. Mortality was 60.7% in patients who developed PNX/PMD versus 38.6% in those who did not (pa?=a?0.04). CONCLUSION: PNX/PMD occurs frequently in COVID-19 patients with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation, and is associated with increased mortality. Development of PNX/PMD seems to occur despite use of protective mechanical ventilation and has a radiologic predictor sign.","output":"Predictors of Pneumothorax/Pneumomediastinum in Mechanically Ventilated COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused state-wide shutdowns of elective surgical activities in March and April of 2020 forcing graduate medical education program directors and their trainees in the United States to quickly adapt to new rules and circumstances. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the current pandemic on pediatric anesthesiology fellow education and wellness nationally in order to guide creation of optimal support systems for fellows during the ongoing pandemic. METHODS: In July 2020, an electronically distributed survey was sent to all United States-based pediatric anesthesiology fellowship program directors who were asked to distribute the survey to all current/graduating fellows. RESULTS: A total of 75 out of 184 pediatric anesthesiology fellows (41%) responded to the survey. Major domains identified include reduction of clinical time, financial impact, mental health/wellness effects, and concerns about the overall quality of the fellowship educational experience. Respondents indicated that the pandemic has led to personal quarantine (and/or illness) leave time (21.3%), changes in finances (42.7%) and career opportunities (37.3%), decreased clinical education/experience (28%), and a dissatisfaction with the modified didactic experience (22.7%). In addition, a majority of respondents (97.3%) experienced increased stressors during this pandemic, including worry for family members (80%), stress due to changes in certifying examinations (76%), and fear of contracting COVID-19 from a patient (72%). CONCLUSION: While the results of this survey are only one snapshot in time during an evolving pandemic, these results highlight important domains where program directors and other departmental leaders might focus limited resources to maximize the educational experiences and overall wellness for pediatric anesthesiology fellows.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the education and wellness of U.S. Pediatric Anesthesiology Fellows"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Golgi apparatus maintains a highly organized structure in spite of the intense membrane traffic which flows into and out of this organelle.

Kata Kunci : Peran, Gubernur, Mengontrol, Kebijakan, Pemda In carrying out his duties as Governor which is an extension of the central government in each province the Jambi Governor must control the policies that have been imposed by the regional government at the city and district levels in tackling COVID-19. However in reality until now the system of government in the regional government is still running its own government so it does not coordinate with the Governor as the leader in his regional province. This condition is certainly a problem in running the government system so that it needs to be studied more deeply related to the role of the Governor of Jambi. The subject matter studied in this study is related to the role of the Governor of Jambi in controlling local government policies. So in this case the research method used is a legislative and analytical approach. The research materials used are primary secondary and tertiary legal materials and data collection techniques namely literature studies and qualitative analysis techniques. The results of the discussion are that until now the role of the Governor of Jambi has not been carried out in controlling local government policies because the regional government in running its own government is still alone so that it lacks synergy in running the government system in order to cope with the spread of COVID-19.

Currently, only symptomatic relief has been provided by FDA-approved therapeutic approaches for Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aims to evaluate the potential of wedelolactone (WDL), a natural occurring coumestan found in Eclipta alba to mitigate the parkinsonism in Caenorhabditis elegans disease model. In the present studies, supplementation with 37.5 M WDL exhibited a reduction in the level of -syn in an age-dependent manner (22% at day 5, p < 0.05; and 16% at day 10, p < 0.001, n = 30), along with improvement in neuronal health through basal movement, and elevated the dopamine levels evident through 1-nonanol repulsion results in wild-type and diseased worms. Moreover, WDL augmented the mitochondrial health in wild-type, PD-diseased, and mev-1 mutant worms that establish the inherent activity of WDL in the alleviation of oxidative stress. Furthermore, WDL supplementation significantly decreases the neutral lipid and triglyceride level and also alleviates protein carbonyl level in PD disease condition. The overall investigation will provide a pioneer to the future insights of PD research related to plant-based drugs. qPCR studies after WDL supplementation revealed alteration of genes involved in the regulation of various stress-responsive (sod-5, gst-4, skn-1), -syn-suppressing (lrk-1, ymel-1, lagr-1, grk-1), and mitochondrial (pink-1) genes. All together, these findings support that the WDL is a promising candidate to combat age-related multi-factorial PD pathology associated with protein misfolding and accumulation.

Palermo et al. (Palermo et al. 2018 J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept.

By contrast, facial-expression recognition was not significantly correlated with measures of depression, positive or negative affect, empathy, or autistic-like traits. Because the range of affective factors considered in this study and its use of multiple expression-recognition tasks mean that it is a relatively comprehensive investigation of the role of affective factors in facial expression recognition, we carried out a direct replication. In common with Palermo et al. (Palermo et al. 2018 J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept.

However, and by contrast with Palermo et al. (Palermo et al. 2018 J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept. Perform. 44, 503C517), other affective factors (e.g. those related to empathy) often also significantly predicted emotion-recognition performance.

As environmental exposures do not respect state borders, a globalist concept of global health response has developed, which requires transparency and cooperation for coordinated responses to disease outbreaks. Countries that avoid cooperation on health issues for social or political reasons can endanger the global community. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the rapid change in China's infectious disease policy between 2000 and 2013, from actively rejecting the assistance of international health experts during the HIV/AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome crises to following best-practice disease response policies and cooperating with international health actors during the 2013 avian influenza outbreak. METHODS: Using international relations theory, I examined whether international political factors had a major influence on this change. Using the case studies of international reputation, socialization with international organizations, and the securitization of infectious disease, this study examined the influence of international and domestic pressures on Chinese infectious disease policy. FINDINGS: Although international relations theory, especially theories popular in global health diplomacy literature, provide valuable insight into the role of international factors and foreign policy interests in China's changing approach to infectious disease control, it cannot provide viable explanations without considering the domestic interests of the Chinese government. CONCLUSION: Analysis of state responses to infectious disease using international relations theories must consider domestic political factors.","output":"From SARS to Avian Influenza: The Role of International Factors in China's Approach to Infectious Disease Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 pandemic is having a major impact on our daily lives.

This study aimed to explore depression levels in Chinese and South Korean elderly individuals by focusing on testing the generalizability of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). METHODS: The data of 493 community-dwelling Chinese and Korean elderly individuals over the age of 60 years were used to examine GDS. To test the dimensionality, item quality, and reliability of the GDS, the item response theory, Rasch analysis was performed. The detection of differential item functioning (DIF) of the GDS between the two countries was determined by performing a hybrid ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: The four-dimensional framework of the GDS, categorized into agitation, cognitive concerns, dysphoria, and vigor/withdrawal was fit for measuring depression levels in Chinese and Korean elderly individuals. In addition, good item quality and reliability of the GDS indicate that almost all items in this scale contribute to measuring the intended trait. Meanwhile, 18 out of 28 items of the GDS were detected as country-related DIF with five items having a large effect size. CONCLUSIONS: Although China and Korea are close geographically and culturally, the item bias shown by severe country-related DIF implies that different cultural backgrounds impact how the elderly interpret GDS items.

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) offers an alternative to invasive mechanical ventilation, though its role in both de novo AHRF and pandemic viral pneumonia has been controversial. Our group has previously demonstrated that NIV delivered by helmet reduces endotracheal intubation rates and improves mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome when compared to facemask NIV in a randomized controlled clinical trial (1). Limited data are available on the comparative efficacy of noninvasive respiratory support strategies in patients with AHRF due to Covid-19. NIV by helmet interface offers a promising strategy for these patients and may avert the need for endotracheal intubation. METHODS: All patients with Covid-19 associated AHRF admitted to the intensive care unit and managed initially with noninvasive respiratory support between March 1 and July 31, 2020 were identified. Those who received helmet NIV were matched with patients who received HFNC (high flow nasal cannula) using propensity scores in a 1:1 ratio without replacement. Baseline characteristics and therapies that differed on univariable analysis were used for matching. After matching, univariable analysis was conducted comparing the HFNC and helmet NIV groups. RESULTS: 78 patients initially managed with HFNC and 31 patients managed with helmet NIV (excluding 7 patients who received helmet NIV after intubation) were identified. Matching resulted in similar groups according to baseline characteristics and therapies received. The primary composite outcome of intubation or inhospital mortality occurred in 20 (64.5%) patients in the helmet group and 20 (64.5%) patients in the control group (absolute difference, 0%;95% CI,-23.4% to 23.4%;p=1.00). In-hospital mortality in the helmet NIV group was similar to that of the HFNC control group (absolute difference-9.7%;95% CI,-34.4% to 15.0%;p=0.45). In patients treated with helmet NIV, gas exchange improved significantly following application with an increase in the ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen from 72 to 141 (mean difference, 69;95% CI 26 to 112;p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: While limited by the small sample size and observational nature, there was no significant difference observed in outcomes of patients with Covid-19 associated AHRF managed with helmet NIV compared to HFNC. After application of helmet NIV, a significant improvement in gas exchange was observed. REFERENCES: 1. Patel BK, et al.

OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to determine which virtual communication method (ie, telephone call or video call) was preferred by confined older hospital patients and nursing home residents and the variables influencing this preference. METHODS: The TOVID (Telephony Or Videophony for Isolated elDerly) study was a cross-sectional study that was designed to examine the preference between telephone calls and video calls among frail older adults who were either hospitalized in a geriatric acute care unit or institutionalized in a long-term care and nursing home during the COVID-19 confinement period. RESULTS: A total of 132 older people were surveyed between March 25 and May 11, 2020 (mean age 88.2 years, SD 6.2); 79 (59.8%) were women. Patients hospitalized in the geriatric acute care unit were more able to establish communication independently than residents institutionalized in the long-term care and nursing home (P=.03) and were more satisfied with their communication experiences (P=.02). Overall, older people tended to favor telephone calls (73/132, 55.3%) over video calls (59/132, 44.7%); however, their satisfaction degree was similar regardless of the chosen method (P=.1), with no effect of age (P=.97) or gender (P=.2). In the geriatric acute care unit, the satisfaction degrees were similar for telephone calls (40/41, 98%) and video calls (33/38, 87%) in older patients (P=.10). Conversely, in the long-term care and nursing home, residents were more satisfied with the use of video calls to communicate with their relatives (14/15, 93%) versus the use of telephone calls (6/12, 50%; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Older people confined to health care settings were able to complete telephone calls more independently than video calls, and they tended to use telephone calls more often than video calls.

The mortality rate in our study was 25.6%, and the population most susceptible to poor outcomes in the ESRD subgroup was elderly people (45.5%), while younger patients recovered the most from COVID-19 (53.1%). Hypoalbuminemia, leukocytosis, lymphopenia and raised LDH were also found to be associated with death in ESRD patients suffering from COVID-19 (81.8, 72.7, 100 and 100%, respectively). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that the odds ratio of dying from COVID-19 was 19.5 times higher in patients aged >65 years as compared to patients aged 18C50 years (p=0.039). Similarly, patients with a high TLC were 24.1 times more likely to die than patients with a normal TLC (p=0.008). CONCLUSION: In our center, the mortality rate of ESRD patients affected with COVID-19 disease was 25.6%, and older age, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia and high LDH were significantly associated with mortality.","output":"Clinical Course and Outcome of ESRD Patients on Maintenance Hemodialysis Infected with COVID-19: A Single-Center Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dialysis patients are more vulnerable and susceptible to the severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection due to multiple comorbidities.

We assessed the post-licensure safety data for IIV3-HD in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 2011-2019. METHODS: We searched VAERS for reports after IIV3-HD during 1/1/2011-06/30/2019 in persons aged &#8805;65 years. Medical records were reviewed for all death reports and for certain pre-specified conditions (e.g. Guillain Barr Syndrome [GBS], anaphylaxis). We also reviewed certain groups who received IIV3-HD erroneously (e.g. pregnant women, children). Empirical Bayesian data mining was used to identify disproportional reporting. RESULTS: VAERS received 12,320 reports after IIV3-HD;723 reports (5.9%) were serious. The most common adverse events (AEs) among serious reports were pyrexia (30.2%), asthenia (28.9%), and dyspnea (24.9%), and among non-serious reports were injection site erythema (16.8%), pain in extremity (15.8%), and injection site pain (14.2%). Among 55 death reports, the most common causes of death were diseases of the circulatory system (n = 23;41.8%). Based on medical record review, there were 61 reports of GBS and 13 of anaphylaxis. There were 13 reports of pregnant-women who inadvertently received IIV3-HD; three reports described arm pain or local reactions, and 10 did not report any AE. Among 59 reports of children who erroneously received IIV3-HD, 31 experienced an AE (most commonly injection site or constitutional reactions) and the remaining 28 reports did not describe any AE. CONCLUSIONS: Post-licensure safety data of IIV3-HD during 9 influenza seasons revealed no new or unexpected safety concerns among individuals &#8805;65 years. Inadvertent administration of IIV3-HD to children or pregnant women was observed, although with no serious AEs reported. Training and education of providers in vaccine recommendations and groups for whom the vaccine is indicated may help in preventing these vaccine administration errors.

DESIGN: Stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial conducted during an institutional ACF bundle implementation program. SETTING: Single-center study conducted in eight adult ICUs. PATIENTS: Adult patients admitted for at least 24 hours, not undergoing active withdrawal of life support or palliative care. INTERVENTIONS: Four ICUs in the intervention group received bundle-related staff education, data literacy training, and weekly bundle performance reports during the 12-month study period. The four ICUs in the nonintervention group received none of these interventions. Bundle compliance and patient outcomes were tracked, including ICU and hospital mortality, transfer and discharge, discharge disposition, mechanical ventilation, and ICU delirium. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: In the intervention group, staff education alone increased bundle compliance from 9% to 16% (p < 0.0001);data literacy training further increased compliance from 16% to 21% (p = 0.03). This improvement was sustained throughout the study period including the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and was greater than improvement in the nonintervention group (p < 0.001). Full ACF bundle compliance was associated with a lower likelihood of next-day ICU and hospital mortality, discharge to a facility other than home, and was associated with a higher likelihood of next-day extubation in patients. Next-day ICU and hospital discharge likelihood decreased, and delirium frequency was not affected. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating that the combination of staff education, data literacy training, and access to performance data improves ACF bundle compliance, sustains performance, and improves ICU patient outcomes (ICU and hospital mortality, mechanical ventilation duration, and home discharge rates). In contrast to previous studies, increased bundle compliance did not hasten ICU or hospital discharges or reduce delirium frequency in patients.","output":"Improving ABCDEF Bundle Compliance and Clinical Outcomes in the ICU: Randomized Control Trial to Assess the Impact of Performance Measurement, Feedback, and Data Literacy Training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza\\\\like\\\\illness can be caused by a wide range of respiratory viruses.

To this end, hiPSCs were differentiated into lung epithelial progenitor cells (LPCs) and subsequently matured into a functional alveolar type 2 (AT2)-like epithelium with monolayer-like morphology. AT2-like cells cultured at the physiological ALI conditions displayed characteristics of AT2 cells with classical alveolar surfactant protein expressions and lamellar-body like structures. The integrity of the epithelial barriers between the AT2-like cells was confirmed by applying a custom-made device for 96-parallelized transepithelial electric resistance (TEER) measurements. In order to generate an IPF disease-like phenotype in vitro, the functional AT2-like cells were stimulated with cytokines and growth factors present in the alveolar tissue of IPF patients. The cytokines stimulated the secretion of pro-fibrotic biomarker proteins both on the mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) and protein level. Thus, the hiPSC-derived and cellular model system enables the recapitulation of certain IPF hallmarks, while paving the route towards a miniaturized medium throughput approach of pharmaceutical drug discovery.","output":"Functional human iPSC-derived alveolar-like cells cultured in a miniaturized 96?Transwell airCliquid interface model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of 2019 a novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing severe acute respiratory syndrome expanded globally from Wuhan, China.

METHODS We conducted a national test of assessments of four standardized cognitive function data elements among patients in PAC. One hundred and forty-three PAC settings (57 home health agencies, 28 inpatient rehabilitation facilities, 28 long-term care hospitals, and 73 Skilled Nursing Facilities) across 14 U.S. markets from November 2017 to August 2018.

The results of a panel regression analysis showed that derivative use by Malaysian public listed companies was positively connected with earnings volatility, inferring that the use of derivatives did not mitigate earnings volatility as intended. This study also found that both earnings volatility and derivative use have a positive relationship with earnings management.

Previous studies on chemokines have included only small numbers of patients, and the utility of plasma chemokines as prognostic indicators is unclear. Methods: We studied 255 archival plasma samples collected during the first or second week after disease onset. The chemokines interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), monokine induced by interferon- (MIG), interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were measured by cytometric bead array with a 4-color FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Reverse transcription and real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical staining were performed to analyze the production of IP-10 in lung tissue at autopsy. Conditional logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors for adverse disease outcome. Results: Increases in IP-10, MIG, and IL-8 during the first week after onset of fever were associated with adverse outcome (intensive care unit admission or death) in the univariate analysis. During the second week, only MIG concentration was associated with prognosis. After adjusting for other risk factors, plasma IP-10 concentration at the first week remained as an independent prognostic factor, with an odds ratio for adverse outcome of 1.52 (95% confidence interval, 1.05C2.55) per fold increase in plasma IP-10 concentration above the median. During the second week, chemokines provided little independent prognostic information. IP-10 was increased in lung tissue from patients who died of SARS.

Firstly, P. putida KTU-U13, a 13 GIs- and upp-deleted mutant derived from the parental strain P. putida KT2440, was used as a starting strain for further deletion of GIs to generate a series of genome-reduced strains. Subsequently, the two minimal genome strains KTU-U24 and KTU-U27, which had a 7.19% and 8.35% reduction relative to the genome size of KT2440 and were advantageous over the strain KTU (KT2440?upp) and KTU-U13 in several physiological traits such as the maximum specific growth rate, plasmid transformation efficiency, heterologous protein expression capacity and PHA production capacity, were selected as the chassis cells for PHA metabolic engineering. To prevent the formation of the by-product gluconic acid, the glucose dehydrogenase gene was deleted in KTU-U24 and KTU-U27, resulting in KTU-U24?gcd and KTU-U27?gcd. To enhance the transcriptional level of PHA synthase genes (phaC) and the supply of the precursor acetyl-CoA, a strong endogenous promoter P46 was inserted into upstream of the phaC operon and pyruvate dehydrogenase gene in the genome of KTU-U24?gcd and KTU-U27?gcd, to generate KTU-U24?gcd-P46CA and KTU-U27?gcd-P46CA, with the PHA yield of 50.5 wt% and 53.8 wt% (weight percent of PHA in cell dry weight). Finally, KTU-U27?gcd-P46CA, the most minimal KT2440 chassis currently available, was able to accumulate the PHA to 55.82 wt% in a 5-l fermentor, which is the highest PHA yield obtained with P. putida KT2440 so far. This study suggests that genome streamlining in combination with promoter engineering may be a feasible strategy for the development of the MGF for the efficient production of high value products. Moreover, further streamlining of the P. putida KT2440 genome has great potential to create the optimal chassis for synthetic biology applications.","output":"Enhanced production of polyhydroxyalkanoates in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 by a combination of genome streamlining and promoter engineering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The abundance of biomedical text data coupled with advances in natural language processing (NLP) is resulting in novel biomedical NLP (BioNLP) applications. These NLP applications, or tasks, are reliant on the availability of domain-specific language models (LMs) that are trained on a massive amount of data. Most of the existing domain-specific LMs adopted bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) architecture which has limitations, and their generalizability is unproven as there is an absence of baseline results among common BioNLP tasks. RESULTS We present 8 variants of BioALBERT, a domain-specific adaptation of a lite bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (ALBERT), trained on biomedical (PubMed and PubMed Central) and clinical (MIMIC-III) corpora and fine-tuned for 6 different tasks across 20 benchmark datasets. Experiments show that a large variant of BioALBERT trained on PubMed outperforms the state-of-the-art on named-entity recognition (+ 11.09% BLURB score improvement), relation extraction (+ 0.80% BLURB score), sentence similarity (+ 1.05% BLURB score), document classification (+ 0.62% F1-score), and question answering (+ 2.83% BLURB score). It represents a new state-of-the-art in 5 out of 6 benchmark BioNLP tasks. CONCLUSIONS The large variant of BioALBERT trained on PubMed achieved a higher BLURB score than previous state-of-the-art models on 5 of the 6 benchmark BioNLP tasks. Depending on the task, 5 different variants of BioALBERT outperformed previous state-of-the-art models on 17 of the 20 benchmark datasets, showing that our model is robust and generalizable in the common BioNLP tasks.

Therefore, it is essential to have information about the progress of the infections at the national level and thus apply effective public health interventions. Objectives: In this paper, we compare different time series methodologies to predict the number of confirmed cases and deaths from Covid-19 in Chile and thus support the decisions of health agencies. Methods: We modeled the confirmed cases and deaths from Covid-19 in Chile by using ARIMA models, exponential smoothing techniques, Poisson models for time-dependent counting data. In addition, we evaluated the accuracy of the predictions by using a training set and test set. Results: The database used in this paper allows us to say that for the confirmed Covid-19 cases the best model corresponds to a well-known Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time-series model, whereas for deaths from Covid-19 in Chile the best model resulted in damped trend method.

Depletion of circulating monocytes and DC reduced disease incidence and severity. Unlike the classical models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells did not affect disease induction. T cells and demyelinating lesions were observed in the CNS at a later stage as a result of organ-specific inflammation. We propose that alterations in the numbers or function of monocytes and DC coupled to dysregulated expression of chemokines in the neural tissues, favors development of CNS autoimmune disease.","output":"A novel model of demyelinating encephalomyelitis induced by monocytes and dendritic cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rare but dangerous adverse events evidenced after massive vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 are represented by thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. The patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 may develop a pro-thrombotic state with a much higher frequency, thus we decided to investigate the role of Spike protein (the only common product of the two conditions) or the anti-Spike antibodies in the etiopathogenesis of thrombosis. A pathogenic Platelet Factor 4 (PF4)-dependent syndrome, unrelated to the use of heparin therapy, has been reported after the administration of vaccines in the patients manifesting acute thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. Thus, we aimed at shedding light on the structural similarities of Spike of SARS-CoV-2 and PF4 on their eventual biochemical interactions and on the role of their specific antibodies. The similarities between PF4 and Spike-RBD proteins were evaluated by a comparison of the structures and by testing the cross-reactivity of their specific antibodies by ELISA assays. We found that the anti-Spike antibodies do not recognize PF4, on the contrary, the anti-PF4 antibodies show some cross-reactivity for Spike-RBD. More interestingly, we report for the first time that the PF4 and Spike-RBD proteins can bind each other. These data suggest that the interaction of the two proteins could be involved in the generation of anti-PF4 antibodies, their binding to Spike-RBD, which could lead to platelets aggregation due also to their high expression of ACE2.","output":"Interactions of Spike-RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and Platelet Factor 4: New Insights in the Etiopathogenesis of Thrombosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When we visited Damian Family Care Centers' Wards Island facility in New York City, collocating addiction treatment services run by Odyssey House and a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) run by Damian, all we could think was: Why isn't this done everywhere?

In this study, we have selected 41 quinazoline alkaloids from two natural product databases to create an adequate library and performed detailed computational studies against the main protease ( M pro ) of SARS-CoV-2 using two reference compounds, namely famotidine and X77. The screening of the library was carried out by blending the rigid docking and pharmacokinetic analysis that resulted in nine alkaloids as initial leads against M pro . These initial leads were further subjected to advanced flexible docking and were compared with reference compounds (famotidine and X77) for the analysis of structure-based interactions. For further selection, a second screening was carried out based on binding energies and interaction profiles that yielded three alkaloids, namely CNP0416047, 3-hydroxy anisotine and anisotine as final leads. The stereo-electronic features of lead alkaloids were further investigated through additional E-pharmacophore mapping against crystallized X77 reference compound. Additionally, the reactivity of lead alkaloids at the binding sites of the protein was estimated by measuring the electron distribution on the frontier molecular orbitals and HOMOCLUMO band energies. Finally, the stabilities of complexes between lead alkaloids with the protein were accessed extensively using robust molecular dynamics simulation through RMSD, RMSF, Rg and MM-PBSA calculation. Thus, this study identifies three natural quinazoline alkaloids as potential lead inhibitors of M pro through extensive computational analysis. This study performed a full-scale in silico investigations on natural quinazoline alkaloids against the main protease (MPro) of SARS_CoV_2 by examining forty one natural quinazoline alkaloids and identified three alkaloids (CNP0416047, 3-hydroxy anisotine and anisotine) as final lead compounds.

Despite the new available criteria, its early diagnosis remains difficult, highlighting the necessity of looking for a valid muscle wasting biomarker. Myostatin, a muscle mass negative regulator, is one of the potential candidates. The aim of this work is to point out various factors affecting the potential of myostatin as a biomarker of muscle wasting. Based on the literature review, we can say that recent studies produced conflicting results and revealed a number of potential confounding factors influencing their use in sarcopenia diagnosing. These factors include physiological variables (such as age, sex and physical activity) as well as a variety of disorders (including heart failure, metabolic syndrome, kidney failure and inflammatory diseases) and differences in laboratory measurement methodology. Our conclusion is that although myostatin alone might not prove to be a feasible biomarker, it could become an important part of a recently proposed panel of muscle wasting biomarkers. However, a thorough understanding of the interrelationship of these markers, as well as establishing a valid measurement methodology for myostatin and revising current research data in the light of new criteria of sarcopenia, is needed.","output":"Myostatin as a Biomarker of Muscle Wasting and other Pathologies-State of the Art and Knowledge Gaps."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of COVID-19 has caused millions of infections, which has led to a great loss all over the world, socially and economically.

Since the very beginning of the pandemic, researchers in the artificial intelligence area have proposed a large number of automatic diagnosing models, hoping to assist radiologists and improve the diagnosing accuracy. However, after two years of development, there are still few models that can actually be applied in real-world scenarios. Numerous problems have emerged in the research of the automated diagnosis of COVID-19. In this paper, we present a systematic review of these diagnosing models.

First, we compare the medical image modalities (CT or X-ray) for COVID-19 diagnosis from both the clinical perspective and the artificial intelligence perspective. Then, we classify existing methods into two typesimage-level diagnosis (i.e., classification-based methods) and pixel-level diagnosis (i.e., segmentation-based models). For both types of methods, we define universal model pipelines and analyze the techniques that have been applied in each step of the pipeline in detail. In addition, we also review some commonly adopted public COVID-19 datasets. More importantly, we present an in-depth discussion of the existing automated diagnosis models and note a total of three significant problems: biased model performance evaluation;inappropriate implementation details;and a low reproducibility, reliability and explainability.

Owing to the differences in its genotype, FCoV belongs to a separate clade along with other viruses, such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and canine coronavirus (CCoV), which can be isolated from cats. In this study, a PCR assay was developed to differentiate these coronaviruses concurrently. Multiplex differential RT-PCR was performed with primers based on the highly conserved coronavirus membrane protein. Three primer sets were designed: a primer pair (S1 and S2) that can bind to conserved sequences in all target coronaviruses, a CCoV-specific primer (S3), and a TGEV-specific primer (S4). Because of the high sequence homology among FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV, a nucleotide preceding the last pair of dissimilar nucleotides in S3 and S4 was substituted with an inosine to allow primer binding. This assay could detect and differentiate FCoV (n = 7), CCoV (n = 4), and TGEV (n = 8) precisely and did not show any cross-reactivity with other pathogens.

Furthermore, exposure to air pollution can increase human sensitivity to respiratory pathogens via damage to the respiratory track or via airborne transmission on the surface of particulate matter, and might be an additional factor influencing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates. The aim of this study was to examine the association between populations' exposure to air pollution and the morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19. METHODS: We examined the association between population-weighted long term exposure to PM(2.5) and NOx, and the morbidity and mortality over time following the detection of the first COVID-19 positive case in 36 OECD countries. Pearson and Spearman correlations between daily COVID-19 morbidity and mortality (Jan-Jun 2020) on the 10(th), 20(th), 40(th) and 60(th) and 80(th) days since first confirmed case in the country, and demographic, health, economic, and environmental data were calculated. Multivariate linear regression were used to examine the associations between demographic, health, economic and air pollution features and the rate of confirmed cases and deaths on the 60(th) and 80(th) days following the first confirmed case. RESULTS: PM(2.5) concentrations in 2015-2017 were positively correlated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality on the 10(th), 20(th), 40(th) and 60(th) days since the first confirmed case in all countries. NOx concentrations in 2015-2017 and country's density (population/Km(2)) were positively correlated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality on the 60(th) day. All multivariate linear regressions consisting PM(2.5) concentrations models were statistically significant. Our models also emphasize the importance of the relative number of hospital beds in decreasing the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The adverse health outcomes stemming from long-term exposure to various air pollutants has long been known to the scientific community. According to our results and previously published studies, it appears that long-term exposure to air pollutants concentrations exceeding WHO guidelines, such as PM(2.5) and NOx might exacerbate morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19.

The SAFER (Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving) algorithm was applied together with the radiation-use efficiency (RUE) model for biometeorological index assessments. The highest latent heat fluxes (E), above 8.0 MJ m-2 d-1, at the end of the year, coincide with the progressive increases on both rainfall and global solar radiation (RG) levels, and drop to below 5.0 MJ m-2 d-1 in the middle of the year, during the driest conditions. The same tendencies along the year are verified for sensible heat fluxes (H), for which mean pixel values are above 3.5 MJ m-2 d-1 at the end of the year. On the one hand, the highest values for water productivity (WP), which is considered the ratio of actual evapotranspiration (ET) to biomass production (BIO), above 4.0 kg m-3, are verified in April, period under increasing BIO and low ET rates. On the other hand, the lowest WP values (below 2.0 kg m-3) occur between August and October, when BIO is low, and ET is high. Although the area featuring good WP levels under high precipitation (P), with rainfalls generally above ET, supplementary irrigation may benefit agriculture in some periods of the year.

The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is emerging as a potential candidate biomarker for perioperative risk stratification. We therefore performed this systematic review and meta-analysis on the prognostic value of elevated preoperative NLR in vascular surgery. METHODS We searched Embase (Ovid), Medline (Ovid), and the Cochrane Library database from inception to June 2019. Screening was performed, and included all peer-reviewed original research studies reporting preoperative NLR in adult emergent and elective vascular surgical patients. Studies were assessed for bias and quality of evidence using a standardized tool. Meta-analysis was performed by general linear (mixed-effects) modelling where possible, and otherwise a narrative review was conducted. Between-study heterogeneity was estimated using the Chi-squared statistic and explored qualitatively. RESULTS Fourteen studies involving 5,652 patients were included. The overall methodological quality was good. Elevated preoperative NLR was associated with increased risk of long-term mortality (HR 1.40 [95%CI: 1.13-1.74], Chi-squared 60.3%, 7 studies, 3,637 people) and short-term mortality (OR: 3.08; 95%CI: 1.91-4.95), Chi-squared 66.59%, 4 studies, 945 people). Outcome measures used by fewer studies such as graft patency and amputation free survival were assessed via narrative review. CONCLUSIONS NLR is a promising, readily obtainable, prognostic biomarker for mortality outcomes following vascular surgery. Heterogeneity in patient factors, severity of vascular disease, and type of vascular surgery performed renders direct comparison of outcomes from the current literature challenging. This systematic review supports further investigation for NLR measurement in pre-vascular surgical risk stratification. In particular, the establishment of a universally accepted NLR cut-off value is of importance in real-world implementation of this biomarker.","output":"Prognostic Significance of Preoperative Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio in Vascular Surgery: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aim: Remote ischemic conditioning is a procedure purported to reduce the ischemic injury of an organ. This study aimed to explore the efficiency and safety of remote ischemic conditioning in patients with acute ischemic stroke. We hypothesized that remote ischemic conditioning administered from the first day of hospital admission would improve the infarct volume and clinical outcome at 180 days. Material and Methods: We performed a unicentric double-blind randomized controlled trial. We included all patients consecutively admitted to an Emergency Neurology Department with acute ischemic stroke, ineligible for reperfusion treatment, up to 24 hours from onset. All subjects were assigned to receive secondary stroke prevention treatment along with remote ischemic conditioning on the non-paretic upper limb during the first 5 days of hospitalization, twice daily - a blood pressure cuff placed around the arm was inflated to 20 mmHg above the systolic blood pressure (up to 180 mmHg) in the experimental group and 30 mmHg in the sham group. The primary outcome was the difference in infarct volume (measured on brain CT scan) at 180 days compared to baseline, whereas the secondary outcomes included differences in clinical scores (NIHSS, mRS, IADL, ADL) and cognitive/mood changes (MoCA, PHQ-9) at 180 days compared to baseline. Results: We enrolled 40 patients; the mean age was 65 years and 60% were men. Subjects in the interventional group had slightly better recovery in terms of disability, as demonstrated by the differences in disability scores between admission and 6 months (e.g., the median difference score for Barthel was ?10 in the sham group and ?17.5 in the interventional group, for ADL ?2 in the sham group and ?2.5 in the interventional group), as well as cognitive performance (the median difference score for MoCA was ?2 in the sham group and ?3 in the interventional group), but none of these differences reached statistical significance. The severity of symptoms (median difference score for NIHSS = 5 for both groups) and depression rate (median difference score for PHQ-9 = 0 for both groups) were similar in the two groups. The median difference between baseline infarct volume and final infarct volume at 6 months was slightly larger in the sham group compared to the interventional group (p = 0.4), probably due to an initial larger infarct volume in the former. Conclusion: Our results suggest that remote ischemic conditioning might improve disability and cognition. The difference between baseline infarct volume and final infarct volume at 180 days was slightly larger in the sham group.","output":"Remote Ischemic Conditioning May Improve Disability and Cognition After Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Purpose: This document provides guidance for the communications infrastructure industry to support a safe, clean environment for workers COVID-19 (Disease);Disaster recovery;Communication in public health;Disaster recovery--Plans","output":"COVID-19 Industry Guidance: Communications Infrastructure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence and clinical relevance of viremia in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been well studied.

We conducted 9 online focus groups with 30 students from a large public university to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the food choices of those displaced from their typical residences due to the pandemic. To the authors knowledge, this is the first qualitative research to examine the changes in food choice for US university students due to COVID-19 and offer insight into why these changes occurred. Students in this study reported significant, and often negative, changes in food choices during the pandemic compared to when on campus. Many students described changes in the foods they ate, the amount consumed, and increased snacking behaviors. We found food availability and household roles to be powerful factors influencing food choices. Most students had returned to family homes with many students taking a passive role in activities that shape food choices. Parents usually purchased groceries and prepared meals with students eating foods made available to them. Increased free time contributed to boredom and snacking for some students, while for a few students with increased skills and/or agency, additional free time was used to plan and prepare meals. About a third of the students attributed eating different foods at home to food availability issues related to the pandemic such as groceries being out of stock, purchasing non-perishable foods, or the inability to get to a store.

However, the use of barbed progressive tension sutures (B-PTSs) in deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap donor-site closure has not been investigated. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with DIEP flap reconstruction in a 3-year period at 2 institutions by 2 surgeons. Patients were compared by method of DIEP donor-site closure. Group 1 had barbed running progressive tension sutures without drain placement. Group 2 had interrupted progressive tension closure with abdominal drain placement (PTS-AD). Group 3 had closure with only abdominal drain placement (AD). Data collected included demographics, perioperative data, and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS Seventy-five patients underwent DIEP reconstruction (25 B-PTS, 25 PTS-AD, and 25 AD). Patient characteristics-age, body mass index, comorbidities, smoking status, and chemotherapy-were not significantly different between groups. Rate of seroma was 1.3% (B-PTS = 0%, PTS-AD = 4%, AD = 0%), wound dehiscence 16% (B-PTS = 8%, PTS-AD = 16%, AD = 24%), and umbilical necrosis 5.3% (B-PTS = 0%, PTS-AD = 0%, AD = 16%). No hematomas were observed in any patients. No statistically significant difference was found between complication rates across groups. CONCLUSIONS Use of B-PTSs for abdominal closure after DIEP flap harvest can obviate the need for abdominal drains. Complication rates following this technique are not significantly different from closure using progressive tension suture and abdominal drain placement. This practice can prevent the use of abdominal drains, which can promote patient mobility, increase independence upon discharge, and contribute to patient satisfaction.","output":"No-drain DIEP Flap Donor-site Closure Using Barbed Progressive Tension Sutures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundIn March 2020, due to COVID-19 the Social and Therapeutic Horticulture (STH) group in day services had to close.

IGD is an area of concern in the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which can be objectively assessed by dysfunctional behaviour and the increasing time of being online, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Electroencephalography (EEG) identifies amplitude changes in the evoked response potential (ERP) among IGDs, correlated with underlying comorbidities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A scoping review was performed to elaborate on the research regarding resting-state EEG and task-based EEG, particularly for Go/No-go paradigms pertaining to subjects with IAD or specifically IGD. The role of EEG was identified in its diagnostic capability to identify the salient changes that occurred in the response to reward network and the executive control network, using restingstate and task-based EEG. The implication of using EEG in monitoring the therapy for IAD and IGD was also reviewed. RESULTS: EEG generally revealed reduced beta waves and increased theta waves in addicts. IGD with depression demonstrated increased theta and decreased alpha waves. Whereas increased P300, a late cognitive ERP component, was frequently associated with impaired excessive allocation of attentional resources of the IAD towards addiction-specific cues. IGD had increased whole brain delta waves at baseline, which showed significant reduction post therapy. CONCLUSION: EEG can identify distinct neurophysiological changes among Internet Addiction Disorder and Internet Gaming Disorder that are akin to substance abuse disorders.","output":"Electroencephalography-detected neurophysiology of internet addiction disorder and internet gaming disorder in adolescents - A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current spread of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) and its disease COVID-19, has confronted society with a paradigm shift in all fields: political, social, religious, economic, and healthcare is no exception This has created challenges for the adequate and safe delivery of services for patients and healthcare workers Notwithstanding the global efforts to contain the spread of the disease, the outbreak continues to escalate COVID-19 is currently the disease receiving the most attention worldwide;however, patients continue to present other conditions that demand the same level of care to be effectively controlled, so that they do not become another healthcare concern, as a result of potential secondary complications due to poor care This reflection article gives recommendations to care for patients requiring diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures under sedation, outside the operating room, keeping the current standards and biosecurity protocols in mind Moreover, it provides a brief description of the disease, symptoms, diagnosis and transmission routes Resumen La actual propagacin del SARS-COV-2 (Coronavirus 2 del sndrome respiratorio agudo severo) y su enfermedad, la COVID-19, ha enfrentado a la sociedad a un cambio de paradigmas en todos los aspectos: poltico, social, religioso, econmico, y el rea de la salud no es la excepcin;lo que ha generado retos para la adecuada prestacin de servicios dentro del marco de seguridad para los pacientes y el personal asistencial A pesar de los esfuerzos mundiales para contener la propagacin de la enfermedad, el brote sigue en aumento La COVID-19 es en este momento la enfermedad de mayor atencin en el mundo, pero los pacientes siguen presentando otras patologas que requieren igual atencin para ser controladas de manera eficaz, de modo que no se conviertan en otro problema para los sistemas de salud por las posibles complicaciones secundarias a la desatencin de las mismas Este artculo de reflexin brinda recomendaciones para la atencin de pacientes que requieren procedimientos diagnsticos y/o teraputicos bajo sedacin fuera de quirfanos, teniendo en cuenta la normatividad actual y los protocolos de bioseguridad vigentes;adicionalmente, proporciona una breve descripcin de la enfermedad, sntomas, diagnstico y rutas de transmisin","output":"Recommendations for sedation outside the operating room during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients are at high risk for late occurring radiation-related morbidity and recurrence, necessitating close long-term medical surveillance.

Enteral nutrition (EN) is commonly used in case of hypercatabolism. However, the effect of amount of calories in EN on hypercatabolism remains unexplored. OBJECTIVE: Here, we compared the effect of low-calorie, medium-calorie and high-calorie EN on hypercatabolism in the acute phase of endotoxemia, which is associated with gastrointestinal hormones and hypothalamic neuropeptide proopiomelanocortin (POMC). METHODS: Overall 84 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used for research. A set of rats were divided into 5 groups, Control (NS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) groups were fed a standard chow diet; LPS + L (LPS + 40 kcal/kg/day EN), LPS + M (LPS + 80 kcal/kg/day EN) and LPS + H (LPS + 120 kcal/kg/day EN) groups received EN through a gastric tube for 3 days. Another set of rats were used for parallel control experiment and divided into 5 groups: NS + F (saline + fasting) and LPS + F (LPS + fasting) groups were given no food, NS + L (saline + 40 kcal/kg/day EN), NS + M (saline + 80 kcal/kg/day EN) and NS + H (saline + 120 kcal/kg/day EN) groups received EN through a gastric tube for 3 days. Hypercatabolism was evaluated by assessing skeletal muscle protein synthesis and atrophy, insulin resistance, and corticosterone levels. Moreover, serum inflammatory factors, gastrointestinal hormones, hypothalamic ghrelin, growth hormone secretagogue receptor-1, hypothalamic neuropeptide, and intestinal injury indicators were detected. RESULTS: Low-calorie EN effectively increased serum and hypothalamic ghrelin possibly due to slight intestinal barrier damage, thereby decreasing hypothalamic POMC expression; consequently, it alleviated rat insulin resistance, reduced blood cortisol levels and muscle atrophy, and improved the survival rate of rats in the acute phase of endotoxemia. Interestingly, with an increase in calories in enteral nutrition, the aforementioned effects did not increase. CONCLUSIONS: Low-calorie EN could effectively increase gastrointestinal hormone ghrelin by reducing intestinal damage and suppressing POMC expression to ameliorate hypercatabolism when compared with medium-calorie and high-calorie EN. Therefore Low-calorie EN may be preferred for providing EN in the acute stage of endotoxemia.","output":"Comparison of the effects of different calorie amounts of enteral nutrition in hypercatabolism associated with ghrelin-POMC in endotoxemic rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses are obligatory intracellular pathogens with a simple structure consisting of assembled proteins enclosing the nucleic acid genome with or without a lipid envelope.

Our objective was to evaluate the impact of decreased Hib vaccination due to COVID-19 on invasive Hib disease burden in Japan. METHODS: Using a deterministic dynamic transmission model (susceptible-carriage-infection-recovery model), the incidence rates of invasive Hib disease in under 5 year olds in rapid vaccination recovery and persistent vaccination declined scenarios were compared for the next 10 years after 2020. The national Hib vaccination rate after the impact of COVID-19 reduced to 87% and 73% in 2020 from approximately 97% each in 2013-2019 for primary and booster doses. RESULTS: While the persistent decline scenarios revealed an increase in invasive Hib disease incidence to 0.50/100,000 children under 5 years old, the incidence of the rapid recovery scenario slightly increased with a consistent decline of incidence after 2021. The shorter the duration of the decline in vaccination rate was, the smaller the incremental disease burden observed in the model. Compared to the rapid recovery scenario, the permanent decline scenario showed a 296.87 cumulative incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALY) loss for the next 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: The persistent decline of Hib vaccination rate due to COVID-19 causes an incremental disease burden irrespective of the possible decline of Hib transmission rate by COVID-19 mitigation measures.

The current study compared negative symptom severity scores obtained during the pandemic to pre-pandemic assessments in two samples: (1) outpatients with chronic schizophrenia (SZ: n = 32) and matched healthy controls (CN: n = 31) and (2) individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR: n = 25) and matched CN (n = 30).

Inflammation-based indexes have been widely used to predict the prognosis of patients with cancers and some inflammatory diseases. In our study, we aim to explore the predictive value of the inflammation-based indexes in SFTS patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 82 patients diagnosed with SFTS. The inflammation-based indexes, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), aggregate index of systemic inflammation (AISI) and C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR), were compared between the survival and death patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the predictive ability of MLR, AISI, and CAR. The survival analysis was based on the KaplanCMeier (KM) method. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the independent risk factors of poor prognosis in patients with SFTS. RESULTS: The CAR is higher in the death group while MLR and AISI were higher in the survival group. The ROC curve analysis indicated CAR exhibited more predictive value than the other indexes and the optimal cut-off value of CAR was equal to or greater than 0.14. KM survival curve showed that higher CAR was significantly correlated to the lower overall survival in SFTS patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that CAR was an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in patients with SFTS. CONCLUSION: The CAR is an independent risk factor for death in patients with SFTS and could predict the poor prognosis of SFTS patients.

Drug checking, or the use of technology to provide insight into the contents of illicit drug products, is an overdose prevention strategy with an emerging evidence base. The use of portable spectrometry devices to provide point-of-service analysis of the contents of illicit drugs been adopted by harm reduction organizations internationally but is only emerging in the United States. This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators of implementing drug checking services with spectrometry devices in an urban harm reduction organization and syringe service program serving economically marginalized people who use drugs in Boston, Massachusetts (USA). METHODS: In-vivo observations and semi-structured interviews with harm reduction staff and participants were conducted between March 2019 and December 2020. We used the consolidated framework for implementation research to identify implementation barriers and facilitators. RESULTS: This implementation effort was facilitated by the organizations shared culture of harm reductionwhich fostered shared implementation goals and beliefs about the intervention among staff personsits horizontal organizational structure, strong identification with the organization among staff, and strong relationships with external funders. Barriers to implementation included the technological complexity of the advanced spectroscopy devices utilized for drug checking. Program staff indicated that commercially available spectroscopy devices are powerful but not always well-suited for drug checking efforts, describing their technological capacities as the Bronze Age of Drug Checking. Other significant barriers include the legal ambiguity of drug checking services, disruptive and oppositional police activity, and the responses and programmatic changes demanded by the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: For harm reduction organizations to be successful in efforts to implement and scale drug checking services, these critical barriersespecially regressive policing policies and prohibitive costsneed to be addressed.

To prevent the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and treat patients with mild symptoms, sports stadiums and convention centers were reconstructed into mobile hospitals. Research Question: It is unknown whether a mobile cabin hospital can provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms. Study Design and Methods: This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 421 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a mobile cabin hospital in Wuhan from February 9, 2020, to March 5, 2020. Clinical data comprised patient age, sex, clinical presentation, chest imaging, nucleic acid testing, length of hospitalization, and outcomes. Results: Of the patients who were discharged from the cabin hospital, 362 (86.0%) were categorized as recovered; 14.0% developed severe symptoms and were transferred to a designated hospital. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (60.6%) and cough (52.0%); 5.2% exhibited no obvious symptoms. High fever (> 39.0C) was more common in severe cases than in recovered cases (18.6% vs 6.6%). The distribution of lung lesions was peripheral in 85.0% of patients, multifocal in 69.4%, and bilateral in 68.2%. The most common pattern was ground-glass opacity (67.7%), followed by patchy shadowing (49.2%). The incidence of patchy shadowing was higher in patients with severe disease (66.1%) than in those who recovered (31.8%, P < .0001). The median length of hospitalization was 17 days (interquartile range, 14-19 days), and the median time taken for positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results to become negative in recovered patients was 8 days (interquartile range, 6-10 days). Interpretation: Mobile cabin hospitals provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms and offer an effective isolation area to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of 421 Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Treated in a Mobile Cabin Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In September 2018, India launched Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), a nationally implemented government-funded health insurance scheme to improve access to quality inpatient care, increase financial protection, and reduce unmet need for the most vulnerable population groups.

When viruses invade the glomeruli from the bloodstream, glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) initiate the innate immune reactions. We investigated the expression of interferon (IFN)-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) 1/2/3, antiviral molecules, in human GECs treated with a toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 agonist. Role of IFIT1/2/3 in the expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) was also examined. METHODS: Human GECs were cultured and stimulated with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly IC), a synthetic TLR3 agonist. Real-time qPCR, Western blotting, and ELISA were used to examine the expression of IFIT1/2/3, IFN-?, and CXCL10. RNA interference against IFN-? or IFIT1/2/3 was also performed. RESULTS: Expression of IFIT1/2/3 and CXCL10 was induced by poly IC in GECs. The inductions were inhibited by RNA interfering of IFN-?. Knockdown of IFIT1/2/3 decreased the CXCL10 expression. Knockdown of IFIT3 decreased the expression of IFIT1 and IFIT2 proteins. CONCLUSION: IFIT1/2/3 and CXCL10 were induced by poly IC via IFN-? in GECs. IFIT1/2/3 may increase the expression of CXCL10 which induces lymphocyte chemotaxis and may inhibit the replication of infected viruses.

We determined whether or not hypophosphatemia in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was associated with specific pathogens, patient factors, disease severity, and mortality. METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed 600 patients with CAP who were admitted to our hospital between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2019. RESULTS: Hypophosphatemia was found in 72 (12.0%) of the 600 patients. The most frequent causative microbial agents of CAP in patients with hypophosphatemia were S. pneumoniae, Legionella spp., and influenza virus, whereas in severely ill patients with hypophosphatemia, influenza virus was the most common. Legionella spp., diabetes mellitus, and severe pneumonia were the independent factors for hypophosphatemia in the multivariable analysis. An impaired performance status, severe status on admission, interstitial pneumonia, bacteremia, and guideline-discordant therapy were the independent factors associated with mortality in the multivariable analysis. Hypophosphatemia was not significantly associated with mortality but showed a trend towards higher mortality in the multivariable analysis.

OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of asthma among hospitalized children with acute symptomatic COVID-19, compare demographic and clinical outcomes between asthmatics and nonasthmatics, and characterize behaviors of our outpatient pediatric population. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective study of pediatric patients admitted to the Cohen Children's Medical Center at Northwell Health with symptomatic COVID-19 within 4 months of the surge beginning in March 2020 and a retrospective analysis of pediatric asthma outpatients seen in the previous 6 months. Baseline demographic variables and clinical outcomes for inpatients, and medication compliance, health behaviors, and asthma control for outpatients were collected. RESULTS: Thirty-eight inpatients and 95 outpatients were included. The inpatient prevalence of asthma was 34.2%. Asthmatics were less likely to have abnormal chest x-rays (CXRs), require oxygen support, and be treated with remdesivir.

Prevention strategies to control the transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as closing of schools, refraining from gathering, and social distancing, have direct impacts on mental well-being. SARS-CoV-2 has a devastating psychological impact on the mental health status of the community and, particularly when associated with psychotic symptoms, it could affect the overall quality-of-life. The virus also has the potential to enter and infect the brain. As a result, psychosis symptoms could be an emerging phenomenon associated with the corona virus pandemic. The presence of psychotic symptoms may complicate the management options of patients with COVID-19. Objective: The aim of this article review is to elaborate the relationships between COVID-19 and psychotic symptoms. Methodology: We independently searched different electronic databases, such as Google scholar, PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychInfo, and other relevant sources published in English globally, by using the search terms psychosis and COVID-19, corona virus, brief psychotic, schizophrenia, organic psychosis, infectious disease, mental illness, pandemics, and psychiatry in various permutations and combinations. Results: The results of the included studies revealed that patients with a novel corona virus had psychotic symptoms, including hallucination in different forms of modality, delusion, disorganized speech, and grossly disorganized or catatonic behaviors. The patients with COVID-19-related psychotic symptoms had responded with a short-term administration of the antipsychotic medication. Conclusion and Recommendation: A corona virus-related psychosis has been identified in different nations, but it is difficult to conclude that a novel corona virus has been biologically related to psychosis or exacerbates psychotic symptoms. Therefore, to identify the causal relationships between COVID-19 and psychosis, the researchers should investigate the prospective study on the direct biological impacts of COVID-19 and psychosis, and the clinicians should pay attention for psychotic symptoms at the treatment center and isolation rooms in order to reduce the complication of a novel corona virus.","output":"Available evidence and ongoing hypothesis on corona virus (COVID-19) and psychosis: Is corona virus and psychosis related? a narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Composite materials and their applications constitute a hot field of research nowadays due to the fact that they comprise a combination of the unique properties of each component of which they consist. Very often, they exhibit better performance and properties compared to their combined building blocks. Graphene oxide (GO), as the most widely used derivative of graphene, has attracted widespread attention because of its excellent properties. Abundant oxygen-containing functional groups on GO can provide various reactive sites for chemical modification or functionalization of GO, which in turn can be used to develop novel GO-based composites. This review outlines the most recent advances in the field of novel dyes and pigments encompassing GO as a key ingredient or as an important cofactor. The interactions of graphene with other materials/compounds are highlighted. The special structure and unique properties of GO have a great effect on the performance of fabricated hybrid dyes and pigments by enhancing the color performance of dyes, the anticorrosion properties of pigments, the viscosity and rheology of inks, etc., which further expands the applications of dyes and pigments in dyeing, optical elements, solar-thermal energy storage, sensing, coatings, and microelectronics devices. Finally, challenges in the current development as well as the future prospects of GO-based dyes and pigments are also discussed.

Global pandemic concerns stem from their high mortality rates, capacity for human-to-human spread by respiratory transmission, and complete lack of approved therapeutic countermeasures. Limiting disease may require the development of virus-directed and host-directed therapeutic strategies due to the acute etiology of hCoV infections. Therefore, understanding how hCoVChost interactions cause pathogenic outcomes relies upon mammalian models that closely recapitulate the pathogenesis of hCoVs in humans. Pragmatism has largely been the driving force underpinning mice as highly effective mammalian models for elucidating hCoVChost interactions that govern pathogenesis. Notably, tractable mouse genetics combined with hCoV reverse genetic systems has afforded the concomitant manipulation of virus and host genetics to evaluate virusChost interaction networks in disease. In addition to assessing etiologies of known hCoVs, mouse models have clinically predictive value as tools to appraise potential disease phenotypes associated with pre-emergent CoVs. Knowledge of CoV pathogenic potential before it crosses the species barrier into the human population provides a highly desirable preclinical platform for addressing global pathogen preparedness, an overarching directive of the World Health Organization. Although we recognize that results obtained in robust mouse models require evaluation in non-human primates, we focus this review on the current state of hCoV mouse models, their use as tractable complex genetic organisms for untangling complex hCoVChost interactions, and as pathogenesis models for preclinical evaluation of novel therapeutic interventions.","output":"Modeling pathogenesis of emergent and pre-emergent human coronaviruses in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There is no valid and reliable patient self-reported measure assessing symptomology among outpatients with COVID-19. The Symptoms Evolution of COVID-19 (SE-C19) is a self-administered new instrument that includes 23 symptoms, each rated for severity at their worst moment within the last 24 hours. We studied the psychometric properties of SE-C19. Methods: Reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change of the SE-C19 were assessed in 657 outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 enrolled in NCT04425629. SE-C19 and Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) were administered daily from baseline (predose at Day 1) to end of study (Day 29). Findings: Most patients (70.0%) were aged []50 years and white (85.5%). At baseline, patients reported an average (SD) of 6.6 (3.9) symptoms (ie, rated as at least Mild) with 3.8 (3.3) of these symptoms being rated as Moderate or Severe. By Day 29, most symptoms had resolved; 74.4% of patients reported no symptoms and on average, only 0.6 (SD 1.5) were reported as at least Mild. Stable patients according to the PGIS showed scores with intraclass correlation values indicating moderate-to-good test-retest reliability (ie, 0.50-0.90). At baseline, 20 item scores (87%) varied significantly across PGIS defined groups supporting the validity of SE-C19. A symptom resolution endpoint was defined after excluding the item 'Sneezing', due to its low ability to discriminate severity levels, and 'Confusion', 'Rash', and 'Vomiting', due to their low prevalence in this population. Symptoms resolution required complete absence of all remaining items, except 'Cough', 'Fatigue', and 'Headache', which could be Mild or Moderate in severity. Interpretation: We identified 19 items that are valid and reliable to measure disease-related symptoms in COVID-19 outpatients and propose a definition of symptom resolution that could be used in future clinical trials and potentially, also in clinical practice.","output":"A reliable and valid measure of COVID-19 patient-reported symptoms in outpatients: the Symptoms Evolution of COVID-19 (SE-C19) instrument"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2014 was associated with high public anxiety in the affected countries. Media speculations may have increased this psychological distress. The healthcare community was the most distressed because they were at the highest risk of infection. This study is the first to explore MERS-CoV epidemic impact on medical students perception and determinants of their psychological distress during this outbreak. METHODS: We randomly selected and surveyed 200 students from the College of Medicine at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A predesigned questionnaire was answered by participants, and the collected data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-four (87%) responded. Female students had a significantly higher mean stress level than males (P < 0.001). Participants had a mean GAD score of 2.7  3.1 and a median of 2. Perceived sufficiency of information score was the highest mean and median (17.4  4.2 and 18 respectively). College and hospital announcements were the most common source of information (25.4%). One hundred and thirty-four (77%) reported minimal anxiety, thirty-two (18.4%) reported mild anxiety, 8 (4.6%) reported moderate anxiety, and none of them reported severe anxiety (score >14). The stress level (as reported on 1C10 scale) shows significant correlation with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score. We found in this study that significant predictors in our model, in terms of more significant to the least, were: an increased self-report on hygienic habits, self-reported social avoidance, the generalized anxiety score and finally being female gander while other variables including numbers of resources access, agreeing with public fear and knowledge score on MERS-CoV all were found to be non-significant. However, the number of accessed resources, as per students, has borderline significant correlation with higher self-reported anxiety from MERS-CoV.

It shows that older people living in such areas are likely to experience a ?double lockdown? as a result of restrictions imposed by social distancing combined with the intensification of social and spatial inequalities. This argument is presented as follows: first, the paper examines the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on older people, highlighting how the pandemic is both creating new and reinforcing existing inequalities in ageing along the lines of gender, class, ethnicity, race, ability and sexuality. Second, the paper explores the role of spatial inequalities in the context of COVID-19, highlighting how the pandemic is having a disproportionate impact on deprived urban areas already affected by cuts to public services, the loss of social infrastructure and pressures on the voluntary sector. Finally, the paper examines how interrelated social inequalities at both the individual and spatial level are affecting the lives of older people living in deprived urban neighbourhoods during the pandemic.

The analysis is based on a calibrated residential building stock model for Saudi Arabia supported by national statistics regarding the characteristics of AC systems. Various housing prototypes, vintages, and locations are included in the analysis. Specifically, the analysis considers the scaling up of the government's High Efficiency AC (HEAC) program which offers 900 Saudi Riyals (240 USD) per unit to consumers for up to 6 split system units with an energy efficiency rating (EER) of 13.0 or more per household. The main findings of the study suggest that upgrading the existing old stock of window units and split systems currently in place to the requirements of HEAC program would generate a reduction in electricity consumption of around 33 TWh/year and 24 million tons of CO2. Due to the effect of the HEAC consumer subsidy, purchasing a high efficiency unit has a simple payback period for the consumer of 5 years which is faster than less efficient AC options. This would come at a cost to the government of approximately 6 Billion USD resulting in an annual income of 3.0 Billion USD from the sale of avoided fuel associated with the saved electricity consumption.","output":"Transitioning to high efficiency air conditioning in Saudi Arabia: A benefit cost analysis for residential buildings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There is sparse information to describe the clinical features and outcomes of patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Methods: In a single-center retrospective observational study, 50 patients infected with COVID-19 were studied Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared Results: The mean age of the patients was 48 8 years, with male predominance Dry cough, fever, and dyspnea were the most complaining symptoms on admission Chronic medical illnesses before admission were present in 56% of the patients The most common laboratory abnormalities were lymphopenia, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, high serum creatinine level, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and increasing ESR and CRP levels Bilateral mixed ground-glass opacity and consolidation were observed in chest CT scan of most patients Some patients required supplemental oxygen and some needed invasive mechanical ventilation Blood oxygen saturation was different between survivors and nonsurvivors 10% of patients died, of whom 60% were men 40% of dead cases had chronic medical illnesses;60% underwent invasive mechanical ventilation Conclusion: Among the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, the frequent clinical presentation was with a wide range of signs and symptoms The laboratory changes suggest that COVID-19 infection may be related to cellular immune deficiency, myocardial, hepatic, and kidney injury Additional research is needed to elucidate COVID-19 pathogenesis ? 2021 Iran University of Medical Sciences","output":"Clinical features of 50 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus in Bandar Abbas, Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In our study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of Coupled Plasma Filtration Adsorption (CPFA) treatment in situations with severe disease progression like sepsis, septic shock and multiple organ failure, considered to be secondary to cytokine storm, in COVID-19 disease.

These patients show a distinct profile of comorbidity, which makes their care more complex. In recent years, the PROFUND index, a specific tool for estimating the mortality rate at one year in pluripathology patients, has been developed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the PROFUND index and of in-hospital and 30-day mortality after discharge of patients admitted for acute heart failure (AHF). Materials and Methods: A prospective multicenter longitudinal study was performed that included patients admitted with AHF and 2 comorbid conditions. Clinical, analytical, and prognostic variables were collected. The PROFUND index was collected in all patients and rates of in-hospital and 30-day mortality after discharge were analyzed. A bivariate analysis was performed with quantitative variables between patients who died and those who survived at the 30-day follow-up. A logistic regression analysis was performed with the variables that obtained statistical significance in the bivariate analysis between deceased and surviving subjects. Results: A total of 128 patients were included. Mean age was 80.5 +/? 9.98 years, and women represented 51.6%. The mean PROFUND index was 5.26 +/? 4.5. The mortality rate was 8.6% in-hospital and 20.3% at 30 days. Preserved left ventricular ejection fraction was found in 60.9%. In the sample studied, there were patients with a PROFUND score < 7 predominated (89 patients (70%) versus 39 patients (31%) with a PROFUND score  7).

Eye care professionals may be especially susceptible to mental health problems due to high-risk exposures to patients. Yet, no prior research has studied mental health issues among eye care professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic among eye care professionals. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey study among eye care professionals and students in the United States and Canada from June 23 to July 8, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 8505 eye care professionals and students received email invitations to the survey and 2134 participated. We measured mental health outcomes including symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress using validated scales, as well as potential risk factors including demographic characteristics, state-level COVID-19 case counts, participants patient interactions, childcare responsibilities, and pre-pandemic stress levels. Linear multiple regression and logistic regression analyses were used to determine relationships between risk factors and mental health outcomes. RESULTS: We found that 38.4% of eyecare professional participants in the survey met screening threshold as probable cases of anxiety, depression, or both during the COVID-19 pandemic. Controlling for self-reported pre-pandemic stress level and state COVID-19 case daily cases, significant risk factors for depression, anxiety, and psychological stress during the COVID-19 pandemic included: being female, younger age, and being Black or Asian. Interestingly, we found two somewhat surprising protective factors against depression symptoms: more frequent interactions with patients and having a greater proportion of childcare responsibilities at home. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high prevalence of mental health problems and revealed disparities in mental health among eye care personnel and students: Female, younger, Black, and Asian populations are particularly vulnerable to mental health issues. These results indicate that it is critical to identify mental health issues more effectively and develop interventions among this population to address this significant and growing public health issue.

We proposed and evaluated a soft labeling methodology to quantify opacification and percent well-aerated lung (%WAL) on chest CT, that considers uncertainty in segmenting pulmonary opacifications and reduces labeling burden. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively sourced 760 COVID-19 chest CT scans from five international centers between January and June 2020. We created pixel-wise labels for >27,000 axial slices that classify three pulmonary opacification patterns: pure ground-glass, crazy-paving, consolidation. We also quantified %WAL as the total area of lung without opacifications. Inter-user hard label variability was quantified using Shannon entropy (range=0-1.39, low-high entropy/variability). We incorporated a soft labeling and modeling cycle following an initial model with hard labels and compared performance using point-wise accuracy and intersection-over-union of opacity labels with ground-truth, and correlation with ground-truth %WAL. RESULTS: Hard labels annotated by 12 radiologists demonstrated large inter-user variability (3.37% of pixels achieved complete agreement). Our soft labeling approach increased point-wise accuracy from 60.0% to 84.3% (p=0.01) compared to hard labeling at predicting opacification type and area involvement. The soft label model accurately predicted %WAL (R=0.900) compared to the hard label model (R=0.856), but the improvement was not statistically significant (p=0.349). CONCLUSION: Our soft labeling approach increased accuracy for automated quantification and classification of pulmonary opacification on chest CT.

Peer support through debriefing has demonstrated positive impacts on clinicians' well-being following critical incidents. This study explored community hospital emergency department staff's perceptions of critical incidents, assessed openness to debriefing and measured baseline well-being. Our analysis provides a baseline of provider well-being immediately prior to the local onset of COVID-19. The potential need for additional resources to support frontline providers during the pandemic can be evaluated. METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional study for 4-weeks prior to the first COVID-19 case in Connecticut using a survey offered to an interprofessional group of emergency department clinical staff. The main outcome measures were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) scale. Pearson's chi-square test was used to identify significant differences in perceptions of critical incidents and debriefings between professional categories. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's test were used to analyze significant differences in well-being between professional categories. RESULTS: Thirty-nine clinical personnel from St. Vincent's Emergency Department responded to the survey. Events frequently selected as critical incidents were caring for critically ill children (89.7%), mass casualty events (84.6%), and death of a patient (69.2%). Critical incidents were commonly reported (81.6%) as occurring once per week. Additionally, 76.2% of participants reported wanting to discuss a critical incident with their team. Across all respondents, 45.7% scored borderline or abnormal for anxiety, 55.9% scored moderate for burnout, and 55.8% scored moderate to high for secondary traumatic stress.

Receptiveness to post-event debriefing is high but the method is still underutilized. With nearly half of staff scoring borderline or abnormal for anxiety, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress at baseline, peer support measures should be implemented to protect frontline providers' well-being during and after the pandemic.","output":"Baseline well-being, perceptions of critical incidents, and openness to debriefing in community hospital emergency department clinical staff before COVID-19, a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Black and Hispanic populations have higher rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization and mortality than White populations but lower in-hospital case-fatality rates. The extent to which neighborhood characteristics and comorbidity explain these disparities is unclear. Outcomes in Asian American populations have not been explored. Objective: To compare COVID-19 outcomes based on race and ethnicity and assess the association of any disparities with comorbidity and neighborhood characteristics. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study was conducted within the New York University Langone Health system, which includes over 260 outpatient practices and 4 acute care hospitals. All patients within the system's integrated health record who were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between March 1, 2020, and April 8, 2020, were identified and followed up through May 13, 2020. Data were analyzed in June 2020. Among 11a?547 patients tested, outcomes were compared by race and ethnicity and examined against differences by age, sex, body mass index, comorbidity, insurance type, and neighborhood socioeconomic status. Exposures: Race and ethnicity categorized using self-reported electronic health record data (ie, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Asian, and multiracial/other patients). Main Outcomes and Measures: The likelihood of receiving a positive test, hospitalization, and critical illness (defined as a composite of care in the intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice, or death). Results: Among 9722 patients (mean [SD] age, 50.7 [17.5] years; 58.8% women), 4843 (49.8%) were positive for COVID-19; 2623 (54.2%) of those were admitted for hospitalization (1047 [39.9%] White, 375 [14.3%] Black, 715 [27.3%] Hispanic, 180 [6.9%] Asian, 207 [7.9%] multiracial/other). In fully adjusted models, Black patients (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.6) and Hispanic patients (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.7) were more likely than White patients to test positive. Among those who tested positive, odds of hospitalization were similar among White, Hispanic, and Black patients, but higher among Asian (OR, 1.6, 95% CI, 1.1-2.3) and multiracial patients (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9) compared with White patients. Among those hospitalized, Black patients were less likely than White patients to have severe illness (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.8) and to die or be discharged to hospice (hazard ratio, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of patients in a large health system in New York City, Black and Hispanic patients were more likely, and Asian patients less likely, than White patients to test positive; once hospitalized, Black patients were less likely than White patients to have critical illness or die after adjustment for comorbidity and neighborhood characteristics. This supports the assertion that existing structural determinants pervasive in Black and Hispanic communities may explain the disproportionately higher out-of-hospital deaths due to COVID-19 infections in these populations.","output":"Assessment of Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Hospitalization and Mortality in Patients With COVID-19 in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. The global outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 has been an international public health threat. Quick diagnostic tests and specific treatments for SARS are not yet available; thus, prevention is of paramount importance to contain its global spread. This study aimed to determine factors associating with individuals' practice of the target SARS preventive behavior (facemask wearing). Methods. A total of 1329 adult Chinese residing in Hong Kong were surveyed. The survey instrument included demographic data, measures on the five components of the Health Belief Model, and the practice of the target SARS preventive behavior. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine rates and predictors of facemask wearing. Results. Overall, 61.2% of the respondents reported consistent use of facemasks to prevent SARS. Women, the 50C59 age group, and married respondents were more likely to wear facemasks. Three of the five components of the Health Belief Model, namely, perceived susceptibility, cues to action, and perceived benefits, were significant predictors of facemask-wearing even after considering effects of demographic characteristics. Conclusions. The Health Belief Model is useful in identifying determinants of facemask wearing.

This research aims to identify Arabic fake news tweets and classify them into six categories: entertainment, health, politics, religious, social, and sports. The study also aims to uncover patterns in the spread of Arabic fake news associated with the Covid-19 pandemic. The researchers created an Arabic dictionary and used text classification based on a rule-based system to detect and categorize fake news. A dataset consisting of 5 million tweets was analyzed. The developed model achieves an overall accuracy of 78.1% with 70% precision and 98%recall. The model detected more than 26006 fake news tweets. Interestingly we found an association between the number of fake news tweets and dates. The result demonstrates that as more information and knowledge about Covid-19 become available over time, people's awareness increase, while the number of fake news tweets decreases. The categorization of false news indicates that the social category was highest in all Arab countries except Palestine, Qatar, Yemen, and Algeria.

It remains unclear how the domestic waves arose and abated. To better understand this, we analyzed the pangenomic sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and characterized the molecular epidemiological features of the five epidemic waves in Japan. In this study, we performed deep sequencing to determine the pangenomic SARS-CoV-2 sequences of 1,286 samples collected in two cities far from each other, Tokyo Metropolis and Nagoya. Then, the spatiotemporal genetic changes of the obtained sequences were compared with the sequences available in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database. A total of 873 genotypes carrying different sets of mutations were identified in the five epidemic waves. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that sharp displacements of lineages and genotypes occurred between consecutive waves over the 2 years. In addition, a wide variety of genotypes were observed in the early half of each wave, whereas a few genotypes were detected across Japan during an entire wave. Phylogenetically, putative descendant genotypes observed late in each wave displayed regional clustering and evolution in Japan. The genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 displayed uneven dynamics during each epidemic wave in Japan.

This qualitative study includes 20 patients suffering from disorders of fluency, voice, swallowing and neurogenic disorders. The participants included were undergoing face-to-face therapy at our institute. After the completion of face-to-face session series, telerehabilitation services were provided through a video calling app. The outcomes of teletherapy were assessed subjectively using a structured questionnaire on 11 parameters using a Likert scale. Of the included 20 patients, after completion of teletherapy, four patients chose the physical interaction as the preferred mode of therapy while 16 chose teletherapy as the preferred mode. Except three clients who rated their overall satisfaction as 3, others rated as 4 or 5.The therapists were satisfied with the outcomes in 17 cases, and were pleased with the overall progress of all the clients (rated 4 or 5).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 3114 cases of COVID-19 without pre-existing diabetes, 351 of which had NDD, in Hubei Province, China. The Cox regression model was used to calculate the risk of adverse clinical outcomes comparing the NDD vs non-NDD group before and after propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis. Patients with NDD were further divided into a sustained hyperglycemia group, a fluctuating group, and a remitted group based on their blood glucose levels during hospitalization as well as into hypoglycemic agent users and nonusers. RESULTS: Compared to the non-NDD individuals, individuals with NDD had a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR after PSM, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.49C4.72; P = 0.001) and secondary outcomes involving organ damage during the 28-day follow-up period. Subgroup analyses indicated that among individuals with NDD, the individuals with remitted hyperglycemia had the lowest 28-day mortality, whereas those with sustained hyperglycemia had the highest (IRR 24.27; 95% CI, 3.21C183.36; P < 0.001). Moreover, individuals treated with hypoglycemic agents had significantly lower all-cause mortality than those not treated with hypoglycemic agents (IRR 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01C0.56; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study reinforces the clinical message that NDD is strongly associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

We investigated the impact of school opening with various mitigation measures (masks, rotations, mass testing) on growth rate of new cases in child cohorts ranging from kindergartens to upper secondary in Czechia, a country heavily hit by Covid-19, since April 2020 to June 2021. Methods: Our primary method is comparison of the reported infections in age cohorts corresponding to school grades undergoing different regimes. When there is no opportunity for such a comparison, we estimate corresponding coefficients from a regression model. In both the cases, we assume that district-level infections in particular cohorts depend on the school attendance and the external environment in dependence on the current overall risk contact reduction. Results: The estimates of in-cohort growth rates were significantly higher for normally opened schools compared to closed schools. When prevalence is comparable in the cohorts and general population, and no further measures are applied, the in-cohort growth reduction for closed kindergartens is 29% (SE=11%); primary: 19% (7%); lower secondary: 39% (6%); upper secondary: 47% (6%). For secondary education, mitigation measures reduce school-related growth 2-6 times. Conclusion: Considering more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants and the 'long covid' risk, mitigation measures in schools, especially in secondary levels, should be implemented for the next school year.

World Health Organization estimates that over 10,000 HCWs in Africa have been infected with COVID-19 making it a significant occupational health hazard to HCWs. In Ghana, over 100 HCWs have already been infected and dozen others died from the virus. Acceptability and uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine is therefore critical to promote health and safety of HCWs as the country battles out of a third wave of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The study sought to ascertain the correlates of HCWs likelihood of participating in a COVID-19 vaccine trial and accepting the vaccine when given the opportunity. METHODS: The study was a web-based cross-sectional survey among HCWs (n = 1605) in all sixteen (16) administrative regions in Ghana. Data were analyzed with STATA statistical analysis software (version 14). Chi-square (X(2)) and Fishers exact tests were used to test for differences in categorical variables; bivariate probit regression analysis with Average Marginal Effect (AME) was employed to ascertain the determinants of HCWs likelihood of participating in a COVID-19 vaccine trial and taking the vaccine. RESULTS: It was found that 48% of HCWs will participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial when given the opportunity; 70% will accept the COVID-19 vaccine; younger HCWs (AME = 0.28, SE = 0.16, p < 0.1), non-Christians (AME = 21, SE = 0.09, p < 0.05) and those who worked in faith-based health facilities (AME = 18, SE = 0.07, p < 0.05) were more likely to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial. Female HCWs (AME = ? 11, SE = 0.04, p < 0.05) and those with lower educational qualification were less likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine (AME = ? 0.16, SE = 0.08, p < 0.1). Reasons cited for unwillingness to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial or uptake the vaccine were mainly fear, safety concerns, mistrust, uncertainty, spiritual and religious beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine appear to be high among HCWs; conversely, willingness to volunteer for the vaccine trial was low.

Particularly, telemedicine has become the primary modality of patient visits for nonemergent conditions. This study aimed to characterize user experiences of neurosurgeons and advanced practice providers focusing on perceived utility and barriers of telemedicine in management of elective neurosurgical patients during COVID-19. METHODS An online survey was sent to clinicians involved in neurosurgical care using telemedicine with questions focusing on frequency of utilization, duration of patient encounters, benefits of telemedicine, and barriers to current forms of remote patient visits. Survey responses were stratified by clinical position (neurosurgeon vs. advanced practice provider) and subspecialty focus (cranial vs. spinal neurosurgery). RESULTS The survey was completed by 14 of 17 eligible clinicians. Respondents included 10 neurosurgeons and 4 APPs with 57% specializing in cranial neurosurgery and 43% specializing in spinal neurosurgery. During the COVID-19 period, 78% of respondents used teleconference/video conference visits multiple times in a week, and 86% planned to continue using telemedicine after the pandemic. The most common barrier for telemedicine was the inability to perform a neurological examination, while the most common perceived benefit was increased convenience for patients. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 period, telemedicine was heavily relied on to ensure the continuation of perioperative care for patients with elective neurosurgical pathologies.

Commercial spore carriers (CSC) coated with 10(6) spores of Geobacillus stearothermophilus are often used to assess the efficacy of disinfection. We used quantitative carrier testing (QCT) procedures to compare the sensitivity of CSC with that of surrogates for nonenveloped and enveloped viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), mycobacteria, and spores, to an aerosolized mixture of peroxyacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide (aPAA-HP). We then used the QCT methodology to determine relevant process parameters to develop and validate effective disinfection protocols (4-log(10) reduction) in various large and complex facilities. Our results demonstrate that aPAA-HP is a highly efficient procedure for airborne room disinfection. Relevant process parameters such as temperature and relative humidity can be wirelessly monitored. Furthermore, we found striking differences in inactivation efficacies against some of the tested microorganisms. Overall, we conclude that dry fogging a mixture of aPAA-HP is highly effective against a broad range of microorganisms as well as material compatible with relevant concentrations. Furthermore, CSC are artificial bioindicators with lower resistance and thus should not be used for validating airborne disinfection when microorganisms other than viruses have to be inactivated. IMPORTANCE Airborne disinfection is not only of crucial importance for the safe operation of laboratories and animal rooms where infectious agents are handled but also can be used in public health emergencies such as the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. We show that dry fogging an aerosolized mixture of peroxyacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide (aPAA-HP) is highly microbicidal, efficient, fast, robust, environmentally neutral, and a suitable airborne disinfection method. In addition, the low concentration of dispersed disinfectant, particularly for enveloped viral pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, entails high material compatibility. For these reasons and due to the relative simplicity of the procedure, it is an ideal disinfection method for hospital wards, ambulances, public conveyances, and indoor community areas. Thus, we conclude that this method is an excellent choice for control of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","output":"Airborne Disinfection by Dry Fogging Efficiently Inactivates Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Mycobacteria, and Bacterial Spores and Shows Limitations of Commercial Spore Carriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Just as there was a transition to remote teaching because of the COVID pandemic, many universities are in the process of transitioning back to in person classrooms.

Even with the transition to fully online teaching in the Spring of 2020, the robust breakout room feature of the video teleconferencing software, Zoom, permitted small group work that occurs with the flipped to continue. As the fall 2021 semester approached, the University approved a return to in person classes, however several students emailed the course instructor (L.C. Anderson) expressing concern and asking if an online option would be available. Students completed a pre-class survey in which they committed to attend class in person or remotely via zoom. The instructor continued the flipped classroom with some students in small groups in person and some students in zoom breakout rooms. The students scored lower than expected on the first exam. Traditionally, the average of the first exam is approximately 80%, however the Fall 2021 Exam 1 average was 70%. Of 40 students, 13 scored less than 70%; this statistic was concerning given that students must earn a 70% to pass the course. To address the difficulty of the exam and to make sure students had learned the material, the course instructor flagged 13 questions (of 40 test questions total) with questionable testing statistics. Student submitted reflective essays on three of the exam questions but could write about all 13 questions for extra credit. From the student writings, the instructor ascertained that 3 of the test questions were flawed and all students were given credit for those 3 questions. Post exam reflections and adjustments raised the course average to 85%. Sensing continued anxiety within class, the instructor surveyed the students. The survey results suggested that remote students were less satisfied with class and perceived that they, as a group, had done poorly on the exam. Remote students reported feeling unfairly disadvantaged by the flipped classroom model online and reported a lack of trust in their online group members. This led the instructor to ask the questions: 1) Did the remote students score worse than the in-person students? 2) If there is a performance difference, are there other factors that could explain the difference? In-person students answered an average of 29.9 + 4.8 questions (about 75%) correctly whereas remote students answered an average of 25.7 + 5.8 (about 64%) correctly which was significantly different (Student's T test, p=0.015).

This paper describes the conversion experience of the Unit, and outlines broader lessons for other acute care teams faced with similar issues. METHODS: We deployed walkthroughs, simulations, and ethnography to identify important safety gaps in care delivery processes on the Unit. These interventions were undertaken using interdisciplinary theories of implementation that combined systems-level HF perspectives, ethnographic approaches, and individual-level IPC perspectives. Timely recommendations were developed and delivered to Unit staff for feedback and implementation.

AIMS: We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 SCZ patients with those of non-SCZ patients. METHOD: This was a case-control study of COVID-19 patients admitted to 4 AP-HM/AMU acute care hospitals in Marseille, southern France. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by a positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample and/or on chest computed scan among patients requiring hospital admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: A total of 1092 patients were included. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 9.0%. The SCZ patients had an increased mortality compared to the non-SCZ patients (26.7% vs. 8.7%, P=0.039), which was confirmed by the multivariable analysis after adjustment for age, sex, smoking status, obesity and comorbidity (adjusted odds ratio 4.36 [95% CI: 1.09-17.44]; P=0.038). In contrast, the SCZ patients were not more frequently admitted to the ICU than the non-SCZ patients. Importantly, the SCZ patients were mostly institutionalized (63.6%, 100% of those who died), and they were more likely to have cancers and respiratory comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that SCZ is not overrepresented among COVID-19 hospitalized patients, but SCZ is associated with excess COVID-19 mortality, confirming the existence of health disparities described in other somatic diseases.","output":"Increased in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 in patients with schizophrenia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genomes have an inherent context dictated by the order in which the nucleotides and higher order genomic elements are arranged in the DNA/RNA. Learning this context is a daunting task, governed by the combinatorial complexity of interactions possible between ordered elements of genomes. Can natural language processing be employed on these orderly, complex and also evolving datatypes (genomic sequences) to reveal the latent patterns or context of genomic elements (e.g Mutations)? Here we present an approach to understand the mutational landscape of Covid-19 by treating the temporally changing (continuously mutating) SARS-CoV-2 genomes as documents. We demonstrate how the analogous interpretation of evolving genomes to temporal literature corpora provides an opportunity to use dynamic topic modeling (DTM) and temporal Word2Vec models to delineate mutation signatures corresponding to different Variants-of-Concerns and tracking the semantic drift of Mutations-of-Concern (MoC). We identified and studied characteristic mutations affiliated to Covid-infection severity and tracked their relationship with MoCs.

Trials of vaccine candidates using mRNA delivery systems developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have shown substantial VEs of 94-95%, leading the US Food and Drug Administration to issue Emergency Use Authorizations and subsequent widespread administration of the vaccines. As the trials continue, a key issue is the possibility that VE may wane over time. Ethical considerations dictate that all trial participants be unblinded and those randomized to placebo be offered vaccine, leading to trial protocol amendments specifying unblinding strategies. Crossover of placebo subjects to vaccine complicates inference on waning of VE. We focus on the particular features of the Moderna trial and propose a statistical framework based on a potential outcomes formulation within which we develop methods for inference on whether or not VE wanes over time and estimation of VE at any post-vaccination time. The framework clarifies assumptions made regarding individual- and population-level phenomena and acknowledges the possibility that subjects who are more or less likely to become infected may be crossed over to vaccine differentially over time.

However, the lack of knowledge on EDs and their perceived beneficial effects could lead to excessive EDs consumption, which is strongly associated with serious side effects. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and perceived beneficial effects of EDs consumers and determine the consumption patterns and side effects experienced by different EDs consumers among the Malaysian population. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in Malaysia from February to April 2021. A structured and validated questionnaire, consisting of 5 sections with 46 items, was distributed online. Only 515 out of 591 invited participants agreed to participate in the study. Descriptive and inferential analysis were done using SPSS. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 23  7.3 years. The majority of participants (65%) were unaware of the active ingredients of EDs, and approximately 40% of them had no idea that EDs contain caffeine. The main reason for consuming EDs was to stay awake (43%), and Red Bull was the most preferred brand (57%). Lack of rest (57%), headache (53%), and nervousness (49%) were the most experienced side effects. A significant difference was observed between consumption patterns and knowledge and perceived beneficial effects (p < 0.05). Our data showed a significant association between respondents' demographic data (e.g., coffee intake, smoking, and alcohol status) and their consumption pattern. CONCLUSION: ED consumers in Malaysia were found to have limited knowledge on EDs. Therefore, attention should be drawn to the Ministry of Health regarding the significant side effects such as palpitation and nervousness experienced by ED consumers. Hence, awareness ought to be raised by adopting regulations or policies to regulate the sales and warning labels of EDs in Malaysia.","output":"Knowledge, Consumption Pattern, and Adverse Effects of Energy Drinks among Asian Population: A Cross-Sectional Analysis from Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objective To determine the incidence of and risk-factors for development of acute kidney injury (AKI) and investigate the association between AKI and mortality in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. Patients and Methods This retrospective case series includes the first 370 patients consecutively hospitalized with confirmed Covid-19 illness between March 10, 2020 and May 13, 2020, at a 242-bed teaching hospital. To determine independent association between demographic factors, comorbidities and AKI incidence, multivariable-logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios adjusted for clinical covariates. Results Median age of patients was 71 (59C82) years and 44.3% were female. Patients with AKI were significantly older with a higher comorbidity-burden and mortality-rate (58.1% vs 19.6%, p<.001) when compared to those without AKI. Increasing age, chronic kidney disease, hyperlipidemia and being of African-American descent showed higher odds of AKI. Patients with AKI had significantly higher odds of mortality when compared to patients without AKI, and this effect was proportional to the stage of AKI. Increasing age and acute respiratory distress syndrome also revealed higher adjusted odds of mortality. Conclusion AKI is a common complication among hospitalized Covid-19 patients. We found significantly higher odds of AKI with increasing age, among hyperlipidemics and patients with chronic kidney disease and among African-Americans.

The aviation industry appears to lack a standardized, practical, and easily replicable protocol for fatigue risk assessment which can be consistently applied across operators. AIM: Our paper sought to present a framework, supported by real-world data with subjective and objective parameters, to monitor aircrew fatigue and performance, and to determine the safe crew configuration for commercial airline operations. METHODS: Our protocol identified risk factors for fatigue-induced performance degradation as triggers for fatigue risk and performance assessment. Using both subjective and objective measurements of sleep, fatigue, and performance in the form of instruments such as the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, Samn-Perelli Crew Status Check, Psychomotor Vigilance Task, sleep logs, and a wearable actigraph for sleep log correlation and sleep duration and quality charting, a workflow flagging fatigue-prone flight operations for risk mitigation was developed and trialed. RESULTS: In an operational study aimed at occupational assessment of fatigue and performance in airline pilots on a three-men crew versus a four-men crew for a long-haul flight, we affirmed the technical feasibility of our proposed framework and approach, the validity of the battery of assessment instruments, and the meaningful interpretation of fatigue and work performance indicators to enable the formulation of safe work recommendations.

This instrument is often considered as the only viable option for curbing infection spread both in developed and developing countries;however, some experts have a cynical view on its effectiveness. Exploiting cross-country lockdown information, effectiveness of lockdown on slowing the pace of COVID-19 can be elicited. Methods: : The study intends to understand whether lockdown or similar measures can suppress infection growth in developing countries. In this pursuit, the study uses panel regression-based difference in difference and GMM estimation method. Results: : This study finds that lockdown type measures are not as effective in developing countries as in developed nations. Nevertheless, staying at home order, income support programs, and other social distancing measures are found to be effective for both developed and developing countries. Also, the timing of the lockdown is found to be vital. One the one hand, enforcing a nationwide lockdown too early, i.e., when cases are very low, may not yield expected outcome;on the other hand, enforcing lockdown too late is also ineffective. Conclusion: Even though this study does not find strong evidence of the effectiveness of lockdown in curbing infection growth in developing countries, these findings do not necessarily suggest that lockdown should not be enforced in developing countries. Rather it indicates that lockdown should be combined with other complementary measures such as contact tracing, extensive testing, income support for the poor, effective management of informal and migrant workers to make the lockdown effective. Merely declaring lockdown, without accompanying other must-have measures, will hurt the economy without contributing much to reducing the growth of infection.JEL Codes: H2, H3, I1, I3","output":"Can Lockdown Reduce Infection Growth in Developing Countries?

Three-port procedures for LESS have been reported to be superior to single-port access, but they usually require expensive, technically sophisticated instruments. To avoid these problems, we have developed a modified procedure for performing LESS with a single port, referred to as the \\"Obama system.\\" METHODS From January 2009 through December 2010, we performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) in 61 patients. Conventional LC with three ports was performed in 39 patients, LESS with a SILS Port was performed in 4 patients, and modified LESS was performed using the Obama system in 18 patients. The operative results were compared. RESULTS LC was successfully completed in all 61 patients, with no postoperative complications. The mean operating time was 102.3 min (C-reactive protein [CRP]  2) and 160.1 min (CRP > 2) in the 39 patients who underwent conventional LC, 108.3 min (CRP  2) in the 4 patients who underwent LESS with a SILS Port, and 116.5 min (CRP  2) and 186.5 min (CRP > 2) in the 18 patients who underwent LESS using the Obama system.

Unlike genome and antigenome assembly, S mRNA assembly is a relatively slow process, which is not coupled to its synthesis. Within the encapsidated S mRNA population, three forms could be distinguished, those with intact primers which were or were not also assembled with N protein and those in which the primer and up to 3 template bases had been lost. We suggest that genome replication, but not transcription, is down regulated with time in mosquito cells for reasons that are unclear. The pool of unassembled N protein then increased to the point at which it began to interact with its own mRNA, as this mRNA also contains what is considered to be the assembly site, i.e., the conserved sequences at the 5' ends of all genome and antigenome chains. This lead to the assembly of the entire mRNA, except for the nontemplate primer.

As the pandemic has progressed, many have justifiably speculated that such restrictions may pose a danger to the safety and well-being of people experiencing such violence. Early in the pandemic, countries hard hit by COVID-19 began raising the alarm bell about the impacts of the disease on IPV occurrence. Police in China report that 90% of the causes of recent IPV cases could be attributed to the COVID-19 epidemic. Rising fears and anxiety about prolonged movement restrictions, increased economic strain and diminished health care capacity to support survivors are among the potential reasons for such dramatic effects. Under normal circumstances: low income, unemployment, economic stress, depression, emotional insecurity and social isolation are all risk factors for using violence against partners. Many of these factors may worsen in the context of COVID-19. Despite the urgency in addressing COVID-19, existing health concerns like Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) persistand may well be worsened by the virus.

Management of Parkinson's disease with subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) modifies initiation and inhibition, with prior work suggesting that these effects may be mediated via the connectivity of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) with the frontal cortex. Here, we employed high-resolution structural neuroimaging to investigate the variability in initiation, inhibition and strategy use in a cohort of twenty-five (ten females, mean age 62.5, mean Hoehn and Yahr stage 2.5) participants undertaking subthalamic DBS for Parkinson's disease. Neuropsychological assessment of initiation and inhibition was performed preoperatively and at six months postoperatively. We first reconstructed the preoperative connectivity of the STN with a frontal network of anterior and superior medial cortical regions. We then modelled the postoperative site of subthalamic stimulation and reconstructed the connectivity of the stimulation field within this same network. We found that, at both pre- and postoperative intervals, inter-individual variability in inhibition and initiation were strongly associated with structural network connectivity. Measures of subcortical atrophy and local stimulation effects did not play a significant role. Preoperatively, we replicated prior work, including a role for the right inferior frontal gyrus in inhibition and strategy use, as well as the left inferior frontal gyrus in tasks requiring selection under conditions of maintained inhibition. Postoperatively, greater connectivity of the stimulation field with right anterior cortical regions was associated with greater rule violations and suppression errors, supporting prior work implicating right-hemispheric STN stimulation in disinhibition.

PARTICIPANTS: 320 homebound older adults (mean(SD) age 72.9(9.6), 79% female, 44% people of color, 81% low-income, 61% living alone, average four chronic conditions) with clinically significant depression (PHQ-9 mean(SD) 12.7(4.6)). INTERVENTION: 4-6 month home-based depression care management model delivered by trained front-line providers. MEASUREMENTS: Brief validated social connectedness scales: Duke Social Support Index 10-item (DSSI-10), PROMIS-Social Isolation (6-item), UCLA-Loneliness (3-item); sociodemographic and health measures. RESULTS: At baseline, PEARLS participants overall and with >/=1 of the following characteristics were less socially connected: younger (50-64), white, LGBTQ+, not partnered, not caregiving, living alone, financial limitations, chronic conditions, and/or recently hospitalized. Six-months post-PEARLS enrollment, participants significantly increased social interactions and satisfaction with social support (DSSI-10 t[312]=5.2, p<0.001); and reduced perceived isolation (PROMIS t[310]=6.3, p<0.001); and loneliness (UCLA t[301]=3.7, p=0.002), with small to moderate effect sizes (Cohen's d DSSI-10: 0.28, PROMIS-SI: 0.35, UCLA: 0.21).

However, viruses evolved sophisticated strategies to antagonize autophagy and even exploit it to promote their replication. In our recent study, we systematically analyzed the impact of individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins on autophagy. We showed that E, M, ORF3a, and ORF7a cause an accumulation of autophagosomes, whereas Nsp15 prevents the efficient formation of autophagosomes. Consequently, autophagic degradation of SQSTM1/p62 is decreased in the presence of E, ORF3a, ORF7a, and Nsp15. Notably, M does not alter SQSTM1 protein levels and colocalizes with accumulations of LC3B-positive membranes not resembling vesicles. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 prevents SQSTM1 degradation and increases lipidation of LC3B, indicating overall that the infection causes a reduction of autophagic flux. Our mechanistic analyses showed that the accessory proteins ORF3a and ORF7a both block autophagic degradation but use different strategies. While ORF3a prevents the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes, ORF7a reduces the acidity of lysosomes.

Interventions to reduce their use are being developed and there is a need to understand their implementation into clinical care. Aim of review This systematic review aims to identify and analyse qualitative research studies exploring the barriers and facilitators to reducing anticholinergic burden. Methods Medline (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EMBSCO) and PsycINFO (OVID) were searched using comprehensive search terms. Peer reviewed studies published in English presenting qualitative research in relation to the barriers and facilitators of deprescribing anticholinergic medications, involving patients, carers or health professionals were eligible. Normalization Process Theory was used to explore and explain the data. Results Of 1764 identified studies, two were eligible and both involved healthcare professionals (23 general practitioners, 13 specialist clinicians and 12 pharmacists). No studies were identified that involved patients or carers. Barriers to collaborative working often resulted in poor motivation to reduce anticholinergic use. Low confidence, system resources and organisation of care also hindered anticholinergic burden reduction. Good communication and relationships with patients, carers and other healthcare professionals were reported as important for successful anticholinergic burden reduction. Having a named person for prescribing decisions, and clear role boundaries, were also important facilitators. Conclusions This review identified important barriers and facilitators to anticholinergic burden reduction from healthcare provider perspectives which can inform implementation of such deprescribing interventions. Studies exploring patient and carer perspectives are presently absent but are required to ensure person-centeredness and feasibility of future interventions.","output":"Barriers and facilitators to reducing anticholinergic burden: a qualitative systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a highly contagious disease.

Human patients with type 1 diabetes show an unusually high frequency of wheat gluten-sensitive enteropathy; T-cell response to wheat proteins is increased in some patients, and high concentrations of wheat antibodies in blood have been reported. In both major models of spontaneous type 1 diabetes, the BioBreeding (BB) rat and non-obese diabetic mouse, at least half of the cases are diet-related. In studies of BB rats fed defined semipurified diets, wheat gluten was the most potent diabetes-inducing protein source. A major limitation in understanding how wheat or other dietary antigens affect type 1 diabetes has been the difficulty in identifying specific diabetes-related dietary proteins. To address this issue, we probed a wheat cDNA expression library with polyclonal IgG antibodies from diabetic BB rats. Three clones were identified, and the intensity of antibody binding to one of them, WP5212, was strongly associated with pancreatic islet inflammation and damage. The WP5212 putative protein has high amino acid sequence homology with a wheat storage globulin, Glb1. Serum IgG antibodies from diabetic rats and humans recognized low molecular mass (33-46 kDa) wheat proteins. Furthermore, antibodies to Glb1 protein were found in serum from diabetic patients but not in age-, sex-, and HLA-DQ-matched controls. This study raises the possibility that in some individuals, type 1 diabetes may be induced by wheat proteins. Also, it provides a first candidate wheat protein that is not only antigenic in diabetic rats and human patients but is also closely linked with the autoimmune attack in the pancreas.","output":"A type 1 diabetes-related protein from wheat (Triticum aestivum). cDNA clone of a wheat storage globulin, Glb1, linked to islet damage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) are living longer due in part to changing treatment patterns. It is important to understand how changing treatment patterns affect patients' lives beyond extending survival. Research suggests that direct patient report is the best way to capture information on how patients feel and function in response to their disease and its treatment. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize evidence of patients' experience collected through patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in RRMM patients, and to explore PRO reporting quality. METHODS We conducted a systematic search to identify manuscripts reporting PROs in RRMM and summarized available evidence. We assessed PRO reporting quality using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) PRO Extension checklist. RESULTS Our search resulted in 30 manuscripts. Thirteen unique PRO measures were used to assess 18 distinct PRO domains. Pain, fatigue, and emotional function were commonly assessed domains though reporting formats limited our ability to understand prevalence and severity of PRO challenges in RRMM. Evaluation of PRO reporting quality revealed significant reporting deficiencies. Several reporting criteria were included in less than 25% of manuscripts. CONCLUSIONS Existing evidence provides a limited window for understanding the patient experience of RRMM and is further limited by suboptimal reporting quality. Observational studies are needed to describe prevalence, severity and patterns of PROs in RRMM overtime. Future studies that incorporate PROs would benefit from following existing guidelines to ensure that study evidence and conclusions can be fully assessed by readers, clinicians and policy makers.","output":"How are patient-reported outcomes and symptoms being measured in adults with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma?

The working mechanism of this flexible electromagnetic manipulator has been studied based on the Maxwell and Abaqus simulation.

Furthermore, flexible electromagnetic manipulators can be upgraded to capture various objects by attaching a mechanical force triggered gripper to their top pads. With this design, the velocity of gripper can be significantly improved(the maximum velocity of this is 8.1m/s. However, the soft gripper in the previous research does not have the characteristics of fast movement ), thus making it possible to get objects without approaching them, in another word, we can catch objects even though they are far away from us ,which provide a possibility of long-distance capture.We believe this kind of bio-inspired fabrication is a powerful strategy to design and synthesize flexible even stretchable manipulators, extending the boundaries of conventional manipulators for soft robots.","output":"Flexible electromagnetic capturer with a rapid ejection feature inspired by a biologically ballistic tongue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the first case of proteinase 3 (PR3)- antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) with predominant ears, nose, and throat (ENT) manifestations following COVID-19 vaccination.

Even with a limited protective effect, face masks can reduce total infections and deaths, and can delay the peak time of the epidemic. However, random distribution of masks is generally suboptimal; prioritized coverage of the elderly improves outcomes, while retaining resources for detected cases provides further mitigation under a range of scenarios.

We overturned the concept by demonstrating that H2 exhibits antioxidant effects and protects cells against oxidative stress. Subsequently, it has been revealed that H2 has multiple functions in addition to antioxidant effects, including ant-inflammatory, anti-allergic functions, and as a cell death and autophagy regulation. Additionally, H2 stimulates energy metabolism. Because H2 does not readily react with most biomolecules without a catalyst, it is essential to identify the primary targets with which H2 reacts or interacts directly. As a first event, H2 may react directly with strong oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals (a?OH) in vivo. This review addresses the key issues related to this in vivo reaction. a?OH may have a physiological role because it triggers a free radical chain reaction and may be involved in the regulation of Ca2+ - or mitochondrial ATP-dependent K+ - channeling. In the subsequent pathway, H2 suppressed a free radical chain reaction, leading to decreases in lipid peroxide and its end products. Derived from the peroxides, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal functions as a mediator that up-regulates multiple functional PGC-1&#945;. As the other direct target in vitro and in vivo, H2 intervenes in the free radical chain reaction to modify oxidized phospholipids, which may act as an antagonist of Ca2+ -channels. The resulting suppression of Ca2+ - signaling inactivates multiple functional NFAT and CREB transcription factors, which may explain H2 multifunctionality. This review also addresses the involvement of NFAT in the beneficial role of H2 in COVID-19, Alzheimer's disease and advanced cancer. We discuss some unsolved issues of H2 action on lipopolysaccharide signaling, MAPK and NF-&#954;B pathways and the Nrf2 paradox. Finally, as a novel idea for the direct targeting of H2 , this review introduces the possibility that H2 causes structural changes in proteins via hydrate water changes.","output":"Direct targets and subsequent pathways for molecular hydrogen to exert multiple functions: Focusing on interventions in radical reactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Across and within countries there is a need to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted populations of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). OBJECTIVE: Rates of COVID-19 positivity for adults with IDD, including Down syndrome, relative to adults without IDD in Ontario, Canada were compared. Health profiles and case-based rates of hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and mortality within 30 days of testing positively were compared for those with IDD, including Down syndrome, versus those without IDD. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study linked health administrative databases using unique encoded identifiers to describe population-level COVID-19 positivity, related hospital use and mortality from January 15, 2020 to January 10, 2021. Incidence rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: Relative to adults without IDD, COVID-19 positivity rates were 1.28 times higher for adults with IDD and 1.42 times higher for adults with Down syndrome. Compared to adults without IDD, adults with IDD were more than twice as likely to be hospitalized following COVID-19 (RR:2.21 (95%CI: 1.93,2.54)) and to die (RR:2.23 (95%CI: 1.86,2.67). These RRs were greater for adults under 65. For adults with Down syndrome, mortality rates were 6.59 (95%CI: 4.51,9.62) times higher than those without IDD. DISCUSSION: In Ontario, Canada, hospitalization and mortality rates associated with COVID-19 are higher for adults with IDD than other adults.

The objective of this field trial was to compare the effectiveness of a newly available commercial BRSV-bPI3 V intranasal vaccine with that of a benchmarked one in newborn beef calves reared in a cow-calf system.

Non-inferiority analysis was performed by calculating the difference in BRD prevalence between the two vaccine groups. No significant differences were observed between vaccines regarding clinical outcomes of morbidity, mortality, duration between vaccination and BRD occurrence, or treatments required. Because the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the difference in BRD prevalence between the two treatment groups (0.8%) was less than the margin of non-inferiority ( =5%), a non-inferiority of Vaccine A was concluded.

Results show how positive sentiment in social media has a strong correlation with the actual vaccinated population. Furthermore, we introduce a simple ratio between Anti and Pro-vaccine as a proxy to quantify vaccine hesitancy and show how our results align with other traditional survey approaches.

RESULTS: 7195 hospitalizations for NTDs were retrieved, accounting for 7375 diagnoses, 60% in Italians and 40% in foreigners. Male-to-female ratio was 2; the age group more commonly affected was 25-44 years (32.5%). The most common diagnoses were leishmaniasis (34%), schistosomiasis (29%), strongyloidiasis (12%), Chagas disease (8%), and dengue (8%). Average yearly hospitalization rate per 100,000 residents for all NTDs was 2.05, 1.33, and 10.39 in general population, Italians, and foreign citizens, respectively.

When a new virus emerges, generally, little is known about it, and no vaccines or other pharmaceutical interventions are available. In the case of a person-to-person transmission virus with no vaccines or other pharmaceutical interventions, the only way to control the virus outbreak is by keeping a sustained physical distancing between the individuals. However, to adjust the level of the physical distancing accurately can be so complicated. Any level above the necessary can compromise the economic activity, and any level below can collapse the health care system. This work proposes a controller to keep the number of hospitalized individuals below a limit, and a new group-structured model to describe the COVID-19 outbreak. The proposed controller is robust to the uncertainties in the parameters of the model and keeps the number of infected individuals controlled only by adjusting the social distancing level. Numerical simulations, to show the behavior of the proposed controller and model, are done.","output":"Controlling epidemic diseases based only on social distancing level: General case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cell response to novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is currently a widely researched topic.

The study group consisted of 23 patients divided on two groups: COVID-19 X-ray (+) n = 14 and COVID-19 X-ray (-) n = 9 and control n = 20. The flow cytometry method was performed. We observed a significantly higher percentage of plasmablasts and lower CD4+ lymphocytes in COVID-19 X-ray (+) patients than in COVID-19 X-ray (-) and control. In the COVID-19 X-ray (+) patients, there was a lower proportion of effector CD4+ T cells, na?ve CD8+ T cells and higher central memory CD4+ cells and effector CD8+ T cells than control.

To evaluate the level and persistence of NAbs induced by two inactivated COVID-19 vaccines in China. Methods and findings Serum samples were collected from 1,335 people aged 18 and over who were vaccinated with COVID-19 inactivated vaccine in Peking University People's Hospital from January 19 to June 23, 2021, for detection of COVID-19 antibodies. The WHO standard of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs was detected. The coefficients of variation between the detection results and the true values of the NAbs detected by the WHO standard were all lower than the WHO international standard 3% after the dilution of the original and the dilution of the theoretical concentrations of 500 IU/mL, 250 IU/mL, 125 IU/mL, 72.5 IU/mL, 36.25 IU/mL and 18.125 IU/mL. On day 11-70, the positive rate of NAbs against COVID-19 was 82% to 100%; From day 71 to 332, the positive rate of NAbs decreased to 27%. The level of NAbs was significantly higher at 3-8 Weeks than at 0-3 Weeks. There was a high linear correlation between NAbs and IgG antibodies in 1335 vaccinated patients. NAbs levels were decreased in 31 of 38 people (81.6%) at two time points after the second dose of vaccine. There was no significant difference in age between the group with increased and decreased neutralizing antibody levels (x2 =-0.034, P>0.05). The positive rate of NAbs in the two-dose vaccine group (77.3%) was significantly higher than that in the one-dose group (18.1%), with statistical difference (x2=312.590, P<0.001). A total of 206 people who were 11-70 days after receiving the second dose were tested and divided into three groups: 18-40 years old, 41-60 years old and >60 years old. The positive rates of NAbs in three groups (18-40 years old, 41-60 years old and >60 years old) were 95.14%, 78.43% and 81.8%, respectively. The positive rate of NAbs was significantly higher in 18-40 years old than in 41-60 years old (x2=12.547, P <0.01). The titer of NAbs in 18-40 years old group was significantly higher than that in 41-60 years old group (t=-0.222, P <0.01). The positive rate of NAbs in male group (89.32%) was lower than in female (91.26%), but there was no significant difference (x2=0.222, P >0.05). Conclusions The positive rate of NAbs was the highest from 10 to 70 days after the second dose of vaccine, and the positive rate gradually decreased as time went by. There was a high linear correlation between COVID-19 NAbs and IgM/IgG antibodies in vaccinators, suggesting that in cases where NAbs cannot be detected, IgM/IgG antibodies can be detected instead. The level of NAbs produced after vaccination was affected by age, but not by gender. The highest levels of NAbs were produced between shots 21 to 56 days apart, suggesting that 21 to 56 days between shots is suitable for vaccination.","output":"Studies on the level of neutralizing antibodies produced by inactivated COVID-19 vaccines in the real world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Hemodialysis emergencies in nephrology are frequent Prompt diagnosis and management are needed to save life and enhance prognosis The aim of this work was to determine the hemodialysis prevalence in emergency situations, its indications, the clinical, paraclinical and evolutionary profiles and to describe the parameters of the session as well as the per-dialytic incidents and their impacts on patient mortality Methods: It is a retrospective monocentric descriptive study during 3 months (July, August, and September 2020) carried out in the nephrology department of the University teaching hospital of Sousse We collect patients who underwent at least one session of HD Results: We included 61 patients who underwent emergency hemodialysis The average age of our patients was 5817 years (17- 95) and the sex ratio was 1,5 Our patients have hypertension and diabetes in respectively 56,1% and 34,4% of cases 42,6% of patients were admitted from the emergency department, 27,9% of patients from the surgical and urology department, 18% of patients from nephrology departments and 11,5% of patients from other departments Our population consists in chronic HD patients in 34,5% Chronic renal failure was noted in 43,6% with diabetic nephropathy as the most primary cause (44,1%) Acute renal failure was found in 18 2% with Obstructive nephropathy (66,1%) as the main etiology two patients were transplanted (3,3%) HD indications were hyperkalemia in 30%, acute pulmonary edema in 25% and metabolic acidosis in 23,3% of cases Conventional HD was performed with mean session duration of 3,4 hours Ultrafiltration was required in 73,8% with an average of 1800ml (range: 500-4000) The most frequently used approach was the femoral route in 54,1% followed by arterioveinous fistula in 24,6% Transfusion was required in 26,2% of cases Perdialytic complications were observed in 29,5% of cases Hypotension was the most common complication present in 13,1% of case;which leads to the interruption of the session in 4 9% of cases;followed by agitation in 4,9% of case The renal evolution of our population was hemodialysis dependence in 35,6%, back to basic level in13,3%chronic kidney disease in4,4% and recovery in 2,2% Death occurred in 5 cases including 3 patients outside dialysis and 2 patients on dialysis Infection by SARS covid 19 was the cause of death in 1 patient Conclusions: Extra-renal purification (REE) is sometimes essential in an emergency situation in the management of severe ARI or terminal CKD Early diagnosis and relevant treatment will enhance the prognosis of patients in the short and medium term No conflict of interest","output":"Pos-112 Hemodialysis Emergencies : a Monoclonal Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cartilage loss due to osteoarthritis (OA) in the patellofemoral joint provokes pain, stiffness, and restriction of joint motion, which strongly reduces quality of life.

Until now, however, there have been no strict protocols for VAG acquisition especially in regard to differences between the patellofemoral and tibiofemoral joints. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the proposed examination and acquisition protocol for the patellofemoral joint, as well as to determine the optimal examination protocol to obtain the best diagnostic results. Thirty-four patients scheduled for knee surgery due to cartilage lesions were enrolled in the study and compared with 33 healthy individuals in the control group. VAG acquisition was performed prior to surgery, and cartilage status was evaluated during the surgery as a reference point. Both closed (CKC) and open (OKC) kinetic chains were assessed during VAG. The selection of the optimal signal measures was performed using a neighborhood component analysis (NCA) algorithm. The classification was performed using multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) neural networks. The classification using artificial neural networks was performed for three variants: I. open kinetic chain, II. closed kinetic chain, and III. open and closed kinetic chain. The highest diagnostic accuracy was obtained for variants I and II for the RBF 9-35-2 and MLP 10-16-2 networks, respectively, achieving a classification accuracy of 98.53, a sensitivity of 0.958, and a specificity of 1.

We analyzed patient material using enzyme immune assays, flow cytometry and heparin-induced platelet aggregation assay and performed autopsies on two fatal cases. Eight patients (five females, three males) with a median age of 41.5 years (range, 24-53) were referred to us with suspected thrombotic complications 6 to 20 days after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. All patients had thrombocytopenia at admission. Patients had a median platelet count of 46.5x109/L (range, 8-92). Three had a fatal outcome and five were successfully treated.

Methods: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) for the first 18 secondary patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Bahia Blanca (Argentina). We ranked the fiability of the data depending upon certainty about the identification of the infector and the date of exposition to infector. The sample has some missing values. In the case of incubation, as 3 patients were infected by other household members, we only have 15 observations with an observed date of exposition. For the estimation of serial interval, one patient became ill from close contact with an asymptomatic infectious. Also, estimations of both the incubation period and the serial interval were carried using the full sample and a subsample with higher certainty about the transmissor and date of exposition. By the time the dataset was prepared all infectors were recovered so estimations do need to take into account right censoring. Results: The mean incubation period for symptomatic patients is 7.9 days (95% CI: 4.6, 11.1) considering the sample of 15 cases patients and 7.5 days (95% CI: 4.1, 10.9) if the sample is restricted to the most certain cases (n=12). The median is 6.1 (95% CI: 4.1, 9.2) and 5.8 (95% CI: 3.6, 9.3) respectively. Moreover, 97.5% of symptomatic cases will develop symptoms after 13.6 days from exposition (95% CI 10.7, 16.5). The point estimation for the mean serial interval is 6.8 days (95% CI: 4.0-9.6). Considering only the most certain pairs, the mean serial interval is estimated at 5.5 days (95% CI: 2.8, 8.1). The estimated median serial intervals were 5.2 (95% CI: 3.0, 8.1) and 4.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 6.9) days respectively. Conclusions: Evidence from Bahia Blanca (Argentina) suggests that the median and mean serial interval of Covid-19 is shorter than the incubation period. This suggests that a pre-symptomatic transmission is not negligible. Comparisons with foreign estimates show that incubation period and serial interval could be longer in Bahia Blanca city than in other regions.

Patients have been found to have different degrees of response, likely having to do with variable levels of inflammation within the body. Patients who have recovered from the initial infection can develop long-term symptomatology and chronic conditions. Today, we will describe a unique case of a middle aged-healthy man who developed complications of ANCA-associated vasculitis after recovering from a mild COVID-19 infection. Case: A 51-year-old Hispanic male with no previous past medical history presented to the ED with productive sputum and hemoptysis. The patient had previously tested positive for COVID-19 one month prior, but did not require hospitalization. Physical exam findings were significant for diffuse, bilateral lower extremity palpable purpura. Initial workup was significant for CT Chest findings of diffuse patchy consolidations throughout both lungs with cavitary lesions. Additionally, the patient was found to have an acute kidney injury, with Cr 5.80 and GFR less than 10. UA revealed many red blood cells, +1 protein. Nephrology was consulted, started the patient on hemodialysis, and began workup for suspected acute glomerulonephritis (GN). Pulmonology was consulted and began workup for pulmonary renal syndrome in the setting of acute kidney injury with pulmonary disease.Infectious workup results included;a now negative COVID-19, negative Tuberculosis PCR, Respiratory culture revealing yeast. Additional workup revealed;CRP of greater than 200, D-Dimer of 6.41, Fibrinogen of 561. Notably, the patient had decreased complement C3 and C4 levels, negative Anti-GBM antibody, negative Anti-streptolysin O, positive ANCA assay, positive Proteinase antibody, and mildly positive Myeloperoxidase antibody.The patient was subsequently scheduled for renal biopsy to obtain a definitive diagnosis, but this was delayed due to increased INR. The patient's respiratory status worsened during hemodialysis. CTA at that time revealed markedly increased pulmonary infiltrates. The decision was made to intubate the patient, upon which active frank red bleeding arising from the trachea was noted. Shortly after intubation, the patient continued to hemorrhage and sustained 2 cardiac arrests;unfortunately, the patient expired. Discussion: This case is significant because it highlights a unique complication of COVID-19 leading to a possible ANCA-associated vasculitis.

The data were collected by using the Socio-demographic and COVID-19 Pandemic Information Form and Death Anxiety Scale (DAS). The student nurses who agreed to participate in the study were asked to fill out an online questionnaire that was sent by the researchers. The study was conducted with 115 nursing students. RESULTS The DAS mean scores of the nursing students were found to be 8.011.96. When the correlation between DAS scores of the nursing students and their knowledge and attitudes regarding COVID-19 pandemic was examined, it was determined that as their anxiety levels about transmission of coronavirus increased, DAS scores also increased (p=0.037). The scores of death anxiety scale decreased as the level of students' attention to events other than coronavirus, their level of comforting themselves and their belief mentioning that they would heal if they catch coronavirus increased (p<0.05). No statistically significant correlation was found between DAS scores and other knowledge and attitudes of nursing students regarding COVID-19 pandemic (p<0.05).

METHODS: We performed a systematic review in the PubMed/Medline database to address the risk of SARS-CoV-2 recurrence. The last update was for 20 November 2020. Among the 1178 initially found articles, 66 met the inclusion criteria and were considered. FINDINGS: In total, 1128 patients with at least one-time recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 were included. Recurrence rate has been reported between 2.3% and 21.4% in cohort studies, within a mean of 20 (ranged 1-98) days after discharge; younger patients are being affected more. Following the second course of disease, the disease severity decreased or remained unchanged in 97.3% while it increased in 2.6%.

One explanation may be that SILS is technically demanding in morbidly obese patients. This report describes our technique and experience with single incision laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (SILAGB). METHODS Prospective data collection was performed on consecutive obese patients who underwent SILAGB between November 2009 and February 2011. A single 3 cm transverse incision in the right upper quadrant was used for a Covidien SILS? multichannel access port. The technique is described with a standard pars flaccida approach and the 'tips and tricks' needed for a wide range of candidates using standard laparoscopic equipment. RESULTS A total of 29 patients (27 female) with a median body mass index of 41 kg/m(2) (range: 35-52 kg/m(2)) and median age of 44 years (range: 22-57 years) underwent SILAGB. There were no 'conversions' to a standard laparoscopic technique. Two cases required the addition of one single 5 mm port. The only complications were two postoperative wound infections (one with a port site infection requiring replacement of the port) and one faulty band requiring replacement. There were therefore two returns to theatre and no 30-day deaths. All patients were discharged on the first postoperative day. In this series, operative times reduced significantly to be comparable with the conventional laparoscopic approach. CONCLUSIONS SILAGB is safe and feasible in the morbidly obese.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the common clinical manifestations of severe COVID-19 and it is also responsible for the current shortage of ventilators worldwide. This study aims to analyze the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 ARDS patients and establish a diagnostic system based on artificial intelligence (AI) method to predict the probability of ARDS in COVID-19 patients. We collected clinical data of 659 COVID-19 patients from 11 regions in China. The clinical characteristics of the ARDS group and no-ARDS group of COVID-19 patients were elaborately compared and both traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning-based method were used to build the prediction models. Results indicated that the median age of ARDS patients was 56.5 years old, which was significantly older than those with non-ARDS by 7.5 years. Male and patients with BMI > 25 were more likely to develop ARDS. The clinical features of ARDS patients included cough (80.3%), polypnea (59.2%), lung consolidation (53.9%), secondary bacterial infection (30.3%), and comorbidities such as hypertension (48.7%). Abnormal biochemical indicators such as lymphocyte count, CK, NLR, AST, LDH, and CRP were all strongly related to the aggravation of ARDS. Furthermore, through various AI methods for modeling and prediction effect evaluation based on the above risk factors, decision tree achieved the best AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in identifying the mild patients who were easy to develop ARDS, which undoubtedly helped to deliver proper care and optimize use of limited resources.","output":"Risk factors analysis of COVID-19 patients with ARDS and prediction based on machine learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dermatological examination revealed a solitary, well defined, hypotrichic, hypohidrotic, annular plaque, 7 cm in diameter over the dorsum of the left foot which was hypoaesthetic to pain, touch and temperature.

To date, to our knowledge, no studies have investigated the longer-term effects of COVID-19 on vascular function. Herein, we hypothesized that young, otherwise healthy adults who are past the acute phase of COVID-19 would exhibit blunted peripheral [brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and reactive hyperemia] and cerebral vasodilator function (cerebral vasomotor reactivity to hypercapnia; CVMR) and increased central arterial stiffness. Sixteen young adults who were at least 4 wk past a COVID-19 diagnosis and 12 controls who never had COVID-19 were studied. Eight subjects with COVID-19 were symptomatic (SYM) and eight were asymptomatic (ASYM) at the time of testing. FMD and reactive hyperemia were not different between COVID and control groups. However, FMD was lower in SYM (3.8  0.6%) compared with ASYM (6.8  0.9%; P = 0.007) and control (6.8  0.6%; P = 0.003) with no difference between ASYM and control. Similarly, peak blood velocity following cuff release was lower in SYM (47  8 cm/s) compared with ASYM (64  19 cm/s; P = 0.025) and control (61  14 cm/s; P = 0.036). CVMR and arterial stiffness were not different between any groups. In summary, peripheral macrovascular and microvascular function, but not cerebral vascular function or central arterial stiffness were blunted in young adults symptomatic beyond the acute phase of COVID-19. In contrast, those who were asymptomatic had similar vascular function compared with controls who never had COVID-19. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study was the first to investigate the persistent effects of COVID-19 on vascular function in otherwise healthy young adults. We demonstrated that peripheral macrovascular and microvascular vasodilation was significantly blunted in young adults still symptomatic from COVID-19 beyond the acute phase (>4 wk from diagnosis), whereas those who become asymptomatic have similar vascular function compared with controls who never had COVID-19. In contrast, cerebral vascular function and central arterial stiffness were unaffected irrespective of COVID-19 symptomology.","output":"Blunted peripheral but not cerebral vasodilator function in young otherwise healthy adults with persistent symptoms following COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In real world data classification tasks, we always face the situations where the data samples of the normal cases present a well defined pattern and the features of abnormal data samples vary from one to another, i.e., do not show a regular pattern. Up to now, the general data classification hypothesis requires the data features within each class to present a certain level of similarity. Therefore, such real situations violate the classic classification condition and make it a hard task. In this paper, we present a novel solution for this kind of problems through a network approach. Specifically, we construct a core-periphery network from the training data set in such way that core node set is formed by the normal data samples and peripheral node set contains the abnormal samples of the training data set. The classification is made by checking the coreness of the testing data samples. The proposed method is applied to classify radiographic image for COVID-19 diagnosis. Computer simulations show promising results of the method.

The causes that lead to ARDS are multiple and include inhalation of salt water, smoke particles, or as a result of damage caused by respiratory viruses. ARDS can also arise due to systemic complications such as blood transfusions, sepsis, or pancreatitis. Unfortunately, despite a high mortality rate of 40%, there are limited treatment options available for ARDS outside of last resort options such as mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal support strategies. Aim of review: A complication of ARDS is the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH); however, the mechanisms that lead to PH in ARDS are not fully understood. In this review, we summarize the known mechanisms that promote PH in ARDS.

Plasma lipidomic measure may improve the prognostic performances of clinical endpoints of CAD. Our research is designed to identify the correlations between plasma lipid species and the risks of death, major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) and left ventricular (LV) remodeling in patients with CAD. METHODS: A total of 1569 Chinese patients with CAD, 1011 single\\\\centre patients as internal training cohort, and 558 multicentre patients as external validation cohort, were enrolled. The concentration of plasma lipids in both cohorts was determined through widely targeted lipidomic profiling. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox and multivariate Cox regressions were used to develop prognostic models for death and MACE, respectively. RESULTS: Ten (Cer(d18:1/20:1), Cer(d18:1/24:1), PE(30:2), PE(32:0), PE(32:2), PC(O\\\\38:2), PC(O\\\\36:4), PC(16:1/22:2), LPC(18:2/0:0) and LPE(0:0/24:6)) and two (Cer(d18:1/20:1) and LPC(20:0/0:0)) lipid species were independently related to death and MACE, respectively. Cer(d18:1/20:1) and Cer(d18:1/24:1) were correlated with LV remodeling (P < .05). The lipidic panel incorporating 10 lipid species and two traditional biomarkers for predicting 5\\\\year death risk represented a remarkable higher discrimination than traditional model with increased area under the curve from 76.56 to 83.65%, continuous NRI of 0.634 and IDI of 0.131. Furthermore, the panel was successfully used in differentiating multicentre patients with low, middle, or high risks (P < .0001). Further analysis indicated that the number of double bonds of phosphatidyl choline and the content of carbon atoms of phosphatidyl ethanolamines were negatively associated with death risk. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in the prediction of death confirms the effectiveness of plasma lipids as predictors to risk classification in patients with CAD.

Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs; Nurse Practitioners & Clinical Nurse Specialists) manage high burden, complex care of patients with HF. During the COVID-19 pandemic, clinician burnout, stress and job dissatisfaction have likely impacted quality of life (WR-QoL). No studies describe burnout and resilience in APRNs who provide care to individuals with HF. Aims Among APRNs who work with patients with HF, three aims include: 1) Describe the level of burnout and WR-QoL; 2) Determine the relationship between burnout and QOWL variables; 3) Examine whether resilience moderates the association between WR-QoL and burnout. Methods This descriptive correlational study employed an online survey in October, 2020 to APRNs who were members of the American Association of Heart Failure Nurses and the HFSA. Inclusion criteria: APRN's who practiced in cardiology clinics, advanced HF clinics, inpatient cardiology units, or HF home care programs, at least 8 hours weekly. Exclusion criteria: Exclusively pediatric, administrative, educational, or research-focused APRNs. Outcomes measured: Burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory), WR-QoL (Work-Related QoL Scale), and Resilience (Brief Resilience Scale). Institutional review board approval and written consents were obtained. Results Participant (N=101) mean age was 50 (10) years, 93% identified as female, 96% White, and 70% were master's prepared. Mean weekly worked hours were more than 42 and the majority of APRNs (n=75) represented community and academic health centers. APRNs reported high levels of personal (M= 51.7, norm-referenced mean: 35.9) and work-related burnout (M=50.1, norm-referenced mean: 33.0) with significant correlations between high levels of burnout and low WR-QoL (r range: -.74  -.39 -, p<.001). APRNs who reported medium or high resilience showed negative relationships between burnout and general well-being (r = -.64, -.76, respectively, p<.001), while the low resilience group showed no relationship. Additionally, APRNs who reported no/low or work-related burnout showed a positive relationship between resilience and general well-being (r = .57, p<.001), while the moderate and severe burnout groups did not. Conclusion We found that the positive effect of resilience on general well-being decreased as work-related burnout went up, indicating the moderating role of work-related burnout. The unanticipated finding that the negative burnout-QOWL relationship was stronger with higher resilience requires more exploration. It is especially critical now, given the emphasis on supporting clinician well-being and preventing burnout, for us to better understand the role of resilience and burnout in well-being.","output":"Quality Of Work-Life Among Advanced Practice Nurses Who Care For Patients With Heart Failure: The Effect Of Resilience During The Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of melanoma diagnoses has increased dramatically over the past three decades, outpacing almost all other cancers.

However, screening is a multi-step process and most patients do not perfectly adhere to guideline-recommended screening schedules. Our objective was to compare the reduction in colorectal cancer incidence and life-years gained based on US guideline-concordant fecal immunochemical test screening to scenarios with a range of delays. METHOD The Colorectal Cancer Simulated Population model for Incidence and Natural history (CRC-SPIN) microsimulation model was used to estimate the effect of systematic departures from fecal immunochemical test screening guidelines on lifetime screening benefit. RESULTS The combined effect of consistent modest delays in screening initiation (1 year), repeated fecal immunochemical test screening (3 months), and receipt of follow-up or surveillance colonoscopy (3 months) resulted in up to 1.3 additional colorectal cancer cases per 10,000, 0.4 additional late-stage colorectal cancer cases per 10,000 and 154.7 fewer life-years gained per 10,000. A 5-year delay in screening initiation had a larger impact on screening effectiveness than consistent small delays in repeated fecal immunochemical test screening or receipt of follow-up colonoscopy after an abnormal fecal immunochemical test. The combined effect of consistent large delays in screening initiation (5 years), repeated fecal immunochemical test screening (6 months), and receipt of follow-up or surveillance colonoscopy (6 months) resulted in up to 3.7 additional colorectal cancer cases per 10,000, 1.5 additional late-stage colorectal cancer cases per 10,000 and 612.3 fewer life-years gained per 10,000.

Outcomes comprised hematoma characteristics, the impact of continuation, discontinuation, and initiation of statins on peak PHE extent, and the influence of statin treatment on the occurrence of seizures, cardiovascular adverse events, and functional recovery after ICH. RESULTS A total of 1275 patients with ICH with information on statin treatment were analyzed. Statin treatment on hospital admission (21.7%) was associated with higher rates of lobar versus nonlobar ICH (odds ratio, 1.57 [1.03-2.40]; P=0.038). Initiation of statins after ICH was associated with increased peak PHE (=0.12, SE=0.06, P=0.008), whereas continuation versus discontinuation of prior statin treatment was not significantly associated with edema formation (P>0.10). There were no significant differences in the incidence of remote symptomatic seizures according to statin exposure during follow-up (statins: 11.5% versus no statins: 7.8%, subdistribution hazard ratio: 1.15 [0.80-1.66]; P=0.512). Patients on statins revealed less cardiovascular adverse events and more frequently functional recovery after 12 months (functional recovery: 57.7% versus 45.0%, odds ratio 1.67 [1.09-2.56]; P=0.019). CONCLUSIONS Among statin users, lobar ICH occurs more frequently as compared with nonstatin users. While continuation of prior statin treatment appears to be safe regarding PHE formation, the initiation of statins during the first days after ICH may increase PHE extent. However, statins should be initiated thereafter (eg, at hospital discharge) to prevent cardiovascular events and potentially improve functional recovery.","output":"Impact of Statins on Hematoma, Edema, Seizures, Vascular Events, and Functional Recovery After Intracerebral Hemorrhage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of Review: An unprecedented outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China (COVID-19) occurred in December 2019, and then engulfed the entire world, presenting a significant and urgent threat to global health.

The morbidity rate was low with the contribution of illness from the total country population of approximately 0.02%. While the dispersion of the number of evolved cases of infection followed Gaussian distribution in the major wave, the mortality number failed to show signs of normal spreading of data indicated by significant drifting of skewness and kurtosis values from the normal distribution.

The major components of Avenula dahurica, including xanthotoxin (1), bergapten (2), imperatorin (3), isoimperatorin (4), oxypeucedanin (5), and byakangelicol (6), were all metabolized by the human fecal sample, and each furanocoumarin was also biotransformed by Blautia sp. MRG-PMF1 responsible for intestinal O-demethylation. Oxypeucedanin (5) and byakangelicol (6) were converted to oxypeucedanin hydrate (9) and desmethylbyakangelicin (12), respectively. The gut microbial conversion of xanthotoxin (1) and bergapten (2) with the MRG-PMF1 strain resulted in the production of xanthotoxol (7) and bergaptol (8), respectively, due to the methyl aryl ether cleavage by O-methyltransferase. Unexpectedly, the biotransformation of prenylated furanocoumarins, imperatorin (3), and isoimperatorin (4) resulted in the corresponding deprenylated furanocoumarins of xanthotoxol (7) and bergaptol (8), respectively. The cleavage of the prenyl aryl ether group by gut microbiota was unprecedented metabolism.

Analogous to the gravity field, magnetic field modeling can be expanded by magnetic curvatures (MC), the third-order derivatives of the magnetic potential (MP), which are the change rates of the magnetic gradient tensor (MGT). Exploiting Poissons relations between [Formula: see text] th-order derivatives of the GP and nth-order derivatives of the MP, this paper derives expressions for the MC of a uniformly magnetized tesseroid using the fourth-order derivatives of the GP of a uniform tesseroid expressed in terms of the Cartesian kernel functions. Based on the magnetic effects of a uniform spherical shell, all expressions for the MP, magnetic vector (MV), MGT and MC of tesseroids have been examined for numerical problems due to singularity of the respective integral kernels (i.e., near zone and polar singularity problems). For this, the closed analytical expressions for the MP, MV, MGT and MC of the uniform spherical shell have been provided and used to generate singularity-free reference values. Varying both height and latitude of the computation point, it is found numerically that the near zone problem also exists for all magnetic quantities (i.e., MP, MV, MGT and MC). The numerical tests also reveal that the polar singularity problems do not occur for the magnetic quantity as a result of the use of Cartesian as opposed to spherical integral kernels. This demonstrates that the magnetic quantity including the newly derived MC inherit the same numerical properties as the corresponding gravitational functional. Possible future applications (e.g., geophysical information) of the MC formulas of a uniformly magnetized tesseroid could be improved modeling of the Earths magnetic field by dedicated satellite missions.","output":"Magnetic Curvatures of a Uniformly Magnetized Tesseroid Using the Cartesian Kernels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract How is it possible to account for the continuing presence of monarchy in advanced social democracies?

Oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) clinical practice uniquely exposes providers to COVID-19. The purpose of the present study was to understand the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on OMS residency training programs (OMSRTPs): 1) training and education; 2) availability and use of personal protective equipment (PPE); 3) experience with, and use of, screening and viral testing; 4) resident experience; and 5) program director (PD) experience and observations of the immediate and future effects on OMSRTPs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: OMS residents and PDs in OMSRTPs in the United States were invited to participate in the present cross-sectional study from April 1, 2020 to May 1, 2020. A 51-question survey was used to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on OMSRTPs and to assess the 5 specific aims of the present study. RESULTS: A total of 160 residents and 13 PDs participated in the survey, representing 83% of US states or territories with OMSRTPs. Almost all residents (96.5%) reported modifications to their training program, and 14% had been reassigned to off-service clinical rotations (eg, medicine, intensive care unit). The use of an N95 respirator mask plus standard PPE precautions during aerosol-generating procedures varied by procedure location, with 36.8% reporting limited access to these respirators. Widespread screening practices were in use, with 83.6% using laboratory-based viral testing. Residents scheduled to graduate in 2022 were most concerned with the completion of the graduation requirements and with decreased operative experience. Most residents (94.2%) had moved to web-based didactics, and a plurality (47%) had found increased value in the didactics. CONCLUSIONS: Sweeping alterations to OMS clinical practice have occurred for those in OMSRTPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the overall OMSRTP response has been favorable, residents' concerns regarding the ubiquitous availability of appropriate PPE, operative experience, and completion of graduation requirements requires further deliberation.","output":"Early Effects of COVID-19 on Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Residency Training-Results From a National Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the association between Covid-19 and thromboembolic events, there has been a surge in anticoagulation use during the pandemic based on evolving guidelines for management of hospitalized Covid-19 patients.

Objective: To evaluate the effect of combination subcutaneous casirivimab and imdevimab on progression from early asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection to symptomatic COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of close household contacts of a SARS-CoV-2-infected index case at 112 sites in the US, Romania, and Moldova enrolled July 13, 2020-January 28, 2021; follow-up ended March 11, 2021. Asymptomatic individuals (aged 12 years) were eligible if identified within 96 hours of index case positive test collection. Results from 314 individuals positive on SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) testing are reported. Interventions: Individuals were randomized 1:1 to receive 1 dose of subcutaneous casirivimab and imdevimab, 1200 mg (600 mg of each; n = 158), or placebo (n = 156). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was the proportion of seronegative participants who developed symptomatic COVID-19 during the 28-day efficacy assessment period. The key secondary efficacy end points were the number of weeks of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and the number of weeks of high viral load (>4 log10 copies/mL). Results: Among 314 randomized participants (mean age, 41.0 years; 51.6% women), 310 (99.7%) completed the efficacy assessment period; 204 were asymptomatic and seronegative at baseline and included in the primary efficacy analysis. Subcutaneous casirivimab and imdevimab, 1200 mg, significantly prevented progression to symptomatic disease (29/100 [29.0%] vs 44/104 [42.3%] with placebo; odds ratio, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.30-0.97]; P = .04; absolute risk difference, -13.3% [95% CI, -26.3% to -0.3%]). Casirivimab and imdevimab reduced the number of symptomatic weeks per 1000 participants (895.7 weeks vs 1637.4 weeks with placebo; P = .03), an approximately 5.6-day reduction in symptom duration per symptomatic participant. Treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab also reduced the number of high viral load weeks per 1000 participants (489.8 weeks vs 811.9 weeks with placebo; P = .001).

The aim of this study was to develop a computer model of a laparoscopic ventral hernia repair and to test different meshes in that model at various intra-abdominal pressures. METHODS Four meshes were tested in a computer model of a ventral hernia. Mechanical failure testing of each mesh was performed in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. A CT scan of a patient with a 5 cm umbilical hernia was used to generate a 3 dimensional model. Meshes were then applied to the model in an intraperitoneal onlay position with a 5 cm overlap. The model was then tested with intraabdominal pressures for standing, coughing and jumping with and without meshes. RESULTS Meshes varied significantly (p < 0.001) in both rupture force 14.8 (5.6) to 78 (5) n/cm and force in which they changed from elastic to plastic 1.6 (0.1) to 14.2 (0.2) n/cm. When applied to the computer model all significantly reduced the strain on the abdominal wall from 17.5% without mesh to less than 1% with mesh. All meshes prevented the hernia from bulging in the model. CONCLUSIONS We have developed a computer model of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair based on engineering principles.

In search of effective treatments, the global medical, scientific, pharma and funding communities have rapidly initiated over 500 COVID-19 clinical trials on a range of antiviral drug regimens and repurposed drugs in various combinations. A paradigm shift is underway from the current focus of drug development targeting the pathogen, to advancing cellular Host-Directed Therapies (HDTs) for tackling the aberrant host immune and inflammatory responses which underlie the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and high COVID-19 mortality rates. We focus this editorial specifically on the background to, and the rationale for, the use and evaluation of mesenchymal stromal (Stem) cells (MSCs) in treatment trials of patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Currently, the ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) report a combined 28 trials exploring the potential of MSCs or their products for treatment of COVID-19. MSCs should also be trialed for treatment of other circulating WHO priority Blueprint pathogens such as MERS-CoV which causes upto 34% mortality rates. It's about time funding agencies invested more into development MSCs per se, and also for a range of other HDTs, in combination with other therapeutic interventions. MSC therapy could turn out to be an important contribution to bringing an end to the high COVID-19 death rates and preventing long-term functional disability in those who survive disease.","output":"Reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with severe COVID-19 disease by advancing ongoing trials of Mesenchymal Stromal (stem) Cell (MSC) therapy - Achieving global consensus and visibility for cellular host-directed therapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) has been recognized as the third class of redox cofactors in addition to the well-known nicotinamides (NAD(P)+) and flavins (FAD, FMN). It plays important physiological roles in various organisms and has strong antioxidant properties. The biosynthetic pathway of PQQ involves a gene cluster composed of 4 to 7 genes, named pqqA-G, among which pqqA is a key gene for PQQ synthesis, encoding the precursor peptide PqqA. To produce recombinant PqqA in E. coli, fusion tags were used to increase the stability and solubility of the peptide, as well simplify the scale-up of the fermentation process. In this paper, pqqA from Gluconobacter oxydans 621H was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as a fusion protein with SUMO and purified using a hexahistidine (His6) tag. The SUMO fusion protein and His6 tag were specifically recognized and cleaved by the SUMO specific ULP protease, and immobilized-metal affinity chromatography was used to obtain high-purity precursor peptide PqqA. Expression and purification of target proteins was confirmed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE.

However, tumultuous times, such as the time during a major pandemic, cause many significant disruptions in both internal and external environmental domains. Thus, we argue that it is critical during this time to reevaluate the company's business relationships as a whole. While long-term partnerships are great for handling incremental changes during stable times, disruptive environmental changes may require managers to consider disruptive changes to their businesses. A pandemic may also present opportunities for establishing new relationships as there may be other partners/suppliers who are better equipped to help the company address urgent short-term needs and to capitalize on significant long-term opportunities. In this paper, we design a new relationship audit template to help B2B firms weather the immediate crisis at hand and position themselves more strategically for the future.

METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 3500 Spanish adults was interviewed in June 2020 (mean age 49.25 years,  15.64; 51.50% females). Mental health included Generalized Anxiety Disorders (GAD; GAD-7, cut-off point of  10), Major Depressive Disorders (MDD; PHQ-8, cut-off point of  10) and the comorbid form (those screening positive for GAD and MDD). COVID-related stress was assessed using an adapted version of the Peri Life Events Scale, and social support using the Oslo Social Support Scale. Logistic regression models were used to assess if COVID-related stress and social support were related to mental health outcomes and interactions were conducted to examine whether these relationships differed according to the presence of pre-pandemic mental disorders. RESULTS: Higher COVID-related stress was associated with a higher risk of lower mental health. The association between COVID-related stress with GAD and MDD was significantly moderated by pre-pandemic mental disorders, except for comorbid GAD + MDD. Higher levels of social support were linked to better mental health. Only the association between social support and GAD was significantly moderated by pre-pandemic mental disorders. That is, for those without pre-pandemic mental disorders, higher levels of social support decreased the odds of GAD, while minor decreases were observed in those with pre-pandemic mental disorders.

Specifically, it predicts higher levels of positive selection on these genes in domesticated species, relative to closely related wild species. Here we test this prediction in a comparative framework. We obtained DNA sequences from a public database (NCBI) for eleven key neural crest cell genes from a set of thirty domesticated vertebrates and matched close relatives that remain wild.

It is unclear what motivates solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients to participate and whether the games serve as an incentive for SOT recipients to increase their physical activity (PA) levels. OBJECTIVES: 1. To describe the characteristics of participants from past games and their motivation for attending and 2. to determine whether there was an interest in participating in goal-based, pre-games exercise training programs. METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was sent to adult SOT recipients who were members of the Canadian Transplant Association. The survey included questions about why participants attended, their PA levels, and their interest in a pre-games training program. RESULTS: Of the 157 participants, more were male than female; the 35-54-year-old age group was the most common; and 62% of respondents received a liver or kidney transplant. The most common reasons for participating in the games were to showcase health post-transplant, promote awareness of organ donation, sports competition, and social reasons. Sixty-five percent of respondents reported that they would be interested in an exercise program to be more physically prepared for the competition. CONCLUSION: Pre-games training programs could be developed to motivate participation and help participants achieve higher training intensities and foster social interaction. Directing resources to individuals who do not attend the games and to those who are not physically active should be considered.","output":"Characteristics and Motivation of Solid Organ Transplant Recipients Attending the Canadian Transplant Games"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor blocker, has been used in the inflammatory phase of COVID-19, but its impact independent of corticosteroids remains unclear in patients with severe disease. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 admitted between March 2 and April 14, 2020 to a large academic medical center in New York City, we describe outcomes associated with tocilizumab 400 mg (without methylprednisolone) compared to a propensity-matched control. The primary endpoints were change in a 7-point ordinal scale of oxygenation and ventilator free survival, both at days 14 and 28. Secondary endpoints include incidence of bacterial superinfections and gastrointestinal perforation. Primary outcomes were evaluated using t-test. RESULTS: We identified 33 patients who received tocilizumab and matched 74 controls based on demographics and health measures upon admission. After adjusting for illness severity and baseline ordinal scale, we failed to find evidence of an improvement in hypoxemia based on an ordinal scale at hospital day 14 in the tocilizumab group (OR 2.2; 95% CI, 0.7-6.5; p = 0.157) or day 28 (OR 1.1; 95% CI, 0.4-3.6; p = 0.82). There also was no evidence of an improvement in ventilator-free survival at day 14 (OR 0.8; 95% CI, 0.18-3.5; p = 0.75) or day 28 (OR 1.1; 95% CI, 0.1-1.8; p = 0.23). There was no increase in secondary bacterial infection rates in the tocilizumab group compared to controls (OR 0.37; 95% CI, 0.09-1.53; p = 0.168).

Deconjugation of Ub or UBL from proteins is performed by a class of proteases called isopeptidases. Herein is described a readily quantifiable novel isopeptidase assay platform consisting of Ub or UBL fused to the reporter enzyme phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)). Isopeptidase activity releases PLA(2), which cleaves its substrate, generating a signal that is linear with deubiquitylase (DUB) concentration and is able to discriminate DUB, deSUMOylase, deNEDDylase, and deISGylase activities. The power and sensitivity of the UBL-PLA(2) assay are demonstrated by its ability to differentiate the contrasting deISGylase and DUB activities of two coronavirus proteases: severe acute respiratory syndrome papain-like protease (SARS-CoV PLpro) and NL63 CoV papain-like protease 2 (PLP2). Furthermore, direct comparisons with the current Ub-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ub-AMC) assay demonstrated that the Ub-PLA(2) assay is an effective tool for characterizing modulators of isopeptidase activity. This observation was expanded by profiling the inhibitory activity of the nonselective isopeptidase inhibitor NSC 632839 against DUBs and deSUMOylases.

Understanding how climate variability affects the transmission of infectious diseases is important for both researchers and the general public. Yet, the widespread knowledge of the general public on this matter is unknown, and quantitative research is still lacking. A survey was designed to assess the knowledge and perception of 1) infectious diseases, 2) climate change and 3) the effect of climate change on infectious diseases. Participants were recruited via convenience sampling, and an anonymous cross-sectional survey with informed consent was distributed to each participant. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed primarily focusing on the occupational background as well as nationality of participants. A total of 458 individuals participated in this study, and most participants were originally from Myanmar, the Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States. Almost half (44%) had a background in natural sciences and had a higher level of knowledge on infectious diseases compared to participants with non-science background (mean score of 12.5 and 11.2 out of 20, respectively). The knowledge of the effect of climate change on infectious diseases was also significantly different between participants with and without a background in natural sciences (13.1 and 11.8 out of 20, respectively). The level of knowledge on various topics was highly correlated with nationality but not associated with age. The general population demonstrated a high awareness and strong knowledge of climate change regardless of their background in natural sciences. This study exposes a knowledge gap in the general public regarding the effect of climate change on infectious diseases, and highlights that different levels of knowledge are observed in groups with differing occupations and nationalities.

A high IQ is correlated with many important outcomes (e.g., academic prominence, reduced crime), but it does not protect against cognitive biases, partisan thinking, reactance, confirmation bias, and even falling for discredited beliefs such as alchemy, cold fusion, and astrology. There are several newer theories that directly address the question about solving real-world problems. Prominent among them is Sternbergs adaptive intelligence with adaptation to the environmentas the central premise, a construct that does not exist on standardized IQ tests (e.g., Sternberg, 2019).

We present a case of a patient with severely elevated inflammatory markers who remained clinically stable during his hospital course. CASE DISCUSSION A 53-year-old male presented to the emergency room with 11 days of persistent fevers and new-onset anterior chest tightness. He was admitted to the hospital due to a reported oxygen desaturation at home to 87% (taken by his spouse, a healthcare professional) and ambulatory oxygen desaturation down to 87%. He was noted to have severely elevated inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, and computed tomography pulmonary angiograph findings consistent with COVID-19. He remained on room air and clinically stable throughout his 3-day hospital course. While his C-reactive protein levels improved, his ferritin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate continued to elevate. He was discharged home and was symptom-free within 4 days of hospital discharge. DISCUSSION COVID-19 has proven to be a viral disease with a high transmission rate, that has caused over 100,000 deaths in the United States, thus far.

The present study examines the consumption of medical services among adults over the age of 65 in Israel at the time of the first COVID-19 lockdown relative to the corresponding period the year before, according to various socio-demographic variables: gender, age, marital status, ethnicity, degree of religiosity and socioeconomic status. Methods: A retrospective longitudinal observational quantitative research based on the Natali Healthcare Solutions Israel database of subscribers. Company subscribers over the age of 65 (N=103,955) were included in the sample (64.5% women) in two time periods, before the COVID-19 outbreak-P1, in 2019, and during the first COVID-19 lockdown- P2 in 2020. Medical needs included referrals to a medical or emergency services, ordering an ambulance, physician home visits and service refusal. Results: The average number of referrals to services was lower during the COVID-19 lockdown period (M=0.3658, SD=0.781) compared to the corresponding period the previous year (M=0.5402, SD=0.935). At the time of the COVID-19 lockdown, the average number of referrals to medical services was lower, but the average number of ambulance orders, physician visits and service refusals was higher compared to the same period in the previous year. During both time periods, women (P1- M=0.5631, SD=0.951; P2- M=0.3846, SD=0.800) required significantly more (p<.000) services than men (P1- M=0.5114, SD=0.910; P2- M=0.3417, SD=0.753). In both time periods, subscribers who were older, widowed, living in non-Jewish/mixed localities or in average or below average socioeconomic status localities required more services relative to younger, married people living in Jewish localities, or in above-average socioeconomic localities (p<.000). Summary and Conclusions: In a large sample of elderly in Israel, findings indicate a decrease in referrals to medical care during the first COVID-19 lockdown period, yet an increase in ambulance orders, physician visits and service refusals. There were no significant differences between the periods according to different socio-demographic characteristics. The period of the first COVID-19 lockdown was characterized by a higher incidence of medical service refusals compared to routine times.

However, its therapeutic efficacy is impaired by low intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, significantly limiting its therapeutic potential. Herein, a multimodal strategy to improve ferroptosis is presented, in which a state-of-art engineered erythrocyte, termed as sonodynamic amplified ferroptosis erythrocyte (SAFE), is developed for simultaneously activating ferroptosis and oxygen-riched sonodynamic therapy (SDT). SAFE is composed of internalizing RGD peptide and red blood cell membrane hybrid camouflaged nanocomplex of hemoglobin, perfluorocarbon, ferroptosis activator (dihomo-?3-linolenic acid, DGLA), and sonosensitizer verteporfin. It is identified that SAFE, under ultrasound stimulation, can not only substantially supply oxygen to overcome tumor hypoxia associated therapeutic resistance, but effectively activate ferroptosis through the coeffect of SDT triggered ROS production and DGLA mediated lipid peroxidation. In vivo studies reveal that SAFE selectively accumulates in tumor tissues and induces desirable anticancer effects under mild ultrasound stimulation. Importantly, SAFE can effectively inhibit tumor growth with minimal invasiveness, resulting in a prolonged survival period of mice. Therefore, a multimodal ferroptosis therapy driven by oxygen-riched sonodynamic peroxidation of lipids, significantly advancing synergistic cancer treatment, is presented.","output":"Biomimetic Activator of Sonodynamic Ferroptosis Amplifies Inherent Peroxidation for Improving the Treatment of Breast Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cerebrovascular diseases attributed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are uncommon but can result in devastating outcomes.

[NEJM 1994;331(10):637-42]). Assumptions underlying this approach have yet to be formally evaluated. METHODS: Respiratory events (RE) observed during a 48-week trial of ataluren (NCT02139306), a read-through agent for premature nonsense codons, were compared across six exacerbation definitions: any AT, intravenous AT (IVAT), &#8805;4 Fuchs criteria present, AT plus &#8805;4 Fuchs criteria, IVAT plus &#8805;4 Fuchs criteria, and investigator assessment. Fuchs definitions were evaluated by assessing missingness of individual criteria and associations between criteria presence and clinician exacerbation assessment. RESULTS: Among 751 RE, more than one third had &#8805;4 Fuchs criteria present but were not assessed as exacerbations by investigators. Data for &#8805;1 and for 4 Fuchs criteria, respectively, were missing for ~ 90% and >30% of RE. Only 6/12 Fuchs criteria were present more often when investigators assessed RE as exacerbations than when they did not. CONCLUSIONS: \\"Objective\\" definitions have shortcomings inconsistent with their purpose of optimizing exacerbation capture in clinical trials : 1) they capture events clinicians do not consider exacerbations, 2) are prone to data missingness which can bias the likelihood of meeting the definition, and 3) employ criteria that are not associated with investigator assessment of exacerbation.","output":"Evaluating assumptions of definition-based pulmonary exacerbation endpoints in cystic fibrosis clinical trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY: This study examines the difference in length of stay and total hospital charge by income quartile in hip fracture patients.

This study aims to determine if there is a difference in hospital length of stay (LOS) and total hospital charge between income quartiles in hospitalized hip fracture patients. METHODS: National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data from 2016 to 2018 was used to determine differences in LOS, total charge, and other demographic/clinical outcomes by income quartile in patients hospitalized for hip fracture. Multivariate regressions were performed for both LOS and total hospital charge to determine variable impact and significance. RESULTS: There were 860,045 hip fracture patients were included this study. With 222,625 in the lowest income quartile, 234,215 in the second, 215,270 in the third, and 190,395 in the highest income quartile. LOS decreased with increase in income quartile. Total charge was highest in the highest quartile, while it was lowest in the middle two-quartiles. Comorbidities with the largest magnitude of effect on both LOS and total charge were lung disease, kidney disease, and heart disease. Time to surgery post-admission also had a large effect on both outcomes of interest. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that income quartile has an effect on both hospital LOS and total charge. This may be the result of differences in demographics and other clinical variables between quartiles and increased comorbidities in lower income levels. The overall summation of these socioeconomic, demographic, and medical factors affecting patients in lower income levels may result in worse outcomes following hip fracture.

The pandemic has led to changes in locational and travel behaviour as well as regulated lockdowns with respect to where people work, live and social distance from one another. This makes it impossible to predict a new normal reflecting ways we are able to control and manage the pandemic. As we have little data pertaining to this future, to engage in informed discussion, we develop a hypothetical city organised around theories of spatial interaction, urban hierarchy, density, and heterogeneity of movement. We propose a symmetric square grid of locations, simulate the interactions using gravitational models, and then lock it down. We release the lockdown in the transition to a new normal, assuming different parameter values controlling the effects of distance, illustrating the difficulty of generating highly decentralised city forms. We apply the model to London, locking down the metropolis, and exploring seven functional forms that provide us with a sample of different city shapes and densities.

It has previously been shown that the fungal allodiploid species Verticillium longisporum, causal agent of Verticillium stem striping in rape seed, has originated from at least three independent hybridization events between two haploid Verticillium species. To reveal the impact of genome duplication as a consequence of the hybridization, we studied the genome and transcriptome dynamics upon two independent V. longisporum hybridization events, represented by the hybrid lineages \\"A1/D1\\" and \\"A1/D3\\". We show that the V. longisporum genomes are characterized by extensive chromosomal rearrangements, including between parental chromosomal sets. V. longisporum hybrids display signs of evolutionary dynamics that are typically associated with the aftermath of allodiploidization, such as haploidization and a more relaxed gene evolution. Expression patterns of the two sub-genomes within the two hybrid lineages are more similar than those of the shared A1 parent between the two lineages, showing that expression patterns of the parental genomes homogenized within a lineage. However, as genes that display differential parental expression in planta do not typically display the same pattern in vitro, we conclude that sub-genome-specific responses occur in both lineages. Overall, our study uncovers the genomic and transcriptomic plasticity during evolution of the filamentous fungal hybrid V. longisporum and illustrate its adaptive potential. ImportanceVerticillium is a genus of plant-associated fungi that include a handful of plant pathogens that collectively affect a wide range of hosts. On several occasions, haploid Verticillium species hybridized into the stable allodiploid species Verticillium longisporum, which is, in contrast to haploid Verticillium species, a Brassicaceae specialist. Here, we studied the evolutionary genome and transcriptome dynamics of V. longisporum and the impact of the hybridization. V. longisporum genomes display a mosaic structure due do genomic rearrangements between the parental chromosome sets. Similar to other allopolyploid hybrids, V. longisporum displays an ongoing loss of heterozygosity and a more relaxed gene evolution. Also, differential parental gene expression is observed, with an enrichment for genes that encode secreted proteins. Intriguingly, the majority of these genes displays sub-genome-specific responses under differential growth conditions. In conclusion, hybridization has incited the genomic and transcriptomic plasticity that enables adaptation to environmental changes in a parental allele-specific fashion.","output":"The interspecific fungal hybrid Verticillium longisporum displays sub-genome-specific gene expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza is a contagious acute respiratory disease caused by the influenza virus infection. Hemagglutinin (HA) is an important target in the therapeutic treatment and diagnostic detection of the influenza virus. Influenza A virus encompasses several different HA subtypes with different strains, which are constantly changing. In this study, we identified a fully human H1N1 neutralizing antibody (32D6) via an Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B cell-based technology. 32D6 specifically neutralizes the clinically isolated H1N1 strains after the 2009 pandemic but not the earlier strains. The epitope was identified through X-ray crystallographic analysis of the 32D6-Fab/HA1 complex structure, which revealed a unique loop conformation located on the top surface of HA. The major region is composed of two peptide segments (residues 172C177 and 206C213), which form an abreast loop conformation. The residue T262 between the two loops forms a conformational epitope for recognition by 32D6. Three water molecules were observed at the interface of HA and the heavy chain, and they may constitute a stabilizing element for the 32D6-HA association. In addition, each 32D6-Fab is likely capable of blocking one HA trimer.

In the civilian domain, it can provide quantitative evidence to investigate urban mobility and traffic patterns in cities. Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can help in detecting vehicles in (almost) all weather conditions and during the day and night. In this study, the capability of SAR StripMap imaging mode data to monitor traffic is analyzed using the case study of Wuhan, China. In ordinary times, the bridges crossing the Yangtze river are the key infrastructure allowing for urban mobility inWuhan. More recently, the city has been the first in the world to be put in lockdown due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Using a very long time series of 294 COSMO-SkyMed StripMap HIMAGE mode scenes collected from 2011 to 2020, we detected vehicles on seven bridges, estimated their speed, and analyzed the traffic pattern over time. Vehicles are detected based on their azimuth shift caused by their across-track motion. Our goal is to monitor the variations in traffic instead of single-car detection. The results from 2011 to 2019 show a general increase in the number of vehicles crossing the bridges, as new infrastructure was built over the years. Variations in detected vehicle numbers were especially found during the two events of the 7th International Military Sports Council (CISM) Military World Games in October 2019, and the COVID-19 lockdown in early 2020. These events were therefore used for internal validation of our assessment of traffic patterns. On the other side, TomTom traffic index data were used for external validation. The results and their comparison with TomTom data prove the effectiveness of our method in detecting traffic patterns, but also demonstrate that mostly large vehicles (e.g., trucks or buses) are detected.

Telemedicine has been shown to reliably extend pediatric intensivist expertise to facilities where expertise is limited. If reliable, telemedicine may extend the reach of pediatric respiratory therapists (RTs) to facilities where expertise does not exist or free up existing RT resources for important face-to-face activities in facilities where expertise is limited. The aim of this study was to determine how well respiratory assessments for ventilated neonates and children correlated when performed simultaneously by 2 RTs face-to-face and via telemedicine. METHODS We conducted a pilot study including 40 assessments by 16 RTs on 11 subjects (5 neonatal ICU; 6 pediatric ICU). Anonymously completed intake forms by 2 different RTs concurrently assessing 14 ventilator-derived and patient-based respiratory variables were used to determine correlations. RESULTS Forty paired assessments were performed. Median telemedicine assessment time was 8 min. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was used to determine agreement between continuous data, and the Cohen kappa statistics were used for binary variables. Pressure control, PEEP, breathing frequency, and FIO2 perfectly correlated (r = 1, all P < .001) as did the presence of a CO2 monitor and need for increased ventilatory support (kappa = 1). The Pearson correlation coefficient for VT, minute ventilation, mean airway pressure, and oxygen saturation ranged from 0.84 to 0.97 (all P < .001). kappa = 0.41 (95% CI 0.02-0.80) for patient-triggered breaths, and kappa = 0.57 (95% CI 0.19-0.94) for breathing frequency higher than set frequency. kappa = -0.25 (95% CI -0.46 to -0.04) for need for suctioning. CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine technology was acceptable to RTs. Telemedicine evaluations highly correlated with face-to-face for 10 of 14 aspects of standard bedside respiratory assessment.

METHODS: Expression levels of PDCD1 mRNA encoded by haplotypes were investigated by quantitative PCR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Flow cytometry was used to detect PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1. RESULTS: The frequency of IFNL4 rs12979860 C/T or T/T genotypes was significantly higher in patients with HCV-related diseases than blood donors (P<0.0001). Patients expressing the IFN&#955;4 variant with one amino acid change that reduces IFN&#955;4 secretion was found increased in frequency in HCV-related diseases compared to HCC. PDCD1 mRNA levels in HCC tissue were significantly higher in cases carrying the PD-1.3 A or the PD-1.7 G allele (P=0.0025 and P=0.0167). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between PD-1.3 and IFNL4 was found in patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) only (LD=0 in HCC; LD=72 in MC). PBMCs of MC patients expressed low levels of PD-L1 in CD19+IgM+ B cells and of PD-1 in CD4+ T cells suggesting the involvement of regulatory B-T cell interaction to the pathogenesis of MC.

Whereas larger rebates can partially offset increases in list prices for insurers, patient out-of-pocket costs may be directly associated with list prices for individuals without insurance and indirectly associated with list prices for individuals with insurance through deductibles or coinsurance. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between rebates and patient out-of-pocket costs and whether this association differs by coverage type (ie, Medicare, commercial, or uninsured) and before and after 2014. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) combined with pricing data for single-source branded drugs from SSR Health from 2007 through 2018. The study was conducted among a nationally representative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian US population. Included individuals were respondents to MEPS with at least 1 prescription for a single-source branded drug who were covered by Medicare or commercial insurance or were uninsured during an entire year. Data analyses were conducted from August 2019 through March 2021. EXPOSURES: Estimated rebate size. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Out-of-pocket costs per prescription were calculated, adjusting for year and drug. RESULTS: Among 38 131 individuals with at least 1 prescription, the mean age was 54 years (95% CI, 54 to 55 years), with 22 044 women (57.8%) and 29 086 White individuals (76.3%). The sample included 444 unique drugs with a survey-weighted total of 4.7 billion prescriptions. Estimated mean (SE) rebates increased from $34 ($1) per prescription in 2007 to $374 ($9) per prescription in 2018. The rebate sizes were associated with statistically significant mean out-of-pocket increases per branded prescription of $4 (95% CI, $4 to $4) from 2007 to 2013 and $11 (95% CI, $10 to $12) from 2014 to 2018. From 2014 to 2018, rebate sizes were associated with statistically significant mean increases in out-of-pocket costs per prescription of $13 (95% CI, $12 to $13) for individuals with Medicare, $6 (95% CI, $6 to $7) for individuals with commercial insurance, and $39 (95% CI, $34 to $44) for individuals without insurance. After adjusting for list prices, there was no association between rebates and out-of-pocket costs, with a change from 2014 to 2018 of ?$0.01 (95% CI, ?$0.04 to $0.02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that drug manufacturers may have provided larger rebates to insurers primarily by increasing list prices and that individuals without insurance had greater cost increases. The results emphasize the need for policy solutions that decouple list prices and out-of-pocket costs.","output":"Association of Branded Prescription Drug Rebate Size and Patient Out-of-Pocket Costs in a Nationally Representative Sample, 2007-2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human activated T lymphocytes expressing class II molecules are able to present only complex antigens that bind to their own surface receptors, and thus can be captured, internalized, and processed through the class II major histocompatibility complex processing pathway.

Although such studies are rarely undertaken for parasites, they can be highly revealing because of the parasite's coevolutionary relationships with hosts. Modes of reproduction and transmission are thought to be strong determinants of genomic diversity for parasites and vary widely among microsporidia (fungal-related intracellular parasites), which are known to have high intraspecific genetic diversity and interspecific variation in genome architecture. Here we explore genomic variation in the microsporidium Hamiltosporidium, a parasite of the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna, looking especially at which factors contribute to nucleotide variation. Genomic samples from 18 Eurasian populations and a new, long-read based reference genome were used to determine the roles that reproduction mode, transmission mode and geography play in determining population structure and demographic history. We demonstrate two main H. tvaerminnensis lineages and a pattern of isolation-by-distance, but note an absence of congruence between these two parasite lineages and the two Eurasian host lineages. We suggest a comparatively recent parasite spread through Northern Eurasian host populations after a change from vertical to mixed-mode transmission and the loss of sexual reproduction. While gaining knowledge about the ecology and evolution of this focal parasite, we also identify common features that shape variation in genomic diversity for many parasites, e.g., distinct modes of reproduction and the intertwining of host-parasite demographies.","output":"Demographic history shapes genomic variation in an intracellular parasite with a wide geographic distribution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microarray data from SARS CoV2 patients helps to construct a gene network relating to this disease.

The present study evaluated parameters of importance for spray drying of siRNA-loaded poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) into nanocomposite microparticles intended for inhalation. The spray drying process was optimised using a statistical design of experiment and by evaluating powder characteristics upon systematic variation of the formulation parameters. Concentration, carbohydrate excipient (trehalose, lactose and mannitol) and the ratio of NP to excipient were varied to monitor the effects on moisture content, particle morphology, particle size and powder yield. The identified optimum conditions were applied for spray drying of siRNA-loaded nanocomposite microparticles, resulting in a product with a low water content (0.78% w/w) and an aerodynamic particle diameter considered suitable for inhalation. The use of mannitol in the formulation allowed a significantly lower moisture content than trehalose and lactose. The inclusion of 50% (w/w) or higher amounts of NPs resulted in a marked change in the surface morphology of the spray-dried particles. Importantly, the integrity and biological activity of the siRNA were preserved during the spray drying process.

The infection now shows devastating impacts on the younger population, who were not previously predicted to be vulnerable, such as in the older population. COVID-19-related complications have been reported in neonates whose mothers were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy, and in children who get infected. Hence, a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 during various developmental stages and placental transmission is essential. Although a connection has not yet been established between exosomal trafficking and the placental transmission of COVID-19, reports indicate that SARS-CoV-2 components may be trafficked between cells through exosomes. As the infection spreads, the transcriptome of cells is drastically perturbed, e.g., through the severe upregulation of several immune-related genes. Consequently, a major outcome of COVID-19 is an elevated immune response and the detection of viral RNA transcripts in host tissue. In this direction, this review focuses on SARS-CoV-2 virology, its in utero transmission from infected pregnant mothers to fetuses, SARS-CoV-2 and exosomal cellular trafficking, transcriptomic impacts, and RNA-mediated therapeutics against COVID-19.

METHODS: We present OASIS +, a variant of the Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS) in which an ensemble of 200 decision trees is used to predict in-hospital mortality based on the 10 same clinical variables in OASIS.

STUDY METHOD: Multivariable, survey-weighted linear regression models were used to examine associations between explanatory variables (i.e., household structure and number of children) and outcome variables (mental distress in April and change in mental distress), measured via the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-4. RESULTS: In adjusted models, each additional child under the age of 12 was associated with lower mental distress in April 2020 (? = -.30, p = .002). Having children aged 13 to 18 and household structure were not significantly associated with mental distress. In interaction models, living with children only was associated with decreased mental distress among individuals reporting low income (interaction ? = -1.28, p = .016) but not high income. Similarly, living with children only was associated with decreased mental distress in females (interaction ? = -1.09, p = .025) but not males.

Here, we analyze 346 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from samples collected between 20 February and 15 March 2020 from infected patients in Washington State, USA. We found that the large majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections sampled during this time frame appeared to have derived from a single introduction event into the state in late January or early February 2020 and subsequent local spread, indicating cryptic spread of COVID-19 before active community surveillance was implemented. We estimate a common ancestor of this outbreak clade as occurring between 18 January and 9 February 2020. From genomic data, we estimate an exponential doubling between 2.4 and 5.1 days.

The popular media portrayal of the human benefits of pet ownership is often biased and overstated, oftentimes creating unrealistic expectations for pet owners. There is evidence that pets can be beneficial to the health and well-being of their owners in certain circumstances; however, there is also evidence that negative or ambivalent relationships between owners and pets can be a detriment to owner well-being, as well as a risk for shelter relinquishment (i.e., surrender) of the pet. Relinquishment due to adverse scenarios like the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may increase rates of shelter euthanasia of adoptable pets. In this study we identify the unique difficulties related to caring for pets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pet owners reported concerns related to pets, humans, and the entire household or family, inclusive of people and pets. Data from this study indicate that strength of the owners attachment to their pet, as well as their economic resources, and the characteristics of their household are associated with the types of concerns expressed. We discuss implications for human well-being and pet welfare, and the need to address these issues in order to prevent shelter relinquishment. ABSTRACT: Pets may be a positive presence for their owners during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, it is pertinent to identify the hardships associated with pet ownership. We conducted a large-scale survey of U.S. pet owners (n = 2254) in spring and summer 2020 to assess the ways that relationships with pets impacted life during COVID-19. We used thematic analysis to analyze 3671 open-ended responses to three prompts. Reported concerns fell into three major categories: (1) pet-focused (meeting needs of pets; procuring supplies; accessing veterinary care; new and emerging behavioral issues; fate of the pet if owner becomes ill; general safety and well-being), (2) human-focused (issues with working from home; well-being and mental health; balancing responsibilities), and (3) household-focused (disease spread; economic issues). Quantitative analyses showed that the owners strength of attachment to their pet, economic resources, and relationship status were associated with the types of concerns expressed. Results from this study indicate that pet owners experienced unique hardships related to changes in everyday life from the COVID-19 pandemic. These hardships should be considered alongside the potential benefits found in other studies in order to manage pet owner expectations, prevent pet relinquishment, and more fully understand multifaceted human-companion animal relationships.","output":"The Concerns, Difficulties, and Stressors of Caring for Pets during COVID-19: Results from a Large Survey of U.S. Pet Owners"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Though primarily a pulmonary disease, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus can generate devastating disease states that affect multiple organ systems including the central nervous system (CNS). The various neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 range in severity from mild symptoms such as headache, or myalgias to more severe symptoms such as stroke, psychosis, and anosmia. While some of the COVID-19 associated neurological complications are mild and reversible, a significant number of patients suffer from stroke. Studies have shown that COVID-19 infection triggers a wave of inflammatory cytokines that induce endothelial cell dysfunction and generate coagulopathy that increases the risk of stroke or thromboses. Inflammation of the endothelium following infection may also destabilize atherosclerotic plaque and induce thrombotic stroke. Although uncommon, there have also been reports of hemorrhagic stroke associated with COVID-19. The proposed mechanisms include a blood pressure increase caused by infection leading to a reduction in angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) levels that results in an imbalance of the renin-angiotensin system ultimately manifesting inflammation and vasoconstriction. Coagulopathy, as demonstrated by elevated prothrombin time (PT), has also been posited as a factor contributing to hemorrhagics stroke in patients with COVID-19. Other neurological conditions associated with COVID-19 include encephalopathy, anosmia, encephalitis, psychosis, brain fog, headache, depression, and anxiety. Though there are several hypotheses reported in the literature, a unifying pathophysiological mechanism of many of these disorders remains unclear. Pulmonary dysfunction leading to poor oxygenation of the brain may explain encephalopathy and other disorders in COVID-19 patients. Alternatively, a direct invasion of the CNS by the virus or breach of the blood-brain barrier by the systemic cytokines released during infection may be responsible for these conditions. Notwithstanding, the relationship between the inflammatory cytokine levels and conditions such as depression and anxiety is contradictory and perhaps the social isolation during the pandemic may in part be a contributing factor to some of the reported CNS disorders. OBJECTIVE In this article, we review the current literature pertaining to some of the most significant and common neurological disorders such as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, encephalopathy, encephalitis, brain fog, Long COVID, headache, Guillain-Barre syndrome, depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders in the setting of COVID-19. We summarize some of the most relevant literature to provide a better understanding of the mechanistic details regarding these disorders in order to help physicians monitor and treat patients for significant COVID-19 associated neurologic impairments.

Articles such as case reports, case series, and cohort studies were included as references. No language restrictions were enforced. In the case of anxiety and depression, attempts were made to focus mainly on articles describing these conditions in infected patients. RESULTS A total of 112 articles were reviewed.

The most widely used vision assistance apps are magnifier apps. It is still largely unknown what the apps are used for. Lack of insight into the visual needs of individuals with visual impairment is a hurdle for the development of more effective assistive technologies. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate how needs for visual aids may vary with social activities, by observing the changes in the usage of a smartphone magnifier app when many users take breaks from work. METHODS: The number of launches of the SuperVision Magnifier app was determined retrospectively from 2018 to 2020 from among active users worldwide. The fluctuation in app usage was examined by comparing weekday vs weekend periods, Christmas and new year vs nonholiday seasons, and COVID-19 lockdowns vs the easing of restriction during the pandemic. RESULTS: On average, the app was used 262,466 times by 38,237 users each month in 2020 worldwide. There were two major trough points on the timeline of weekly app usage, one aligned with the COVID-19 lockdowns in April 2020 and another aligned with the Christmas and new year week in 2018 and 2019. The app launches declined by 6947 (11% decline; P<.001) during the lockdown and by 5212 (9% decline; P=.001) during the holiday weeks. There was no significant decline during March to May 2019. App usage compensated for seasonal changes was 8.6% less during weekends than during weekdays (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The need for vision assistance technology was slightly lower during breaks and lockdowns, probably because the activities at home were different and less visually demanding.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical features, laboratory abnormalities, and rates of survival and intensive care unit admission in 551 patients with COVID\\\\19, hospitalized between 1 March 2020, and 31 May 2020 at a tertiary care academic medical center. Hepatic jaundice was defined as a serum total bilirubin concentration >2.5 mg/dL and a direct bilirubin concentration >0.3 mg/dL that was >25% of the total. Liver injury was characterized as cholestatic, mixed, or hepatocellular at the time of peak serum total bilirubin concentration by calculating the R factor. RESULTS: Hepatic jaundice was present in 49 (8.9%) patients and associated with a mortality rate of 40.8% and intensive care unit admission rate of 69.4%, both significantly higher than for patients without jaundice. Jaundiced patients had an increased frequency of fever, leukopenia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, hypoxemia, elevated serum creatinine concentration, elevated serum procalcitonin concentration, and sepsis.

Here, we focus on zinc deficiency symptoms, symptom overlap with other conditions, as well as zinc effects on immune health and mechanistic zinc deficiency risk groups. There are well-studied beneficial effects of zinc on the immune system including a decreased susceptibility to and improved clinical outcomes for infectious pathogens including multiple viruses. Zinc is also an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress agent, relevant to some severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms. Unfortunately, zinc deficiency is common worldwide and not exclusive to the developing world. Lifestyle choices and preexisting conditions alone can result in zinc deficiency, and we compile zinc risk groups based on a review of the literature.

Zinc is being considered as prophylactic or adjunct therapy for COVID-19, with 12 clinical trials underway, highlighting the relevance of this trace element for global pandemics. Using the example of zinc, we show that there is a critical need for a deeper understanding of essential trace elements in human health, and the resulting deficiency symptoms and their overlap with other conditions.

Decreased lung function results in less elastic lung tissue, reduced chest wall compliance, reduced area for gas exchange, and even a variety of chronic diseases. Traditional Chinese health exercise (TCHE) has three components: breath regulation, body regulation, and heart regulation, which play an important role in the improvement of lung function. However, which component has the most significant effect on lung functioning remains unclear. Therefore, depending on the modality of conditioning, TCHEs will be divided into three exercise intervention groups: breath regulation group, body regulation group, and heart regulation group, in order to explore the magnitude of the effect of the different modalities of conditioning on the improvement of lung function. METHODS: The prospective, parallel, single-blind, randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of different conditioning methods of TCHE on lung function in middle-aged and elderly people. The study subjects are healthy middle-aged and elderly adults, who will be randomly divided into the breath regulation group, body regulation group, heart regulation group, and control group. The control group will receive health education. Health education and exercise intervention in the three intervention groups will be provided for 6 months, 5 times a week, with each session lasting 60 min. The outcomes of interest include changes in the pulmonary function tests measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after the beginning of the intervention. The primary outcome is the forced vital capacity (FVC), while the secondary outcomes include forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FVC/FEV1 ratio, vital capacity (VC), and maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV). DISCUSSION: This study will assess the effects of different conditioning methods of TCHE on lung function in middle-aged and elderly people. The final findings of this study will validate the effectiveness and safety of TCHE on lung function interventions in middle-aged and elderly people.

However, the persistence of immune responses in the long term is not known yet. This study aimed to evaluate humoral immune responses in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients over 6 months and to analyze the effects of the booster dose. METHODS Humoral immune responses of PD patients were measured after initial SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations and after 6 months following initial vaccinations. Immune responses were compared between patients who received and did not receive booster doses. PD patients were compared with 41 hemodialysis (HD) patients and 61 healthy controls. Humoral immune responses were measured by a commercial test that detects antibodies toward the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS Twenty PD patients were evaluated over 6 months. The initial seropositivity rate was 90.9% with inactivated vaccine and 100% with mRNA vaccine. Seropositivity decreased to 44.4% after 6 months, and a booster dose helped in maintaining the 100% of seropositivity (p = 0.005). Magnitude of humoral response at the 6th month was also higher in patients who received the third dose (1,132.8  769.6 AU/mL vs. 400.0  294.6 AU/mL; p = 0.015). Among patients who did not receive the third dose, those who got mRNA vaccine could maintain higher seropositivity than others who got inactivated vaccine (75% vs. 40% for PD, 81.8% vs. 50% for HD). Seropositivity and antibody levels were similar for PD and HD patients after 6 months (p = 0.24 and 0.56) but lower than healthy controls (p = 0.0013). CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced antibody levels and seropositivity of PD patients significantly fall after 6 months. A booster dose after around 3 months following initial immunization might help in maintaining seropositivity.","output":"Waning of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine-Induced Immune Response over 6 Months in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients and the Role of a Booster Dose in Maintaining Seropositivity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical, laboratory and treatment characteristics of COVID-19 patients and to determine the factors associated with mortality during hospital stay. Materials and Methods: Retrospective cohort study of adult COVID-19 inpatients. The clinical, laboratory and treatment data were obtained from the medical records of patients from the Hospital Nivel III Daniel Alcides Carrin in Tacna. For the survival analysis we used the Cox proportional hazards model, and we calculated crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: We evaluated 351 patients; 74.1% of them were men. The most common comorbidities were obesity (31.6%), hypertension (27.1%) and diabetes mellitus (24.5%). The median time of hospitalization was 8 days (IQR: 4-15). From the total of patients, 32.9% died during follow-up. The multivariate analysis showed an increased risk of dying associated with the following: age 65 years, HR = 3.55 (95% CI: 1.70-7.40); increase in lactate dehydrogenase >720 U/L, HR = 2.08 (95% CI: 1.34-3.22); and oxygen saturation less than 90%, mainly when it was less than 80%, HR = 4.07 (95% CI: 2.10-7.88).

DESIGN Living systematic review and network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Multiple databases including grey literature sources were searched up to February 2019. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials examining the effectiveness of any treatment in patients with both insertional and/or midportion Achilles tendinopathy. We excluded trials with 10 or fewer participants per treatment arm or trials investigating tendon ruptures. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise the certainty of evidence. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE The validated patient-reported Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles questionnaire. RESULTS 29 trials investigating 42 different treatments were included. 22 trials (76%) were at high risk of bias and 7 (24%) had some concerns. Most trials included patients with midportion tendinopathy (86%). Any treatment class seemed superior to wait-and-see for midportion Achilles tendinopathy at 3 months (very low to low certainty of evidence). At 12 months, exercise therapy, exercise+injection therapy and exercise+night splint therapy were all comparable with injection therapy for midportion tendinopathy (very low to low certainty). No network meta-analysis could be performed for insertional Achilles tendinopathy. SUMMARY/CONCLUSION In our living network meta-analysis no trials were at low risk of bias and there was large uncertainty in the comparative estimates. For midportion Achilles tendinopathy, wait-and-see is not recommended as all active treatments seemed superior at 3-month follow-up. There seems to be no clinically relevant difference in effectiveness between different active treatments at either 3-month or 12-month follow-up. As exercise therapy is easy to prescribe, can be of low cost and has few harms, clinicians could consider starting treatment with a calf-muscle exercise programme.

The aggressive behavior of this group of tumors justifies the need for a multidisciplinary team to assist in clinical decisions during the current pandemic. Brazil is now ranked #2 in the number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 pandemic, and existing disparities in the treatment of neuro-oncology patients in Brazil will challenge the clinical and surgical decisions of this population, possibly affecting global survival. Objective: To search the literature about the management of glioblastomas during COVID-19 pandemic to guide surgical and clinical decisions in this population of patients in Brazil. Methods: We performed a systematic search on the PubMed electronic database targeting consensus statements concerning glioblastoma approaches during COVID-19 pandemic up to July 18, 2020. Results: When approaching glioblastoma during the COVID-19 pandemic, important parameters that help in the decision-making process are age, performance status, tumor molecular profile, and patient consent. Younger patients should follow the standard protocol after maximal safe resection, mainly those with MGMT methylated tumors. Aged and underperforming patients should be carefully evaluated, and probably a monotherapy scheme is to be considered. Centers are advised to engage in telemedicine and to elaborate means to reduce local infection.

Its causative virus, is a novel strain of RNA viruses with high mortality rate. There is no definitive treatment, but among available approaches the use of recovered patients' plasma containing specific antibodies can enhance the immune response against coronavirus. However, the dearth of eligible donors and also ABO incompatibility in plasma transfusion, have limited this therapeutic method. Therefore, it is highly desirable to introduce a simple procedure that allows efficient reduction or even removal of natural ABO antibodies. Accordingly, we aimed to evaluate a RBC-mediated adsorption technique that reduces the titer of the mentioned antibodies in plasma. METHODS/MATERIALS: This experimental study was conducted in Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran. The pre- and post-incubation antibody titers of 168 plasma samples were determined. For incubation, each plasma sample was exposed (60 min) to different percentages of RBCs at room temperature or 4 C. RESULTS: The results evidenced that both the concentration of RBCs and temperature had significant decreasing effects on antibody titer (P < 0.001) and all concentrations significantly reduced titer. Compared to RT, 4 C further reduced the antibody titer. Overall, the best incubation condition for reducing antibody titer in all blood groups was 4 C and 2% RBCs concentration. CONCLUSION: The presented adsorption procedure is able to produce universal plasma (we call it Ubiquitous Convalescent Plasma) with a non-immunogenic level of ABO mismatch antibodies which can be used for COVID-19 patients with any type of blood group with desirable simplicity, feasibility, and efficacy.","output":"Ubiquitous convalescent plasma: An artificial universal plasma for COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents the findings of a user study conducted at a company, a global leader in its industry, in order to engage experts by experience in the research and development of the company's future products.

Here, we report outcomes and risk factors for serious disease in patients with multiple myeloma treated at five large academic centers in New York City in the spring of 2020, during which it was a global epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Of 100 patients with multiple myeloma (male 58%; median age 68) diagnosed with COVID-19, 75 were admitted; of these, 13 patients (17%) were placed on invasive mechanical ventilation, and 22 patients (29%) expired. Of the 25 nonadmitted patients, 4 were asymptomatic. There was a higher risk of adverse outcome (intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, or death) in Hispanics/Latinos (n = 21), OR = 4.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.3C16.7), and African American Blacks (n = 33), OR = 3.5 (1.1C11.5), as compared with White patients (n = 36).

We compared the effects of the preadmission use of antidiabetic medications on the in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 having type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science databases was performed to include studies (except case reports and review articles) published until November 30, 2021. We excluded papers regarding in-hospital use of antidiabetic medications. We used a random-effects meta-analysis to calculate the pooled OR (95% CI) and performed a sensitivity analysis to confirm the robustness of the meta-analyses. MAIN FINDINGS: We included 61 studies (3,061,584 individuals), which were rated as having low risk of bias. The OR (95% CI) indicated some medications protective against COVID-related death, including metformin [0.54 (0.47C0.62), I(2) 86%], glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) [0.51 (0.37C0.69), I(2) 85%], and sodiumCglucose transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) [0.60 (0.40C0.88), I(2) 91%]. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) [1.23 (1.07C1.42), I(2) 82%] and insulin [1.70 (1.33C2.19), I(2) 97%] users were more likely to die during hospitalization. Sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitor were mortality neutral [0.92 (95% CI 0.83C1.01, I(2) 44%), 0.90 (95% CI 0.71C1.14, I(2) 46%), and 0.61 (95% CI 0.26C1.45, I(2) 77%), respectively]. The sensitivity analysis indicated that our findings were robust. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin, GLP-1RA, and SGLT-2i were associated with lower mortality rate in patients with COVID-19 having type 2 diabetes. DPP-4i and insulin were linked to increased mortality. Sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors were mortality neutral.

Thus, alternatives to antibiotics are essential for reasons associated with both safety and cost-effectiveness. Underutilized plant sources need to be developed to replace antibiotics in broiler feed. Several feed resources have been introduced so far, but they have yet to be applied widely. Date pits are a major by-product of the date industry (6C8%) and have the potential antioxidant to replace antibiotics. In this study, fresh date pits were degraded using the mold Trichoderma reesei under solid-state degradation (SSD), resulting in degraded date pits (DDP). A total of 180 Brazilian Cobb 500 broiler chicks were divided into six feed treatments in triplicate groups. The treatments were corn-soy basal diet (positive control; C+), corn-soy + 20% oxytetracycline at 0.05% (negative control; CC), corn-soy + 10% DDP, corn-soy + 0.2% mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS), corn-soy + 0.1% mannose, and corn-soy + 0.2% mannose. The antioxidant and biochemical effects of DDP, MOS, and mannose were determined in the blood serum, liver, and intestine of broilers at age 21 and 42 days. The results indicated that the contents of antioxidants such as flavonoids and phenolics, as well as the MOS content in DDP, were increased by the degradation process. Additionally, mannose, glucose, arabinose, rhamnose, and glucuronic acid were significantly increased in DDP after degradation. The activity of antioxidant enzymes (GPxglutathione peroxidase, catalase, and SODsuperoxide dismutase) in the serum, liver, and intestine of broilers fed with diets containing 10% DDP and 0.2% MOS was increased significantly compared to the control group. Malondialdehyde activity was decreased, whereas the mean corpuscular hemoglobin level and the iron content were significantly upregulated in the broilers fed with 10% DDP, 0.1% mannose, and 0.2% MOS diets compared with the control. Thus, DDP can be used to improve the antioxidant status and has a prebiotic-like effect in broiler chicken performance.","output":"Effect of Trichoderma reesei Degraded Date Pits on Antioxidant Enzyme Activities and Biochemical Responses of Broiler Chickens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has simultaneously increased the need for mental health services and decreased their availability.

Many safety measures were implemented to provide services to patients during the pandemic. However, the impact of these measures on the experiences of lung cancer surgery patients, FCGs, and their healthcare team is not well known. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to describe the changes and experiences with surgical care delivery from the patient, FCG, and surgical team perspectives. Methods: This mixed methods study included healthcare professionals, lung cancer surgery patients, and their FCGs from an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Data was collected between September 2020 through February 2021 using the Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patients' Assets, Risks, and Experiences survey (patients and FCGs only). Key informant interviews with patients, FCGs, and surgical team were also conducted. Patients/FCGs were recruited from a randomized efficacy trial of a multimedia self-management intervention in lung cancer surgery. Qualitative data was analyzed using the conventional content analysis approach and demographic descriptive statistics for patients/FCGs were determined through baseline surveys from the randomized trial. Results: Our study participants (n=56) were predominantly English speaking (91%), non-Hispanic White (68%), Asian (14%), and Black (7%) lung cancer surgery patients/FCGs. Most participants achieved more than a high school diploma (77%), 33% were employed full-time, and 50% used Medicare. Providers (n=4) included a nurse practitioner and thoracic surgeons. We identified 5 constructs that were associated with cancer care delivery from perioperative to discharge: 1) increased diagnostic testing-COVID-19 test;2) visitor restrictions increased patients/FCGs mental health distress and decreased provider-FCG shared-decision making;3) communication barriers decreased for patients/FCGs due to use of telehealth resources (i.e., Hope Virtual, WhatsApp, FaceTime) which increased frequency of provider engagement throughout care continuum;4) patients/FCGs concerns and lack of education of COVID-19 risk factors impacted postoperative recovery;and 5) COVD-19 elevated the use and need for including telemedicine in standard of care practices. Moreover, patients experienced delays in treatment, isolation, lack of social support, financial hardship, and fear of death from COVID-19. FCGs also experienced psychological distress, financial hardship, fear of contracting COVID-19, and a heightened awareness of public health safety measures. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic created challenges to the cancer care delivery landscape for the surgical team and impacted the psychological and financial well-being of lung cancer surgery patients and their FCGs. While the long-term effects of the pandemic is unknown, opportunities to improve patient/FCG quality of life outcomes through targeted mental health/financial toxicity interventions is warranted.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on care delivery and quality of life in lung cancer surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diagnostic error is a global patient safety priority. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the incidence, origins and avoidable harm of diagnostic errors in English general practice. Diagnostic errors were defined as missed opportunities to make a correct or timely diagnosis based on the evidence available (missed diagnostic opportunities, MDOs). METHOD: Retrospective medical record reviews identified MDOs in 21 general practices. In each practice, two trained general practitioner reviewers independently conducted case note reviews on 100 randomly selected adult consultations performed during 2013C2014. Consultations where either reviewer identified an MDO were jointly reviewed. RESULTS: Across 2057 unique consultations, reviewers agreed that an MDO was possible, likely or certain in 89 cases or 4.3% (95% CI 3.6% to 5.2%) of reviewed consultations. Inter-reviewer agreement was higher than most comparable studies (Fleiss kappa=0.63). Sixty-four MDOs (72%) had two or more contributing process breakdowns. Breakdowns involved problems in the patientCpractitioner encounter such as history taking, examination or ordering tests (main or secondary factor in 61 (68%) cases), performance and interpretation of diagnostic tests (31; 35%) and follow-up and tracking of diagnostic information (43; 48%). 37% of MDOs were rated as resulting in moderate to severe avoidable patient harm. CONCLUSIONS: Although MDOs occurred in fewer than 5% of the investigated consultations, the high numbers of primary care contacts nationally suggest that several million patients are potentially at risk of avoidable harm from MDOs each year. Causes of MDOs were frequently multifactorial, suggesting the need for development and evaluation of multipronged interventions, along with policy changes to support them.","output":"Incidence, origins and avoidable harm of missed opportunities in diagnosis: longitudinal patient record review in 21 English general practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Changing gloves more frequently is encouraged, more now than ever given the COVID-19 pandemic. When the donning process has moisture introduced, however, complications can arise, which consumes vital time. Most commonly, gloves undergo a chlorination treatment to reduce glove tack, allowing easier donning. To assess the effects of different chlorination strengths and glove thicknesses on donning, acrylonitrile butadiene gloves were manufactured at two different thicknesses (0.05 and 0.10 mm) with 4 different chlorination treatments: 0, 500, 1000 and 2000 ppm. Six participants were used to assess the time taken to don each of the glove sets with dry and wet hands (16 tests in total). Overall, the thicker gloves took longer to don, due to differences in the material stiffness hindering the donning process. The quickest performance from the chlorinated gloves was noted in the 1000 and 2000 ppm concentrations. Wet conditions also showed significant increases in the donning time.Practitioners Summary: The study was conducted based on the gaps identified in previous literature reviews which revealed the requirement for a greater understanding of glove donning process. It was found a stronger chlorination was detrimental when the hands were wet, but better when dry. Thicker gloves were also found to be detrimental.

The purpose of this review was to analyse clinical trials regarding vitamins and supplements for the treatment of COVID-19 infections. METHODS: Articles were identified through a literature search utilizing online databases and bibliographic review. RESULTS: A total of seven articles were identified for review. All articles evaluated the use of vitamins and supplements for the treatment of COVID-19. Drug therapies included oral vitamin D, intravenous and oral vitamin C, oral vitamin D/magnesium/vitamin B12, oral zinc, oral combination zinc/ascorbic acid, and intravenous alpha-lipoic acid. The end points of each study varied, including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, mortality, rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, negativity of COVID-19 tests, oxygen requirements, and symptom burden. CONCLUSION: Of the vitamins and supplements that were studied, vitamin D presented the most promising data demonstrating significant decreases in oxygen requirements, need for ICU treatment, SARS-CoV-2 RNA test positivity, and mortality. All of these benefits were exhibited in hospitalized patients. Other vitamins and supplements that were evaluated in studies did not demonstrate any statistically significant benefits.

The data was further age restricted (18-65 years) and a categorical variable was created representing payer plans (Medicaid, Medicare, Other insurance). Data on patients race/ethnicity, comorbidities, treatments administered (Remdesivir and ECMO) and insurance information was analyzed using various exploratory data methods and visualizations. Logistic regression was implemented to model the relationship between variables (dependent/independent) in the cohorts. Model complexity was analyzed using the F test of significance. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Taken as a whole, the data contained over 7 billion rows and around 6.4 million persons (~ 2.15 million of whom were COVID+). The main cohort of individuals with concurrent COVID positivity and ischemic stroke made up around 0.29% of the original COVID+ group, and the payer plan sub-cohort consists of around 29.26% of our main cohort.

With COVID-19 has come unprecedented digital adoption, bringing health care delivery to a critical juncture. While digital tools and technologies present vast opportunities for democratizing and decentralizing care experiences, their piecemeal application to the existing sick care model and its information technology infrastructure will not only limit their value, but will inevitably add cost, inefficiency, and burden to care teams. In order to build upon this momentum and reap the full benefits of practice digitization, care model transformation must occur. This entails holistically reexamining how every component of the health care experience, from the digital tools to visit interactions, synchronizes to address the full continuum of patient needs throughout the journey. By doing this, care shifts away from one-size-fits-all, fragmented strings of visits, toward seamless experiences that adapt to patients needs in real-time while integrating within their daily lives. Rather than acting as a substitute for care, technology instead is vital to promoting and amplifying the impact of all those involved. To achieve this, this paper outlines 10 principles for restructuring care to incorporate digital health capabilities.

Pooled analysis showed that the use of ACEI/ARB was not associated with mortality (OR 0.73 [0.38, 1.40], p = 0.34; I2: 81%) and severity (OR 1.03 [0.73, 1.45], p = 0.87; I2: 65%). Pooled adjusted OR showed no risk/benefit associated with ACEI/ARB use in terms of mortality (OR 0.83 [0.54, 1.27], p = 0.38; I2: 0%). Subgroup analysis showed that the use of ARB was associated with reduced mortality (OR 0.51 [0.29, 0.90], p = 0.02; I2: 22%) but not ACEI subgroup (OR 0.68 [0.39, 1.17], p = 0.16; I2: 0%). Meta-regression showed that the association between ACEI/ARB use and mortality in patients with COVID-19 do not varies by gender (p = 0.104). GRADE showed a very low certainty of evidence for effect of ACEI/ARB on mortality and severity. The certainty of evidence was very low for both ACEI and ARB subgroups. CONCLUSION: Administration of a renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor, was not associated with increased mortality or severity of COVID-19 in patients with hypertension. Specifically, ARB and not ACEI use, was associated with lower mortality.","output":"The use of renin angiotensin system inhibitor on mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The reemergence of avian influenza (H5N1 infection) has heightened concern for a potential human influenza pandemic.

This exceptional context compels us to understand students' experience with online learning. Previous literature identifies relevant factors that intervene in the online education experience and can affect students' academic development. One of the main concerns is the students' mental health, given the lockdown restrictions under which classes have been conducted. Furthermore, the impact of the prolonged lockdown and the pandemic fatigue on university students and their academic experience is still unclear. This study delves into engineering undergraduate students' online education experience during the COVID-19 pandemic and its emotional impact across time. With this aim, a questionnaire was distributed to second, third, and fourth-year engineering undergraduate students at two time points, approximately six months apart. The results show significant differences in students' connection with other students and teachers, workspace conditions, and boredom between time points. Besides, the findings indicate significant correlations between academic development and quality of online classes, adaptation of the course, workspace conditions, and connection with other students and teachers, and also between students' emotions and connection with other students and teachers. Finally, the study identifies best practices carried out during online teaching that will be of value for future courses and engineering education beyond the pandemic situation, amongst which those related to effective communication with teachers stand out.","output":"Academic and emotional effects of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic on engineering students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of the rotational components on quantum circuits, some quantum neural networks based on variational circuits can be considered equivalent to the classical Fourier networks.

Previously described LUS manifestations for COVID-19 include B-lines, consolidations, and pleural thickening. The interrater reliability (IRR) of these findings for COVID-19 is unknown. METHODS: This study was conducted between March and June 2020. Nine physicians (hospitalists: n = 4; emergency medicine: n = 5) from 3 medical centers independently evaluated n = 20 LUS scans (n = 180 independent observations) collected from patients with COVID-19, diagnosed via RT-PCR. These studies were randomly selected from an image database consisting of COVID-19 patients evaluated in the emergency department with portable ultrasound devices. Physicians were blinded to any patient information or previous LUS interpretation. Kappa values (&#954;) were used to calculate IRR. RESULTS: There was substantial IRR on the following items: normal LUS scan (&#954; = 0.79 [95% CI: 0.72-0.87]), presence of B-lines (&#954; = 0.79 [95% CI: 0.72-0.87]), &#8805;3 B-lines observed (&#954; = 0.72 [95% CI: 0.64-0.79]). Moderate IRR was observed for the presence of any consolidation (&#954; = 0.57 [95% CI: 0.50-0.64]), subpleural consolidation (&#954; = 0.49 [95% CI: 0.42-0.56]), and presence of effusion (&#954; = 0.49 [95% CI: 0.41-0.56]). Fair IRR was observed for pleural thickening (&#954; = 0.23 [95% CI: 0.15-0.30]). DISCUSSION: Many LUS manifestations for COVID-19 appear to have moderate to substantial IRR across providers from multiple specialties utilizing differing portable devices. The most reliable LUS findings with COVID-19 may include the presence/count of B-lines or determining if a scan is normal. Clinical protocols for LUS with COVID-19 may require additional observers for the confirmation of less reliable findings such as consolidations.","output":"Interobserver Agreement of Lung Ultrasound Findings of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose To determine predictors associated with caregivers willingness to accept an accelerated regulatory process for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine development. Methods An international cross-sectional survey of 2557 caregivers arriving with their children to 17 pediatric Emergency Departments (ED) across six countries from March 26 to June 30, 2020. Caregivers were asked to select one of four choices they agreed with the most regarding a proposed COVID-19 vaccine approval process, in addition to questions regarding demographics, the ED visit, and attitudes about COVID-19. Univariate analyses were conducted using the Mann-Whitney test for comparing non-normal continuous variables, independent t-test for comparing normally distributed continuous variables, and Chi-square or Fishers exact test for categorical variables. Variables of interest subsequently underwent a multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine independent factors associated with caregivers willingness to accept abridged COVID-19 vaccine development. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Findings Almost half (1101/2557; 43%) of caregivers reported that they are willing to accept less rigorous testing and post-research approval for a new COVID-19 vaccine. Independent factors associated with willingness to expedite COVID-19 vaccine research included children that were up-to-date on their vaccination schedule (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.72, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.29-2.31), caregivers concerned that they had COVID-19 at the time of survey completion in the ED (OR = 1.1, 95% CI 1.05-1.16), and caregivers that intend to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 if a vaccine becomes available (OR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.54-2.21). Mothers completing the survey were less likely to approve changes in the vaccine development process (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.53-0.78). Implications Less than half of caregivers in a global sample are willing to accept abbreviated vaccine testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of an effort to increase acceptance and uptake of the new vaccine, especially in order to protect children, public health strategies and individual providers should understand caregivers attitudes towards approval of the vaccine and consult them appropriately.","output":"Caregivers willingness to accept expedited vaccine research during the COVID-19 pandemic C a cross sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Syphilis and gonorrhea reached an all-time high in 2018. The resurgence of syphilis and gonorrhea requires innovative methods of sexual contact tracing that encourage disclosure of same-sex sexual contacts that might otherwise be suppressed. Over 75% of Grindr mobile phone application users report seeking \\"friendship,\\" so this study asked people diagnosed with syphilis and gonorrhea to identify their friends. METHODS: Patients at the two Baltimore sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics and the Baltimore City Health Department were asked 12 questions to elicit members of their friendship networks before eliciting sexual networks. The study included 353 index cases and 172 friendship contacts, yielding a friendship network of 331 non-isolates (n = 331) and sexual-only network of 140 non-isolates. The data were plotted and analyzed using exponential family random graph analysis. RESULTS: Eliciting respondents' in-person social contacts yielded 12 syphilis cases and 6 gonorrhea cases in addition to the 16 syphilis cases and 4 gonorrhea cases that would have been found with sexual contacts alone. Syphilis is clustered within sexual (odds ratio = 2.2, 95% confidence interval (1.36, 3.66)) and social contacts (OR = 1.31, 95% CI (1.02, 1.68)). Gonorrhea is clustered within reported social (OR = 1.56, 95% CI (1.22, 2.00)) but not sexual contacts (OR = 0.98, 95% CI (0.62, 1.53)). CONCLUSIONS: Eliciting friendship networks of people diagnosed with syphilis and gonorrhea may find members of their sexual networks, drug use networks, or people of similar STI risk. Friendship networks include more diagnosed cases of syphilis and gonorrhea than sexual networks alone, especially among populations with many non-disclosing men who have sex with men (MSM) and women who have sex with women (WSW).

COVID 19 has triggered a boom in the digital education implementation. Those courses that never had been delivered in a digital format, suddenly were forced to be prepared and presented as digital education. The nature of different courses might facilitate this new reality, depending if they are theoretical, numerical or mixed. This paper has evaluated a set of characteristics deployed in different engineering courses transformed into digital courses, depending on its nature. On the other hand, this analysis had a focus on the women participation in engineering courses and their evaluations of such digital course's characteristics. The main purpose of the present paper is to answer the question of what characteristics within the course methodology design, works and are evaluated better by students. A survey was designed and applied to the 87% of the Industrial and Systems Engineering program population in Tecnologico de Monterrey, Sonora Mexico. Data was statistically analyzed to find if there were any difference between female and male opinions about the course characteristics and within each gender in each kind of course. Also, a correlation analysis was made to identify how the elements influenced each other and if they should be combined depending on the desired result. An additional analysis took place to identify the level of participation of female and male students before and during pandemic time. Findings reveal interesting coincidences and differences in evaluating some of those digital course's characteristics depending on the gender of students and course nature, such as women participation and the differences in perception of competitiveness among women and men. Some of these findings are: 1) In mixed subjects, male students identify a higher academic environment that encourages more competitiveness than female students. 2) Another finding is that men seem to have greater motivation to attend class sessions in numerical subjects. 3) Among female students a negative correlation between the frequency of the instructor request of a final reflection analysis of the session with considering a competitiveness academic environment. 4) Talking about mixed courses, all female students evaluated with the highest score in the question about motivation to be present in the session and the identification of moments and activities that allowed them to share opinions.

With drastic changes in the provision of services available in the health sector, so too were medical students provision of learning. With the onslaught of COVID and the need for ongoing learning resources for students, novel methods to maintain adequate surgical patient exposure and student interaction on a platform amenable to the interactive format required was devised using a virtual platform to compliment current pedagogical approaches. METHODS: This was a randomised control trial to evaluate the perceived use of remote learning in place of surgical bedside teaching in the COVID-19 era. Medical students in a regional hospital were recruited and randomised to undergo the bedside teaching in person or receive the teaching virtually through a Xpert eye, smart glasses to facilitate connections remotely. Feedback questionnaires and exit interviews carried out following each session. Content analysis of transcripts was performed to evaluate the presence and quality of perceived learning, benefits and limitations. RESULTS: Feedback demonstrated greater engagement, satisfaction, involvement and learning (p < 0.01) in the bedside teaching group. Content analysis yielded three main themes; Interpersonal content, technological features, and provision of content. Students reported the virtual teaching was an acceptable alternative in the current climate of social distancing and reduced patient access. CONCLUSION: The current pandemic poses a risk to adequate patient exposure to patient centred learning. Teaching sessions received remotely are an acceptable alternative in the current climate of reduced clinical access, however bedside teaching remains the preferred method of learning.","output":"P27 Bedside teaching from a distance; surgical education in the COVID era, a randomised control trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Texas horned lizard ( Phrynosoma cornutum) is a threatened species in Texas, US (federal category C2).

METHODS: Fifty-six consecutive patients with unilateral intracerebral hemorrhage and 38 healthy control subjects were recruited for this study. The Motricity index and the modified Barthel index were used to evaluate motor function of the affected extremities and activity of daily living independence, respectively. The diffusion tensor imaging parameter values for fractional anisotropy (FA) and voxel number (VN) of the CST were determined. Ratios of the ipsilesional to the contralesional CST measures were calculated and are presented as the CST-ratio (FA value and VN). RESULTS: The FA value and VN of the ipsilesional CST and the CST-ratio in the patient group were lower than those of the control group (P<0.05). There was a strong positive correlation between the Motricity index score of the affected extremities and the modified Barthel index score (P<0.05), while the FA value and VN of the ipsilesional CST and the CST-ratio showed moderate and strong positive correlations with the Motricity index and modified Barthel index scores, respectively (P<0.05). In addition, the VN of the ipsilesional CST showed excellent utility as a classifier, whereas the FA value of the ipsilesional CST and the FA value and VN of the CST-ratio showed good classifier utility (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that impairment of activity of daily living independency was closely related to the injury severity of the ipsilesional CST in patients with chronic intracerebral hemorrhage. In addition, the injury severity of the ipsilesional CST can be used to classify the degree of activity of daily living independency.

The importance of proper cell culture for successful PEDV propagation and maintenance of disease phenotype are addressed in our survey of permissive cell lines. We also highlight areas of particular relevance to PEDV pathogenesis and disease that have benefited from reverse genetics studies and pressing questions that await resolution by such studies. In particular, we examine the spike protein as a determinant of viral tropism, entry and virulence, ORF3 and its association with cell culture adaptation, and the nucleocapsid protein and its potential role in modulating PEDV pathogenicity.

Here, a new all-fiber Fresnel reflection microfluidic biosensor (FRMB) was constructed through combining all-fiber optical system, microfluidic chip, and multimode fiber bio-probe. The transmission of the incident light and the collection and transmission of Fresnel reflection light are achieved using a single-multi-mode fiber optic coupler (SMFC) without any other optical separation elements. This compact design greatly simplifies the whole system structure and improves light transmission efficiency, which makes it suitable for the label-free, sensitive, and easy-to-use point-of-care testing (POCT) of targets in nanoliter samples. Based on Fresnel reflection mechanism and immunoassay principle, both the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could be sensitively quantified in 7 min using the secondary antibodies-modified multimode fiber bio-probe. The FRMB performs in one-step, is accurate, label-free, and sensitive in situ/on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG in serum with simple dilution only.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who presented for LTBI evaluation at the Hamilton County Public Health Tuberculosis Clinic in Ohio between 2019 and 2020. We defined 01/2019 to 02/2020 as the pre-COVID-19 response period, and 04/2020 to 12/2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic response period. We reviewed electronic medical records and extracted sociodemographic information, medical history, and follow-up and treatment data to define steps within the LTBI cascade of care. Logistic regressions were used to assess factors associated with LTBI treatment acceptance and completion, adjusted by potential confounders and COVID-19 period. RESULTS: Data from 312 patients were included. There was a significant decrease in the number of monthly LTBI referrals (median, 18 vs. 8, p=0.02) and LTBI evaluations (median, 17.5 vs. 7, p< 0.01) during COVID-19. There was a decrease in the proportion of immigrants as indication for LTBI testing (30% vs. 9%; p< 0.01), and an increase in LTBI diagnoses based on interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA; 30% vs. 49%; p< 0.01) during COVID-19. The proportion of people who were recommended LTBI treatment was similar before and during COVID-19 (76% vs. 81%, p=0.41), as well as the LTBI treatment acceptance rates (56% vs. 64%, p=0.28), and LTBI treatment completion rates (65% vs. 63%, p=0.85). In multivariate analysis, LTBI treatment acceptance was associated with Hispanic ethnicity, younger age, male sex, IGRA use, no comorbidities, and non-healthcare occupation, independent of COVID-19 period. LTBI treatment completion was associated with taking a rifamycin-containing regimen, independent of COVID-19 period. CONCLUSION: We observed a significant decline in the number of monthly LTBI referrals and evaluations during COVID-19.

As such models become more common, it is critical to understand the experiences of lay providers because they are on the forefront for delivering care services. A greater understanding would improve lay provider support and help them provide high-quality care. This is especially the case for those providing mental health services, as providing psychological care may pose unique stressors. We sought to understand experiences of lay counselors, focusing on identity, motivation, self-efficacy, stress, and burnout. The goal was to understand how taking on a new provider role influences their lives beyond simply assuming a new task, which would in turn help identify actionable steps to improve interventions with task-shifting components. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews (n = 20) and focus group discussions (n = 3) were conducted with three lay counselor groups with varying levels of experience delivering a community-based family therapy intervention in Eldoret, Kenya. Thematic analysis was conducted, including intercoder reliability checks. A Stress Map was created to visualize stress profiles using free-listing and pile-sorting data collected during interviews and focus group discussions. RESULTS: Counselors described high intrinsic motivation to become counselors and high self-efficacy after training. They reported positive experiences in the counselor role, with new skills improving their counseling and personal lives. As challenges arose, including client engagement difficulties and balancing many responsibilities, stress and burnout increased, dampening motivation and self-efficacy. In response, counselors described coping strategies, including seeking peer and supervisor support, that restored their motivation to persevere. At case completion, they again experienced high self-efficacy and a desire to continue. CONCLUSIONS: Findings informed suggestions for ways to incorporate support for lay providers into task-shifting interventions at initiation, during training, and throughout implementation. These include acknowledging and preparing counselors for challenges during training, increasing explicit attention to counselor stress in supervision, fostering peer support among lay providers, and ensuring a fair balance between workload and compensation. Improving and building an evidence base around practices for supporting lay providers will improve the effectiveness and sustainability of lay provider-delivered interventions.","output":"What about lay counselors experiences of task-shifting mental health interventions?

Previous studies support an association between peri-implantitis and periodontal pathogen. Thus, we investigated the bacterial flora of peri-implantitis patients in comparison to those of healthy implant and periodontitis patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 70 patients visiting Tokyo Dental College Chiba Hospital were divided into four groups: healthy, periodontitis, healthy implant, and peri-implantitis. For each group, the following five periodontal pathogens were detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Prevotella intermedia. RESULTS: The average copy number of total bacteria was significantly higher in the periodontitis group than in the other groups. P. gingivalis was detected in the periodontitis and peri-implantitis groups at levels as high as 18.92% and 12.29%, respectively, and P. intermedia was found in the peri-implantitis group at a rate of 2.06%. Nevertheless, periodontal pathogens were generally detected at lower levels in the peri-implantitis group than in the periodontitis group. CONCLUSION: We found lower bacterial counts in the peri-implantitis group relative to the periodontitis group. Our results suggest that the peri-implant tissue is less resistant to bacteria, so even a small number of bacteria can be a risk factor for peri-implantitis and the causative agent of peri-implantitis can be bacteria other than periodontal pathogen.","output":"Clinical evaluation of periodontal pathogen levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction in peri-implantitis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The high potential risks involved in working in a healthcare setting during a pandemic and the associated fear that may affect health care workers' (HCWs') willingness to work are important to understand to eliminate potential barriers to working. This study aimed to assess Palestinian HCWs' willingness to work and the related factors as well as to explore their ethical dilemmas during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Materials and Methods: Quantitative (survey questionnaire) and qualitative (semi-structured interviews) data were collected. Frontline HCWs (n = 550) received an online survey link via closed institutional networks. Frequencies summarized the data, and chi-square compared variables and outcomes. Odds ratios (ORs) and multivariable analysis examined predictors for willingness to work. Fifteen HCWs (physicians, nurses, and lab and radiology technicians) were purposefully sampled and agreed to interviews to explore their thoughts, motivations, and worries. Thematic analysis focused on ethical dilemmas to enhance the breadth and the depth of the study. Results: Almost 25% of surveyed HCWs were not willing to work during the pandemic. Logistic model results showed that physicians and nurses had higher willingness to work than others (p = 0.004, Adj. OR = 3.5). Lower stress levels and longer professional experience were predictors of more willing to work (p = 0.03, Adj. OR = 2.5; p = 0.03, Adj. OR = 2.6, respectively). Interviews showed that willingness to work did not preclude HCWs from fulfilling their duties despite grueling workloads and grave fears about safety and security. HCWs felt poorly prepared, unappreciated, and frustrated by unfair work distribution. The occupation presented additional safety issues. Conclusion: Physicians and nurses were more likely to comply with a commitment to their professional ethics and the duty or obligation to work. Stress levels could be mitigated in the future with better leadership, adding supports to address mental health and psychosocial challenges to enhance HCWs' well-being and improve quality of care.

It is essential to monitor efficiently its spread to help guide public health policies. Genome sequencing is the gold standard for identification of Delta, but is time-consuming, expensive, and unavailable in many regions. We describe here a rapid and relatively inexpensive alternative to sequencing for specific identification of the Delta variant, by application of double-mismatch allele-specific RT-PCR (DMAS-RT-PCR). The technique exploits forward and reverse allele-specific primers, targeting two spike gene mutations, L452R and T478K, within the same amplicon. The discriminatory power of each primer is enhanced by the presence of an additional mismatch located at the fourth nucleotide from the 3' end. Amplicons are detected in real-time by means of a conventional fluorescently-labelled hydrolysis probe. Specificity was assessed by testing a range of well characterised cell culture-derived viral isolates and clinical samples, most of which had previously been fully sequenced. In all cases the results of viral genotyping by DMAS-RT-PCR were entirely concordant with the results of sequencing, and the assay was shown to discriminate reliably between the Delta variant and other variants of concern (Alpha, B.1.1.7 and Beta, B.1.351), and 'wild-type' SARS-CoV-2. Other respiratory viruses, including influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus, were non-reactive in the assay. The sensitivity of DMAS-RT-PCR matched that of the diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR screening assay, which targets the E gene. Several samples that could not be sequenced due to insufficient virus could successfully be genotyped by DMAS-RT-PCR. The method we describe would be simple to establish in any laboratory that has the ability to conduct PCR assays and should greatly facilitate monitoring of the spread of the Delta variant throughout the world, and its proportional representation in any SARS-CoV-2-infected population.","output":"Highly sensitive and specific detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant by double-mismatch allele-specific PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has become a standard measure in recent years to utilise evidence-based practice, which is associated with a greater need to implement and use advanced, reliable methods of summarising the achievements of various scientific disciplines, including such highly specialised approaches as personalised medicine.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: An email was sent to 66 urological hospitals with focus on robotic surgery (RS) including a link to a questionnaire (e.g. bed/staff capacity, surgical caseload, protection measures during RS) that covered three time points: a representative baseline week prior to COVID-19, the week of March 16th-22nd and April 20th-26th 2020. The results were evaluated using descriptive analyses. RESULTS: 27 out of 66 questionnaires were analyzed (response rate: 41%). We found a decrease of 11% in hospital beds and 25% in OR capacity with equal reductions for endourological, open and robotic procedures. Primary surgical treatment of urolithiasis and benign prostate syndrome (BPS) but also of testicular and penile cancer dropped by at least 50% while the decrease of surgeries for prostate, renal and urothelial cancer (TUR-B and cystectomies) ranged from 15 to 37%. The use of personal protection equipment (PPE), screening of staff and patients and protection during RS was unevenly distributed in the different centers-however, the number of COVID-19 patients and urologists did not reach double digits. CONCLUSION: The German urological landscape has changed since the outbreak of COVID-19 with a significant shift of high priority surgeries but also continuation of elective surgical treatments.

We aimed to determine the association of the frequency of circulating TLR2+/CD14+ monocytes (FTLR2%) with the outcomes of KD, as well as to compare FTLR2% to the usefulness of sIL-10. METHODS: The FTLR2% in patients with KD was measured by flow cytometry. Serum levels of IL-10 (sIL-10) were determined in 31 patients with KD before the initial treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and in 21 febrile controls by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients were classified as having coronary artery lesions (CALs) based on the maximal internal diameters of the proximal right coronary artery and proximal left anterior descending coronary artery one month after the initial diagnosis. RESULTS: We found that FTLR2% greater than 92.62% predicted CALs with 80% sensitivity and 68.4% specificity, whereas FTLR2% more than 94.61% predicted IVIG resistance with 66.7% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity.

METHODS We conducted an observational and multicentre study with both retrospective and prospective collections in 14 GETAID centres. The primary objective was to assess the survival without colectomy following tofacitinib initiation in patients hospitalised for a UC flare. We determined rates of clinical response, clinical remission, and steroid-free clinical remission at week 6 and week 14 and safety. RESULTS Fifty-five patients were included (49 with prior infliximab failure and 19 previously exposed to ciclosporin). With a median follow-up of 6.5 months (interquartile range [IQR] [3-12.3]), rate of colectomy-free survival was estimated at 78.9% (95 CI [68.5-90.9]) and 73.6% (95 CI [61.9-87.3]) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Rates of clinical response, clinical remission and steroid-free clinical remission were 60%, 45.5% and 37.5% at week 6 and 41.8%, 34.5% and 32.7% at week 14. Regarding safety, no death was observed, three patients withdrew tofacitinib due to adverse events. Two herpes zoster infections occurred in patients aged over 60 years old. No venous thrombotic or major adverse cardiovascular events occurred.

Previous observational studies have suggested early tracheotomy to be advantageous. The aim of this parallel, multicentre, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the optimal timing of tracheotomy. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-infected patients within the Region V?stra G?taland of Sweden who needed intubation and mechanical respiratory support were included and randomly assigned to early tracheotomy ( 7 days after intubation) or late tracheotomy ( 10 days after intubation). The primary objective was to compare the total number of mechanical ventilation days between the groups. RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients (mean age 65 years, 79% males) were included. Seventy-two patients were assigned to early tracheotomy, and 78 were assigned to late tracheotomy. One hundred two patients (68%) underwent tracheotomy of whom sixty-one underwent tracheotomy according to the protocol. The overall median number of days in mechanical ventilation was 18 (IQR 9; 28), but no significant difference was found between the two treatment regimens in the intention-to-treat analysis (between-group difference: ? 1.5 days (95% CI ? 5.7 to 2.8); p = 0.5). A significantly reduced number of mechanical ventilation days was found in the early tracheotomy group during the per-protocol analysis (between-group difference: ? 8.0 days (95% CI ? 13.8 to ? 2.27); p = 0.0064). The overall correlation between the timing of tracheotomy and days of mechanical ventilation was significant (Spearmans correlation: 0.39, p < 0.0001). The total death rate during intensive care was 32.7%, but no significant differences were found between the groups regarding survival, complications or adverse events.

A single reviewer completed screening and another verified 50% of exclusions, using a machine-learning program to prioritize records. A second reviewer verified all exclusions at full text, extracted data, and (for incidence and risk factors) risk of bias assessments using modified Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Team consensus determined certainty of evidence ratings for incidence and risk factors using GRADE. Results46 studies were included (14 on incidence, 7 on risk factors, 11 on characteristics and short-term course, 3 on longer term outcomes, and 21 on mechanisms). Incidence of myocarditis after mRNA vaccines is highest in male adolescents and young adults (12-17y: range 50-139 cases per million [low certainty] and 18-29y: range 28-147 per million [moderate certainty]). For 5-11 year-old males and females and females 18-29 years of age, incidence of myocarditis after vaccination with Pfizer may be fewer than 20 cases per million (low certainty). There was very low certainty evidence for incidence after a third dose of an mRNA vaccine. For 18-29 year-old males and females, incidence of myocarditis is probably higher after vaccination with Moderna compared to Pfizer (moderate certainty). Among 12-17, 18-29 and 18-39 year-olds, incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis after dose 2 of an mRNA vaccine may be lower when administered []31 days compared to []30 days after dose 1 (low certainty). Data specific to males aged 18-29 indicated that the dosing interval may need to increase to []56 days to substantially drop incidence. For clinical course and short-term outcomes only one small series (n=8) was found for 5-11 year olds. In cases of adolescents and adults, the majority (>90%) of myocarditis cases involved 20-30 year-old males with symptom onset 2 to 4 days after second dose (71-100%). Most cases were hospitalized ([]84%) for a short duration (2-4 d). For pericarditis, data is limited but more variation has been reported in patient age, sex, onset timing and rate of hospitalization. Case series with longer-term (3 mo; n=38) follow-up suggest persistent ECG abnormalities, as well as ongoing symptoms and/or a need for medications or restriction from activities in >50% of patients. 16 hypothesized mechanisms are described, with little direct supporting or refuting evidence. ConclusionsAdolescent and young adult males are at the highest risk of myocarditis after mRNA vaccination. Pfizer over Moderna and waiting more than 30 days between doses may be preferred for this population. Incidence of myocarditis in children aged 5-11 may be very rare but certainty was low. Data on clinical risk factors was very limited. Clinical course of mRNA related myocarditis appears to be benign although longer term follow-up data is limited. Prospective studies with appropriate testing (e.g., biopsy, tissue morphology) will enhance understanding of mechanism(s).

Not registered. Summary boxWhat is already known about this topic? Case reports and surveillance signals of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the two-layered sac surrounding the heart) after COVID-19 vaccination appeared as early as April 2021. These have prompted ongoing surveillance and research of these complications to investigate their incidence, possible attribution to the vaccines, and clinical course. What this study adds This review critically appraises and synthesizes the available evidence to-date on the incidence of and risk factors for myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination in multiple countries. It summarizes the presentation and clinical course of over 8000 reported cases and describes some initial reports of longer term outcomes. Further, many possible mechanisms are outlined and discussed. Though low, the incidence of myocarditis is probably the highest in young males aged 12-29 years and is probably higher with Moderna than Pfizer mRNA vaccines. Longer dosing intervals may be beneficial. Most cases are mild and self-limiting, though data in 5-11 year-olds is very limited. Continued active surveillance with longer term follow-up is warranted.","output":"Myocarditis and Pericarditis following COVID-19 Vaccination: Evidence Syntheses on Incidence, Risk Factors, Natural History, and Hypothesized Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundPoliovirus vaccination induces an adaptive humoral immune response; in vitro experiments show polio-immune sera contain antibodies against the poliovirus RNA transcriptase that cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. While structural similarities between poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2 could have major implications for the COVID-19 response worldwide, polio-induced immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 have not been confirmed in prospective clinical trials. ObjectiveTo evaluate whether immune sera from adults who recently received inactivated poliovirus vaccination (IPV) can block SARS-CoV-2s ability to synthesize RNA. InterventionIPV intramuscular injection. MeasurementsPre-inoculation and 4-weeks post-inoculation sera were tested for anti-3Dpol (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp) antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). To assess IPVs ability to induce antibodies that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis, immune-based detection assays tested RdRp enzymatic activity in polio-immune sera. Results298 of the 300 enrolled participants completed both on-site visits. Comparing pre-inoculation to 4-week samples, 85.2% of participants demonstrated an increase in anti-3Dpolantibodies against RdRp proteins. Among tested post-inoculation samples, 94.4% demonstrated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis. Few inoculation-related side effects were reported (2.0%), all were minor. LimitationsParticipants were not systematically tested for COVID-19, though known exposures were reported and positive results (1.7%) were documented. ConclusionIPV can induce antibodies that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis, minimizing the risk of viral replication in infected individuals. This finding has practical implications for resource-deficient areas that may have limited access to newly developed COVID-19 vaccines and/or areas with low COVID-19 vaccination rates due to hesitancy.

The main objective of the new rule was to boost credit growth in the economy and provide lending for credit-constrained households and firms that are in need. A secondary aim was to shift the denomination structure of the deposits toward domestic currency. Hence, the paper focus particularly on how the policy affected the growth rate of loans and the share of domestic deposits relative to foreign ones among the commercial banks. The policy was also heavily criticized due to the possibility that it will subjugate the banking system to excessive risk. The paper explore this possible impact by measuring how much the policy affected the default risk allowances in the banking system. Design/methodology/approach: The new policy required banks with deposits above a threshold level, i.e. large banks, to maintain a certain asset ratio. Banks with deposits below the threshold, i.e. small banks, were held exempt from it. The paper implement a difference-in difference methodology to assess the quantitative impacts of the asset ratio policy by taking large banks as the treatment group, and small banks as the control group. Findings: Difference-in-difference estimation results suggest that the asset ratio policy resulted in a 9.6% rise in loans and an 8.4% rise in government securities. Deposits also increased, with no significant change in their composition. The policy initially generated a 7% increase in the credit risk allowances of banks in the treatment group, which vanished in the following periods. Based on all these, the paper argue that the policy was successful in providing liquidity to the economy without jeopardizing the financial stability. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this study show that asset ratio policy is effective in increasing credit growth in countries with limited policy space such as Turkey. While saying this, the importance of the robust and prudent structure of the banking system in the economy should be underlined. Otherwise, the policy may have an unintended consequence of raising systemic risk. The policy suggestions also apply to advanced countries where the monetary policy has reached a natural limit due to the zero lower bound (ZLB). The ZLB problem encouraged these countries to use quantitative easing schemes in the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis, just like the global financial crisis. However, it may take a long time to undo the effects of this policy on the balance sheets of central banks. In such cases, asset ratio policy can also be considered as an alternative tool for advanced economies notwithstanding the fact that the banking system should be prudent, well-capitalized and the country should have enough fiscal space. The main objective of the asset ratio policy was to help SMEs that were in urgent need of liquidity at the beginning of the crisis. The bank balance sheet data used in this paper does not contain information about the borrowers of the loans extended during the implementation of the policy. Analysis of this dimension using matched bank-firm level data will better demonstrate the success of the policy in achieving this goal. The paper address this as the main limitation of the paper and leave that analysis for future research. Originality/value: This paper provides an important contribution to the literature by assessing a new unique policy whose objective is to stimulate loans and mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the economy. The policy in question is predicted to have effects on the asset and liability structure and risk exposure of the banking system in Turkey. The quantitative analysis in this study estimates these impacts and discusses the effectiveness of the new policy in providing a relief for firms and households in need. Whether or not the policy caused a disruption in the sound structure of the banking system in Turkey is another question addressed in t e paper. ? 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"An investigation of the impacts of asset ratio policy on the banking system during the Covid-19 crisis in Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus has evolved into a devastating pandemic since December 2019.

Objective: Highlighting the significance of hyperglycemia on COVID-19 patient outcomes. Methods: Five patients with DKA were admitted and diagnosed with COVID-19 based on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Electronic medical records were reviewed and informed consent was obtained prior to reporting the index cases. Results: Five patients presenting with DKA complicating a concurrent COVID-19 infection were reported. Three were known to have preexisting diabetes and two had newly diagnosed diabetes based on significantly elevated glycated hemoglobin levels at admission. Four recovered and were discharged to their homes and one had a complicated course and died. Conclusion: Our cases demonstrate that COVID-19 infection can trigger DKA. DKA can occur among patients who are known to have diabetes mellitus or appears as a first presentation.

We investigated the tolerability and safety of S-1 and oxaliplatin as adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III gastric cancer. METHODS Japanese patients with stage III gastric cancer who had undergone D2 or more extensive lymphadenectomy were enrolled. In the first cycle, S-1 (40-60 mg/m2 twice daily) alone was given orally for 2 weeks of a 3-week cycle. From the second cycle, S-1 was administered as in the first cycle and oxaliplatin (100 mg/m2) was infused intravenously on day 1. Treatment was continued for 8 cycles. The primary end point was the treatment completion rate for eight cycles. RESULTS Sixty-three patients were enrolled and 62 patients were included in analysis. The treatment completion rate was 74.2 %, which was higher than the expected completion rate of 72.0 %. The median relative dose intensities were 77.1 % for S-1 and 72.6 % for oxaliplatin, with 41.9 and 61.7 % patients requiring dose reduction of S-1 and oxaliplatin, respectively.

Best classification performance was obtained when training two separate classifiers for each data source, one for Reddit and one for Twitter posts, when evaluating on in-source test data for both test sets combined with an overall accuracy of 0.95 (and macro-average F1 of 0.92) and an F1-score of 0.95 for patient voice only. CONCLUSION: The main conclusion resulting from this work is that combining social media data from platforms with different characteristics for training a patient and professional voice classifier does not result in best possible performance. We showed that it is best to train separate models per data source (Reddit and Twitter) instead of a model using the combined training data from both sources. We also found that it is preferable to train separate models per domain (cardiovascular and skin) while showing that the difference to the combined model is only minor (0.01 accuracy). Our highest overall F1-score (0.95) obtained for classifying posts as patient voice is a very good starting point for further analysis of social media data reflecting the experience of patients.

Some patients had gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, abnormal liver function, digestive system disease and liver disease. AIM: To investigate the prevalence of GI symptoms, abnormal liver function, digestive system disease and liver disease in patients with COVID-19 by a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Ovid Embase, Medline, and 2 Chinese databases. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of GI symptoms, abnormal liver function, digestive system disease, and liver disease. Different studies were included in different subset analysis. These outcomes were estimated with proportions, odds ratio, 95% confidence interval (CI) and P-value by Stata SE 15.1. RESULTS: Thirty-one studies involving 4682 patients were included. The most significant GI symptoms were diarrhea (0.08, 95% CI: 0.06-0.11) and anorexia (0.17, 95% CI: 0.06-0.27). The most significant abnormal liver function was increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (0.25, 95% CI: 0.16-0.33). A total of 5% of the patients had digestive system disease (95% CI: 0.02-0.08). A total of 3% of the patients had liver disease (95% CI: 0.02-0.05). The prevalence of nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abnormal liver function, digestive system disease, and liver disease was higher in Wuhan group. The prevalence of diarrhea was higher in non-China group. Patients in severe/intensive care unit group were more likely to have diarrhea, anorexia, abdominal pain increased aspartate aminotransferase, and increased ALT. CONCLUSION: The most significant GI symptoms were anorexia and diarrhea. The most significant abnormal liver function was increased ALT.

Our previous study has shown that NaDC3 promotes cellular senescence, but its mechanism is not clear. It is known that when the concentration of intermediates in Krebs cycle is increased, NAD(+)/NADH ratio will be decreased. NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase sirtuin1 (SIRT1) prolongs mammalian cellular lifespan. Therefore, we propose that NaDC3 accelerates cellular aging by inhibiting SIRT1. After NaDC3 was overexpressed in two human embryo lung fibroblastic cell lines, WI38 and MRC-5, we found that the cells displayed aging-related phenotypes in advance. Meanwhile, the level of SIRT1 activity was down-regulated. In WI38/hNaDC3 cells treated with the activators of SIRT1, aging-related phenotypes induced by NaDC3 were obviously improved. The NAD(+)/NADH ratio in WI38/hNaDC3 cells was also decreased. Further study found that enhanced intracellular NAD(+) level could attenuate the aging phenotypes induced by NaDC3.

In a hasty way and with little time to react, an interruption of academic normality had to be carried out and a virtual teaching modality had to be transitioned. Not only the teachers, who have had to adapt and modify the teaching-learning processes, but also the students have been affected by this drastic change of direction that has occurred in higher education. In a key phase of the course, with social and family conditions not always favorable, with lack of resources and with the distance imposed by alarm measures, students have been subjected to pressure that has put the continuity of studies. METHOD The study carried out with a sample of 475 students from different undergraduate degrees from the University of La Laguna (Spain), aimed to validate a predictive model on the intention to abandon, using a structural equation model. Specifically, the predictive value that the virtual teaching model, academic exhaustion and expectations of self-efficacy had in the intention of dropping out of university students was analyzed.

For many individuals knowledge of a likely infection and possibly serious health consequences stood in contrast to a vague fear of the vaccination itself. What has a stronger influence on the decision to be vaccinated: the cognitive estimation of risk or the feeling of risk? Based on data collected during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic we tested the relative influence of the cognitive and affective aspects of risk on estimation of the individual willingness to be vaccinated. In doing so we also focused on fear. The results indicate that the feeling of risk had a significant effect on the willingness to be vaccinated. In contrast, the classic, cognitive estimation of a risk was no longer a significant predictor when the feeling of risk was also used to predict the willingness to be vaccinated. A highly felt risk to become infected with influenza A (H1N1) substantially increased the willingness to be vaccinated. A highly felt risk regarding the vaccination, on the other hand, decreased the willingness to be vaccinated. Fear of the vaccination significantly decreased the willingness to be vaccinated even when fear of the spreading disease was also very high.

This work uses Randic's star networks in order to convert the protein primary structure data in specific topological indices that are used to construct a natural/random protein classification model. The set of natural proteins contains 1046 protein chains selected from the pre-compiled CulledPDB list from PISCES Dunbrack's Web Lab. This set is characterized by a protein homology of 20%, a structure resolution of 1.6 ? and R-factor lower than 25%. The set of random amino acid chains contains 1046 sequences which were generated by Python script according to the same type of residues and average chain length found in the natural set. A new Sequence to Star Networks (S2SNet) wxPython GUI application (with a Graphviz graphics back-end) was designed by our group in order to transform any character sequence in the following star network topological indices: Shannon entropy of Markov matrices, trace of connectivity matrices, Harary number, Wiener index, Gutman index, Schultz index, MoreauCBroto indices, Balaban distance connectivity index, KierCHall connectivity indices and Randic connectivity index. The model was constructed with the General Discriminant Analysis methods from STATISTICA package and gave training/predicting set accuracies of 90.77% for the forward stepwise model type. In conclusion, this study extends for the first time the classical TIs to protein star network TIs by proposing a model that can predict if a protein/fragment of protein is natural or random using only the amino acid sequence data. This classification can be used in the studies of the protein functions by changing some fragments with random amino acid sequences or to detect the fake amino acid sequences or the errors in proteins. These results promote the use of the S2SNet application not only for protein structure analysis but also for mass spectroscopy, clinical proteomics and imaging, or DNA/RNA structure analysis.","output":"Natural/random protein classification models based on star network topological indices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to present the clinical characteristics and dynamic changes in laboratory parameters of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou, and explore the probable early warning indicators of disease progression.

In mid-December 2019, coronavirus (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) infection begun scattering from China. Globally, there are growing worries about community infections, in light of pandemic characterization for the outbreak by the WHO. Some studies have found that 1 out of 7 COVID-19 patients have acquired secondary bacterial infection, and half of the patients who have died had such infections. The challenge of antibiotic resistance could become an enormous force contributing to the rise in illness and death associated with COVID-19, as lower respiratory tract infections are among the leading causes of mortality in critically ill ventilated-patients with COVID-19. The increasing prevalence of resistance to penicillin and other drugs among pneumococci has considerably complicated the treatment of acquired pneumonia. Resistance to other classes of antibiotics, traditionally used as alternatives in the treatment of pneumococcal infections, has also increased markedly in the recent years. Although the search for new antibiotics remains a top priority, the pipeline for new antibiotics is not encouraging, making it essential to search for other alternative solutions. Researching promising antimicrobial agents that are effective against COVID-19 as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a major cause of pneumonia, should be encouraged to reduce mortality related to COVID-19 infections.

We characterized the role of the nucleocapsid protein (N) of SARS-CoV-2 in modulating antiviral immunity. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 N resulted in the attenuation of retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptor-mediated interferon (IFN) production and IFN-induced gene expression. Similar to the SARS-CoV-1 N protein, SARS-CoV-2 N suppressed the interaction between tripartate motif protein 25 (TRIM25) and RIG-I. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 N inhibited polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)]-mediated IFN signaling at the level of Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and interfered with the association between TBK1 and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), subsequently preventing the nuclear translocation of IRF3.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this research was to characterize how community pharmacy in Ontario (Canada) responded to the COVID-19 pandemic of winter/spring 2020, in particular in understanding what factors may influence or predict resiliency of individual practitioners and their workplaces. METHODS: One-on-one interviews mediated through technology (Microsoft Teams) were used, following a semi-structured interview protocol. Verbatim transcripts were produced and analyzed by two independent researchers, using an inductive coding process to identify and characterize themes. RESULTS: A total of 21 pharmacists participated in this study. Six themes were identified: a) use of and comfort with technology; b) early adoption of corporate and professional guidance; c) workplaces that emphasized task-focus rather than multi-tasking were more resilient; d) scheduling methods and practices in the workplace are important for personal resilience; e) dedicated specialty staff allowed pharmacists to focus on their work; and f) provision of personal protective equipment was essential. CONCLUSIONS: Traditionally, resilience in professional practice has been characterized as a personal, not a workplace, issue.

The patients' sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the previous year, death event, source of death (SARS-CoV-2 or not), presence of hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, need for intensive care unit, need for ventilatory support in intensive care unit were obtained from the clinical file records. RESULTS: 85 of the 200 patients had a history of SARS-Cov-2 infection during the last 12 months. Forty-two (49.5%) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were hospitalized. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 had longer dialysis time, increased mortality, and significantly higher comorbidities such as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure. Besides, heart failure and hypertension were the determining factors in the risk factor analysis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In dialysis patients, the mortality rate in the last year, due to all causes, including SARS-CoV-2 infection, was 23% while the mortality rate due to \\"SARS-CoV-2 infection only\\" was 13%) (p > 0.05). Our findings are important in guiding clinical decision-making and informing the public and health authorities about the risk of death associated with COVID-19 in this patient group.","output":"COVID-19: mortality rates of patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We determine how pediatric emergency department (ED) visits changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large sample of U.S. EDs. METHODS: Using retrospective data from January-June 2020, compared to a similar 2019 period, we calculated weekly 2020-2019 ratios of Non-COVID-19 ED visits for adults and children (age 18 years or less) by age range. Outcomes were pediatric ED visit rates before and after the onset of pandemic, by age, disposition, and diagnosis. RESULTS: We included data from 2,213,828 visits to 144 EDs and 4 urgent care centers in 18 U.S. states, including 7 EDs in children's hospitals. During the pandemic period, adult non-COVID-19 visits declined to 60% of 2019 volumes and then partially recovered but remained below 2019 levels through June 2020. Pediatric visits declined even more sharply, with peak declines through the week of April 15 of 74% for children age < 10 years and 67% for 14-17 year. Visits recovered by June to 72% for children age 14-17, but to only 50% of 2019 levels for children < age 10 years. Declines were seen across all ED types and locations, and across all diagnoses, with an especially sharp decline in non-COVID-19 communicable diseases. During the pandemic period, there was 22% decline in common serious pediatric conditions, including appendicitis. CONCLUSION: Pediatric ED visits fell more sharply than adult ED visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, and remained depressed through June 2020, especially for younger children. Declines were also seen for serious conditions, suggesting that parents may have avoided necessary care for their children.","output":"Characterizing pediatric emergency department visits during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of June 2021, Zimbabwe entered into a harsh third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw an increase in the cumulative number of cases from approximately 38,000 to 120,000 in just two months. This exponential case rise was accompanied by an increase in the absolute number of case fatalities, with a corresponding strain on the public health sector. To effectively inform public health responses, policy and strategy to deal with the current wave and prepare for further waves, we discuss the drivers and challenges of control for this current wave and future waves, and offer practical recommendations. Vaccination will be the most important public health intervention to deal with the spread, morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, therefore, efforts to fight vaccine hesitancy and build vaccine confidence and availability will be critical. Similarly, it will be important to build public health sector capacity and resilience to adequately deal with large-scale outbreaks and absorb the shock waves associated with such. Resuscitating and building the economy is an indispensable component of protecting public health. Therefore, collaborative efforts from relevant public health stakeholders, economists, politicians and other players are required to effectively coordinate the necessary responses and formulate the right policies and strategies.","output":"Drivers of the third wave of COVID-19 in Zimbabwe and challenges for control: perspectives and recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are crucial for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Drug adherence by the patient but also adherence to guidelines by the physician are suboptimal. This review highlights aspects of DOAC treatment during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and selected challenging scenarios. RECENT FINDINGS: For patients with a newly diagnosed indication for oral anticoagulation, a new interim clinical guidance recommends starting DOAC instead of vitamin K antagonists if DOAC are not contraindicated. The goal is to reduce the potential exposure of patients to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus during the routine coagulation monitoring visits. As COVID-19 can lead to kidney failure, we discuss the challenges of DOAC dosing in kidney failures. Finally, we discuss two common challenges - when to start a DOAC after an ischemic stroke linked to atrial fibrillation, and whether cerebral microbleeds, including their count, are per se a contraindication to DOAC.

However, the major drawback of these studies is the ecological fallacy that can lead to spurious associations. In this frame, an increasing concern has been addressed to clarify the possible role of contextual variables such as municipalities characteristics (including urban, rural, semi-rural settings), those of the resident communities, the network of social relations, the mobility of people, and the responsiveness of the National Health Service (NHS), to better clarify the dynamics of the phenomenon. The objective of this paper is to identify and collect the municipalities and community contextual factors and to synthesize their information content to produce suitable indicators in national environmental epidemiological studies, with specific emphasis on assessing the possible role of air pollution on the incidence and severity of the COVID-19 disease. A first step was to synthesize the content of spatial information, available at the municipal level, in a smaller set of summary indexes that can be more easily viewed and analyzed. For the 7903 Italian municipalities (1 January 2020ISTAT), 44 variables were identified, collected, and grouped into five information dimensions a priori defined: (i) geographic characteristics of the municipality, (ii) demographic and anthropogenic characteristics, (iii) mobility, (iv) socio-economic-health area, and (v) healthcare offer (source: ISTAT, EUROSTAT or Ministry of Health, and further ad hoc elaborations (e.g., OpenStreetMaps)). Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out for the five identified dimensions, with the aim of reducing the large number of initial variables into a smaller number of components, limiting as much as possible the loss of information content (variability). We also included in the analysis PM(2.5), PM(10) and NO(2) population weighted exposure (PWE) values obtained using a four-stage approach based on the machine learning method, random forest, which uses spaceCtime predictors, satellite data, and air quality monitoring data estimated at the national level. Overall, the PCA made it possible to extract twelve components: three for the territorial characteristics dimension of the municipality (variance explained 72%), two for the demographic and anthropogenic characteristics dimension (variance explained 62%), three for the mobility dimension (variance explained 83%), two for the socio-economic-health sector (variance explained 58%) and two for the health offer dimension (variance explained 72%). All the components of the different dimensions are only marginally correlated with each other, demonstrating their potential ability to grasp different aspects of the spatial distribution of the COVID-19 pathology. This work provides a national repository of contextual variables at the municipality level collapsed into twelve informative factors suitable to be used in studies on the association between chronic exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 pathology, as well as for investigations on the role of air pollution on the health of the Italian population.","output":"A Methodological Approach to Use Contextual Factors for Epidemiological Studies on Chronic Exposure to Air Pollution and COVID-19 in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare systems are complex adaptive systems, requiring a change in leadership style, from the traditional model to collaborative, values-driven leadership (VDL).

The changes in vaccination intention and reasons for changes were reported. Subgroup analyses were performed by region, gender, age, and occupation. Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used for quality assessment of the articles. Twenty-seven studies with 39,193 participants were included. Among 22 studies reporting intention to vaccinate in 20/21, there was increased intention to vaccinate (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.32C1.69, p < 0.001) regardless of age, gender, and occupation. The remaining five studies reporting vaccination intention and uptake in 20/21 showed a similar increase (RR 1.68, 95%CI 1.20C2.36). Important determinants include historical vaccine acceptance, and perception of influenza severity and vaccine safety.

Research is needed to better understand how resource constraints and systemic inequalities contribute to moral distress in order to develop effective mitigation strategies. Oncology providers in low\\\\ and middle\\\\income countries are well positioned to provide insight into the moral experience of cancer care priority setting and expertise to guide solutions. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 22 oncology physicians, nurses, program leaders, and clinical advisors at a cancer center in Rwanda. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the framework method. RESULTS: Participants identified sources of moral distress at three levels of engagement with resource prioritization: witnessing program\\\\level resource constraints drive cancer disparities, implementing priority setting decisions into care of individual patients, and communicating with patients directly about resource prioritization implications. They recommended individual and organizational\\\\level interventions to foster resilience, such as communication skills training and mental health support for clinicians, interdisciplinary team building, fair procedures for priority setting, and collective advocacy for resource expansion and equity. CONCLUSION: This study adds to the current literature an in\\\\depth examination of the impact of resource constraints and inequities on clinicians in a low\\\\resource setting. Effective interventions are urgently needed to address moral distress, reduce clinician burnout, and promote well\\\\being among a critical but strained oncology workforce. Collective advocacy is concomitantly needed to address the structural forces that constrain resources unevenly and perpetuate disparities in cancer care and outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: For many oncology clinicians worldwide, resource limitations constrain routine clinical practice and necessitate decisions about prioritizing cancer care. To the authors knowledge, this study is the first in\\\\depth analysis of how resource constraints and priority setting lead to moral distress among oncology clinicians in a low\\\\resource setting. Effective individual and organizational interventions and collective advocacy for equity in cancer care are urgently needed to address moral distress and reduce clinician burnout among a strained global oncology workforce.

CRS is is characterized by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and is closely linked to CAR-T expansion and bystander cells like monocytes/macrophages. In other hyperinflammatory states, obesity contributes to inflammatory cascades and acts as a risk factor for disease severity. We aimed to study the influence of anthropometric and body composition (BC) measurements on CAR-T-related immunotoxicity in 64 patients receiving CD19-directed CAR-T for relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. Patients with grade  2 CRS presented with a significantly higher median BMI, waist circumference, Waist-to-Height Ratio (WtHR) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). These parameters were also found to be associated with an earlier CRS onset. Other adipose deposits and muscle mass did not differ between patients with CRS 0-1 vs CRS  2. Moreover, BC parameters did not influence ICANS severity or onset. In a multivariate binary logistic regression incorporating known risk factors of immunotoxicity, the factors BMI, waist circumference, WtHR and VAT increased the probability of grade  2 CRS. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were utilized to determine optimal discriminatory thresholds for these parameters. Patients above these thresholds displayed markedly increased peak IL-6 levels. Our data imply that increased body composition and VAT in particular represent an additional risk factor for severe and early CRS. These findings carry implications for risk-stratification prior to CD19 CAR-T and may be integrated into established risk models.","output":"Increased visceral fat distribution and body composition impact cytokine release syndrome onset and severity after CD19 CAR-T in advanced B-cell malignancies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate the Barrow holographic dark energy (BHDE) model using IR cutoff as the Hubble horizon in the background of a flat FriedmannCLema?treCRobertsonCWalker universe.

Since the beginning of 2020, this stability has been undergoing one of the most vigorous pressure tests ever due to the COVID-19 outbreak. From a mere health issue, the pandemic has turned into an economic threat to food security globally in the forms of lockdowns, economic decline, food trade restrictions, and rising food inflation. It is safe to assume that the novel health crisis has badly struck the least developed and developing economies, where people are particularly vulnerable to hunger and malnutrition. However, due to the recency of the COVID-19 problem, the impacts of macroeconomic fluctuations on food insecurity have remained scantily explored. In this study, the authors attempted to bridge this gap by revealing interactions between the food security status of people and the dynamics of COVID-19 cases, food trade, food inflation, and currency volatilities. The study was performed in the cases of 45 developing economies distributed to three groups by the level of income. The consecutive application of the autoregressive distributed lag method, Yamamoto's causality test, and variance decomposition analysis allowed the authors to find the food insecurity effects of COVID-19 to be more perceptible in upper-middle-income economies than in the least developed countries. In the latter, food security risks attributed to the emergence of the health crisis were mainly related to economic access to adequate food supply (food inflation), whereas in higher-income developing economies, availability-sided food security risks (food trade restrictions and currency depreciation) were more prevalent. The approach presented in this paper contributes to the establishment of a methodology framework that may equip decision-makers with up-to-date estimations of health crisis effects on economic parameters of food availability and access to staples in food-insecure communities.","output":"Impacts of COVID-19 on Trade and Economic Aspects of Food Security: Evidence from 45 Developing Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is associated with severe and life-threatening pneumonia and respiratory failure.

They completed self-report questionnaires that included measures of psychological distress, event-related rumination, and social support. RESULTS: The hierarchical regression analysis showed that maladaptive intrusive rumination and perceived social support predicted increases and decreases in psychological distress, respectively, even when subjective severity of COVID-19-related experiences was controlled. Putatively adaptive type of rumination (i.e., deliberate rumination) was not a significant predictor concurrently. CONCLUSION: This is among the early endeavors to comprehensively understand risk and protective factors associated with an effective coping strategy against the COVID-19 crisis.

Still, the long-term health consequences of COVID-19 are not well described in patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods: We conducted a population-based study investigating the outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with UC and CD in Denmark. The Danish COVID-19 IBD Database is an extensive population-based database which prospectively monitors the disease course of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among patients with UC and CD. Severe COVID-19 was defined as COVID-19 necessitating intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, or death, while adverse COVID-19 was defined as requirement of COVID-19 related hospitalization. Sequelae following COVID-19 were defined as symptoms that developed during or after an infection consistent with COVID- 19, were present for more than 12 weeks, and were not attributable to alternative diagnoses. Results: The study included 319 patients with UC and 197 patients with CD from January 28th, 2020, to April 1st, 2021. Of these, a total of 137 (42.9%) and 85 (43.1%), respectively, participated in a subsequent investigation of post-COVID-19 sequelae after a median of 5.1 months (IQR 4.5-7.9) after infection (Table 1). An equal proportion of patients with UC (58 (42.3%)) and CD (39 (45.9%), p=0.60) reported persisting symptoms of COVID-19 for at least 12 weeks, consistent with the development of post-COVID-19 syndrome. The most common persisting patient-reported symptoms included fatigue (UC: 49 (35.8%), CD: 31 (36.5%), p=0.92), anosmia (UC: 37 (27.0%), CD: 25 (29.4%), p=0.70), ageusia (UC: 26 (19.0%), CD: 24 (28.2%), p=0.11), headache (UC: 19 (13.9%), CD: 16 (18.8%), p=0.32), dyspnea (UC: 19 (13.9%), CD: 16 (18.8%), p=0.32), and arthralgia (UC: 17 (12.4%), CD: 14 (16.5%), p=0.40) (Figure 1). Only discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapies for UC during COVID-19 (OR=1.50 (95% CI 1.07-10.22), p=0.01) and the severity of COVID-19 among patients with CD were independently associated with the long-term effects of COVID-19 (OR=2.76 (95% CI 1.05- 3.90), p=0.04) (Tables 2-3). Conclusion: This Danish population-based study found a high occurrence of patient-reported persisting symptoms following the acute phase of COVID-19 infection, which were associated with the discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapies for UC during COVID-19 and the severity of COVID-19 among patients with CD.

To enhance drug or gene delivery to the brain, investigators have proposed the use of nanoparticulate delivery vectors to improve pharmacokinetics and pharmacodistribution. Once blood-brain barrier crossing is achieved, it has been assumed that nanoparticles would have a relatively prolonged residence time in the central nervous system, long enough for the payload to reach the target cells of interest. Indeed, earlier pharmacokinetic studies with inorganic nanoparticles, such as iron oxide, supported this assumption of prolonged brain residence times of nanoparticulate agents. Recently, Gu et al. studied the residence time in the brain of organic, biodegradable nanoparticles that are more typically used for drug delivery. They found that nanoparticles composed of either lipoproteins or polymers cleared fairly rapidly from the mouse brain following direct intraparenchymal injection, with a clearance half-life of only a few hours. Moreover, they found that this clearance was mediated, for the most part, by the glymphatic systema recently described mechanism by which the brain's interstitial fluid clears into the lymphatic system of the body via paravascular channelswith the resident immune cells of the brain playing a pivotal role. From a drug delivery perspective, this implies that bioengineers must not assume that delivery of a nanoparticle past the blood-brain barrier will be sufficient and instead consider that the glymphatic system could clear the nanoparticle nearly as fast as it is being delivered. Additionally, this implies that nanoparticles may be uniquely suited for studying how the glymphatic system clears different types of materials from the brain, as well as the role of immune cells in this process. Furthermore, given that they are selectively cleared by immune cells into the glymphatic system, this suggests that nanoparticles could be uniquely suited to treating neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. Certainly, although these data are compelling, future studies will need to verify that these results translate to larger animals that better predict the human situation. Additionally, they will need to be realized in realistic models of the diseases the nanoparticles are intended to treat. Overall, this study underlines the importance of explicitly verifying the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodistribution of drug delivery technologies.","output":"Click here for free access to our latest coronavirus/COVID-19 research, commentary, and news"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore the self-reported impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on changes to care and behaviour in UK patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, to help ensure that patient experiences are considered in future pandemic planning. METHODS: This was a longitudinal mixed methods study, with a cohort completing baseline surveys in March 2020 and follow-up surveys in June 2020 (N = 111), combined with thematic analysis of the LUPUS UK forum and participant interviews (N = 28). RESULTS: Cancellations of routine care and difficulties accessing medical support contributed to some participants deteriorating physically, including reports of hospitalisations. The majority of participants reported that fear of COVID-19 and disruptions to their medical care had also adversely impacted their mental health. Feeling medically supported during the pandemic correlated with multiple measures of mental health and perceptions of care, including the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Score (r = 0.44, p = 0.01). Five themes were identified: 1. Detrimental reduction in care; 2. Disparities in contact and communication, (medical security vs abandonment sub-theme); 3. Perceived and actual endangerment; 4. The perfect storm of reduced clinician ability to help, and increased patient reticence to seek help; and 5. Identifying the patients most vulnerable to reduced medical care. CONCLUSION: The diversion of resources away from chronic disease care was perceived by many participants to have caused adverse outcomes. Fear about increased vulnerability to COVID-19 was high, contributing to healthcare-avoidant behaviours. This study also highlights the influence of clinician accessibility and patients feeling medically supported on multiple measures of physical and mental health.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the medical care and healthcare-behaviour of patients with lupus and other systemic autoimmune diseases: a mixed methods longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, poses a severe threat to humanity.

It is known that chronic cardiovascular diseases are associated with the risk of severe course and lethal outcomes both in COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Therefore, in each case it is necessary to study the interaction and mutual influence of different components of the treatment program prescribed to such patients.The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of coagulation activity on the course of a novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) and to justify the management of comorbid patients having been received novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in previously selected doses according to indications in concomitant somatic diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Total 76 cases of confirmed coronavirus infection in patients who had been received initial therapy on an outpatient basis were analyzed. 26 patients who received NOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran) made up the main group and 50 - the comparison (control) group in which patients had not been administered any drugs that affect blood clotting until the episode of COVID-19. All patients have been prescribed therapy following the Provisional guidelines ?Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus infection (COVID-19)? (https://static-0.minzdrav.gov.ru/system/attachments/attaches/). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The number of hospitalizations was significantly fewer in the group of patients who had been received NOACs (19 vs. 66% in the control group). No deaths or cases of severe respiratory and/or renal failure were observed in the main group, while adverse outcomes were noted in 14% of patients who had not been administered these drugs. CONCLUSION: Taking NOACs reduces the probability of severe course and adverse outcomes in the development of coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, which indicates a significant contribution of coagulation mechanisms to the pathogenesis in COVID-19. There were no indications for drug replacement and correction of anticoagulant therapy regimens in patients who received adequate therapy with oral anticoagulants for treating a non-severe form of coronavirus infection in ambulatory patient settings.","output":"[Effect of anticoagulant therapy on the course of COVID-19 in comorbid patients]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The field of neurosurgery has always been propelled by the adoption of novel technologies to improve practice Although advancements have occurred in the diagnosis, treatment, and long-term outcomes of patients, these have not translated to global patient benefit Up to five million people each year do not have access to safe and affordable neurosurgical interventions, and those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are disproportionately affected Current approaches to increase neurosurgical capacity are unlikely to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals target by 2030, and many of the most successful programs have been disrupted by the travel restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic There is therefore a pressing need for creative virtual solutions An area of growing relevance is the use of immersive technologies: virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) AR allows additional information to be superimposed onto the surgeon's visual field, thus enhancing intra-operative visualization This can be used for remote tele-proctoring, whereby an experienced surgeon can virtually assist with a procedure regardless of geographical location Expert guidance can therefore be given to both neurosurgical trainees and non-neurosurgical practitioners, further facilitating the growing practice of neurosurgical task-shifting in LMICs VR simulation is another useful tool in remote neurosurgical training, with the potential to reduce the learning curve of complex procedures whilst conserving supplies in low-resource settings The adoption of immersive technologies into practice is therefore a promising approach for achieving global neurosurgical equity, whilst adapting to the long-term disruptions of the pandemic","output":"Virtual Connections: Improving Global Neurosurgery Through Immersive Technologies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we propose and discuss a stochastic SIRS epidemic model with non-monotone incidence rate under regime-switching.

The modular offshore wind industry, and in particular an offshore wind project in the British section of the North Sea, faced issues with delivery times, productivity, and uncertainty management (safety and/or pandemic disruptions). The objective of our research was to develop and test a conceptual model that responds to these challenges, which further will increase the likelihood of reducing delays in offshore energy operations. The initial literature review made it evident that few, if any, have covered Takt implementation in modular construction, and certainly not in offshore energy operations. A design science approach was chosen, and in collaboration with the case organization, the model was constructed and evaluated in a longitudinal field study. The application of mixed methods ensured data input originating from practical experience provided by field experts both within and outside the case-study organizations, theoretical knowledge from academics, and state-of-the-art literature allowed the development of a model that embeds Kanban, Takt, and PDCA to the context of modular offshore wind turbine tower construction. After its implementation, a 10% increase in labor productivity was recorded. Furthermore, through the stable productivity measures in a time of crisis, the model revealed its robustness during COVID-19. The contributions to the body of knowledge are the developed model combining Takt, Kanban, and PDCA, and the visual management interface. The model was implemented together with the visual management interface to achieve a flexible planning framework that can respond to challenges with delivery times and productivity and withstand major disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: This cross-sectional hospital-based study included 6,277 patients presenting between March 25, 2017 and March 31, 2021. The data of the patients who underwent keratoplasty during the lockdown and unlock phases were compared with the respective periods in the previous three years before COVID-19. RESULTS: During the year one of pandemic, there was a 29.46% decline in the total number of keratoplasty performed at the institute compared to previous years annual numbers. The patients undergoing keratoplasty decreased by 90.28% (28/288) of pre-COVID-19 volumes during the lockdown phase. This was mainly because of a 40.6% reduction in the proportion of patients requiring interstate travel. There was complete recovery in the number of patients undergoing keratoplasty to 129.27% (184/142) of pre-COVID-19 volumes by March 2021. This gradual incremental trend was seen across all types of keratoplasty in Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty (135.29%), penetrating keratoplasty (117.6%), therapeutic keratoplasty (122.22%), anterior lamellar keratoplasty (150%), and Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (141.18%) by March 2021 with the gradual ease of lockdown regulations.

We synthesize the available literature on time to surgery and its impact on outcomes along with a critical appraisal of the released triage guidelines in the United States. Methods We performed a systematic literature review using PubMed according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines evaluating relevant literature from the past 15 years. Results Out of 679 screened abstracts, 12 studies investigating time to surgery in lung cancer were included. In stage I-II lung cancer, delayed resection beyond 6 to 8 weeks is consistently associated with lower survival. No identified evidence justifies a 2 cm cutoff for immediate versus delayed surgery. For stage IIIa lung cancer, time to surgery greater than 6 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy is similarly associated with worse survival. For esophageal cancer, 254 abstracts were screened and 23 studies were included. Minimal literature addresses primary esophagectomy, but time to surgery over 8 weeks is associated with lower survival. In the neoadjuvant setting, longer time to surgery is associated with increased pathologic complete response, but also decreased survival. The optimal window for esophagectomy following neoadjuvant therapy is 6 to 8 weeks. Conclusions In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, timely resection of lung and esophageal cancer should be prioritized whenever possible based upon local resources and

Patients and methods: We conducted a nationwide online study among adult patients with PASC as defined by symptoms persisting over 4 weeks following a confirmed or probable COVID-19, without any identified alternative diagnosis. Information concerning PASC symptoms, vaccine type and scheme and its effect on PASC symptoms were studied. Results: 620 questionnaires were completed and 567 satisfied the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The respondents median age was 44 (IQR 25C75: 37C50) and 83.4% were women. The initial infection was proven in 365 patients (64%) and 5.1% had been hospitalized to receive oxygen. A total of 396 patients had received at least one injection of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine at the time of the survey, after a median of 357 (198C431) days following the initially-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the 380 patients who reported persistent symptoms at the time of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, 201 (52.8%) reported a global effect on symptoms following the injection, corresponding to an improvement in 21.8% and a worsening in 31%. There were no differences based on the type of vaccine used. After a complete vaccination scheme, 93.3% (28/30) of initially seronegative patients reported a positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. A total of 170 PASC patients had not been vaccinated. The most common reasons for postponing the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were fear of worsening PASC symptoms (55.9%) and the belief that vaccination was contraindicated because of PASC (15.6%). Conclusion: Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is well tolerated in the majority of PASC patients and has good immunogenicity.

The country set up its national PV center in 2015 and joined WHOs Program for International Drug Monitoring (PIDM) in 2018 as a full member. The current study was aimed to evaluate the PV systems functionality, identify the gaps, areas of improvement, and a strategy to lead a functional PV system in Pakistan. Methods: The descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted by providing an interviewer-administered questionnaire of the PV system across Pakistan by utilizing the Indicator based Pharmacovigilance assessment tool (IPAT). By a convenience sampling method 36 study participants were selected from the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP), drug administration of provincial health departments of 4 provinces and federally affiliated areas, 5 national public health programs, and 23 public and private hospitals. The assessment includes document review, interviews of the key informants by structured open-ended questions, and a review of websites of relevant organizations. Results: Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) with a national PV center received a 75% overall performance score on IPAT. To be regarded as minimally functioning, a countrys PV and drug safety system must meet all core indicators. DRAP scored 80.76% on the core indicators so cannot be deemed functional at this time. The only province with a regional PV center, Punjab, had scored 72.13% on relevant parameters. Despite receiving funding from the Global Fund, none of the National Public Health Programs (PHPs) have PV centers or associated activities. All hospitals except two private hospitals could not qualify the minimum requirements for functional PV. The absence of a legal framework for mandatory ADR reporting, lack of drug information center, budgetary constraints, no active surveillance activities, the nonexistence of pharmacovigilance risk assessment expert committee, and insufficient coordination among stakeholders were identified as major gaps. Conclusion: The results of the study reveal that Pakistans PV system is not fully functional at all levels. A two-phased strategy encompassing the non-financial and financial interventions is proposed to improve the PV systems at the national, provincial, PHPs, and hospitals levels.","output":"Assessment of the Current State of Pharmacovigilance System in Pakistan Using Indicator-Based Assessment Tool"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Organisms have evolved a rapid and non-specific way to defend themselves via Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize specific signatures present on invading microbes and viruses. Once detected, these receptors flood the cell with cytokines and IFNs that not only help to eradicate the invading viruses but also activate the adaptive immune response. Owing to difficulties in viral detection, a whole class of TLRs is dedicated to sensing viral nucleic acids, while other TLRs detect viral coat proteins and aid in establishing antiviral immunity. To protect humans better, TLRs and their downstream mediators can be used as potential drug targets, which can be either activated or inhibited, to counter viral infections. AREAS COVERED The current review focuses on TLR-targeting investigational drugs developed to treat viral diseases and virus-induced complications. EXPERT OPINION TLRs are a good choice for eradicating viral infections because they can fine-tune the immune response. However, TLRs should be exploited carefully, as there have been instances where their activation has led to unwanted responses in terms of both immune and viral activation. Therefore, more focus should be placed on novel drugs that can induce significant and long-term immunity, while concomitantly alleviating side effects.","output":"Advances in Antiviral Therapies Targeting Toll-like Receptors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conflicting results have been published on prognostic significance of central venous to arterial PCO(2) difference (?PCO(2)) after cardiac surgery.

Of these, ten patients with rectal neuroendocrine tumors were reviewed retrospectively. The full-thickness excision down to the outer fatty tissues was completed using TAMIS technique. Clinicopathological findings, perioperative and postoperative complications were recorded. RESULTS TAMIS for small rNET was successfully completed in all cases. There were seven cases with a tumor size of less than 10 mm, and three cases with a tumor size between 10 and 15 mm. Six patients underwent the primary tumor excision; the remaining four patients underwent resection for the scar after endoscopic procedure. The median surgical duration was 80.5 (53-124) minutes and the median blood loss was 1 (1-12) ml. All removed tumors in the 6 primary excisions were diagnosed as neuroendocrine tumor G1. The margins of specimens were completely free in all cases. Among the four patients after endoscopic procedure, all had no histological evidence of residual tumor. The median length of hospital stay was 7 days postoperatively. There was no post-operative mortality or severe complication. The median length of observation was 54 months.

Five databases were systematically searched for studies investigating the relationship between general- and domain-specific cognition and longer-term (>3 months) basic activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental ADLs, and participation outcomes. Eligibility for inclusion, data extraction, and study quality was evaluated by 2 reviewers using a standardized protocol. Effect sizes (r) were estimated using a random-effects model. Sixty-two publications were retained for review, comprising 7817 stroke survivors (median age 63.57 years, range:18-96 years). Median length of follow-up was 12 months (range: 3 months-11 years). Cognition (all domains combined) demonstrated a significant medium association with all 3 functional outcomes combined, r=0.37 (95% CI, 0.33-0.41), P<0.001. Moderator analyses revealed these effects persisted regardless of study quality, order in which outcomes were collected (sequential versus concurrent), age, sample size, or follow-up period.

The HSS is a 4-component family support program for children starting school (5C7 years of age) promoting healthy dietary habits and physical activity in the home environment to prevent childhood obesity and parents risk of developing type 2 diabetes. METHODS: IMPROVE is a cluster-randomized controlled trial with two arms to evaluate and compare the effects of two different bundles of implementation strategies on intervention fidelity expressed as adherence and responsiveness at 12 and 24 months (primary outcomes). Thirty schools in two municipalities will participate in the study reaching about 1400 families per school year. In stakeholder workshops, key implementation determinants were identified according to the domains of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Through a consensus process with stakeholders, two bundles of implementation strategies were tailored to address context-specific determinants. Schools randomly assigned to group 1 will receive bundle 1 (Basic) and group 2 will receive bundle 1 + 2 (Enhanced). Bundle 2 consists of external facilitation, fidelity monitoring and feedback strategies. Secondary outcomes will include change in acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and organisational readiness as perceived by school staff. In addition, child weight status and diet, and parents feeding practices and risk of type 2 diabetes will be monitored. Linear and ordinal regression analysis will be used to test the effect on the primary and secondary outcomes, taking clustering and covariates into consideration where needed. Process evaluation will be conducted through key stakeholder interviews to investigate experiences of the program and perceptions on sustainability.

However, the mechanism of APAP-induced inflammation in liver injury is still controversial. Therefore, effective drug intervention is urgently needed. The aim of this study was to explore the inflammatory exact mechanism of APAP, especially on neutrophils, and to study the intervention effect of Chikusetsusaponin V (CKV) derived from Panax japonicus. Establishment of hepatotoxicity model of APAP in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, HepG2 cells, AML12 cells, primary mouse hepatocytes and neutrophils were used to mimic APAP-affected hepatocytes and neutrophil. In vivo, C57BL/6 mice were administrated overdose of APAP with or without neutrophil depletion or abolishing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation. In this study, APAP stimulation increased the level of HMGB1, IL-1 and Caspase-1 in mouse liver, especially hepatocytes, which had a synergistic effect with LPS/ATP combination. NETs were formatted at early stage of APAP or HMGB1-stimulated neutrophils damage. Conditioned mediums from APAP-treated hepatocytes induced more significant NETs than direct APAP stimulation. Neutrophil depletion or abolishing NETs formation decreased HMGB1 level, eventually blocked hepatocytes necrosis. CKV pretreatment interfered Caspase-1 activation and HMGB1 release in APAP-damaged hepatocytes. CKV also prevented NETs formation. These results indicate that the production of HMGB1 may depend on the activation of Caspase-1 and play a key role in liver inflammation caused by APAP. The cross-dialogue between hepatocytes and neutrophils can be mediated by HMGB1. Therefore, CKV has a positive intervention effect on NETs-related inflammation in APAP-damaged liver, targeting Caspase-1-HMGB1.","output":"Modulation of HMGB1 Release in APAP-Induced Liver Injury: A Possible Strategy of Chikusetsusaponin V Targeting NETs Formation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 transmission in K-12 schools was rare during in 2020-2021; few studies included CDC-recommended screening of asymptomatic individuals.

However, little is known about the impact of social media use, unhealthy lifestyles and the risk of miscarriage among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the association between social media use, unhealthy lifestyles and the risk of miscarriage among pregnant women in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 456 singleton pregnant women in mainland China were recruited during January and February, 2020. Social-demographic characteristics, history of previous health, social media use, and current lifestyles was collected at baseline and the occurrence of miscarriage was followed up. Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate the risk ratios (RRs) of miscarriage for women with different exposure of COVID-19-specipfic information. RESULTS: Among all the 456 pregnant women, there were 82 (18.0%) without any physical activities, 82 (18.0%) with inadequate dietary diversity, 174 (38.2%) with poor sleep quality, and 54 (11.8%) spending &#8805; 3 hours on reading COVID-19 news per day. Women with excessive media use (&#8805;3h) were more likely to be previous pregnant, never taking physical activities, with inadequate dietary diversity, and poor sleep quality (all P<.05). The prevalence of miscarriage was 16.0% (95% CI: 12.6%-19.4%). Compared with women who spent 0.5-2h (10.1%) on reading COVID-19 news per day, miscarriage prevalence in women who spent <0.5h (21.7%), 2-3h (19.7%) and &#8805;3h (31.5%) were higher (P<.05). Miscarriage prevalence was also higher in pregnant women with poor sleep quality (22.4% vs 12.1%, P<.05) and high educational level (17.9% vs 8.0%, P<.05). In the multivariable model, poor sleep quality (adjusted RR, 2.06; 95% CI: 1.24-3.44), 2-3h media use daily (adjusted RR, 1.74; 95% CI: 1.02-2.97), and &#8805; 3h media use daily (adjusted RR, 2.56; 95% CI: 1.43-4.59) were associated with miscarriage (all P<.05) (all P<.05). In the sensitivity analysis, results were still stable. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with excessive media use were more likely to be never taking physical activities, with inadequate dietary diversity, and poor sleep quality. Excessive media use and poor sleep quality was associated with the higher risk of miscarriage.

Here, we show cysteine protease Cathepsin L (CatL) involvement with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 from different points of view. CatL is a lysosomal enzyme that participates in numerous physiological processes, including apoptosis, antigen processing, and extracellular matrix remodeling. CatL is implicated in pathological conditions like invasion and metastasis of tumors, inflammatory status, atherosclerosis, renal disease, diabetes, bone diseases, viral infection, and other diseases. CatL expression is up-regulated during chronic inflammation and is involved in degrading extracellular matrix, an important process for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells. In addition, CatL is probably involved in processing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. As its inhibition is detrimental to SARS-CoV-2 infection and possibly exit from cells during late stages of infection, CatL could have been considered a valuable therapeutic target. Therefore, we describe here some drugs already in the market with potential CatL inhibiting capacity that could be used to treat COVID-19 patients.

It is not known whether gender differences in patient preferences explain some of the observed variations in stroke care delivery. METHODS Outpatients with and without a history of cerebrovascular disease were recruited from stroke, vascular, and general internal medicine ambulatory clinics between September 2002 and October 2003. Self-administered surveys described hypothetical scenarios, and participants were asked if they would accept therapy with thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke or carotid endarterectomy for secondary stroke prevention. The surveys also included questions on sociodemographic factors and decision-making preferences. RESULTS A total of 586 patients (45% women) completed the survey. Women were less likely than men to accept thrombolysis (79% vs. 86%, P=0.014), even after adjustment for other factors (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.92). Women and men were equally likely to accept carotid endarterectomy (82% vs. 84%, P=0.502), even after adjustment for other factors (adjusted OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.58- 1.53). Women were less confident in their decisions, were more risk averse, and would have preferred more information to assist them in their decision-making. CONCLUSIONS No gender differences were found in patient preferences for carotid surgery. However, we observed gender differences in patient preferences for thrombolysis and in general attitudes toward stroke care decision-making.

A range of measures are necessary to slow the pandemic and save lives, which include constant evaluation and the careful adjustment of public-health responses augmented by medical treatments, vaccines and protective gear. It is hypothesized that nanostructured particulates underpinned by nanoscience and quantum science yield high-performing antiviral strategies, which can be applied in preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications such as face masks, respirators, COVID test kits, vaccines, and drugs. This review is aimed at providing comprehensive and cohesive perspectives on various nanostructures that are suited to intensifying and amplifying the effectiveness of antiviral strategies. Growing scientific literature over the past eighteen months indicates that quantum dots, iron oxide, silicon oxide, polymeric and metallic nanoparticles have been employed in COVID-19 diagnostic assays, vaccines, and personal protective equipment (PPE). Quantum dots have displayed their suitability as more sensitive imaging probes in diagnostics and prognostics, and as controlled drug-release carriers that target the virus. Nanoscience and quantum science have assisted the design of advanced vaccine delivery since nanostructured materials are suited for antigen delivery, as mimics of viral structures and as adjuvants. Furthermore, the quantum science- and nanoscience-supported tailored functionalization of nanostructured materials offers insight and pathways to deal with future pandemics. This review seeks to illustrate several examples, and to explain the underpinning quantum science and nanoscience phenomena, which include wave functions, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces, thermal and electrodynamic fluctuations, dispersion forces, local field-enhancement effects, and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

In human and mouse, asTF protein features a unique C-terminus that lacks a transmembrane domain, rendering it soluble. asTF protein is able to associate with a subset on integrins on cell surfaces, which can trigger outside-in signaling programs in a variety of cell types. In this review, we discuss recent findings on asTFs proto-oncogenic effects, regulatory mechanisms enabling asTFs biosynthesis, and asTFs potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target. ABSTRACT: In human and mouse, alternative splicing of tissue factors primary transcript yields two mRNA species: one features all six TF exons and encodes full-length tissue factor (flTF), and the other lacks exon 5 and encodes alternatively spliced tissue factor (asTF). flTF, which is oftentimes referred to as TF, is an integral membrane glycoprotein due to the presence of an alpha-helical domain in its C-terminus, while asTF is soluble due to the frameshift resulting from the joining of exon 4 directly to exon 6. In this review, we focus on asTFthe more recently discovered isoform of TF that appears to significantly contribute to the pathobiology of several solid malignancies. There is currently a consensus in the field that asTF, while dispensable to normal hemostasis, can activate a subset of integrins on benign and malignant cells and promote outside-in signaling eliciting angiogenesis; cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; and monocyte recruitment. We provide a general overview of the pioneering, as well as more recent, asTF research; discuss the current concepts of how asTF contributes to cancer progression; and open a conversation about the emerging utility of asTF as a biomarker and a therapeutic target.","output":"Functional Characteristics and Regulated Expression of Alternatively Spliced Tissue Factor: An Update"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The origin and distribution of hexavalent chromium, Cr (VI) over four seasonal cycles was investigated through a conceptual model that included three aquifer systems in Cyprus.

In India, more than 50% of the total cases were documented in megacities and million-plus cities. The slums of cities are the most vulnerable due to its unhygienic environment and high population density that requires an urgent implementation of public healthcare measures. This study aims to examine habitat vulnerability in slum areas to COVID-19 in India using principal component analysis and Fuzzy AHP based technique to develop slum vulnerability index to COVID-19 (SVI(covid-19)). Four slum vulnerability groups (i.e. principal components) were retained with eigen-values greater than 1 based on Kaiser criterion - poor slum household status; lack of social distance maintenance; high concentrations of slum population and towns and mobility of the households. This study also mapped composite SVI(covid-19) on the basis of PCA and Fuzzy AHP method at the state level for a better understanding of spatial variations. The result shows that slums located in the eastern and central parts of India (particularly Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal) were more vulnerable to COVID-19 transmission due to lack of availability as well as accessibility to the basic services and amenities to slum dwellers. Thus, the findings of the study may not only help to understand the habitat vulnerability in slum areas to COVID-19 but it will also teach a lesson to implement effective policies for enhancing the quality of slum households (HHs) and to reduce the health risk from any infectious disease in future.","output":"Habitat vulnerability in slum areas of India C What we learnt from COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel pneumonia virus known as Covid-19 exceeds prior intervention, triggering the use of medical technology approach to counter the rise of coronavirus cases that spread uncontrollably around the globe.

Because of the rapid spread of the virus among people, there is limited number of testing kits available in hospitals. Since, the doctors cannot depend only on these kits, it is necessary to find an alternate way to prevent this pandemic disease. To overcome this situation, it is necessary to implement the recognition of quick substitute diagnosis options for the prevention of COVID-19 among the people. In the proposed work, the main concentration is made by considering the COVID-19 chest X-ray images and the normal chest X-ray images to build the customized deep learning classification model. Then the images obtained from the data sources both from COVID-19 chest X-ray images and from normal chest X-ray images are combined together. Roughly 20% of the images were randomly selected and used for validation, and the remaining 80% of images were used for training purpose. The dataset was carefully screened to have only relevant chest X-ray images removing images of other type or the images which lacked resolution to get the final dataset. To obtain a better accuracy, a customized convolutional neural network architecture was built for this purpose.

Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic drug that has gained interest among researchers due to its in vitro antiviral activity. Despite its novelty, its efficacy has not yet been proven. Therefore, we aim to conduct a living systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of ivermectin on adult patients with COVID-19.Methods: We performed a living systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of ivermectin on adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Six medical databases were searched for studies published from January 2019 to January 30, 2021. For meta-analyses, random-effects models were used to estimate outcome measures assuming high heterogeneity between studies. When a low-heterogeneity was expected, fixed-effects models were assessed. The study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021235402Findings: Ten trials including 1426 patients proved eligible. Pooled analysis in six studies (941 patients), with an overall high risk of bias, showed ivermectin to reduce mortality (OR 0.16;95% CI 0.08 to 0.33;I 2=0%;p=0.81). Three studies reported time to viral clearance as outcome showing a statistically significant difference favoring the ivermectin group (MD - 3.83;95% CI -5.43 to -2.22;I 2=81%;p<0.01). No positive effect was found regarding ivermectin prophylaxis. As for the other outcomes, no statistically significant results were found. The global assessment of the quality of evidence exhibited very low confidence in the estimates of effect for ivermectin on several important and critical outcomes.Interpretation: The available body of evidence suggests ivermectin reduces mortality and time to viral clearance in adult patients with COVID-19. The evidence, however, is of low-quality which reduces the confidence of the results. There is no sufficient available data to suggest ivermectin has a prophylactic effect.

A survey was completed by 160 patients of the National Cancer Centre Singapore, and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. The study found that 95.6% (n = 153/160) of participants did not have prior telehealth experience. Most participants were willing or neutral toward having genetic counseling by phone (n = 114/160, 71.3%) and video (n = 106/160, 66.3%). However, majority prefer in-person appointments for first (n = 127/160, 79.4%) and follow-up (n = 97/160, 60.6%) visits over telehealth. Majority agreed that a phone/video consultation would meet most of their needs but voiced concerns regarding privacy and sharing of information (n = 79/160, 49.4% for phone; n = 74/160, 46.3% for video) and whether their emotional needs could be met (n = 61/160, 38.1%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a multicentric retrospective study enrolling 570 COVID-19 patients who performed a chest CT in emergency settings in two different institutions. Fifty-three age- and sex-matched healthy controls were also identified. Chest CTs were analyzed with CALIPER identifying the percentage of VRS over the total lung parenchyma. Patients were followed for up to 72 days recording mortality and required intensity of care. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in VRS between COVID-19-positive patients and controls (median (iqr) 4.05 (3.74) and 1.57 (0.40) respectively, p = 0.0001). VRS showed an increasing trend with the severity of care, p < 0.0001. The univariate Cox regression model showed that VRS increase is a risk factor for mortality (HR 1.17, p < 0.0001). The multivariate analysis demonstrated that VRS is an independent explanatory factor of mortality along with age (HR 1.13, p < 0.0001).

These 203 participants were an average of 31 years old, 72.3% were white, 60.4% were cis-male, and 55% self-identified as gay. Seventy-one percent (n = 144) belonged to a priority group for HIV testing. We have results for 70.9% (n = 129/182) of participants who ordered a kit: none were positive, 104 were negative, 22 were invalid, and 2 \\"preferred not to say\\"; 1 participant reported an unreadiness to test. IMPLICATIONS: Our results show that HIV self-testing is a pandemic-friendly strategy to help ensure access to sexual health services among persons who are good candidates for HIV testing. It is unsurprising that no one tested positive for HIV thus far, given the 0.08% positivity rate for HIV testing in Ottawa. As such, we advocate for scale-up of HIV self-testing in Canada.","output":"At-home HIV self-testing during COVID: implementing the GetaKit project in Ottawa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo Este artigo analisa como o federalismo brasileiro tem afetado o combate  COVID-19 Tendo por base uma anlise histrico-institucional do caso brasileiro, busca-se compreender como o modelo federativo construdo pelo governo Bolsonaro influenciou as respostas ao combate da pandemia no pas, bem como os resultados do confronto de dois modelos federativos nesse processo De um lado, o iderio e as estruturas institucionais da Constitui??o de 1988 com caractersticas cooperativas e forte coordena??o federal De outro, o federalismo bolsonarista baseia-se numa vis?o dualista de rela??es intergovernamentais, com menor participa??o da Uni?o na redu??o de desigualdades territoriais e no apoio a governos subnacionais, alm da postura centralizadora e hierrquica nas quest?es de impacto nacional O estudo mostra que o federalismo bolsonarista aumentou o conflito com governos subnacionais e tem descoordenado polticas pblicas de enfrentamento  pandemia Conclui-se que as crises sanitria e federativa caminham juntas e trazem  tona uma quest?o chave: a importancia da coordena??o governamental nas polticas pblicas de enfrentamento  pandemia Resumen Este artculo analiza cmo el federalismo brasile?o ha afectado la lucha contra la COVID-19 A partir de un anlisis histrico-institucional del caso brasile?o, buscamos comprender cmo el modelo federativo construido por el gobierno de Bolsonaro influy en las respuestas para combatir la pandemia en el pas, as como los resultados de la confrontacin de dos modelos federativos en este proceso Por un lado, el ideario y las estructuras institucionales de la Constitucin de 1988 con caractersticas cooperativas y una fuerte coordinacin federal Por otro, el federalismo bolsonarista que se basa en una visin dualista de las relaciones intergubernamentales, con menos participacin del Gobierno Federal en la reduccin de las desigualdades territoriales y en el apoyo a los gobiernos subnacionales, adems de la postura centralizadora y jerrquica en materias de impacto nacional El estudio muestra que el federalismo bolsonarista ha aumentado el conflicto con los gobiernos subnacionales y ha descoordinado las polticas pblicas de combate a la pandemia Se concluye que las crisis sanitaria y federativa van juntas y plantean una cuestin clave: la importancia de la coordinacin gubernamental en la implementacin de polticas pblicas de enfrentamiento a la pandemia y sus efectos sociales y econmicos This article analyzes how federalism has affected policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil Through historical-institutional analysis, the study examines how the model of federalism adopted by President Bolsonaro&#039;s government influenced policy responses to the pandemic in the country In addition, the research points out the existence of two models of federalism in the case analyzed, addressing the outcomes of the confrontation between them The first model refers to ideas and institutional structures that have emerged since the 1988 Brazilian Federal Constitution with cooperative features and strong federal coordination The second, named &quot;Bolsonaro&#039;s federalism,&quot;is based on a dualistic view of intergovernmental relations with little participation of the federal government in reducing territorial inequalities and supporting subnational governments, while centralizing issues of national importance and adopting a hierarchical stance The study shows that Bolsonaro&#039;s government increased the conflict with subnational governments and jeopardized the coordination of policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic We conclude that healthcare and federative crises go together and raise a key question: what is the importance of governmental coordination to implement policies to respond to the pandemic and its social and economic effects?","output":"Combating COVID-19 under Bolsonaros federalism: a case of intergovernmental incoordination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This critical review interrogates what we know about how poverty and deprivation impact people at the end of life and what more we need to uncover. While we know that people in economically resource-rich countries who experience poverty and deprivation over the life course are likely to die younger, with increased co-morbidities, palliative care researchers are beginning to establish a full picture of the disproportionate impact of poverty on how, when and where we die. This is something the Covid-19 pandemic has further illustrated. Our article uses a critical social science lens to investigate an eclectic range of literature addressing health inequities and is focused on poverty and deprivation at the end of life. Our aim was to see if we could shed new light on the myriad ways in which experiences of poverty shape the end of peoples lives. We start by exploring the definitions and language of poverty while acknowledging the multiple intersecting identities that produce privilege. We then discuss poverty and deprivation as a context for the nature of palliative care need and overall end-of-life circumstances. In particular, we explore: total pain; choice at the end of life; access to palliative care; and family caregiving. Overall, we argue that in addressing the effects of poverty and deprivation on end-of-life experiences, there is a need to recognise not just socio-economic injustice but also cultural and symbolic injustice. Too often, a deficit-based approach is adopted which both Others those living with poverty and renders invisible the strategies and resilience they develop to support themselves, their families and communities. We conclude with some recommendations for future research, highlighting in particular the need to amplify the voices of people with lived experience of poverty regarding palliative and end-of-life care.","output":"The impact of poverty and deprivation at the end of life: a critical review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer immunotherapy, a promising and widely applied mode of oncotherapy, makes use of immune stimulants and modulators to overcome the immune dysregulation present in cancer, and leverage the hosts immune capacity to eliminate tumors.

Vaccine tourism is a novel health tourism concept, which provides an opportunity for countries with a vaccine surplus to offer medical tourism packages to entice international tourists from countries with vaccine shortages to visit for sightseeing and receive vaccine inoculations. Understanding the factors that influence people to adopt vaccine tourism is one of the strategies that could boost a countrys tourism sector and help to revive the local economy. This study aims to examine the factors influencing the intention to adopt and recommend COVID-19 vaccine tourism among young travelers. A total of 179 questionnaire surveys were collected from traveling-related social media outlets. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was performed to analyze the data. The results indicate that young tourists in Thailand are inclined to promote vaccine tourism to others. Price value appears to be the most significant influencing factor on intentions to both adopt and recommend vaccine tourism. Additionally, trust in the foreign healthcare system was positively associated with young travelers intention to recommend vaccine tourism to others. Theoretically, this research adds to the medical tourism literature, suggesting that, while trust is an important factor influencing the medical tourism decision, it appears to be insignificant in the context of vaccine tourism.","output":"Examining Factors Influencing COVID-19 Vaccine Tourism for International Tourists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Respiratory muscle training (RMT) has various clinical benefits in older adults; however, the low adherence to training remains a challenging issue. The present study aimed to confirm the efficacy of a new device that combines inspiratory muscle training and a positive expiratory pressure (IMT/PEP) compared to that of a Threshold IMT device (Philips Respironics Inc), and to determine whether home-based training differed from rehabilitation center training. METHODS: This four-arm, multicenter, parallel, non-inferiority trial randomized 80 active community-dwelling older men (mean age = 72.93  5.02 years) to center-based groups (new IMT/PEP device or Threshold IMT device; 16 supervised sessions) or home-based groups (new IMT/PEP device or Threshold IMT device; 2 supervised sessions and individual sessions). Participants in all groups performed RMT twice a day for 8 weeks. Assessments were performed at baseline and post-training. The primary outcomes were maximum inspiratory pressure and maximal expiratory pressure. The secondary outcomes included forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in the first second, peak cough flow, diaphragm thickness, VO(2) peak, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire score, electromyographic activities of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and skeletal muscle mass and phase angle as measured by bioimpedance analysis. In addition, rates of adherence to each protocol were also compared. RESULTS: Among all groups, the maximal inspiratory pressure was improved post-training, while the maximal expiratory pressure showed improvement only in the IMT/PEP groups. The overall non-inferiority of the IMT/PEP device was thus validated. A statistically significant improvement in diaphragm thickness was found. However, no consistent improvement was shown in other secondary outcomes. No significant difference in training adherence rate between protocols was observed (mean adherence rate of 91C99%). CONCLUSION: Compared to the Threshold IMT, the new IMT/PEP device did not result in a significant difference in maximal inspiratory pressure but did improve maximal expiratory pressure in older men. The IMT/PEP devices improved usability, which is associated with exercise adherence, provided distinct advantages in this cohort. If proper education is first provided, home-based RMT alone may provide sufficient effects in older individuals.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted from 01 April 2020 to 31 August 2020 involving files review of 171 patients admitted to the ICU of a COVID-19 treatment centre as a result of severe symptoms. RESULTS: Around a third of the ICU patients admitted were over 66 years of age, 59.6% males, 45% diabetics, 39% hypertensive, 25.7% smokers. Patients had symptoms such as 79% fever, 78% cough, 75% headache, 59% sore throat, 57% runny nose, and 75% cough. More than half of the patients had less than 90% oxygen saturation.

Mortality data from COVID-19 were obtained from the Ministry of Health and Medical Education. Since the calculation of mortality rates requires the number of people at risk of death, this data was obtained from the Statistics Center of Iran and was used after a detailed evaluation. The effect of COVID-19 on mortality is evaluated using the techniques of a multi-decrement life table and the corresponding single-reduction life table. The YLL is calculated using the standard method provided by the World Health Organization. Results: Analysis of mortality data showed that deaths due to COVID-19 could reduce life expectancy at birth by 1.4 years in 2020. Therefore, life expectancy at birth declined from 75.1 years to 73.7 years. Furthermore, the deaths due to COVID-19 from the outbreak to early February 2021 have caused about 800,000 years of YLL, which is almost as much as the YLL caused by cancers and tumors. Conclusion: A decrease in life expectancy at birth by more than one year in countries with a life expectancy of over 70 years, such as Iran, can delay the increase in life expectancy for several years.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 Epidemic on Life Expectancy and Years of Life Lost in Iran: A Secondary Data Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background In the midst of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, a lot more chaos could be anticipated in the flu season due to the coexistence of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza with almost similar epidemiologic and clinical features Could this become a \\"twindemic\\" or \\"syndemic\\" if there is any viral interference occurs?

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In Haiti 568 households (incorporating 2900 members) with children less than 5 years of age were randomly sampled geographically with stratifications for population density. These households identified the healthcare providers they frequented. Among 140 providers, 65 were located and enrolled. OUTCOME MEASURES: Household questionnaires with standardised cases (intentions) were compared with self-recall of health events (behaviours). The connectedness of households and their providers was determined by network analysis. RESULTS: Households reported 636 health events in the prior month. Households sought care for 35% (n=220) and treated with home remedies for 44% (n=277). The odds of seeking care increased 217% for severe events (adjusted OR (aOR)=3.17; 95% CI 1.99 to 5.05; p<0.001). The odds of seeking care from a conventional provider increased by 37% with increasing distance (aOR=1.37; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.79; p=0.016). Despite stating an intention to seek care from conventional providers, there was a lack of congruence in practice that favoured non-conventional providers (McNemars (2) test p<0.001). Care was sought from primary providers for 68% (n=150) of cases within a three-tiered network; 25% (n=38/150) were non-conventional.

The complex nature of geriatric syndromes coupled with the occurrence of multiple comorbid illnesses with aging, make geriatric assessment a resource intensive process. Digital health solutions could play an important role in supporting existing health care systems, especially in low and middle income countries, with limited speciality services in geriatrics. Objective: This is a pilot study aimed at screening for geriatric syndromes through self-administered online surveys in urban community dwelling older Malaysians and assessing the pattern of geriatric syndromes in relation to the frailty status of the study participants. Methods: This is a cross-sectional pilot study conducted between July-September 2020. Community dwelling adults aged 60 years and over were invited to take part in an online survey. Information on sociodemographic variables, comorbidities, and the self-reported results of geriatric syndromes (frailty, sarcopenia, anorexia of aging, urinary incontinence, falls, and cognitive impairment), were collected through the survey. Results: Data was collected for 162 participants over a period of 2 months. The mean (SD) age of the respondents was 66.42 (5.25) years with 64.9% females. Majority of the respondents were of Chinese ethnic origin (67.9%) and had tertiary level of education (75.9%). The average time taken by participants to complete the survey was 16.86 min. Urinary incontinence was the highest reported geriatric syndrome (55.1%) followed by falls (37.6%), anorexia of aging (32.8%), cognitive impairment (27.8%), and sarcopenia (8.3%). Frailty was detected in 4.5% of the study population. Loss of weight in the previous year was the highest reported component of the frailty assessment tool. The presence of sarcopenia, anorexia of aging, poor/fair self-rated health, urinary incontinence, and multimorbidity were significantly higher in older adults who were frail or prefrail. Conclusion: Screening for geriatric syndromes through online surveys is a feasible approach to identify older adults in the community who are likely to benefit from geriatric assessment. However, the demographic profile of the older population that are accessible through such digital platforms is limited.","output":"Online Multi-Domain Geriatric Health Screening in Urban Community Dwelling Older Malaysians: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: A pituitary adenoma patient who underwent surgery in our department was diagnosed with COVID-19 and 14 medical staff were confirmed infected later. This case has been cited several times but without accuracy or entirety, we feel obligated to report it and share our thoughts on the epidemic among medical staff and performing endonasal endoscopic surgery during COVID-19 pandemic. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: The patient developed a fever 3 d post endonasal endoscopic surgery during which cerebrospinal leak occurred, and was confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection later. Several medical staff outside the operating room were diagnosed with COVID-19, while the ones who participated in the surgery were not. CONCLUSION: The deceptive nature of COVID-19 results from its most frequent onset symptom, fever, a clich in neurosurgery, which makes it hard for surgeons to differentiate. The COVID-19 epidemic among medical staff in our department was deemed as postoperative rather than intraoperative transmission, and attributed to not applying sufficient personal airway protection. Proper personal protective equipment and social distancing between medical staff contributed to limiting epidemic since the initial outbreak. Emergency endonasal endoscopic surgeries are feasible since COVID-19 is still supposed to be containable when the surgeries are performed in negative pressure operating rooms with personal protective equipment and the patients are kept under quarantine postoperatively. However, we do not encourage elective surgeries during this pandemic, which might put patients in conditions vulnerable to COVID-19.","output":"A COVID-19 Patient Who Underwent Endonasal Endoscopic Pituitary Adenoma Resection: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Classifications were created to facilitate radiological evaluation of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on computed tomography (CT) images. The categorical CT assessment scheme (CO-RADS) categorizes lung parenchymal changes according to their likelihood of being caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study investigates the diagnostic accuracy of diagnosing COVID-19 with CO-RADS compared to the Thoracic Imaging Section of the German Radiological Society (DRG) classification and Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) classification in an anonymized patient cohort. To mimic advanced disease stages, follow-up examinations were included as well. METHOD This study includes all patients undergoing chest CT in the case of a suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection or an already confirmed infection between March 13 and November 30, 2020. During the study period, two regional lockdowns occurred due to high incidence values, increasing the pre-test probability of COVID-19. Anonymized CT images were reviewed retrospectively and in consensus by two radiologists applying CO-RADS, DRG, and RSNA classification. Afterwards, CT findings were compared to results of sequential real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) test performed during hospitalization to determine statistical analysis for diagnosing COVID-19. RESULTS 536 CT examinations were included. CO-RADS, DRG and RSNA achieved an NPV of 96 %/94 %/95 % (CO-RADS/DRG/RSNA), PPV of 83 %/80 %/88 %, sensitivity of 86 %/76 %/80 %, and specificity of 96 %/95 %/97 %. The disease prevalence was 20 %. CONCLUSION All applied classifications can reliably exclude a SARS-CoV-2 infection even in an anonymous setting. Nevertheless, pre-test probability was high in our study setting and has a great influence on the classifications. Therefore, the applicability of the individual classifications will become apparent in the future with lower prevalence and incidence of COVID-19.

However, it can also occur in diabetes patients, a fact that is sometimes overlooked. It is thus important to make a proper diabetes diagnosis if hospitalized patients with episodes of hyperglycemia with and without diabetes are studied. AIMS: To estimate the extent of the association between stress-induced hyperglycemia and in-hospital mortality in patients with hospital hyperglycemia (HH), and to explore potential differences between patients diagnosed with diabetes (HH-DBT) and those with stress-induced hyperglycemia (SH), but not diagnosed with diabetes. METHODS: A cohort of adults with hospital hyperglycemia admitted to a tertiary, university hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: In the study, 2,955 patients were included and classified for analysis as 1,579 SH and 1,376 HH-DBT. Significant differences were observed in glycemic goal (35.53% SH versus 25.80% HH-DBT, p < 0.01), insulin use rate (26.66% SH versus 46.58% HH-DBT, p < 0.01), and severe hypoglycemia rate (1.32% SH versus 1.74% HH-DBT, p < 0.01). There were no differences in hypoglycemia rate (8.23% SH versus 10.53% HH-DBT) and hospital mortality. There was no increase in risk of mortality in the SH group adjusted for age, non-scheduled hospitalization, major surgical intervention, critical care, hypoglycemia, oncological disease, cardiovascular comorbidity, and prolonged hospitalization.

To overcome the challenges with warfarin dosing at initiation, strategies other than conventional or fixed dosing were introduced and explored. Aim In this narrative review, we aim to discuss and critique the different dosing strategies for warfarin at initiation with more focus on genotype-guided warfarin dosing and the most recent supporting evidence for and against its use. Method Medline database was searched from 1965 to July 2021. Articles addressing different warfarin dosing methods were screened for inclusion. Results A number of methods exist for warfarin initiation. Studies comparing different dosing methods for initiation yielded conflicting outcomes due to differences in study design, population studied, comparator, and outcomes measured.

In addition to protein receptors, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein also interacts with heparan sulfate, a negatively charged glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attached to certain membrane proteins on the cell surface. This interaction facilitates the engagement of spike with a downstream receptor to promote viral entry. Here, we show that Mitoxantrone, an FDA-approved topoisomerase inhibitor, targets a spike-GAG complex to compromise the fusogenic function of spike in viral entry. As a single agent, Mitoxantrone inhibits the infection of an authentic SARS-CoV-2 strain in a cell-based model and in human lung EpiAirway 3D tissues. Gene expression profiling supports the plasma membrane as a major target of Mitoxantrone but also underscores an undesired activity targeting nucleosome dynamics. We propose that Mitoxantrone analogs bearing similar GAG-binding activities but with reduced affinity for DNA topoisomerase may offer an alternative therapy to overcome breakthrough infections in the post-vaccine era.","output":"Mitoxantrone modulates a glycosaminoglycan-spike complex to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The catalysis of disulphide (SS) bonds is the most important characteristic of protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) family.

This has been coupled with reduced numbers of available medical professionals due to confirmed or suspected infections with SARS-CoV-2. To counteract these shortages, governments of several countries have considered the enrolment of medical students into the workforce in order to help to tackle the ongoing crisis. METHODS: Questionnaire-based study assessing the perceived role of medical students in assisting in the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary aim was to determine factors contributing to the willingness of medical students to actively assist in the pandemic. The secondary aim was to evaluate their perspectives regarding the associated changes in medical education. RESULTS: Out of 760 responses, 71.18% of medical students were willing to assist the medical workforce during the pandemic. Clinical year students were more likely to help in a medical capacity than pre-clinical students (OR = 0.384, 95%CI [0.167, 0.883, P < 0.05)]. Respondents concerned about their own well-being were less likely to engage in clinical work (OR = 0.680, 95%CI [0.491, 0.941], P < 0.020).

Methods and results The aim of this prospective/retrospective study was to characterize the long-term consequences of this infection from a sex-perspective. For this purpose, we enrolled 223 patients (89 F and 134 M) who experienced a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the acute phase of the illness, females reported more frequently than males: weakness, dysgeusia, anosmia, thoracic pain, palpitations, diarrhoea, and myalgia without significant differences in breathlessness, cough, and sleep disturbance. After a mean follow-up time of 5 months after the acute phase, females were significantly more likely than males to report weakness, thoracic pain, palpitations, and sleep disturbance but not myalgia and cough. At the multivariate logistic regression, women were statistically significantly likely to experience persistent symptoms such as dyspnoea, fatigue, chest pain, and palpitations. On the contrary, myalgia, cough and sleep disturbance were not influenced by sex. Conclusions We demonstrated that females were more symptomatic than males not only in the acute phase but also at follow-up.

The aim of the probe is to provide evidence to support the identification of therapeutic targets in Chinese medicine treatment, which broadens the alternatives for the treatment of ARDS. METHOD: A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS model group is established on rats by tail vein injection. A medicine group is established on ARDS rats by prophylactic administration using YQHYJD. Materials are collected, and tests are conducted according to experimental processes. RESULT: The rats in the medicine group gained weight compared with those in the ARDS model group. Pathological sections from the medicine group indicated improved condition in terms of pulmonary and interstitial edema in the lung tissues of rats compared with that from the ARDS model group. The percentage of neutrophil of the medicine group was significantly brought down compared with that of the ARDS model group (P < 0.001). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the changes in the level of inflammatory cytokines. It was observed that the levels of IL-1 and IL-18 in serum of the medicine group significantly decreased (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01), the contents of TLR4 and NLRP3 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the medicine group decreased, and the contents of TLR4 and NLRP3 in lung tissue homogenate of the medicine group significantly decreased (P < 0.05, P < 0.001, P < 0.01, and P < 0.05).

Expression levels of these enzymes in the LITA and radial artery were compared in each subject. The expression and localization patterns of the enzymes were also analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of the cystathionine ?-synthase was greater in the LITA than in the radial artery (P = 0.033), whereas the expression levels of the other two enzymes did not significantly differ between the two arteries. The immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated greater expression of the cystathionine ?-synthase in the LITA than in the radial artery (P = 0.006). This protein was present in both tunica intima and tunica media of the LITA although it was present only in the tunica media of the radial artery. Localization patterns of the other two enzymes were not different between LITA and radial artery. CONCLUSIONS: Expression levels of the mRNA and protein of cystathionine ?-synthase were significantly greater in LITA than radial artery. These findings might be a factor that affect the superior patency rate of LITA.","output":"Comparative analysis of the hydrogen sulfide pathway in internal thoracic artery and radial artery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unknown","output":"Register"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has been a struggle for medical systems throughout the world. In austere locations in which testing, resupply, and evacuation have been limited or impossible, unique challenges exist. This case series demonstrates the importance of population isolation in preventing disease from overwhelming medical assets. METHODS This is a case series describing the outbreak of COVID-19 in an isolated population in Africa. The population consists of a main population with a Role 2 capability, with several supported satellite populations with a Role 1 capability. Outbreaks in five satellite population centers occurred over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic from its start on approximately 1 March 2020 until 28 April 2020, when a more robust medical asset became available at the central evacuation hub within the main population. RESULTS Population movement controls and the use of telehealth prevented the spread within the main population at risk and enabled the setup of medical assets to prepare for anticipated widespread disease. CONCLUSION Isolation of disease in the satellite populations and treating in place, rather than immediately moving to the larger population center's medical facilities, prevented widespread exposure. Isolation also protected critical patient transport capabilities for use for high-risk patients. In addition, this strategy provided time and resources to develop infrastructure to handle anticipated larger outbreaks.","output":"Isolating Populations to Control Pandemic Spread in an Austere Military Environment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is seen globally as a means to efficient and effective delivery of business and organisational mandates. Governments, in their quest to serve citizens, harness ICT to streamline their service delivery processes. e-Government transforms administrations into smart governments enhancing the social, political and economic inclusion and the quality of life of its citizens. However, the governments of developing countries are still facing challenges regarding transformation due to a myriad of obstacles, which include the lack of interoperability of e-government, lack of resources and lack of management commitment. Therefore, the aim of this study is to define an e-government implementation framework for developing countries. The 12 critical success factors identified for developing countries were mapped to the variables of Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) Theory in order to create the proposed implementation framework. The framework was then applied in a single case study at a government department in South Africa (SA) where the opinions of 110 managers were collected through an on-line questionnaire. By considering the e-government implementation framework, government departments are guided and enabled to prioritise specific elements in their implementation plan focusing on improved e-government delivery.","output":"An e-Government Implementation Framework: A Developing Country Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe the potential anti coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) action of the methide quinone inhibitor, celastrol. The related methide quinone dexamethasone is, so far, among COVID-19 medications perhaps the most effective drug for patients with severe symptoms. We observe a parallel redox biology behavior between the antioxidant action of celastrol when scavenging the superoxide radical, and the adduct formation of celastrol with the main COVID-19 protease. The related molecular mechanism is envisioned using molecular mechanics and dynamics calculations. It proposes a covalent bond between the S(Cys145) amino acid thiolate and the celastrol A ring, assisted by proton transfers by His164 and His41 amino acids, and a &#960; interaction from Met49 to the celastrol B ring. Specifically, celastrol possesses two moieties that are able to independently scavenge the superoxide radical: the carboxylic framework located at ring E, and the methide-quinone ring A. The latter captures the superoxide electron, releasing molecular oxygen, and is the feature of interest that correlates with the mechanism of COVID-19 inhibition. This unusual scavenging of the superoxide radical is described using density functional theory (DFT) methods, and is supported experimentally by cyclic voltammetry and X-ray diffraction.","output":"Interrelated Mechanism by Which the Methide Quinone Celastrol, Obtained from the Roots of Tripterygium wilfordii, Inhibits Main Protease 3CLpro of COVID-19 and Acts as Superoxide Radical Scavenger"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, beneficial use cases for hygienic, touchless human-machine interaction have been explored.

The interface works on a regular webcam, available on most of today's laptops, and only requires a one-point calibration before use. GaVe is designed in a hierarchical structure, presenting broad item cluster to users first and subsequently guiding them through another selection round, which allows the presentation of a large number of items. Cluster/item selection in GaVe is based on the dwell time of fixations, i.e., the time duration that users look at a given Cluster/item. A user study (N=22) was conducted to test optimal dwell time thresholds and comfortable human-to-display distances. Users' perception of the system, as well as error rates and task completion time were registered. We found that all participants were able to use the system with a short time training, and showed good performance during system usage, selecting a target item within a group of 12 items in 6.76 seconds on average.

The phenomenon was one of the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, which as a choice of local public policy involved social isolation and the need to adapt to not interrupt the provision of services. The research is quantitative, using a database extracted from institutional records of the main electronic systems used by the agency, with items of expenses analyzed using the Holt-Winters method and values at constant prices. The results show that the production levels maintained an average behavior after the initial adaptation period and that the number of employees allocated in the period remained stable, with a slight downward trend. There was a reduction in spending items (water, electricity and travel) in relation to their historical values. The work contributes to research in the area by presenting an empirical study involving teleworking and public administration, in a unique context provided by the pandemic, collaborating with quantitative information on public spending and production, which corroborate with perceptions identified in previous qualitative research.

Methods: Exploratory analyses involved meta-analysis of bulk and single cell RNA data for IFITM3 and FYN differential expression. For confirmatory analyses, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on an AD gene signature from AD Consensus transcriptomics;using the Enrichr platform, we scrutinized COVID-19 datasets for significant, overlapping enriched biological networks. Results: Bulk RNA data analysis revealed that IFITM3 and FYN were differentially expressed in two CNS regions in AD: the temporal cortex (AD vs. Controls, adj.p-value=1.3e-6) and the parahippocampal cortex (AD vs. controls, adj.p-value=0.012). Correspondingly, single cell RNA analysis of IFITM3 and FYN revealed that it was differentially expressed in neuronal cells donated from AD patients (astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocyte precursor cells), when compared to controls. Conclusion: IFITM3 and by extent FYN were found as interactors within biological networks overlapping between AD and SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2-mediated IFITM3 induction would mechanistically result in increased A production.

In this paper, we review current and potential approaches to this critical role of the FDA. The FDA has established pathways to accelerate vaccine availability prior to approval, such as emergency use authorization, and to channel resources to high-priority products and allow more flexibility in the evidence required for approval, including accelerated approval based on surrogate markers of effectiveness. Among the 35 new vaccines approved in the US from 2006-2020, about two-thirds of their pivotal trials used the surrogate outcome of immune system response, and just one-third evaluated actual disease incidence. Post-approval safety surveillance of new vaccines-particularly vaccines receiving expedited approval-is crucial. Currently this is accomplished through such mechanisms as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, the CDC Vaccine Safety Datalink, and the CDC Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Project. Adverse events detected in this way may lead to changes in a vaccine's recommended use or its withdrawal from the market. Regulatory oversight of new vaccines will have to balance speed with rigor and decisiveness to effectively address the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

We analysed whether perioperative bilateral BIS monitoring may detect abnormalities before the onset of POD in cardiac surgery patients. METHODS In a prospective observational study, 81 patients undergoing cardiac surgery were included. Bilateral Bispectral Index (BIS)-monitoring was applied during the pre-, intra- and postoperative period, and BIS, EEG Asymmetry (ASYM), and Burst Suppression Ratio (BSR) were recorded. POD was diagnosed according to the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit, and patients were divided into a delirium and non-delirium group. RESULTS POD was detected in 26 patients (32%). A trend towards a lower ASYM was observed in the delirium group as compared to the non-delirium group on the preoperative day (ASYM = 48.2  3.6% versus 50.0  4.7%, mean  sd, p = 0.087) as well as before induction of anaesthesia, with oral midazolam anxiolysis (median ASYM = 49.5%, IQR [47.4;51.5] versus 50.6%, IQR [49.1;54.2], p = 0.081). Delirious patients remained significantly (p = 0.018) longer in a burst suppression state intraoperatively (107 minutes, IQR [47;170] versus 44 minutes, IQR [11;120]) than non-delirious patients.

This case highlights the need to be aware of improperly fitted face masks as a cause of artifact on standard automated perimetry (SAP). CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old female underwent SAP with the 24-2 SITA Fast test of the Humphrey Field Analyzer wearing an ear-loop surgical face mask. At the end of testing, it was noted that the mask had ridden up the patient's face. Small amounts of condensate were noted on the perimeter lens. CLINICAL FINDINGS: SAP demonstrated good reliability indices but in both eyes, there was a marked reduction in sensitivity inferiorly. The glaucoma hemifield test was outside normal limits. It was ensured the upper border of the mask was well sealed with the loops secured around the ears and nasal strip of the mask pinched down. Visual fields were repeated and were found to be normal. CONCLUSIONS: Poorly fitting face masks represent a new cause of visual field artifact which may mimic pathologic field defects. Without careful attention during testing, the cause of such artifacts may not be apparent, especially as reliability indices may be normal.

A 2020 global study (n = 46,054) found that, in comparison to women, men experienced the greatest levels of loneliness. Although research on predictors of loneliness during COVID-19 is increasing, little is known about the characteristics of men who may be particularly vulnerable. Studies using prospective data are needed to inform preventative measures to support men at risk of loneliness. The current study draws on rare longitudinal data from an Australian cohort of men in young to mid-adulthood (n = 283; aged M = 34.6, SD = 1.38 years) to examine 25 pre-pandemic psychosocial predictors of loneliness during COVID-19 social restrictions (MarchCSeptember 2020). Adjusted linear regressions identified 22 pre-pandemic predictors of loneliness across a range of trait-based, relational, career/home and mental health variables. Given the extensive set of predictors, we then conducted penalized regression models (LASSO), a machine learning approach, allowing us to identify the best fitting multivariable set of predictors of loneliness during the pandemic. In these models, men's sense of pre-pandemic environmental mastery emerged as the strongest predictor of loneliness. Depression, neuroticism and social support also remained key predictors of pandemic loneliness (R(2) = 26, including covariates).

RESULTS: To enhance the immune efficiency of CEA in mice that received, we fused a partial CEA gene with exogenous SARS-CoV fragments. Oral vaccination of an attenuated Salmonella typhimurium strain transformed with plasmids encoding CEA-SARS-CoV fusion gene into BALB/c mice elicited significant increases in TNF- and IL-10 in the serum. In addition, a smaller tumor volume was observed in CT26/CEA-bearing mice who received CEA-SARS-CoV gene therapy in comparison with those administered CEA alone.

The IFN- secretion response at spleen was also evaluated by ELISPOT and ELISA. Among the CPPs studied one novel peptide stand out by its ability to potentiate the humoral and cellular immune response against the co-administered antigen. Considering that the use of mucosal routes is a promising strategy in vaccination, which are gaining special relevance nowadays in the development of novel candidates against SARS-CoV-2 and other potential emerging respiratory virus, the searching and development of safe mucosal adjuvants constitute a current need.

Body cavity effusions develop in a subset of patients with advanced disease. Although SARS-CoV-2 is known to be present in certain body fluids (e.g. blood) of COVID patients, it remains unclear if body cavity fluids are sites of infection. Our aim was to characterize the cytologic and clinical findings in COVID-19 patients with effusions. MATERIALS AND METHODS A record search for all cases of body cavity effusion cytology in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from 3/1/2020 - 9/1/2020 was performed. Clinical history, fluid chemical analysis, cytologic findings, and patient outcomes were recorded. All cytology slides were reviewed. In situ hybridization (ISH) targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein transcript (V-nCoV2019-S) was performed on cell block material in all cases. RESULTS 17 effusion cytology cases were identified among 15 COVID patients, including 13 pleural, 2 pericardial, and 2 peritoneal. Most (13/15) patients were hospitalized for COVID complications. 8 patients died during hospitalization, 7 from COVID complications. All fluids were transudative by protein criteria. Lymphocytic or histiocytic inflammation predominated in 12/17 cases. 5 exhibited hemophagocytosis. No viral cytopathic changes or extra-medullary megakaryocytes were seen. Viral RNA was not detected in any case by ISH. CONCLUSION Body cavity effusion is an ominous finding in patients with advanced COVID-19 disease. Such effusions tend to be transudative with lymphohistiocytic inflammation, and commonly exhibit hemophagocytosis, an otherwise rare finding in effusion cytologies.

This single NHS centre study has explored the resulted management differences. METHODS: Retrospective study covering prepandemic data over (March-May, 2019) & early pandemic data over (March-May, 2020). RESULTS: Prepandemic data (43 patients): The mean age was 38.3 years. The mean length of stay was 1.7 days. Preoperative imaging was used in 32(74.4%) patients; this was diagnostic in 28(87.5%). Non-surgical management was used in 4(9.3%) patients; one needed surgery eventually. Surgical approaches in 40 patients were (laparoscopic: 38(95%), open: 2(5%)). Neither significant morbidity nor mortality was reported. Early pandemic data (35 patients): The mean age was 31.2 years. The mean length of stay was 2.2 days. Preoperative imaging was used in 30(85.7%) patients; this was diagnostic in 26(86.6%). Non-surgical management was used in 8(22.9%) patients; one needed surgery eventually. Surgical approaches in 28 patients were (laparoscopic: 10(35.7%), open: 18(64.3%)). Neither significant morbidity nor mortality was reported, apart from one patient with COVID-19 postoperative infection. CONCLUSIONS: There was a tendency towards applying a conservative approach/open surgery during the early days of the pandemic.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational pilot study in a multidisciplinary PICU. Children aged 1 month to 18 years who required mechanical ventilation, with expected stay in the PICU of at least 5 days were included. We examined the feasibility of consenting, enrolling, and completing baseline and 6-month assessments of BIS variables, Functional Status Scale (FSS), and Pediatric Quality of Life (Peds QL), in eligible patients. RESULTS: Of 32 patients approached, 23 (72%) completed baseline assessments [median (IQR) age 3.4 (1.0, 7.8) years, 14 (61%) male]; 6-month assessments were completed in 15 (65%) enrolled patients.

In the aftermath of a large-scale anthrax attack, mass screening to identify early inhalational anthrax may improve both the management of individual cases and the efficiency of health resource utilization. PURPOSE To develop the evidence base for outpatient anthrax screening protocols by quantifying differences in clinical presentation between inhalational anthrax and common viral respiratory tract infections. DESIGN Review, compilation, and data extraction from English-language case reports of inhalational anthrax and epidemiologic studies of influenza and other viral respiratory infections. DATA SOURCES 13 reports of 28 cases of inhalational anthrax from 1920 to 2001 and 5 studies reporting on the clinical features of 2762 cases of influenza and 1932 cases of noninfluenza viral respiratory disease. DATA SYNTHESIS Characterization of presenting clinical symptoms in anthrax and viral disease and calculation of likelihood ratios for the presence of selected clinical features. RESULTS Fever and cough do not reliably discriminate between inhalational anthrax and viral respiratory tract infection. Features suggestive of anthrax include the presence of nonheadache neurologic symptoms (positive likelihood ratio cannot be calculated), dyspnea (positive likelihood ratio, 5.3 [95% CI, 3.7 to 7.4]), nausea or vomiting (positive likelihood ratio, 5.1 [CI, 3.0 to 8.5]), and finding of any abnormality on lung auscultation (positive likelihood ratio, 8.1 [CI, 5.3 to 12.5]). In contrast, rhinorrhea (positive likelihood ratio, 0.2 [CI, 0.1 to 0.4]) and sore throat (positive likelihood ratio, 0.2 [CI, 0.1 to 0.5]) are more suggestive of viral respiratory tract infection. CONCLUSION Inhalational anthrax has characteristic clinical features that are distinct from those seen in common viral respiratory tract infections. Screening protocols based on these features may improve rapid identification of patients with presumptive inhalational anthrax in the setting of a large-scale anthrax attack.","output":"Accuracy of screening for inhalational anthrax after a bioterrorist attack."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rapid increases in the number of COVID-19 cases have led to the closure of academic institutions including elementary and high schools.

The early detection, diagnosis, reporting, isolation, and clinical management of patients during a public health emergency required the extensive involvement of hospitals in all aspects. The response capacity of hospitals directly determined the outcomes of the prevention and control of an outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost all nations and territories regardless of their development level or geographic location, although suitable risk mitigation measures differ between developing and developed countries. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the consequences of the pandemic could be more complicated because incidence and mortality might be associated more with a fragile health care system and shortage of related resources.2, 3 As evidenced by the situation in Bangladesh, India, Kenya, South Africa, and other LMICs, socioeconomic status (SES) disparity was a major factor in the spread of disease, potentially leading to alarmingly insufficient preparedness and responses in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.4 Conversely, the pandemic might also bring more unpredictable socioeconomic and long-term impacts in LMICs, and those with lower SES fare worse in these situations.

Additionally, N protein participates in at least one stage of the complex mechanism of coronavirus RNA synthesis. We previously uncovered an unanticipated interaction between N and the largest subunit of the viral replicase-transcriptase complex, nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). This was found through analysis of revertants of a severely defective mutant of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) in which the N gene was replaced with that of its close relative, bovine coronavirus (BCoV). In the work reported here, we constructed BCoV chimeras and other mutants of MHV nsp3 and obtained complementary genetic evidence for its association with N protein. We found that the N-nsp3 interaction maps to the amino-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of nsp3, which is essential for the virus. The interaction does not require the adjacent acidic domain of nsp3, which is dispensable. In addition, we demonstrated a complete correspondence between N-nsp3 genetic interactions and the ability of N protein to enhance the infectivity of transfected coronavirus genomic RNA. The latter function of N was shown to depend on both of the RNA-binding domains of N, as well as on the serine- and arginine-rich central region of N, which binds nsp3. Our results support a model in which the N-nsp3 interaction serves to tether the genome to the newly translated replicase-transcriptase complex at a very early stage of infection.","output":"Characterization of a critical interaction between the coronavirus nucleocapsid protein and nonstructural protein 3 of the viral replicase-transcriptase complex."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pharmacies have been practicing innovative infection control measures during COVID-19.

PATIENTS/METHODS VOYAGER PAD randomized 6,564 symptomatic PAD patients undergoing LER to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice-daily or placebo on aspirin background. Marginal proportional-hazards models used to generate treatment hazard ratios and associated 95% CIs for first and total events; non-thrombotic deaths treated as competing terminal events. Incidence rates calculated as number of events per 100 patient-years follow-up. RESULTS Over 2.5 years (median), first and total thrombotic event rates: 7.1 and 10.3 events/100 patient-years, respectively, in placebo group. Two-thirds (925/1,372) of total thrombotic events (arterial 95%, venous 5%) were nonfatal first events. Nearly 1/3 of patients with first event had a second arterial or venous thrombotic event. Rivaroxaban plus aspirin reduced first and total arterial and venous thrombotic events to 5.4 and 7.9 events/100 patient-years, respectively, a reduction in total thrombotic events over aspirin of 23% (HR 0.77, 95%CI 0.67-0.89, p=0.0005), preventing 6.1 total arterial and venous thrombotic events at 3 years.

Background Low socioeconomic status predisposes individuals to worse health outcomes. For example, during the 2003 SARS-CoV pandemic and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic disadvantaged individuals were more likely to become infected. More recently, a study found that deaths due to COVID-19 were associated with disadvantaged areas across the United States. South Florida, in particular Broward and Miami-Dade Counties, has experienced a significant burden of coronavirus cases. Investigating the association of income on coronavirus cases in Broward and Miami-Dade Counties may aid in identifying and treating those individuals at increased risk. Methods This retrospective cross-sectional study used data gathered by the Florida Department of Health and 2018 U.S. Census. COVID-19 cases from March 2 - November 1, 2020 were tallied by ZIP code in Floridas Broward and Miami-Dade Counties and scaled per housing unit. An exhaustive regression analysis using County Miami-Dade or Broward, sex, race, ethnicity, median age, and estimated per capita income was performed for each combination of independent variables in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, USA). Regression models were evaluated using both adjusted R-squared and the Akaike Information Criterion, along with the number of significant predictors. The most optimal model with the highest number of significant predictors was selected. Results Among all other variables, sex, race, and ethnicity as the variables that best predicted COVID-19 cases per housing unit within a certain ZIP code. The adjusted R-squared of this optimal model was 0.5062, indicating that within each ZIP code in Broward and Miami-Dade Counties 50.62% of the variance in COVID-19 cases per housing unit can be explained by these variables. A significant relationship was found between the number of COVID-19 cases and individuals who were Black or African American (p < 0.001), individuals who were Hispanic or Latino (p < 0.001), and male to female ratio (p = 0.016). Per capita income, age, and county were not statistically significant predictors in any model tested. Conclusions Racial and gender disparities may be more significant contributors to COVID-19 cases than per capita income in housing units.

The classical method of training has been prohibitive during the Covid-19 pandemic. We determined the value of using virtual training on inanimate models that closely replicate the prostate gland on ultrasound and MRI. METHODS: Six urologic procedures which included the injection of a rectal hydrogel spacer, transperineal biopsy, mpMRI fusion biopsy (2 different devices), Cesium-131 implant and focal brachytherapy were taught by urology and radiation oncology experts via a webinar (example in Figure 1). The prostate phantoms were designed to maximize the learning experience and included MRI visible lesions. The training lasted 30 minutes for each procedure. Seven faculty and 110 attendees participated. Survey Monkey was used to assess the education experience of both groups. RESULTS: 31 attendees and the 7 faculty completed the survey. All the faculty responded the phantom simulated human tissue, was easy to set up, and was superior to using a live patient (Table 1). 42.8% believed that 30 minutes was adequate for training. 100% of the attendees also believed the phantom simulated human tissue (Table 1). In contrast to the faculty, only 19.4% of attendee's believed 30 minutes was adequate. 90.3% of the attendees reported that the prostate phantom could substitute for training on a live patient. CONCLUSIONS: This was the first demonstration of remote learning on a physical prostate phantom.

This study evaluates the associations between physical activity (PA), the level of stress and quality of sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: An online survey was distributed during the governmental lockdown in April 2020 and included measures for assessing physical activity, stress and sleep. The surveyed participants included all adults aged 18 years and over. The final data were collected from the 1959 respondents using: International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). FINDINGS: Almost half of the respondents indicated a low level of PA, performing only 60 min of PA daily. Most of the participants reported a moderate or high level of stress (57% and 29%, respectively) and 64% of them reported poor quality of sleep. People with low levels of stress performed on average 85.1 min/day of walking (WPA), 40.9 min/day of moderate PA (MPA) or 52.6 min/day of vigorous PA (VPA). People with good quality of sleep performed 82.9 min/day of WPA, 43.6 min/day MPA and 40.5 min/day VPA. INTERPRETATION: The results from the study indicate that the volume of daily PA may be a predictor of the level of stress and sleep quality in adults during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. To retain a low level of stress and good quality of sleep, a lifestyle that allows to achieve a moderate level of physical activity should be maintained. The optimal daily dose of PA is at least 70 min per day, involving different intensities.","output":"Physical Activity as a Predictor of the Level of Stress and Quality of Sleep during COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sequence-specific NMR assignments of an internal domain of the protein nsp3, nsp3(513C651), which is a part of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replicase polyprotein, have been determined, using triple-resonance NMR experiments with the uniformly [(13)C,(15)N]-labeled protein.

We set out to verify this hypothesis. Our study aimed to examine the link between the use of alpha blockers and reduction in the mortality linked to COVID-19 in a geriatric population at Paul Brousse Hospital. Patients and methods: This was a retrospective study of 193 male patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 2020 and March 2021. Two groups were formed according to exposure to an alpha-blocker. 61 patients were on alpha-blockers and 132 patients had no alpha-blocker in their usual treatment. Results: The mortality rate was 29.5% in the first group and 33.33% in the group without alpha-blockers, with a p-value of 0.5967. We noted moderate symptomatology for 66 patients (34.2%), with 22 patients (36%) in the first group and 44 patients (33.3%) in the group without alpha-blocker. A severe clinical profile was observed for 73 patients (37.8%) including 20 (33%) in the group with alpha-blocker and 53 (40%) in the other group. Conclusion: We observed the absence of a reduction in the mortality rate in the group on alpha-blockers, and also the absence of excess mortality in this same group although they were more frail and at greater risk of dying. We therefore cannot exclude a beneficial effect of alpha-blockers in COVID-19.","output":"Effet protecteur des alpha-bloquants dans la Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Northern ireland disease surveillance, july to september 2017Bibersteinia trehalosi causing septicaemic pasteurellosis in lambsAbortion due to Streptococcus pluranimalium in cattleLymphoma in cattleAcute fasciolosis in sheepErysipelas in pigsMarek's disease in chickens.","output":"Septicaemic pasteurellosis in unvaccinated lambs in Northern Ireland."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores how trust in formal information sources (government and media) and informal information sources (interpersonal) about COVID-19 influences compliance with preventive measures.

Results suggest that understanding of COVID-19 causes is related to trust in formal information sources, but not to trust in informal information. Self-efficacy for prevention is related to trust in informal information sources, but not to trust in formal information sources. Worry about contracting COVID-19 is related to trust in formal information sources, but not to informal ones. Engaging in preventive measures is linked to both self-efficacy for prevention and worry, while social distancing was related only to worry.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 32 patients with a history of cancer who were referred to our hospital between January 31, 2020 and May 25, 2020. We evaluated the association between clinical outcomes and potential prognostic factors using univariate analyses. RESULTS: The median age was 74.5 (range 24C90) years and 22 patients (69%) were men. A total of 11 patients (34%) died. Our analyses demonstrated that the mortality was significantly associated with lymphocyte count, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein on admission. The median period between illness onset and the first effective negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR result was 22 days (interquartile range 18C25) in survivors.

Studies are aiming to discern if the epidemiology of viruses seen at a population level is related to the interaction between different viruses on a host level.

It is also becoming important to understand the interplay of certain viruses with specific bacteria and understanding the impact of viral-bacterial co-infections. SUMMARY: RSV continues to contribute to a large burden of disease for pediatric patients with acute respiratory illnesses. However, recent literature suggests that viral-viral co-infections do not add to this burden and might, in some cases, be protective of severe disease. Viral-bacterial co-infections, on the other hand, are most likely adding to the burden of morbidity in pediatric patients because of the synergistic way they can infect the nasopharyngeal space.

The CT (computed tomography) examination as a auxiliary confirmed diagnostic method can help clinicians quickly detect lesions locations of COVID-19 once screening by PCR test. Furthermore, the lesion subtypes classification plays a critical role in the consequent treatment decision. Identifying the subtypes of lesions accurately can help doctors discover changes in lesions in time and better assess the severity of COVID-19. METHOD: The most four typical lesion subtypes of COVID-19 are discussed in this paper, which are GGO (ground-glass opacity), cord, solid and subsolid. A computer-aided diagnosis approach of lesion subtype is proposed in this paper. The radiomics data of lesions are segmented from COVID-19 patients CT images with diagnosis and lesions annotations by radiologists. Then the three-dimensional texture descriptors are applied on the volume data of lesions as well as shape and first-order features. The massive feature data are selected by HAFS (hybrid adaptive feature selection) algorithm and a classification model is trained at the same time. The classifier is used to predict lesion subtypes as side decision information for radiologists. RESULTS: There are 3734 lesions extracted from the dataset with 319 patients collection and then 189 radiomics features are obtained finally. The random forest classifier is trained with data augmentation that the number of different subtypes of lesions is imbalanced in initial dataset. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the four subtypes of lesions is (93.06%, 96.84%, 99.58%, and 94.30%), the recall is (95.52%, 91.58%, 95.80% and 80.75%) and the f-score is (93.84%, 92.37%, 95.47%, and 84.42%). CONCLUSION: The three-dimensional radiomics features used in this paper can better express the high-level information of COVID-19 lesions in CT slices. HAFS method aggregates the results of multiple feature selection algorithms intersects with traditional methods to filter out redundant features more accurately. After selection, the subtype of COVID-19 lesion can be judged by inputting the features into the RF (random forest) model, which can help clinicians more accurately identify the subtypes of COVID-19 lesions and provide help for further research.","output":"Pulmonary lesion subtypes recognition of COVID-19 from radiomics data with three-dimensional texture characterization in computed tomography images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundIn 2020 and 2021, more than 1.5 million SARS-CoV-2 sequences were submitted to GenBank. The initial version (v1.0) of the VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) software package that GenBank uses to automatically validate and annotate incoming viral sequences is too slow and memory intensive to process many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 sequences in a reasonable amount of time. Additionally, long stretches of ambiguous N nucleotides, which are common in many SARS-CoV-2 sequences, prevent VADR from accurate validation and annotation. ResultsVADR has been updated to more accurately and rapidly annotate SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Stretches of consecutive Ns are now identified and temporarily replaced with expected nucleotides to facilitate processing, and the slowest steps have been overhauled using blastn and glsearch, increasing speed, reducing the memory requirement from 64Gb to 2Gb per thread, and allowing simple, coarse-grained parallelization on multiple processors per host. ConclusionVADR is now nearly 1000 times faster than it was in early 2020 for processing SARS-CoV-2 sequences submitted to GenBank. It has been used to screen and annotate more than 1.5 million SARS-CoV-2 sequences since June 2020, and it is now efficient enough to cope with the current rate of hundreds of thousands of submitted sequences per month.

Bline identification and quantification can be a challenging skill for novice ultrasound users, and experienced users could benefit from a more objective measure of quantification. We sought to develop and test a deep learning (DL) algorithm to quantify the assessment of B-lines in lung ultrasound. We utilized ultrasound clips (n=400) from an existing database of ED patients to provide training and test sets to develop and test the DL algorithm based on deep convolutional neural networks. Interpretations of the images by algorithm were compared to expert human interpretations on binary and severity (scale of 0 to 4) classifications. Our model yielded sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 81%-98%) and specificity 96(95% CI 84%-99%) for presence or absence of B-lines compared to expert read, with kappa of 0.88 (95% CI 0.79-0.97). Model to expert agreement for severity classification yielded a weighted kappa of 0.65 (95% CI 0.56-074). Overall, the DL algorithm performed well and could be integrated into an ultrasound system in order to help diagnose and track B-line severity. The algorithm is better at distinguishing presence from absence of B-lines but can also be successfully used to distinguish between B-line severity.

Circulating fibrocytes are fibroblasts precursors involved in the repair process. Increased blood fibrocytes count is associated with a poor prognosis in fibrotic lung diseases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We aimed to quantify the % of circulating fibrocytes in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and included in the French COVID cohort, in order to determine their prognosis value in this disease. Methods :SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by PCR in all patients. Blood fibrocytes were quantified by flow cytometry as CD45+/CD15-/CD34+/Collagen-1+. Clinical and imaging data were obtained at inclusion and after 3 months. In a subgroup of patients admitted in ICU, we quantified fibrocytes in blood and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Serum amyloid protein (SAP), a known regulator of fibrocytes differentiation, was quantified by ELISA in serum samples. Results :We included 57 patients admitted for hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia (mean age 60 years [23-87]) and 15 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Samples were taken 0 to 10 days after admission, and 14 days (4-48 days) after first symptom. The median % of circulating fibrocytes was higher in patients compared to controls (2,49% vs 1,82%, p&lt;0,05). The % was lower in patients who died of COVID-19 (6/57) as compared to survivors (1.25% versus 2.52%, p=0.03). Fibrocyte count was lower in patients receiving corticosteroids before blood sample collection (2.28% vs 2.82%, p=0.04). Fibrocyte % did not correlate with biological severity markers (lymphocytes, LDH, ferritin, CRP). Thirty-two patients were evaluated 3 months after admission. Complete resolution of CT abnormalities was observed in 13 patients (40%). It was associated with a significantly higher initial fibrocyte count compared with patients with an incomplete resolution (2.95% vs 2.18%, p=0.03). SAP concentration in serum was higher in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (96.3 vs 65,0 mg/L, p = 0.0021);it did not correlate with fibrocyte count. We studied 7 ICU patients (mean age 62 years [50-73]). In these patients, median blood fibrocyte count was 0.94% while median BALF fibrocyte count was 5.43%, suggesting a recruitment of fibrocytes to the lung in severe cases. Conclusion : Circulating fibrocytes were increased in patients with hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia. Lower fibrocyte count were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death and a slower resolution of lung CT opacities, and may be due to the recruitment of fibrocytes to the lung in the most severe cases.","output":"Involvement of Circulating Fibrocytes in Pathophysiology and Prognosis of COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Patient reported outcomes are important in Crohn's disease. In this prospective cohort, we investigated the performance of the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) and a visual analog scale (VAS) for abdominal pain as outcome measures in Crohn's disease. METHODS Patients with active Crohn's disease starting glucocorticoids or anti-tumor necrosis factor were included. Before treatment and 10 weeks later we collected: clinical activity [Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) and Crohn's-Disease-Activity-Index (CDAI)], serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin, and BSFS (1-7) and a 100-mm VAS based on a 7-day diary. Clinical response was defined as a reduction by at least 3 and at least 100 of HBI and CDAI, respectively. Fecal calprotectin-response and CRP-response were defined as reduction of at least 50%. RESULTS Thirty-eight patients completed follow-up. At baseline, BSFS-parameters correlated more strongly with clinical activity (range: rs: 0.31-0.74) than with CRP (rs: -0.01 to 0.16) and fecal calprotectin (rs: 0.14-0.26). VAS scores correlated very weakly to moderately with clinical activity (rs: 0.18-0.45), and weakly to moderately with CRP (rs: 0.24-0.34) and fecal calprotectin (rs: 0.35-0.43). Changes in VAS scores correlated moderately to strongly (rs: 0.55-0.71) with changes in clinical activity, and weakly with changes in CRP and fecal calprotectin (rs: 0.21-0.35). Changes in BSFS parameters correlated weakly to moderately (rs: 0.23-0.53) with changes in clinical activity, and very weakly to weakly (rs: 0.01-0.35) with changes in CRP and fecal calprotectin. Responsiveness of VAS and BSFS was moderate to high (Guyatt's statistic 0.41-2.17) and highly dependent on the definition of response.

Objectives: The present study aimed to evaluate the clinical features and laboratory data of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted from March 20 to September 5, 2020, on all neonates born to mothers with positive real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 or clinically suspected COVID-19. Neonates enrolled in this study were from five different hospitals affiliated with the Tehran University of Medical Sciences. All the newborns were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swabs during the first 24-48 hours of life, and a second-time swabbing was performed as indicated at subsequent visits. All categorical data were manifested as frequency (%), and continuous data were shown as mean  SD. Results: Forty-four neonates born to 39 infected mothers were evaluated during the study period. Nineteen women had complications during pregnancy, including hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, preterm labor, etc. Besides, 54.5% of the neonates were born preterm. The mean gestational age and birth weight were 35.11  4.01 weeks and 2,567  898 g, respectively. Fifteen (34.1%) neonates were symptomatic at birth, and during the observation, more neonates became symptomatic. Finally, 27/44 (61.3%) neonates became symptomatic, and 17/44 remained asymptomatic. The most common clinical manifestations were respiratory distress (77.7%), followed by fever or hypothermia (18.5%), gastrointestinal problems (14.8%), and neurologic findings (3.7%). Also, the most common clinical feature of eight neonates with positive RT-PCR was respiratory distress, followed by neurologic symptoms, temperature instability, and gastrointestinal disorder, in sequence. Few abnormalities were seen in laboratory findings. Chest X-rays were abnormal in 22.2% of the neonates. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy may cause severe maternal and neonatal morbidities. Neonates with positive SARS-CoV-2 may demonstrate a spectrum of clinical features.

Social distancing became the main policy for public behavior, in effect imposing radical changes in peoples everyday life.

Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Norway, UK, USA and Australia during April/May 2020. Participants (n = 3810) were recruited via social media postings by the researchers and the involved universities. Differences between those with and without infection in the family were investigated with chi-square tests and independent t-tests. Multiple regression analyses were used to assess associations between sociodemographic variables and psychological outcomes (worry, loneliness and mental health) in both groups. Results: Compared to their counterparts, participants with infection in the family reported higher levels of worries about themselves (p < 0.05) and their family members (p < 0.001), and had poorer mental health (p < 0.05). However, the effect sizes related to the differences were small. The largest effect (d = 0.24) concerned worries about their immediate family. Poorer psychological outcomes were observed in those who were younger, female, unemployed, living alone and had lower levels of edcuation, yet with small effect sizes.

Mononuclear cells such as macrophages or lymphocytes in lung tissue and hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes have been recognized to play an essential role in granuloma formation in pulmonary sarcoidosis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) consist of several immunocompetent cells and have been shown to play a mechanistic role in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis. However, the genetic modifications that occur in bulk PBMCs of sarcoidosis remain to be elucidated. PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the pathobiological markers of sarcoidosis in PBMCs by comparing the transcriptional signature of PBMCs from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis with those of healthy controls by RNA sequencing. METHODS: PBMC samples were collected from subjects with pulmonary sarcoidosis with no steroid/immunosuppressant drugs (n = 8) and healthy controls (n = 11) from August 2020 to April 2021, and RNA sequencing was performed with the PBMC samples. RESULTS: Principal component analysis using RNA sequencing datasets comparing pulmonary sarcoidosis with healthy controls revealed that the two groups appeared to be differentiated, in which 270 differentially expressed genes were found in PBMCs between sarcoidosis and healthy controls. Enrichment analysis for gene ontology suggested that some biological processes related to the pathobiology of sarcoidosis, such as cellular response to interleukin (IL)-1 and IFN-, regulation of IL-6 production, IL-8 secretion, regulation of mononuclear cell migration, and response to lipopolysaccharide, were involved. Enrichment analysis of the KEGG pathway indicated the involvement of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), toll-like receptor signaling, IL-17 signaling pathways, phagosomes, and ribosomes. Most of the genes involved in TNF and IL-17 signaling pathways and phagosomes were upregulated, while most of the ribosome-related genes were downregulated. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that bulk gene expression patterns in PBMCs were different between patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis and healthy controls. The changes in the gene expression pattern of PBMCs could reflect the existence of sarcoidosis lesions and influence granuloma formation in sarcoidosis. These new findings are important to strengthen our understanding of the etiology and pathobiology of sarcoidosis and indicate a potential therapeutic target for sarcoidosis.","output":"Transcriptome Analysis of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells in Pulmonary Sarcoidosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases, such as dengue fever and Middle East respiratory syndrome, have become prevalent worldwide in recent times.

However, facial temperature measurements may be vastly different from temperatures measured at the axilla owing to influence from the immediate environment. In this study, heartbeat rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), and standard deviation of heartbeat interval (SDHI) were used to quantify the infection screening system without using facial temperature as a parameter.

However, retreatment of PTB has often developed resistance to at least one of the four first-line anti-TB drugs. The cure rate (approximately 50.0C73.3%) and management of retreatment of PTB in China needs to be improved. Qinbudan decoction has been widely used to treat PTB in China since the 1960s. Previously clinical studies have shown that the Qinbudan tablet (QBDT) promoted sputum-culture negative conversion and lesion absorption. However, powerful evidence from a randomized controlled clinical trial is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of QBDT as an adjunct therapy for retreatment of PTB. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in China. People diagnosed with PTB were enrolled who received previous anti-TB treatment from April 2011 to March 2013. The treatment group received an anti-TB regimen and QBDT, and the control group was administered an anti-TB regimen plus placebo. Anti-TB treatment options included isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, streptomycin for 2 months (2HRZES), followed by isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol for 6 months (6HRE), daily for 8 months. Primary outcome was sputum-culture conversion using the MGIT 960 liquid medium method. Secondary outcomes included lung lesion absorption and cavity closure. Adverse events and reactions were observed after treatment. A structured questionnaire was used to record demographic information and clinical symptoms of all subjects. Data analysis was performed by SPSS 25.0 software in the full analysis set (FAS) population. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-one cases of retreatment PTB were randomly divided into two groups: the placebo group (88 cases) and the QBDT group (93 cases). A total of 166 patients completed the trial and 15 patients lost to follow-up. The culture conversion rate of the QBDT group and placebo group did not show a noticeable improvement by using the covariate sites to correct the rate differences (79.6% vs 69.3%; rate difference = 0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI): - 0.02C0.23; F = 2.48, P = 0.12) after treatment. A significant 16.6% increase in lesion absorption was observed in the QBDT group when compared with the placebo group (67.7% vs 51.1%; rate difference = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.02C0.31; (2) = 5.56, P = 0.02).

Neutrophile to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune inflammation index (SII) (platelet counts  neutrophil counts / lymphocyte counts) and lymphocyte-to-CRP ratio (LCR) were calculated on admission and the association of these markers with disease mortality in CKD patients was identified. Results: CKD patients had higher risk of severe disease, and mortality compared to non-CKD patients (72% vs 50.5%, p=0.003, 36,6% vs 10.8%, p<0.001, respectively) and were more likely to have higher values of immuno-inflammatory indices (leucocyte count, neutrophil, NLR, SII and C-reactive protein etc.) and lower level of lymphocyte and LCR. Also, higher levels of NLR, SII, PLR and lower level of LCR were seen in CKD patients who died compared to those recovered. In a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, NLR, SII, PLR and LCR area under the curve for in-hospital mortality of CKD patients were 0.830, 0.811, 0.664 and 0.712, respectively. Among all parameters, NLR and SII gave us the best ability to distinguish patients with higher risk of death. Based on the cut-off value of 1180.5, the sensitivity and specificity of the SII for predicting in-hospital mortality were found to be 67.5% and 79.6%, respectively. The corresponding sensitivity and specificity of the NLR were 85.2% and 66.1%, respectively, at the cut-off value of 5.1. Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that NLR (5.1), SII (1180.5) and LCR (9) were predictors for in-hospital mortality. Conclusion: We report for the first time that SII is able to distinguish COVID-19 infected CKD patients of worse survival and it is as powerful as NLR in this regard. As SII is easily quantified from blood sample data, it may assist for early identification and timely management of CKD patients with worse survival. Antecedentes y objetivo: Los pacientes con enfermedad renal crnica (ERC) son susceptibles a la infeccin por SARS-CoV-2 y ms propensos a desarrollar una enfermedad grave. Es importante conocer los predictores de los malos resultados para optimizar las estrategias de atencin. Mtodos: Se incluyeron en el estudio 93 pacientes con ERC y 93 pacientes sin ERC, emparejados por edad y sexo. Los datos sobre las caractersticas demogrficas, clnicas, ndices hematolgicos y resultados, se anotaron y compararon entre los grupos. La proporcin de neutrfilos a linfocitos (NLR), la proporcin de plaquetas a linfocitos (PLR), el ndice de inflamacin inmunitaria sistmica (SII) (recuentos de plaquetas  recuentos de neutrfilos / recuentos de linfocitos) y la proporcin de linfocitos a PCR (LCR) se calcularon en el momento de la admisin y se identific la asociacin de estos marcadores con la mortalidad por enfermedad en pacientes con ERC. Resultados: Los pacientes con ERC tuvieron un mayor riesgo de enfermedad grave y mortalidad en comparacin con los pacientes sin ERC (72% vs 50,5%, p = 0,003, 36,6% vs 10,8%, p <0,001, respectivamente) y tuvieron ms probabilidades de tener valores ms altos de ndices inmuno inflamatorios (recuento de leucocitos, neutrfilos, NLR, SII y protena C reactiva, etc.) y niveles ms bajos de linfocitos y LCR. Adems, se observaron niveles ms altos de NLR, SII, PLR y un nivel ms bajo de LCR en pacientes con ERC que murieron en comparacin con los recuperados. En un anlisis de la curva de caractersticas operativas del receptor, el rea NLR, SII, PLR y LCR bajo la curva de mortalidad hospitalaria de pacientes con ERC fueron de 0,830, 0,811, 0,664 y 0,712, respectivamente. Entre todos los parmetros, NLR y SII se di a conocer la mejor manera de distinguir a los pacientes con mayor riesgo de muerte. Con base en el valor de corte de 1180,5, se encontr que la sensibilidad y especificidad del SII, para predecir la mortalidad hospitalaria, fue del 67,5% y 79,6%, respectivamente. La sensibilidad y especificidad correspondientes del NLR fueron del 85,2% y 66,1%, respectivamente, en el valor de corte de 5,1. El anlisis de regresin logstica escalonada hacia adelante mostr que el NLR (5,1), SII (1180,5) y LCR (9) fueron predictores de mortalidad hospitalaria. Conclusin: Informamos, por primera vez, que el SII es capaz de distinguir pacientes con ERC infectados por COVID-19 de peor supervivencia y, en este sentido, es tan poderoso como el NLR. Como el SII se cuantifica fcilmente a partir de los datos de las muestras de sangre, puede ayudar a la identificacin temprana y el manejo oportuno de los pacientes con ERC con peor supervivencia.","output":"Puede el ndice de inflamacin inmunitaria sistmica al ingreso predecir la mortalidad hospitalaria al ingreso de pacientes con enfermedad renal crnica e infeccin por SARS-CoV-2?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the cognitions, behaviors, attitudes, and living conditions of Japanese people during the severe novel coronavirus pandemic that reached the country in January 2020 and to publish the data related to the study.

The virus is transmitted by contact, droplet, and airborne transmission; hence, hand hygiene, social distancing, environmental disinfection, and use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) form important components to protect HCWs from cross-infection. Appropriate use of PPE is of paramount importance not only to reduce the risk of transmission but also to maintain adequate stock for those who are dealing directly with COVID-19 patients. AIMS: In this article, we aim to provide the rationale for appropriate use of PPE in the dermatology setting in the current scenario. We have also discussed the scientific evidence for use of each component of protection and the practical problems faced in our COVID referral tertiary hospital. METHODS: Our review was based on articles that have studied or analyzed the efficacy of various protective measures being utilized by health workers against spread of COVID-19. This was done by carrying out a PUBMED search with terms \\"coronavirus, COVID-19, personal protective equipment (PPE), transmission, mask, face shields, goggles, gloves.\\" We also scrutinized the various pragmatic issues being faced by doctors in our setup while using PPE. RESULTS: In order to maximize the appropriate use of PPE, the rationale for use needs to be understood and problems encountered in daily practice need to be addressed. CONCLUSION: Adherence to protective measures and use of PPE is of utmost importance for HCWs to prevent cross-infection in this pandemic. The use of PPE can limit transmission to a great extent, but appropriate use and avoiding misuse is equally important in the dermatology setting in order to avoid depletion of stock. It is also essential to consider various practical issues with use of PPE and device measures to avoid them so that breach in protocols can be prevented and spread of infection minimized.","output":"Real-world assessment, relevance, and problems in use of personal protective equipment in clinical dermatology practice in a COVID referral tertiary hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"First published in 2006, the first European core syllabus in Adult Respiratory Medicine was developed with the intention of harmonising education and training throughout Europe.

The incidence of TBE is changing owing to various ecological and climatic factors. The factors influencing the variability of the number of TBE cases are still under investigation. In 2020 the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged causing COVID-19 pandemic. Governments have reorganized health care systems to contain a surge of COVID-19 cases and avoid hospital overload. Moreover, new measures have modified several aspects of social habits leading to a change in the incidence of numerous diseases. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiology of TBE in the last decade (2010-2019) and to demonstrate the impact of the surge of SARS-CoV-2 infections on the TBE incidence as reported to a national surveillance database. MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed the analysis of the TBE notification from the epidemiologic reports in the years 2010-2019 and in the pandemic year 2020 at a national and regional level in Poland. We included data from two infectious disease departments located in the most TBE-prevalent province of Poland. RESULTS Most cases of TBE occur in two provinces of Northeastern Poland from May to December. The increasing temporal trend occurred in Poland in 2016-2017. The increased number of cases of COVID-19 coincided with a reduction of the number of the reported TBE cases in 2020. CONCLUSIONS Tick-borne encephalitis virus activity in Poland is invariably concentrated in endemic regions of Northeastern Poland fluctuating considerably from year to year. The decrease of TBE incidence with surge of COVID-19 patients conceivably resulted from underreporting due to limited access to specialized diagnostics. In endemic areas, TBE should be included in the differential diagnostics in all the cases when the central nervous system infection in suspected.","output":"Epidemiology of tick-borne encephalitis in Poland (2010-2019) and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the notified incidence of the disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals who care for aging parents or relatives often experience caregiving burden, which is associated with various negative psychological outcomes During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the conflict between caring for older relatives and taking the necessary personal precautions against infection may be exacerbated among individuals who belong to social groups, which perceive caring for others as an indispensable cultural construct Accordingly, the current study examined whether feeling a part of one's community moderates the association between caregiving burden and depressive symptoms among the ultra-orthodox society in Israel A convenience sample of 358 ultra-orthodox participants was collected (age range 30-70;M = 49 50, SD = 10 24), all of whom completed scales assessing caregiving burden, sense of community, and depressive symptoms Results demonstrated that high caregiving burden and low sense of community were associated with increased depressive symptoms Moreover, sense of community moderated the caregiving burden-depressive symptoms link, as the latter positive association was significant only among individuals reporting low levels of sense of community The discussion highlights the importance of sense of community as a beneficial personal and social factor, which mitigates the negative psychological consequences of caregiving burden among such societies (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Caregiving burden and depressive symptoms among ultra-orthodox jews: The moderating role of sense of community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Vision impairment (VI) may impact a person's functional ability resulting in a loss of independence, anxiety, depression, social isolation and reduced quality of life. Caregivers also experience similar problems due to the increased burden placed on them. Support to address these difficulties encountered by those with VI and their caregivers may not always be accessible. An internet-based intervention may provide more accessible support. The aim of this study was to obtain consensus regarding the content and accessibility features required to design an internet-based intervention to promote wellbeing for people with VI and their caregivers. METHOD A three-round Delphi review was conducted with a panel of 30 stakeholders. Three stakeholder groups were included, namely individuals with vision loss, experts in the field of vision loss and mental health and carers of individuals with vision loss. Conceptual wellbeing ideas were examined in round 1, the intervention modules and module content were proposed in round 2 and refined in round 3. RESULTS Consensus of 75% or more was reached to include 18 modules into the intervention. These were divided into seven sections: understanding vision loss, emotional wellbeing, functional wellbeing, social wellbeing, physical wellbeing, wellbeing for carers and maintaining wellbeing. The accessibility features deemed most important were font size, colour and contrast options, compatibility with low vision aids and layout of the intervention.

The decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), one of the multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques, relies on expert judgements to construct an influential network relation map (INRM), revealing the mutual causes and effects of the criteria and dimensions for presentation of the results in a visual manner. The interactional impacts may be evaluated without considering the presumed hypotheses. The DEMATEL has been successfully utilized to assist in complex decision-making problems in various contexts. However, there is controversy about the reliance upon expert judgements, which could be subjective. Thus, this study seeks to overcome this dispute by developing a data-driven, concept-based novel hybrid model which the authors call SEM-DEMATEL. The model first constructs the direct effects between indicators based on structural equation modeling (SEM) and then utilizes DEMATEL to confirm the interdependence among the variables and identify their causes and effects. Finally, an empirical study exploring the key factors affecting mobile payment usage intention is further conducted to demonstrate the feasibility, validity, and reliability of the novel SEM-DEMATEL research approach.

Muscles of mice with CKD have increased expression of nucleolar protein 66 (NO66), as do muscle biopsy specimens from patients with CKD or those undergoing hemodialysis. Inflammation stimulates NO66 expression and changes in NF-B mediate the response. METHODS Subtotal nephrectomy created a mouse model of CKD with BUN >80 mg/dl. Crossing NO66flox/flox with MCK-Cre mice bred muscle-specific NO66 (MCK-NO66) knockout mice. Experiments assessed the effect of removing NO66. RESULTS Muscle-specific NO66 knockout in mice blocks CKD-induced loss of muscle mass and improves protein synthesis. NO66 suppression of ribosomal biogenesis via demethylase activity is the mechanism behind these responses. In muscle cells, expression of NO66, but not of demethylase-dead mutant NO66, decreased H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 and suppressed pre-rRNA expression. Knocking out NO66 increased the enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 on ribosomal DNA. In primary muscle cells and in muscles of mice without NO66, ribosomal RNA, pre-rRNA, and protein synthesis all increased. CONCLUSIONS CKD suppresses muscle protein synthesis via epigenetic mechanisms that NO66 mediates.

Several studies have demonstrated that major blood loss during PD is associated with both short-term and long-term poor outcomes. Administration of perioperative tranexamic acid (TXA) has been reported to reduce intraoperative blood loss in various surgeries, including cardiovascular surgery and orthopaedic surgery. Nevertheless, the effect of perioperative TXA use in patients undergoing PD has not been investigated. This study aims to investigate the effect of TXA on blood loss during PD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A multicentre (six hospitals), randomised, blind (patient-blinded, surgeon-blinded, anaesthesiologist-blinded, monitor-blinded), placebo-controlled trial of TXA during PD was started in September 2019. Patients undergoing PD for biliary, duodenal or pancreatic diseases are randomly assigned to the TXA or placebo group. The stratification factors are the institutions and preoperative clinical diagnosis. Before skin incision, the participants in TXA group are administrated 1 g TXA as a loading infusion followed by a maintenance infusion of 125 mg/hour TXA until the end of surgery or 8 hours from the incision. Participants in the placebo group are administrated the same volume of saline that is indistinguishable from the TXA. The primary outcome is blood loss during PD. The secondary outcomes are intraoperative and postoperative (up to day 2) blood transfusions, operation time, anaesthesia time, postoperative laboratory variables, length of hospital stay, in-hospital and 90-day mortality and postoperative complications occurring within 28 days of surgery or requiring readmission.

According to the principle of cross-fusion, a bi-directional feature fusion structure is designed, in which features extracted from two branches are fused bi-directionally, and the parallel structures of branches are fused by a feature fusion module, forming a model that can extract features of different scales. To verify the effect of network classification, the classification accuracy on COVIDx-CT dataset is 96.7%, which is obviously higher than that of typical CNN network (ResNet-152) (95.2%) and Transformer network (Deit-B) (75.8%). These results demonstrate accuracy is improved. This model also provides a new method for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and through the combination of deep learning and medical imaging, it promotes the development of real-time diagnosis of lung diseases caused by COVID-19 infection, which is helpful for reliable and rapid diagnosis, thus saving precious lives.","output":"COVID-19 CT Image Recognition Algorithm Based on Transformer and CNN"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the WHO declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic. Although the number of infected cases is increasing, information about its clinical characteristics in the Middle East, especially in Iran, a country which is considered to be one of the most important focal points of the disease in the world, is lacking. To date, there is no available literature on the clinical data on COVID-19 patients in Iran. METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective study, 113 hospitalized confirmed cases of COVID-19 admitted to university affiliated hospitals in Shiraz, Iran from February 20 to March 20 were entered in the study. RESULTS: The mean age was 53.75 years and 71 (62.8%) were males. The most common symptoms at onset were fatigue (75: 66.4%), cough (73: 64.6%), and fever (67: 59.3%). Laboratory data revealed significant correlation between lymphocyte count (P value = 0.003), partial thromboplastin time (P value = 0.000), international normalized ratio (P value = 0.000) with the severity of the disease. The most common abnormality in chest CT scans was ground-glass opacity (77: 93.9%), followed by consolidation (48: 58.5%). Our results revealed an overall 8% (9 out of 113 cases) mortality rate among patients, in which the majority was among patients admitted to the ICU (5: 55.6%).

RECENT FINDINGS: In the 21st century, there have already been several outbreaks of infectious diseases that have led to mass casualties creating ICU strain, providing multiple opportunities for hospitals and hospital systems to prepare their ICUs for future events. Unfortunately, the sheer scale and rapidity of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to overwhelming strain on every aspect of ICU disaster preparedness. Yet, by analyzing experiences of hospitals throughout the first 7 months of the current pandemic in the areas of infection control, equipment preparedness, staffing strategies, ICU spatial logistics as well as acute and postacute treatment, various important lessons have already emerged that will prove critical for successful future ICU preparedness. SUMMARY: Preemptive planning, beginning with the early identification of staffing resources, supply chains and alternative equipment sources, coupled with strong infection control practices that also provide for the flexibility for evolving evidence is of utmost importance.

Therefore, we compared the computed tomography severity scores of smoking coronavirus disease 2019 patients with those of non-smoking coronavirus disease 2019 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 121 patients were included in our study group. We retrospectively reviewed 121 patients who underwent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction sampling and computed tomography examination in our hospital between April 1, 2020, and July 30, 2020. All computed tomography images were independently reviewed by 2 radiologists. RESULTS There were 15 (12.4%) active smokers, 38 (31.4%) former smokers, and 68 (56.2%) never-smokers in this study. Among the 85 patients with evidence of pneumonia in thorax computed tomography, mean computed tomography severity scores were 8.02 and standard deviation 5.812. Computed tomography severity scores for patients with pathological computed tomography scans (n = 85) were performed for evaluating smoking status (never-smokers and smokers). We found a statistically significant relationship between computed tomography severity scores of never-smokers (n = 39) and smokers (n = 46) (Z = 2.243, P = .025). The computed tomography severity scores threshold for differentiating smokers in our study group was 8, with a sensitivity of 52.2% and a specificity of 79.5%. Among the 121 patients, 34 (28.1%) were in the asymptomatic group, 36 (29.75%) were in the mild group, 28 (23.14%) were in the common group, and 23 (19.0%) were in the severe group with severe pneumonia and respiratory distress. Five (1.47%), 16 (44.44%), 14 (50%), and 18 (78.26%) of the patients in these groups were smoking, respectively. CONCLUSION Among coronavirus disease 2019 patients, smoking is associated with the progression of the disease and increased adverse effects. In our study, smoking status was significantly correlated with thorax computed tomography findings on admission.

The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of POPs in irrigation water, soil and in Amaranthus viridis (A. viridis) from different gardening sites in Kinshasa to evaluate the potential environmental and human health risks. A survey study for the use of pesticides and fertilizers was carried out with 740 market gardeners. The levels of POPs (including organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)) were analyzed in irrigation water and 144 vegetable samples collected from different gardening sites. The assessment of potential human health risk was estimated by calculating daily intake and toxic equivalency to quantify the carcinogenicity. The results show highest PAH levels in A. viridis from all studied sites. The concentrations of the sum of seven PCBs (7PCBS) congeners in analyzed plants ranged between 15.89 and 401.36 ng g?1. The distributions of OCPs in both water and A. viridis were congener specific, chlorpyrifos-ethyl and p,p-DDE were predominantly detected. Among PBDEs, only BDE47 was quantified with noticeable concentration in A. viridis, while no PBDEs were detected in irrigation water. Higher estimated daily intake values indicate that consuming leafy vegetables might associate with increased human health risks. However, calculated incremental lifetime cancer risk values indicates no potential carcinogenic risk for the local population. The results of this study provide important information on A. viridis contamination by POPs and strongly recommend implementing the appropriate measures to control the use of chemicals used in studied gardening areas. Thus in Kinshasa, urban agriculture control programs for POPs and fertilizers is very important in order to protect the public health through direct and dietary exposure pathways.","output":"Occurrence of organic micropollutants and human health risk assessment based on consumption of Amaranthus viridis, Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite progress, diversity and minority representation within the pediatric surgery workforce still does not match the expansive backgrounds of the patients we treat.

SNVs are unevenly distributed throughout the genome and hotspots for mutations were found for the spike gene and ORF 1ab. We describe a set of predicted spike protein epitopes whose variability is negligible. Additionally, all predicted epitopes for the structural E, M and N proteins are highly conserved. The amino acid changes present in the spike glycoprotein of variables of concern (VOCs) comprise between 3.4% and 20.7% of the predicted epitopes of this protein.

The long-term pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 remain unknown. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a post-COVID follow-up service to estimate the burden of persistent pulmonary morbidity in hospitalised COVID survivors. RESULTS: A total of 221 patients were followed-up: 44 intensive care unit (ICU) and 177 ward patients. Further investigations were planned as per British Thoracic Society Guidelines: For all ICU patients (n = 44) and for 38 of 177 (21%) ward-based patients who had persistent symptoms and/or persistent radiographic changes on CXR at their initial 8-week follow-up visit. In the ward-based cohort, statistically significant associations with persistent symptoms were being an ex- or current smoker, having pre-existing diabetes, and having a longer length of stay. In patients requiring further investigations, pulmonary function tests (PFTs; n = 67) at an average of 15 weeks post-discharge showed abnormalities in at least one PFT parameter in 79% (equating to 24% of the entire cohort). The most common abnormality was an abnormal diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (TLCO), highest in the ICU cohort (64% ICU vs. 38% non-ICU). TLCO correlated negatively with length of stay and with maximum inspired FiO(2) in the patient group as a whole. In ICU patients, TLCO correlated negatively with maximum inspired positive airway pressure. Computed tomography scans (n = 72) at an average of 18 weeks post-discharge showed evidence of persistent ground glass opacities in 44% and fibrosis in 21% (equating to 7% of the entire cohort).

Cross-sectional analyses were performed at two time-points: before and after receiving the diagnosis. RESULTS: A higher level of anxiety among cancer patients resulted in a decreased risk of depression among spousal caregivers. Moreover, a higher anxiety among spousal caregivers increased their own risk of depression, but it didn't influence depression risk among cancer patients. While there is an intra-individual relationship between a higher level of trait anxiety and a greater risk of depression prior to cancer diagnosis, there is no cross-influence between spouses.

Measurements of daily consumption without exposure to nudges were carried out during four other days (1 day every other week, alternated with the nudging days). The results showed no effect of the nudging strategy; instead, it pointed to the importance of the price as a determinant of buying decisions.

Elderly male and nulliparous female CCP donors who resided in the areas with high load of virus had positive ELISA and rapid test results as well as high levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies titer. Moreover, the long hospital stay and elderly donors were the variables associated with high levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that nulliparous female and male donors with positive rapid tests who resided in areas with a higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, with more than 40 years of age and long hospitalization time can be the preferred donors for CCP donation.","output":"The demographic and serological characteristics of COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors: Identification of basic criteria for optimal donor selection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Investing in human resources for health (HRH) is vital for achieving universal health care and the Sustainable Development Goals. The Programa Mais Mdicos (PMM) (More Doctors Programme) provided 17,000 doctors, predominantly from Cuba, to work in Brazilian primary care. This study assesses whether PMM doctor allocation to municipalities was consistent with programme criteria and associated impacts on amenable mortality. METHODS: Difference-in-differences regression analysis, exploiting variation in PMM introduction across 5565 municipalities over the period 2008C2017, was employed to examine programme impacts on doctor density and mortality amenable to healthcare. Heterogeneity in effects was explored with respect to doctor allocation criteria and municipal doctor density prior to PMM introduction. RESULTS: After starting in 2013, PMM was associated with an increase in PMM-contracted primary care doctors of 15.1 per 100,000 population. However, largescale substitution of existing primary care doctors resulting in a net increase of only 5.7 per 100,000. Increases in both PMM and total primary care doctors were lower in priority municipalities due to lower allocation of PMM doctors and greater substitution effects. The PMM led to amenable mortality reductions of ? 1.06 per 100,000 (95%CI: ? 1.78 to ? 0.34) annually C with greater benefits in municipalities prioritised for doctor allocation and where doctor density was low before programme implementation. CONCLUSIONS: PMM potential health benefits were undermined due to widespread allocation of doctors to non-priority areas and local substitution effects.

FBT has primarily been implemented in specialty clinics, with highly trained interventionists. The goal of this study is to assess effectiveness of FBT implemented in pediatric primary care settings using newly trained interventionists who might implement FBT in pediatric practices. The goal is to randomize 528 families with a child with overweight/obesity (85th BMI percentile) and parent with overweight/obesity (BMI  25) across four sites (Buffalo and Rochester, New York; Columbus, Ohio; St. Louis, Missouri) to FBT or usual care and obtain assessments at 6-month intervals over 24 months of treatment. FBT is implemented using a mastery model, which provides quantity of treatment tailored to family progress and following the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for effective dose and duration of treatment. The primary outcome of the trial is change in relative weight for children, and secondarily, for parents and siblings who are overweight/obese. Between group differences in the tendency to prefer small immediate rewards over larger, delayed rewards (delay discounting) and how this is related to treatment outcome is also evaluated. Challenges in translation of group-based interventions to individualized treatments in primary care settings, and in study implementation that arose due to the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed. It is hypothesized that the FBT intervention will be associated with better changes in relative weight for children, parents, and siblings than usual care.

Design: A cross sectional prospective study was performed on thirty RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal, India, between September 10 and 20, 2020. Ten healthy volunteers were recruited as the control group. IFN, TNF, and IL-21 profiling was conducted using plasma samples, and gut bacterial analysis was performed after obtaining the metagenomics data of stool samples. Results: Patients with a variable COVID-19 severity showed distinct gut microflora and peripheral interleukin-21 levels. A low Firmicute/Bacteroidetes ratio, caused by the depletion of the fibre-utilizing bacteria, F. prausnitzii, B. Plebius, and Prevotella, and an increase in Bacteroidetes has associated gut microbiota dysbiosis with COVID-19 disease severity.

Consequently, novel and more efficacious agents are urgently needed. We have developed a bispecific antibody, 2022, consisting of two antibodies, 2F8 and VHH18. 2F8 was isolated from our proprietary fully synthetic human IDEAL (Intelligently Designed and Engineered Antibody Library)-VH/VL library and VHH18 is a single domain antibody isolated from IDEAL-nanobody library. 2022 was constructed by attaching VHH18 to the C-terminal of Fc of 2F8. 2022 binds two non-overlapping epitopes simultaneously on the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and blocks the binding of RBD to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 2022 potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and all of the variants tested in both pseudovirus and live virus assays, including variants carrying mutations known to resist neutralizing antibodies approved under EUA and that reduce the protection efficiency of current effective vaccines. The half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2022 is 270 pM, 30 pM, 20 pM, and 1 pM, for wild-type, alpha, beta, and delta pseudovirus, respectively. In the live virus assay, 2022 has an IC50 of 26.4 pM, 13.3 pM, and 88.6 pM, for wild-type, beta, and delta live virus, respectively. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2, 2022 showed strong prophylactic and therapeutic effects. A single administration of 2022 intranasal (i.n.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) 24 hours before virus challenge completely protected all mice from bodyweight loss, as compared with up to 20% loss of bodyweight in placebo treated mice. In addition, the lung viral titers were undetectable (FRNT assay) in all mice treated with 2022 either prophylactically or therapeutically, as compared with around 1105 pfu/g lung tissue in placebo treated mice.

The recent outbreak of influenza A (H1N1, also termed as swine flu), first reported in Mexico on April 26, 2009, occurred in the forty first year since last reported flu pandemic (July 1968). Within less than 50 days, it has assumed pandemic proportions (phase VI) affecting over 76 countries with 163 deaths/35,928 cases (as on 15(th) June 2009). It indicated the re-emergence of genetically reassorted virus having strains endemic to humans, swine and avian (H5N1). The World Health Organisation (WHO) member states have already pulled up their socks and geared up to combat such criticalities. Earlier outbreaks of avian flu (H5N1) in different countries led WHO to develop pandemic preparedness strategies with national/regional plans on pandemic preparedness. Numerous factors related to climatic conditions, socio-economic strata, governance and sharing of information/logistics at all levels have been considered critical indicators in monitoring the dynamics of escalation towards a pandemic situation.

An assessment was made of the cytotoxic and antiviral activities and possible mode of action of the tannin ellagic acid from the leaves of Lagerstroemia speciosa toward HeLa cells and three rhinoviruses, HRV-2, -3, and -4. METHODS: The antiviral property and mechanism of action of ellagic acid were evaluated using a sulforhodamine B assay and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with SYBR Green dye. Results were compared with those of the currently used broad-spectrum antiviral agent, ribavirin. RESULTS: As judged by 50% inhibitory concentration values, natural ellagic acid was 1.8, 2.3, and 2.2 times more toxic toward HRV-2 (38 g/mL), HRV-3 (31 g/mL), and HRV-4 (29 g/mL) than ribavirin, respectively. The inhibition rate of preincubation with 50 g/mL ellagic acid was 17%, whereas continuous presence of ellagic acid during infection led to a significant increase in the inhibition (70%). Treatment with 50 g/mL ellagic acid considerably suppressed HRV-4 infection only when added just after the virus inoculation (0 h) (87% inhibition), but not before -1 h or after 1 h or later (<20% inhibition). These findings suggest that ellagic acid does not interact with the HRV-4 particles and may directly interact with the human cells in the early stage of HRV infections to protect the cells from the virus destruction. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis revealed that 50 g/mL ellagic acid strongly inhibited the RNA replication of HRV-4 in HeLa cells, suggesting that ellagic acid inhibits virus replication by targeting on cellular molecules, rather than virus molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Global efforts to reduce the level of antibiotics justify further studies on L. speciosa leaf-derived materials containing ellagic acid as potential anti-HRV products or a lead molecule for the prevention or treatment of HRV infection.","output":"Antiviral activity and possible mode of action of ellagic acid identified in Lagerstroemia speciosa leaves toward human rhinoviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are at risk of developing many neuropsychiatric disorders, due to the effects of the disease on the brain and the psychosocial pressures of having the disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19, who underwent psychiatric consultations. The medical records of 892 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 and the 89 among them who requested psychiatric consultations were analyzed retrospectively. After the psychiatric consultations, patients were most frequently diagnosed with delirium (38.2 %), adjustment disorder (27.0 %), depressive disorder (19.1 %) and anxiety disorder (11.2 %). Patients with delirium had longer hospital stays (p < 0.001), were transferred more frequently to intensive care units (p < 0.001), and had higher mortality rates during their hospital stays (p < 0.001), than all other patients. The need for oxygen (p < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001) was also significantly higher in delirium patients, as well as in patients who received other psychiatric diagnoses. Neuropsychiatric disorders develop in patients receiving inpatient treatments in COVID-19 wards, and these disorders negatively affect the prognosis of COVID-19.

Additionally, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling plays a variety of roles in cancer progression and survival as well as PDT-mediated cytotoxicity, so EGFR inhibitors may be valuable in enhancing the therapeutic index of intraperitoneal PDT. This study examines escalating doses of benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD)-mediated intraperitoneal PDT combined with the EGFR-inhibitor cetuximab in a canine model. In the presence or absence of small bowel resection (SBR) and cetuximab, we observed a tolerable safety and toxicity profile related to the light dose received. Additionally, our findings that BPD levels are higher in the small bowel compared to other anatomical regions, and that the risk of anastomotic failure decreases at lower light doses will help to inform the design of similar PC treatments in humans.","output":"Preclinical Evaluation of Cetuximab and Benzoporphyrin Derivative-Mediated Intraperitoneal Photodynamic Therapy in a Canine Model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To describe the impact and policy response to the COVID-19 Pandemic on Norway and the implications this has for future policy development and Norwegian society.

Its consequence was a re-evaluation of the culture of workplaces and a significant change has occurred to the pattern of daytime employment distribution. In this paper, the network distribution model was built with three constraints, Distribution Bias 1, 2, and 3. These biases were determined through questionnaires, survey data collections of responses from Yangonites, and geographical data of urban employment cores. These percentile biases influenced the amount of employed population per distribution times and gave rise to two results. One was the ordinary daytime employed population and another was the improved daytime employed distribution (considering WFH). These two results were compared and contrasted with coefficient of variations, t-tests, and other correlation methods to determine the effect of WFH on the daytime employed population. With survey data, it was clarified that majorities in Yangon do favor work from home as an alternative option for future employment. Subsequently, the compared results revealed that work from home significantly decreased the amount of employment distribution and the amount of such decrements were more consistent and had less variations, hence reducing cramming during daytime distribution. ?

MetS increases the risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, there still is not total clinical consensus about the definition of MetS, and its pathophysiology seems to be heterogeneous. Moreover, it remains unclear whether MetS is a single syndrome or a set of diverse clinical conditions conferring different metabolic and cardiovascular risks. Indeed, traditional biomarkers alone do not explain well such heterogeneity or the risk of associated diseases. There is thus a need to identify additional biomarkers that may contribute to a better understanding of MetS, along with more accurate prognosis of its various chronic disease risks. To fulfill this need, omics technologies may offer new insights into associations between sphingolipids and cardiometabolic diseases. Particularly, ceramides Cthe most widely studied sphingolipid classC have been shown to play a causative role in both T2DM and CVD.

The patient did not show up to the clinic for a while due to COVID 19 pandemic lockdown, leading to a true unilateral crossbite at the dental arch's upper left side, especially at the molar premolars area. This unilateral cross bite was treated using a new specially designed expanded appliance as a unilateral posterior cross bite dental maxillary expander. As a result of this study, orthodontic treatment was finished within (15) months, much less than expected. We obtained Class I molar and canine relationships with uncrossed dental arches in both upper arch sides, proper overbite and overjet with well-leveled and aligned teeth as it confirmed by clinical examination and radiographic images (OPG (Orthopantomogram) and cephalometric radiograph (WebCeph analysis digitalized computer program).

METHODS: Using Poisson regression and regularized linear regression (elastic net), we evaluated the association between neighborhood characteristics and COVID-19 mortality rates in Chicago through July 22 (2514 deaths across 795 populated census tracts). RESULTS: Black residents (31% of the population) accounted for 42% of COVID-19 deaths. Deaths among Hispanic/Latino residents occurred at a younger age (63 years, compared to 71 for white residents). Regarding residential setting, 52% of deaths among white residents occurred inside nursing homes, compared to 35% of deaths among Black residents and 17% among Hispanic/Latino residents. Higher COVID-19 mortality was seen in neighborhoods with heightened barriers to social distancing and low health insurance coverage. Neighborhoods with a higher percentage of white and Asian residents had lower COVID-19 mortality. The associations differed by race, suggesting that neighborhood context may be most tightly linked to COVID-19 mortality among white residents.

Recent studies suggest that the population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, a proxy for the number of asymptomatic cases, could be an order of magnitude larger than expected from the number of reported symptomatic cases. Knowing the precise prevalence and contagiousness of asymptomatic transmission is critical to estimate the overall dimension and pandemic potential of COVID-19. However, at this stage, the effect of the asymptomatic population, its size, and its outbreak dynamics remain largely unknown. Here we use reported symptomatic case data in conjunction with antibody seroprevalence studies, a mathematical epidemiology model, and a Bayesian framework to infer the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Our model computes, in real time, the time-varying contact rate of the outbreak, and projects the temporal evolution and credible intervals of the effective reproduction number and the symptomatic, asymptomatic, and recovered populations. Our study quantifies the sensitivity of the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 to three parameters: the effective reproduction number, the ratio between the symptomatic and asymptomatic populations, and the infectious periods of both groups. For nine distinct locations, our model estimates the fraction of the population that has been infected and recovered by Jun 15, 2020 to 24.15% (95% CI: 20.48%-28.14%) for Heinsberg (NRW, Germany), 2.40% (95% CI: 2.09%-2.76%) for Ada County (ID, USA), 46.19% (95% CI: 45.81%-46.60%) for New York City (NY, USA), 11.26% (95% CI: 7.21%-16.03%) for Santa Clara County (CA, USA), 3.09% (95% CI: 2.27%-4.03%) for Denmark, 12.35% (95% CI: 10.03%-15.18%) for Geneva Canton (Switzerland), 5.24% (95% CI: 4.84%-5.70%) for the Netherlands, 1.53% (95% CI: 0.76%-2.62%) for Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), and 5.32% (95% CI: 4.77%-5.93%) for Belgium. Our method traces the initial outbreak date in Santa Clara County back to January 20, 2020 (95% CI: December 29, 2019CFebruary 13, 2020).

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in China using a 37-item questionnaire developed based on previous research. A professional online survey tool (www.wjx.cn) and a social media platform (WeChat) were used to display and distribute the questionnaire. Data were collected during April 11 to 13, 2020, when most regions of China had resumed dental practice except for high-risk regions such as Wuhan. Then the data were analyzed with multivariable generalized estimating equations. Results: A total of 2,669 valid questionnaires were collected. Orthodontic services were suspended for nearly all respondents (97.8%) during the epidemic, and 68.0% had resumed work by the time they completed the questionnaire. The majority of respondents (80.2%) were confident that they understood COVID-19 related knowledge, but most of them only correctly answered less than half of the questions testing their actual level of knowledge. About two-thirds (64.1%) were willing to treat/care for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. The completion of relevant training programs was significantly associated with more confidence in knowledge mastery (P < 0.001) and a higher actual level of knowledge (P < 0.001), but did not increase their willingness to treat/care for patients with COVID-19 (P = 0.235). Conclusions: Before work resumption, COVID-19-related training programs are essential for the improvement of knowledge, confidence, and preparedness of orthodontic professionals.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Between January 2000 and May 2016, 287 patients (193 men, 94 women) underwent LPN performed by four surgeons. The median (range) patient age was 59 (19-85) years, tumour size 3.1 (1-9) cm and PADUA score 7.3 (6-12). Access was retroperitoneal in 235 cases (82%). Since October 2010, we have used the ETHOS? chair (ETHOS? , Seattle, WA, USA) during excision of the tumour in 130 patients (45.3%). A total of 51 tumours (17.7%) were excised without ischaemia and 226 (78.7%) under warm ischaemia, with clamping of the renal artery using an enucleo-resection technique. We suture the resection bed and perform renorrhaphy using a barbed-suture pre-loaded with absorbable LAPRA-TY? clips (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA). The impact of the ETHOS chair was examined using a matched-pair analysis (66 with ETHOS chair vs 67 without ETHOS chair). RESULTS The median (range) operating time was 146 (60-325) min, the median (range) estimated blood loss was 99 (10-3 000) mL and the mean (range) warm ischaemia time (WIT) was 17.1 (7-47) min. Histology showed 240 (83.6%) renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) and 46 (15.9%) benign tumours. The cumulative overall disease-free survival rate after a median (range) follow-up of 84 (3-155) months was 100% for 203 pT1 RCCs and local recurrence was observed in one patient (0.4%), who was managed by radical nephrectomy. There were two conversions (0.7%) to open surgery, both to hand-assisted laparoscopy. Perirenal haematoma was observed in 13 patients (4.5%). A total of 20 patients (6.9%) required transfusions (2-11 units). We observed five urine leaks (1.7%) requiring prolonged drainage. The median (range) length of hospital stay was 5 (3-24) days. Three patients developed arteriovenous fistulas, which were successfully occluded by superselective embolization (1.0%). Use of the ETHOS chair resulted in shorter operating time (134.7 vs 168.5 min; P = 0.04), including WIT (13.1 vs 15.9 min; P = 0.01), and a lower complication rate (15 vs 29.8%; P = 0.02).

We aim to compare population attributable risk estimates obtained from different statistical approaches regarding their consistency. We use a real-life data set from the PROSCIS study to identify predictors for mortality and functional impairment one year after first-ever ischemic stroke and quantify their contribution to poor outcome using population attributable risks. METHODS The PROSpective Cohort with Incident Stroke (PROSCIS) is a prospective observational hospital-based cohort study of patients after first-ever stroke conducted independently in Berlin (PROSCIS-B) and Munich (PROSCIS-M). The association of baseline factors with poor outcome one year after stroke in PROSCIS-B was analysed using multiple logistic regression analysis and population attributable risks were calculated, which were estimated using sequential population attributable risk based on a multiple generalized additive regression model, doubly robust estimation, as well as using average sequential population attributable risk. Findings were reproduced in an independent validation sample from PROSCIS-M. RESULTS Out of 507 patients with available outcome information after 12 months in PROSCIS-B, 20.5% suffered from poor outcome. Factors associated with poor outcome were age, pre-stroke physical disability, stroke severity (NIHSS), education, and diabetes mellitus. The order of risk factors ranked by magnitudes of population attributable risk was almost similar for all methods, but population attributable risk estimates varied markedly between the methods. In PROSCIS-M, incidence of poor outcome and distribution of baseline parameters were comparable. The multiple logistic regression model could be reproduced for all predictors, except pre-stroke physical disability. Similar to PROSCIS-B, the order of risk factors ranked by magnitudes of population attributable risk was almost similar for all methods, but magnitudes of population attributable risk differed markedly between the methods. CONCLUSIONS Ranking of risk factors by population impact is not affected by the different statistical approaches. Thus, for a rational decision on which risk factor to target in disease interventions, population attributable risk is a supportive tool. However, population attributable risk estimates are difficult to interpret and are not comparable when they origin from studies applying different methodology. The predictors for poor outcome identified in PROSCIS-B have a relevant impact on mortality and functional impairment one year after first-ever ischemic stroke.","output":"Outcome after stroke attributable to baseline factors-The PROSpective Cohort with Incident Stroke (PROSCIS)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose To determine the perceived self-efficacy of South African LIS academics in e-teaching as a co-requisite to imparting relevant ICT knowledge and skills to LIS students Design/methodology/approach The study was underpinned by the pragmatic world view, which allows a researcher to choose a combination of methods, techniques and procedures that best meets the needs and purposes of the study Based on the purpose and objectives of the study, and the type of data needed, a quantitative approach, employing the descriptive survey design was used An online questionnaire with both structured and unstructured questions was distributed to 79 LIS academics in 8 universities and attracted a 68 4% response rate Structured responses were computed directly as quantitative data, while the unstructured answers were aggregated under themes and analysed quantitatively Findings The findings show that LIS academics in South Africa have not been left behind in the trends regarding e-teaching, and most of them feel quite confident about their self-efficacy in e-teaching A variety of Learning Management Systems and e-tools are in use and relevant policies and technical support available Most LIS academics, to re-/up-skill themselves, employ diverse heutagogical strategies However, the e-teaching support in terms of resources and technical support are inadequate because some universities are deficient in their provision of ICTs and e-learning guidelines Research limitations/implications The limitations of the study is that this was a time-bound study that focused merely on the basic level investigation A further in-depth probing of the real (as opposed to self) levels of e-teaching efficacy and how heutagogy can be explored or advocated is necessary Practical implications The implications of the results are that (1) South African LIS academics are well fairly well prepares to face the impact of COVID-19, which has forced universities to turn to virtual/online education (2) Heutagogical approach should be explored as a method of further improving the capabilities of e-teachers, in order to (3) pass forward a positive impact on LIS graduates by preparing them to be agile for a modern work environment (4) universities have to provide sufficient resources to support academics in their endeavour to continually improve their teaching Social implications Topical in the face of the novel coronavirus Originality/value Optimal","output":"The status of electronic teaching within South African LIS Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A few studies have revealed the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed from 111 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Union Hospital. The gathered data of discharged and deteriorated patients were compared. RESULTS: Among these 111 patients, 93 patients were discharged and 18 patients were deteriorated. The lymphocyte count (0.56 G/L [0.47-0.63] vs 1.30 G/L [0.95-1.65]) was lower in the deteriorated group than those in the discharged group. The numbers of pulmonary lobe involved (5.00 [5.00-5.00] vs 4.00 [2.00-5.00]), serum C-reactive protein (CRP, 79.52 mg/L [61.25-102.98] vs 7.93 mg/L [3.14-22.50]), IL-6 (35.72 pg/mL [9.24-85.19] vs 5.09 pg/mL [3.16-9.72]), and IL-10 (5.35 pg/mL [4.48-7.84] vs 3.97 pg/mL [3.34-4.79]) concentrations in deteriorated patients were elevated compared with discharged patients.

The pathophysiology of these lesions is still widely debated and an association with SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unconfirmed. OBJECTIVES: This paper focus on the unresolved issues about these COVID toes and in particular whether or not they are associated with COVID-19. ARGUMENTS: The temporal link between the outbreak of chilblains and the COVID-19 pandemic is a first suggests a link between the two events. Positive anti-SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 immunostaining on skin biopsy of chilblains seem to confirm the presence of the virus in the lesions, but lack specificity and must be interpreted with caution. Conversely, RT-PCR and anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology were negative in the majority of patients with chilblains. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection can be excluded, with relative certainty, even after accounting for possible lower immunization in mild/asymptomatic patients and for some differences in sensitivity/specificity between the tests used. Some authors hypothesize that chilblains could be the cutaneous expression of a strong type I interferon (IFN-I) response. High production of IFN-I is suggested to be associated with early viral control and may suppress antibody response. However, the absence of other cutaneous or extracutaneous symptoms as observed in other interferonopathies raises unanswered questions. To date, a direct link between chilblains and COVID-19 still seems impossible to confirm. A more indirect association due to lifestyle changes induced by lockdown is a possible explanation. Improvement of chilblains when protective measures were adopted and after lifting of lockdown, support this hypothesis. CONCLUSION: Conflicting current evidence highlights the need for systematic and repeated testing of larger numbers of patients and the need for valid follow-up data that take into consideration epidemic curves and evolution of lockdown measures.","output":"COVID toes: where do we stand with the current evidence?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vitamin D deficiency, which impedes good immune function, is common during winter and spring in regions of high latitude. There is good evidence that vitamin D deficiency contributes to the seasonal increase of virus infections of the respiratory tract, from the common cold to influenza, and now possibly also COVID-19. This communication explores key factors that make it more likely, particularly in combination, that individuals are vitamin D deficient. These factors include old age, obesity, dark skin tone and common genetic variants that impede vitamin D status. Precision nutrition is an approach that aims to consider known personal risk factors and health circumstances to provide more effective nutrition guidance in health and disease. In regard to avoiding vitamin D deficiency, people with excess body fat, a dark skin tone or older age usually need to use a moderately dosed daily vitamin D supplement, particularly those living in a high-latitude region, getting little ultraviolet B exposure due to air pollution or staying mostly indoors. Carriers of the GC (group-specific component) rs4588 AA genotype also are more likely to become deficient. Very high-dosed supplements with more than 4000 IU vitamin D are rarely needed or justified. A state-by-state Mendelian randomisation analysis of excess COVID-19 mortality of African-Americans in the USA shows a greater disparity in northern states than in southern states. It is conceivable that vitamin D adequacy denies the virus easy footholds and thereby slows spreading of the contagion. This finding should drive home the message that vitamin D supplementation is particularly important for individuals with dark skin tones. Vitamin D deficiency, even for a few months during the winter and spring season, must be rigorously remedied because of its many adverse health impacts that include decreased life expectancy and increased mortality.

Social distancing (SD) interventions applied so far have included school closures, remote working and quarantine. These measures have been shown to have large impacts on pandemic influenza transmission. However, there has been comparatively little examination of such measures for COVID-19. Methods: We examined the existing literature, and collated data, on implementation of NPIs to examine their effects on the COVID-19 pandemic so far. Data on NPIs were collected from official government websites as well as from media sources. Results: Measures such as travel restrictions have been implemented in multiple countries and appears to have slowed the geographic spread of COVID-19 and reduced initial case numbers. We find that, due to the relatively sparse information on the differences with and without interventions, it is difficult to quantitatively assess the efficacy of many interventions. Similarly, whilst the comparison to other pandemic diseases such as influenza can be helpful, there are key differences that could affect the efficacy of similar NPIs. Conclusions: The timely implementation of control measures is key to their success and must strike a balance between early enough application to reduce the peak of the epidemic and ensuring that they can be feasibly maintained for an appropriate duration. Such measures can have large societal impacts and they need to be appropriately justified to the population.

Variables having p values of less than 0.05 at the 95% confidence interval (CI) were considered as factors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. RESULTS: A total of 416 respondents participated in the survey, with a response rate of 98.6%. About 59.4% of the respondents were willing to accept the COVID-19 vaccine.

Reverse genetics allows for the molecular study of pathogenic determinants to enable rational vaccine design. The recombinant IBV (rIBV) Beau-R, a molecular clone of the apathogenic Beaudette strain, has previously been investigated as a vaccine platform. To determine tissues in which Beau-R could effectively deliver antigenic genes, an in vivo study in chickens, the natural host, was used to compare the pattern of viral dissemination of Beau-R to the pathogenic strain M41-CK. Replication of Beau-R was found to be restricted to soft tissue within the beak, whereas M41-CK was detected in beak tissue, trachea and eyelid up to seven days post infection. In vitro assays further identified that, unlike M41-CK, Beau-R could not replicate at 41 C, the core body temperature of a chicken, but is able to replicate a 37 C, a temperature relatable to the very upper respiratory tract. Using a panel of rIBVs with defined mutations in the structural and accessory genes, viral replication at permissive and non-permissive temperatures was investigated, identifying that the Beau-R replicase gene was a determinant of temperature sensitivity and that sub-genomic mRNA synthesis had been affected. The identification of temperature sensitive allelic lesions within the Beau-R replicase gene opens up the possibility of using this method of attenuation in other IBV strains for future vaccine development as well as a method to investigate the functions of the IBV replicase proteins.","output":"Temperature Sensitivity: A Potential Method for the Generation of Vaccines against the Avian Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we evaluated 3444 Latin American natural products using cheminformatic tools. We also characterized 196 compounds for the first time from the flora of El Salvador that were compared with the databases of secondary metabolites from Brazil, Mexico, and Panama, and 42 969 compounds (natural, semi-synthetic, synthetic) from different regions of the world. The overall analysis was performed using drug-likeness properties, molecular fingerprints of different designs, two parameters similarity, molecular scaffolds, and molecular complexity metrics. It was found that, in general, Salvadoran natural products have a large diversity based on fingerprints. Simultaneously, those belonging to Mexico and Panama present the greatest diversity of scaffolds compared to the other databases. This study provided evidence of the high structural complexity that Latin America's natural products have as a benchmark. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on a global level. Thus, in the search for substances that may influence the coronavirus life cycle, the secondary metabolites from El Salvador and Panama were evaluated by docking against the endoribonuclease NSP-15, an enzyme involved in the SARS CoV-2 viral replication.

Methods We prospectively collected medical records of 14 health care workers (HCWs) who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, in neurosurgery department of Wuhan Union Hospital, China. Results Among the 14 HCWs, 12 were conformed cases, the other 2 were suspected cases. Most of them were either exposed to the two index patients or infected coworkers, without knowing they were COVID-19 patients. There were 4 male and 10 female infected HCWs in this cohort, whose mean age was 36 years (SD, 6 years). The main symptoms included myalgia or fatigue (100%), fever (86%) and dry cough (71%). On admission, 79% of infected HCWs showed leucopenia and 43% lymphopenia. Reduced complement C3 could be seen in 57% of the infected HCWs and IL-6 was significently elevated in 86% of them. The proportion of lymphocytes subsets, concentrations of immunoglobulins, complement C4, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, TNF- and IFN- were within normal range in these 14 infected HCWs. The most frequent findings on pulmonary computed tomographic images were bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacifications (86%). Conclusions Human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 pneumonia has occurred among HCWs, and most of these infected HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 are mild cases.

The third extracellular domain of NTCP presents a stretch of nine aminoacids (KGIVISLVL) that is characterized by pronounced hydrophobicity and serves as receptor for a protein, preS1, showing the hydrophobic epta-peptide sequence NPLGFFP. Vitamin D-binding protein macrophage activating factor (DBP-MAF) is a multifunctional protein that is characterized by two hydrophobic regions able to bind fatty acids and vitamin D, respectively. Here we demonstrate that NTCP and DBP-MAF show significant sequence similarities as far as hydrophobic stretches of aminoacids are concerned. Alignment of the sequence of seven aminoacids preceding the 157-KGIVISLVL-165 stretch of NTCP shows four aminoacids that are identical to those of the corresponding sequence of DBP-MAF, and two that are conserved substitutions. In addition, in the sequence of DBP-MAF that is aligned with the sequence YKGIVISLVL of NTCP, there are two contiguous negatively charged aminoacids (ED) and, in the preceding epta-peptide sequence, there are three negatively charged aminoacids (D-ED), whereas in the corresponding sequence of NTCP there are only two (D--D) that are not contiguous. This concentration of negatively charged aminoacids may be involved in binding of protein inserts characterized by high density of positively charges residues.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All CT angiogram (CTA) and venous duplex extremity ultrasound (US) examinations performed on 192 consecutively documented cases of COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed at a multi-centered healthcare system. Clinical characteristics and patient outcomes were evaluated and compared between two groups based on the presence or absence of acute thromboembolic events. RESULTS: Of the 16,264 patients tested for COVID-19, 3727 (23%) were positive. Out of those, 192 patients underwent 245 vascular imaging studies including chest CTA (86), venous duplex ultrasound (134), and CTA head and neck (25). Among those who underwent imaging, 49 (26%) demonstrated acute thromboembolic events which included 13/86 (15%) with PE, 34/134 (25%) with DVT, and 6/25 (24%) with CVA. One patient had positive results on all 3 examinations, and 2 patients had positive results on both chest CTA and venous duplex US.

Objective: This study aimed to investigate what factors determined the mortality and length of hospitalisation in individuals with COVID-19. Data Source: This is a systematic review with data from four electronic databases: Scopus, Google Scholar, CINAHL and Web of Science. Eligibility Criteria: Studies were included in this review if they explored determinants of COVID-19 mortality or length of hospitalisation, were written in the English Language, and had available full-text. Study appraisal and data synthesis: The authors assessed the quality of the included studies with the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality checklist, depending on their study design. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed with risk of bias assessment tool for non-randomised studies. A narrative synthesis of the evidence was carried out. Results: The review included 22 studies from nine countries, with participants totalling 239,830. The included studies quality was moderate to high. The identified determinants were categorised into demographic, biological, socioeconomic and lifestyle risk factors, based on the Dahlgren and Whitehead determinant of health model. Increasing age (ORs 1.04-20.6, 95%CIs 1.01-22.68) was the common demographic determinant of COVID-19 mortality while living with diabetes (ORs 0.50-3.2, 95%CIs -0.2-0.74) was one of the most common biological determinants of COVID-19 length of hospitalisation. Review limitation: Meta-analysis was not conducted because of included studies heterogeneity. Conclusion: COVID-19 outcomes are predicted by multiple determinants, with increasing age and living with diabetes being the most common risk factors.

We aimed to study the prehospital management of patients in acute respiratory distress with an indication for NIV and whether they received it or not. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients 18 years old who were cared for acute respiratory distress in a prehospital setting. Indications for NIV were oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) <90% and/or respiratory rate (RR) >25/min with a presumptive diagnosis of APE or COPD exacerbation. Study population characteristics, initial and at hospital vital signs, presumptive and definitive diagnosis were analyzed. For patients who received NIV, dyspnea level was evaluated with a dyspnea verbal ordinal scale (D-VOS, 0-10) and arterial blood gas (ABG) values were obtained at hospital arrival. RESULTS: Among the 187 consecutive patients included in the study, most (n = 105, 56%) had experienced APE or COPD exacerbation, and 56 (30%) received NIV. In comparison with patients without NIV, those treated with NIV had a higher initial RR (35  8/min vs 29  10/min, p < 0.0001) and a lower SpO(2) (79  10 vs 88  11, p < 0.0001). The level of dyspnea was significantly reduced for patients treated with NIV (on-scene D-VOS 8.4  1.7 vs 4.4  1.8 at admission, p < 0.0001). Among the 131 patients not treated with NIV, 41 (31%) had an indication. In the latter group, initial SpO(2) was 80  10% in the NIV group versus 86  11% in the non-NIV group (p = 0.0006). NIV was interrupted in 9 (16%) patients due to either discomfort (n = 5), technical problem (n = 2), persistent desaturation (n = 1), or vomiting (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the prehospital management of patients who present with acute respiratory distress and an indication for NIV. NIV was started on clinically more severe patients, even if predefined criteria to start NIV were present. NIV allows to improve vital signs and D-VOS in those patients.

Monitoring intracardiac pressures may therefore enable clinicians to intervene and avert hospitalizations in a pre-symptomatic phase. Several techniques have been discussed in this review, and thus far, remote monitoring of pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) by the CardioMEMS (CardioMicroelectromechanical system) HF System is the only technique with proven safety as well as efficacy with regard to the prevention of HF-related hospital admissions. Efforts are currently aimed to further develop existing techniques and new sensors capable of measuring left atrial pressures (LAP).

Little is known about how these policies impact various groups in society. This paper explores the relationship between social distancing policies, traffic volumes and air quality and how they impact various socioeconomic groups. This study aims to understand how disparate communities respond to Stay-at-Home Orders and other social distancing policies to understand how human behavior in response to policy may play a part in the prevalence of COVID-19 positive cases. We collected data on traffic density, air quality, socio-economic status, and positive cases rates of COVID-19 for each zip code of Salt Lake County, Utah (USA) between February 17 and June 12, 2020. We studied the impact of social distancing policies across three periods of policy implementation. We found that wealthier and whiter zip codes experienced a greater reduction in traffic and air pollution during the Stay-at-Home period. However, air quality did not necessarily follow traffic volumes in every case due to the complexity of interactions between emissions and meteorology. We also found a strong relationship between lower socioeconomic status and positive COVID-19 rates. This study provides initial evidence for social distancing's effectiveness in limiting the spread of COVID-19, while providing insight into how socioeconomic status has compounded vulnerability during this crisis. Behavior restrictions disproportionately benefit whiter and wealthier communities both through protection from spread of COVID-19 and reduction in air pollution. Such findings may be further compounded by the impacts of air pollution, which likely exacerbate COVID-19 transmission and mortality rates. Policy makers need to consider adapting social distancing policies to maximize equity in health protection.","output":"Understanding the Relationship between Social Distancing Policies, Traffic Volume, Air Quality, and the Prevalence of COVID-19 Outcomes in Urban Neighborhoods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has been a major issue in most countries throughout the world with 213 countries being affected till date due to the disease.

The role of sex on stroke outcome has not been investigated. To objective of this paper is to describe the characteristics of a diverse cohort of acute stroke patients with COVID-19 disease and determine the role of sex on outcome. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with acute stroke and SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted between March 15 to May 15, 2020 to one of the six participating comprehensive stroke centers. Baseline characteristics, stroke subtype, workup, treatment and outcome are presented as total number and percentage or median and interquartile range. Outcome at discharge was determined by the modified Rankin Scale Score (mRS). Variables and outcomes were compared for males and females using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The study included 83 patients, 47% of which were Black, 28% Hispanics/Latinos, and 16% whites. Median age was 64 years. Approximately 89% had at least one preexisting vascular risk factor (VRF). The most common complications were respiratory failure (59%) and septic shock (34%). Compared with females, a higher proportion of males experienced severe SARS-CoV-2 symptoms requiring ICU hospitalization (73% vs. 49%; p=0.04). When divided by stroke subtype, there were 77% ischemic, 19% intracerebral hemorrhage and 3% subarachnoid hemorrhage. The most common ischemic stroke etiologies were cryptogenic (39%) and cardioembolic (27%). Compared with females, males had higher mortality (38% vs. 13%; p=0.02) and were less likely to be discharged home (12% vs. 33%; p=0.04). After adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, and number of VRFs, mRS was higher in males than in females (OR=1.47, 95% CI=1.03-2.09). CONCLUSION: In this cohort of SARS-CoV-2 stroke patients, most had clinical evidence of coronavirus infection on admission and preexisting VRFs.

All the patients were treated with high-dose IVIG (0.3C0.5 g/kg) for 5 consecutive days so that no patient would receive lower than 25 g of the drug. All the patients showed a desirable therapeutic response and were discharged from the hospital with a stable clinical condition after being recovered. CONCLUSION: Treatment with IVIG at the therapeutic dose of 0.3C0.5 g/kg can improve the clinical condition and O2 saturation and prevent the progression of pulmonary lesions in COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms in whom standard treatments have failed.","output":"Recovery of severely ill COVID-19 patients by intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment: A case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research proposes a new type of Grey Wolf optimizer named Gradient-based Grey Wolf Optimizer (GGWO).

In this context, the current epidemiological landscape and its impact on health and economic development are not promissory, despite the commitment by the international community to eradicate neglected tropical infections - especially tuberculosis and malaria, by 2030. Neglected and (re)-emerging infectious diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS) are a major public health concern in these countries, as they cause a great morbidity and mortality; furthermore, survivors often suffer from severe neurological disabilities. Herein, we present a retrospective review focused on some neglected and (re)-emerging infectious diseases, including neurocysticercosis, malaria, rabies, West Nile virus encephalitis, tuberculosis, neuroborreliosis, and SARS-CoV-2 in LMIC. A retrospective review of studies on selected neglected and (re)-emerging infectious diseases in LMIC was performed, including reports by the World Health Organization (WHO) published within the last five years.

In this mini-review article, we discuss the recent treatment modalities for OM, such as suspension gel, transcutaneous immunization, and intranasal and transtympanic drug delivery, including therapies that are currently undergoing clinical trials. We provide an overview of how these recent advancements in therapeutic strategies can facilitate the circumvention of current treatment challenges involving preadolescence soft palate dysfunction, biofilm formation, tympanic membrane (ear drum) barrier and the attainment of efficacious drug concentrations in the middle ear. While traditional first-line immunization strategies are generally not very efficacious against biofilms, new technologies that use transdermal or intranasal drug delivery via chitosan-PsaA nanoparticles have shown promising results in experimental animal models of OM. Sustained drug delivery systems such as penta-block copolymer poloxamer 407-polybutylphosphoester (P407-PBP) or poloxamer 407 (e.g. OTO-201, with the brand name 'OTIPRIO') have demonstrated that treatments can be reduced to a single topical application.

Human/COVID-19 interactions cause different outcomes ranging from minor health consequences to death. Since social interaction is the default mode by which individuals communicate with their surroundings, different modes of contagion can play a role in determining the long-term consequences for mental health and emotional well-being. We examined some basic aspects of human social interaction, emphasizing some particular features of the emotional contagion. Moreover, we analyzed the main report that described brain damage related to the COVID-19 infection. Indeed, the goal of this review is to suggest a possible explanation for the relationships among emotionally impaired people, brain damage, and COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: COVID-19 can cause several significant neurological disorders and the pandemic has been linked to a rise in people reporting mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety. Neurocognitive symptoms associated with COVID-19 include delirium, both acute and chronic attention and memory impairment related to hippocampal and cortical damage, as well as learning deficits in both adults and children. CONCLUSIONS: Although our knowledge on the biology and long-term clinical outcomes of the COVID-19 infection is largely limited, approaching the pandemic based on lessons learnt from previous outbreaks of infectious diseases and the biology of other coronaviruses will provide a suitable pathway for developing public mental health strategies, which could be positively translated into therapeutic approaches, attempting to improve stress coping responses, thus contributing to alleviate the burden driven by the pandemic.","output":"The Social Brain and Emotional Contagion: COVID-19 Effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Negative outcomes of ageism in the context of the Canadian labor market are well documented.

Once we applied CUSUM methodology, we obtained two graphs for CUSUM values (operating time and success), both of them showing three well-differentiated phases: phase 1 (the initial 9-11 cases), phase 2 (the middle 12 cases) and phase 3 (the remaining 20-22 cases). Phase 1 represents initial learning; phase 2 plateau represents increased competence in the use of the robotic system, and finally, phase 3 represents the period of highest skill or mastery with a reduction in docking time (p = 0.000), but a slight increase in operative time (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION The CUSUM curve shows three phases in the learning and use of robotic assisted rectal cancer surgery which correspond to the phases of initial learning of the technique, consolidation and higher expertise or mastery. The data obtained suggest that the estimated learning curve for robotic assisted rectal cancer surgery is achieved after 21-23 cases.","output":"Learning curve for robotic-assisted laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the wide popularity of laparoscopic incisional hernia repair (LIHR) in the nontransplant population, there are very few reports of LIHR available in abdominal organ transplant patients and none exclusively on kidney and/or pancreas (KP) transplant patients. We retrospectively reviewed a consecutive series of LIHR in KP transplant recipients performed over a period of 4 years and compared the results with LIHR in non-transplant patients during the same period. A total of 36 transplant patients were compared with 62 nontransplant patients. There were five patients converted to the open procedure in the transplant and four in nontransplant patients (p-NS). There were three seromas and one patient had a bowel perforation in the transplant group versus eight seromas, one bowel perforation and one small bowel obstruction noted in the nontransplant group. One patient in each group had a mesh infection requiring explant. Patients were followed up for a mean period of 2.2 years in the transplant group and 3 years in the nontransplant group. Overall there were five recurrences in the transplant group and four in the nontransplant group (p = NS).

Despite this vogue, the security vulnerabilities of MLPUs remain mostly unknown. Aim: To address this concern, we conduct a study to understand the test time security vulnerabilities of the state-of-the-art MLPU systems, aiming at providing guidelines for the future development of these systems. Method: In this paper, we propose an evasion attack framework against MLPU systems. To achieve this, we first develop an algorithm to generate adversarial phishing URLs. We then reproduce 41 MLPU systems and record their baseline performance. Finally, we simulate an evasion attack to evaluate these MLPU systems against our generated adversarial URLs. Results: In comparison to previous works, our attack is: (i) effective as it evades all the models with an average success rate of 66% and 85% for famous (such as Netflix, Google) and less popular phishing targets (e.g., Wish, JBHIFI, Officeworks) respectively; (ii) realistic as it requires only 23ms to produce a new adversarial URL variant that is available for registration with a median cost of only $11.99/year. We also found that popular online services such as Google SafeBrowsing and VirusTotal are unable to detect these URLs. (iii) We find that Adversarial training (successful defence against evasion attack) does not significantly improve the robustness of these systems as it decreases the success rate of our attack by only 6% on average for all the models. (iv) Further, we identify the security vulnerabilities of the considered MLPU systems. Our findings lead to promising directions for future research.

After corneal inoculation of mice with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), we observed strong upregulation of both MOV10 mRNA and protein in acutely infected mouse trigeminal ganglia. MOV10 suppressed HSV-1 replication in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells, and this suppression required the N-terminus, but not C-terminal helicase domain of MOV10. MOV10 repressed expression of the viral gene ICP0 in transfected cells, but suppressed HSV-1 replication independently of ICP0. MOV10 increased expression of type I IFN in HSV-1 infected cells with little effect on IFN downstream signaling. Treating the cells with IFN- or an inhibitor of the IFN receptor eliminated MOV10 suppression of HSV-1 replication. MOV10 enhanced IFN production stimulated by cytoplasmic RNA rather than DNA. IKK co-immunoprecipitated with MOV10 and was required for MOV10 restriction of HSV-1 replication. Mass spectrometry identified ICP27 as a viral protein interacting with MOV10. Co-immunoprecipitation results suggested that this interaction depended on the RGG box of ICP27 and both termini of MOV10. Overexpressed ICP27, but not its RGG-Box deletion mutant, rendered MOV10 unable to regulate HSV-1 replication and type I IFN production. In summary, MOV10 is induced to restrict HSV-1 lytic infection by promoting the type I IFN response through an IKK-mediated RNA sensing pathway, and its activity is potentially antagonized by ICP27 in an RGG box dependent manner.","output":"Host MOV10 is induced to restrict herpes simplex virus 1 lytic infection by promoting type I interferon response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artificial intelligence (AI) has an emerging progress in diagnostic pathology. A large number of studies of applying deep learning models to histopathological images have been published in recent years. While many studies claim high accuracies, they may fall into the pitfalls of overfitting and lack of generalization due to the high variability of the histopathological images. We use the example of Osteosarcoma to illustrate the pitfalls and how the addition of model input variability can help improve model performance. We use the publicly available osteosarcoma dataset to retrain a previously published classification model for osteosarcoma. We partition the same set of images into the training and testing datasets differently than the original study: the test dataset consists of images from one patient while the training dataset consists images of all other patients. The performance of the model on the test set using the new partition schema declines dramatically, indicating a lack of model generalization and overfitting.We also show the influence of training data variability on model performance by collecting a minimal dataset of 10 osteosarcoma subtypes as well as benign tissues and benign bone tumors of differentiation. We show the additions of more and more subtypes into the training data step by step under the same model schema yield a series of coherent models with increasing performances.

At present, the widely used CFPS systems are mainly based on Escherichia coli strain. Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium glutamate, and Vibrio natriegens are potential chassis cells for many biotechnological applications with their respective characteristics. Therefore, to expand the platform of the CFPS systems and options for protein production, four prokaryotes, E. coli, B. subtilis, C. glutamate, and V. natriegens were selected as host organisms to construct the CFPS systems and be compared. Moreover, the process parameters of the CFPS system were optimized, including the codon usage, plasmid synthesis competent cell selection, plasmid concentration, ribosomal binding site (RBS), and CFPS system reagent components. By optimizing and comparing the main influencing factors of different CFPS systems, the systems can be optimized directly for the most influential factors to further improve the protein yield of the systems. In addition, to demonstrate the applicability of the CFPS systems, it was proved that the four CFPS systems all had the potential to produce therapeutic proteins, and they could produce the receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of SARS-CoV-2 with functional activity. They not only could expand the potential options for in vitro protein production, but also could increase the application range of the system by expanding the cell-free protein synthesis platform.

In particular, the creation of enormous intensive domestic animal farms, the indiscriminate use of antibiotics, the destruction of forests, the consumption of the meat of wild animals and the illegal animal trade are all factors causing the insurgence and the transmission of zoonotic diseases from animals to humans. The purpose of this study was to explore the knowledge of the One Health concept including the zoonotic risk potentially derived from illegally traded pet animals and wildlife among adolescents in 6 different countries (Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Germany, Mauritius, and Japan). A representative sample of 656 students was recruited and all participants took an anonymous questionnaire. Data were analyzed by ANOVAs to estimate the prevalence of correct health prevention behaviors and to identify the influential factors for these behaviors. After two theoretical-practical lectures, the same anonymous questionnaire was administered for the second time in order to assess the efficacy of the program. The proportion of students who did not know that many diseases affecting humans come from animals is 28.96% while 32.16% of them did not know what a zoonosis is.

RESULTS: During 1-COVID-19 era, 301 patients were added to the waitlist, representing a 40% decrease when compared to the prior 8-week period. This was followed by a significant increase in listing during the 2-COVID-19 era (t = 2.16, P = .032). Waitlist inactivations decreased in 2-COVID-19 era from the 1-COVID-19 era (t = 3.60, P < .001).

To counteract this, involving patients in shared clinical decision making has proven to be of great value. Likewise, involving patients and other stakeholders as researchers is gaining ground. Patient and public involvement (PPI) in research entails many benefits, for example, by bringing further insight from those with lived experiences of being ill. There are various challenges associated with involving some older patients, for example frailty, cognitive impairment and other chronic illnesses. To the best of our knowledge, there are only a few examples of initiatives involving older patients beyond research participation. The feasibility of involving frail older patients during an ongoing care transition from hospital to primary health care remains unknown. To investigate the feasibility of including older frail patients, their relatives and health care professionals (HCPs) as co-researchers, we established a study with increasingly demanding levels of patient involvement to identify relevant outcome measures for future transitional care research. METHODS The study was a pragmatic, qualitative feasibility study. The involved individuals were frail older patients, their relatives and HCPs. Patients and their relatives were interviewed, while the interviewer made reflective notes. A thematic analysis was made. Relatives and HCPs discussed the themes to identify relevant outcome measures and potentially co-create new patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for use in future transitional care studies. The feasibility was evaluated according to six involvement steps. The level of involvement was evaluated using the five-levelled Health Canada Public Involvement Continuum (HCPIC). RESULTS In total, eight patients, five relatives and three HCPs were involved in the study. Patients were involved in discussing care transitions (HCPIC level 3), while some relatives were engaged (HCPIC level 4) in forming PROMs. The partnership level of involvement (HCPIC level 5) was not reached. The thematic analysis and the subsequent theme discussion successfully formed PROMs. The key PROMs were related to care, transparency and the relatives' roles in the transitional care process. CONCLUSIONS When applying a pragmatic involvement approach, frail older patients can be successfully involved in identifying relevant transitional care outcome measures; however, involving these patients as fellow researchers seems infeasible. To maintain involvement, supportive relatives are essential. Useful experiences for future research involvement of this vulnerable group were reported, arguing that patient participation has the potential to become inherent in future geriatric research.","output":"Involving frail older patients in identifying outcome measures for transitional care-a feasibility study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The potential waning of the vaccination immunity to COVID\\\\19 could pose threats to public health, as it is tenable that the timing of such waning would synchronize with the near\\\\complete restoration of normalcy.

The estimated pharmacodynamic parameters [mean (95% CI)] of the adductor pollicis muscle and the masseter muscle were; plasma effect-site equilibration half-time (teq) 3.25 (2.34, 3.69) min vs. 2.86 (1.83, 3.29) min, (?OFV 383.665); Ce50 of 1.24 (1.13, 1.56) mg/l vs. 1.19 (1.00, 1.21) mg/l, (?OFV 184.284); Hill coefficient of 3.97 (3.82, 5.62) vs. 4.68 (3.83, 5.71), (?OFV 78.906). CONCLUSIONS We found that the masseter muscle has faster onset of blockade and similar recovery profile than adductor pollicis muscle.

A 49-year-old man with no past medical history was admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19 pneumonia. He was started on therapeutic Enoxaparin due to D-dimer of 17710ng/ml. Lower extremity duplex was negative for deep vein thrombosis. Patient was enrolled in Sarilumab trial and received the intervention on day 3 and 4 of admission. Initially patient's oxygen requirements decreased, and D-dimer levels trended down. But on day 11, patient was hypotensive, hypoxic to 84% on 5L NC.

Further workup included repeat chest x-ray which showed resolving bilateral infiltrates. D-dimer was 4388ng/ml. A bedside echocardiogram showed right ventricular dilation and a large mobile echo-dense mass measuring 12mm?11mm compatible with a Right Ventricular thrombus. CT chest revealed right lower lobe pulmonary embolus and evidence of right heart strain. Patient was transferred to the ICU. Enoxaparin was stopped, a bolus of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) 50mg was administered over 2 hours followed by a 1mg/hr infusion. Heparin drip with a PTT goal of 30-50 seconds was administered simultaneously for 24 hours. Fibrinogen levels were checked every 6 hours to ensure levels remained above 150 mg/dl. After 24 hours, echocardiogram showed persistent RV mobile thrombus and McConnell's sign. The above infusion protocol was repeated for 24 hours. After tPA infusion patient O2 requirements down trended from nonrebreather 15L to NC 5L. Repeat echo showed resolution of RV thrombus. Repeat CTPE had no new filling defects. There were no bleeding events. Patient was transitioned to apixaban and transferred stable to the floors. Patients with COVID-19 are at higher risk of developing hypercoagulability and it is associated with a worse prognosis.

Approved in the U.S. more than 30 years ago, octreotide is widely used to control the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome and has been shown to demonstrate antiproliferative activity. The two formulations available in the U.S. include a subcutaneous immediate\\\\release (IR) injection introduced in 1989 and a long\\\\acting repeatable (LAR) intramuscular injection approved in 1999. Lanreotide depot (lanreotide), a more recent somatostatin congener, has been available in the U.S. since 2014. Despite widespread use of octreotide LAR, several key challenges exist with the current depot\\\\based treatment paradigm. Studies indicate that LAR formulations are associated with continued unmet patient needs, owing in part to a loss of bioactivity over time that may necessitate progressive supplemental treatment with IR octreotide to adequately control symptoms.

The objective of our study is to unravel the binding mechanism of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dexamethasone (Dex) and boceprevir (Boc) drugs with selected COVID-19 protein targets SARS-CoV-2 spike protein C-terminal domain (spike-CTD), main protease (M(pro)), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Another objective is to analyze the effects of binding Dex and Boc drugs on the interactions of viral spike protein to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Molecular docking and one-microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations of each of the six proteinCdrug complexes along with steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and umbrella sampling (US) methods have revealed the binding mode interactions and the physicochemical stability of the three targeted proteins with two drugs. Results have shown that both drugs bind strongly with the three protein targets through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. A major finding from this study is how the binding of the drugs with viral spike protein affects its interactions at the binding interface with hACE2 protein. Simulations of drug-bound spike-CTD with hACE2 show that due to the presence of a drug at the binding interface of spike-CTD, hACE2 is being blocked from making putative interactions with viral protein at such interface. These important findings regarding the binding affinity and stability of the two FDA-approved drugs with the main targets of COVID-19 along with the effect of drugs on hACE2 interactions would contribute to COVID-19 drug discovery and development.

The best reactor operational conditions to obtain high yield and productivity of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) as the main product and the role of the polyurethane foam in the growth and retention of suspended and attached biomass in the reactors were investigated. In the experiment at 30 C with a batch reactor (700 mL), biomass growth was mostly as immobilized attached cells, and the achieved 1,3-PDO yield was up to 0.58 mol mol-gly-1. In the experiment (30 C) with an upflow anaerobic reactor (717 mL), glycerol loading rates (gly-LR) ranging from 6.94 to 15.47 g gly L-1 day-1 were applied during a 102-day period. During the operation, average 1,3-PDO yield was 0.47 mol mol-gly-1, reaching a maximum of 0.51 mol mol-gly-1 at gly-LR of 13.57 g gly L-1 day-1. High 1,3-PDO productivity (5.35 to 5.44 g L-1 day-1) was obtained when gly-LR was 13.57 to 15.47 g gly L-1 day-1. Comparing the close yield values in both batch and continuous reactors and based on microbial evaluation, it is concluded that most of the 1,3-PDO generated in the continuous reactor was due to the suspended biomass retained by the foam cubes. The Clostridium genus was the predominant 1,3-PDO producer. Good yields and productivities with packed reactors were attributed to polyurethane foam used for mixed culture growth and retention.

Duration of virus persistence was estimated with parametric regression models based on Weibull, Log-normal, Log-logistic, Gamma and Generalized Gamma distributions. Factors associated with prolonged viral persistence were analysed with the best fitting model. RESULTS: 51 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with repeat rRT-PCR test were identified with 44 asymptomatics. The asymptomatic individuals had median virus persistence duration of 8.87 days (95%CI: 7.65 C 10.27) and 95 percentile duration of 20.70 days (95% CI: 16.08 -28.20).

Around one-fourth asymptomatics (10/44) demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 persistence beyond 2 weeks. Age < 60 years and local transmission were found to be significantly associated with longer virus persistence among asymptomatic individuals on univariate regression but not in multivariate analysis.

This intrinsic immunity relies on a large diversity of antiviral processes. In the case of HTLV-1 infection, these active innate host defense mechanisms are debated. Among these mechanisms, we focused on an RNA decay pathway called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), which can target multiple viral RNAs, including HTLV-1 unspliced RNA, as has been recently demonstrated. NMD is a co-translational process that depends on the RNA helicase UPF1 and regulates the expression of multiple types of host mRNAs. RNA sensitivity to NMD depends on mRNA organization and the ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) composition. HTLV-1 has evolved several means to evade the NMD threat, leading to NMD inhibition. In the early steps of infection, NMD inhibition favours the production of HTLV-1 infectious particles, which may contribute to the survival of the fittest clones despite genome instability; however, its direct long-term impact remains to be investigated.","output":"The Complex Relationship between HTLV-1 and Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The safety and efficacy of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have not been clearly demonstrated.

Most such infections are of viral origin and self-limiting, but viral infection is often hard to distinguish from bacterial infection. The use of a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect viruses in respiratory secretions is potentially beneficial, as it might help physicians avoid giving antibiotics unnecessarily. METHOD This article is based on a selective review of the literature and on the findings of the authors' own investigations. RESULTS Multiplex PCR is a highly sensitive, highly specific test for the detection of viral nucleic acids in respiratory secretions. If PCR reveals the presence of RNA derived from respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, or influenza virus, then an acute infection caused by the corresponding pathogen is probably present, and further treatment can be given accordingly. On the other hand, the nucleic acids of adeno-, boca-, rhino- or coronaviruses can be found in relatively trivial infections as well as in asymptomatic persons, probably reflecting either a prior infection or a current subclinical one. For children in particular, upper respiratory infections are so common in the winter months that acute and prior infections with these pathogens cannot be distinguished by multiplex PCR. The use of multiplex PCR in children has not been shown to shorten hospital stays or to lessen antibiotic consumption or overall cost. CONCLUSION The detectability of viral nucleic acids is an important contribution to the diagnostic assessment of children with severe respiratory infection.

To this end, shorter hypofractionated regimens have been recommended where appropriate, with prioritization of radiation therapy by oncologic risk and omission or deferral of radiation therapy for lower risk cases. Timely adoption of these measures reduces COVID-19 risk to both patients and health care workers and preserves resources. Herein, we present our early response and adaptation of breast radiation therapy utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large academic cancer center in Canada. Methods and Materials: A state of emergency was announced in Ontario on March 17, 2020, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Emergency guidelines were instituted. To examine our response, the number of weekly breast radiation therapy starts, type of breast radiation therapy, and patient age were compared from March 1 to April 30, 2020 to the same period in 2019. Results: After the declaration of emergency in Ontario, there was a decrease of 39% in radiation therapy starts in 2020 compared with 2019 (79 vs 129, P &lt; .001). There was a relative increase in the proportion of patients receiving regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in 2020 compared with 2019 (46% vs 29%, respectively), with the introduction of hypofractionated RNI in 2020 (27 of 54 cases, 50%). A smaller proportion of patients starting radiation therapy were aged &gt;50 years in 2020, 66% (78 of 118) versus 83% (132 of 160) in 2019, P = .0027. Conclusions: A significant reduction in breast radiation therapy starts was noted during the early response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with prioritization of radiation therapy to patients associated with higher oncologic risk requiring RNI. A quick response to a health care crisis is critical and is of particular importance for higher volume cancer sites where the potential effect on resources is greater.","output":"Rapid Adaptation of Breast Radiation Therapy Use During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic at a Large Academic Cancer Center in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficient calculation of the centrality or\\"hierarchy\\"of nodes in a network has gained great relevance in recent years due to the generation of large amounts of data.

Although most injuries are to the head, face, and neck, the intersection of IPV and traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains largely unrecognized. This paper reports on COVID-19-related impacts, barriers, needs, and priorities to healthcare and support services for women survivors of IPV-TBI. Methods Using a participatory research model, we engaged 30 stakeholders in virtual meetings drawn from an IPV-TBI Knowledge to Practice (K2P) Network including women survivors, service providers, researchers, and decision makers. Data was gathered through small group breakout sessions facilitated by the research team using semi-structured discussion guides. Sessions were recorded, transcribed verbatim transcripts, and analysed using thematic analysis techniques. Stakeholders were given the opportunity to contribute to the analysis and knowledge transfer through member checking activities. Ethics approval was obtained through the University of Toronto. Results COVID-19 has increased rates and severity of IPV and barriers to services and help-seeking. These effects are exacerbated by infrastructure difficulties in rural and remote areas, including limited access to services. Implications of virtual care such as safety, privacy, and usability require careful consideration. Requests from survivors for peer support have increased significantly, indicating more formalized and better-supported peer roles are needed. An overwhelming lack of awareness of the intersection of IPV-TBI continues. Increasing education and awareness among healthcare and IPV service providers, survivors, and the public remains a priority. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified IPV-TBI, increased challenges for women survivors, and accentuated the continued lack of IPV-TBI awareness.

The real time reproduction number (R(t)) of COVID-19 in two cities was calculated respectively. Results: A total of 346 and 465 confirmed COVID-19 cases were analysed in Guangzhou and Wenzhou, respectively. In two cities, most cases were aged 30-59 years (Guangzhou: 54.9%; Wenzhou: 70.3%). The incidence curve peaked on 27 January, 2020 in Guangzhou and on 26 January, 2020 in Wenzhou, then began to decline in both cities. The peaks of imported COVID-19 cases from Hubei occurred earlier than the peak of COVID-19 incidences in two cities, and the peak of imported cases from Hubei occurred earlier in Wenzhou than in Guangzhou. In early epidemic phase, imported cases were predominant in both cities, then the number of local cases increased and gradually took the dominance in Wenzhou. In Guangzhou, the imported cases was still predominant. Despite the different epidemic pattern, the R(t) and the number of COVID-19 cases declined after strict prevention and control measures were taken in Guangzhou and in Wenzhou. Conclusion: The time and scale specific differences of imported COVID-19 resulted in different epidemic patterns in two cities, but the spread of the disease were effectively controlled after taking strict prevention and control measures.","output":"[Comparison of two epidemic patterns of COVID-19 and evaluation of prevention and control effectiveness: an analysis based on Guangzhou and Wenzhou]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) makes the medical treatment of colorectal cancers difficult.

This study aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 on routine immunisation using triangulated data from global, country-based, and individual-reported sources obtained during the pandemic period. METHODS: This report synthesised data from 170 countries and territories. Data sources included administered vaccine-dose data from January to December, 2019, and January to December, 2020, WHO regional office reports, and a WHO-led pulse survey administered in April, 2020, and June, 2020. Results were expressed as frequencies and proportions of respondents or reporting countries. Data on vaccine doses administered were weighted by the population of surviving infants per country. FINDINGS: A decline in the number of administered doses of diphtheriaCpertussisCtetanus-containing vaccine (DTP3) and first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) in the first half of 2020 was noted. The lowest number of vaccine doses administered was observed in April, 2020, when 33% fewer DTP3 doses were administered globally, ranging from 9% in the WHO African region to 57% in the South-East Asia region. Recovery of vaccinations began by June, 2020, and continued into late 2020. WHO regional offices reported substantial disruption to routine vaccination sessions in April, 2020, related to interrupted vaccination demand and supply, including reduced availability of the health workforce. Pulse survey analysis revealed that 45 (69%) of 65 countries showed disruption in outreach services compared with 27 (44%) of 62 countries with disrupted fixed-post immunisation services. INTERPRETATION: The marked magnitude and global scale of immunisation disruption evokes the dangers of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks in the future. Trends indicating partial resumption of services highlight the urgent need for ongoing assessment of recovery, catch-up vaccination strategy implementation for vulnerable populations, and ensuring vaccine coverage equity and health system resilience.

This study compared the number of emergency department (ED) visits due to injuries and typical low-energy fractures in Finland during the COVID-19 lockdown period in spring 2020 to the reference period in 2019. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The data was collected retrospectively from the electronic patient records of 4 hospitals covering 1/5 of the Finnish population. We included the patients who were admitted to a hospital ED due to any injury during the lockdown period (March 18CMay 31, 2020) and the reference period (March 18CMay 31, 2019). We compared the differences between the average daily ED admissions in the 2 years using the zero-inflated Poisson regression model. RESULTS: The overall number of ED visits due to injuries decreased by 16% (mean 134/day vs. 113/day, 95% CI C18 to C13). The number of ED visits due to wrist fractures decreased among women aged over 50 years by 40% (CI C59 to C9). Among women, the number of ED visits due to ankle fractures decreased by 32% (CI C52 to C5). The number of ED visits due to fractures of the upper end of the humerus decreased by 52% (CI C71 to C22) among women. The number of ED visits due to hip fractures increased by 2% (CI C16 to 24). INTERPRETATION: Restrictions in personal mobility decreased the number of ED visits due to injuries during the pandemic. The effect can mainly be seen as a decreased number of the most typical low-energy fractures among women.

We evaluate it on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating ability to hierarchically decompose overlapping beliefs. In the case where polarization is flat, we compare it to prior art and show that it outperforms state of the art approaches for polarization detection and stance separation.

The present work aimed to compare the effect of BiPhasic Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) mode at two different pressures; low BiPAP (Inspiratory Positive Airway Pressure (IPAP)/Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP) of 10/5 cm water) and high BiPAP (IPAP/EPAP of 20/5 cm water), with HFNC system on pulmonary and systemic drug delivery of salbutamol. On the first day of the experiment, all patients received 2500 g salbutamol using Aerogen Solo vibrating mesh nebulizer. Urine samples 30 min post-dose and cumulative urinary salbutamol during the next 24 h were collected on the next day. On the third day, the ex-vivo filter was inserted before the patient to collect the delivered dose to the patient of the 2500 g salbutamol. Salbutamol was quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: Low-pressure BiPAP showed the highest amount delivered to the lung after 30 min followed by HFNC then high-pressure BiPAP. But the significant difference was only observed between low and high-pressure BiPAP modes (p = 0.012). Low-pressure BiPAP showed the highest delivered systemic delivery amount followed by HFNC then high-pressure BiPAP. Low-pressure BiPAP was significantly higher than HFNC (p = 0.017) and high-pressure BiPAP (p = 0.008). No significant difference was reported between HFNC and high-pressure BiPAP.

Our objective was to examine national trends in mortality following MT. METHODS We analyzed the National Inpatient Sample (2012) and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2008-2011) for patients with a primary diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke that received MT. Temporal trends in mortality were examined using Spearman's rank correlation. To account for confounding factors, mortality was further analyzed in binary logistic regression. RESULTS Hospitals performing MT comprised 8% of all hospitals treating ischemic stroke. The percentage of stroke cases treated with MT increased from 0.6% of cases in 2008 to 1.1% in 2012, totaling 16 307 MT cases in a 5 year period. Inhospital mortality decreased over the study period from 25.4% in 2008 to 16.1% in 2012 (r=-0.081, p<0.001). This finding was supported by regression analysis as each incremental year reduced the odds of mortality by 20% (OR=0.832, p<0.001). Administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was associated with a decrease in the odds of mortality (OR=0.805, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Utilization of MT represents a small percentage of stroke cases, although the trend is increasing. Mortality following MT has been showing a steady decline over the past 5 years. This may be a result of a learning curve, improved patient selection, and/or device improvements. Randomized trials remain essential to evaluate the potential benefit of endovascular devices and identify the most appropriate patients.","output":"Trends in mortality following mechanical thrombectomy for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke in the USA."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present research explores the role of wines social and coping benefits during stressful times (e.g. COVID-19 shutdown).

Understanding how theory and research address this topic is important for its practical implementation based on scientific knowledge. The aim of this article was to analyse the practices derived from RJ implemented in school and what kinds of results have been achieved. Starting from the analysis of the qualitative and quantitative research in the field, a systematic review was conducted on the last decade of studies using RJ and RP at every level of school education. Methods: For this review, methods including the PRISMA guidelines, the PRISMA flow diagram, and qualitative synthesis were carried out. Scientific articles for the literature review were selected according to the following criteria: (1) publication date between the years 2010C2021; (2) student population aged 6C18 years; (3) publications in the English language; (4) articles directly accessible or accessible by contacting the author(s); 34 articles met the inclusion criteria. Results: The most used RP in school are circles (n = 26), followed by restorative conferences (n = 17), peer mediation (n = 10), restorative conversations (n = 8), mediation (n = 7), community-building circles (n = 5). RP can improve the school climate, discipline, positive conflict management through actions that aim at preventing suspensions, exclusions, conflicts, and misbehaviours (e.g., bullying). RJ practices promote positive relationships between peers and between students and teachers, as well as to prosocial behaviours through the development of social and emotional skills. Conclusions: From the studies examined, a great interest in applying restorative justice and practices in schools clearly emerged. Discussions on the benefits and challenges of implementation were provided. However, there is still limited evidence in terms of direct correlation, which suggests further studies on the impact of RJ and RP in school settings.","output":"Use of Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices at School: A Systematic Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid growth of e-commerce and package deliveries across the globe is demanding new solutions to meet customers desire for more and faster deliveries New driverless air and ground vehicles are being launched and tested to deliver products or services in the areas of retail, groceries, and healthcare This research focuses on the efficiency of autonomous (driverless) air and ground delivery vehicles in terms of vehicle-miles, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions Three types of autonomous vehicle are analyzed: drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), sidewalk autonomous delivery robots (SADRs), and road autonomous delivery robots (RADRs) The CO2 emissions of these autonomous vehicles are compared against emissions from an electric van (e-van), a conventional internal combustion engine van, and driving to a store utilizing electric and conventional vehicles The impacts of vehicle capacity, range, and time constraints are analyzed as well as the impacts of number of deliveries, service time, area of service, and depot-service area distance Novel results are found regarding the efficiency of each vehicle type and tradeoffs between driving to a store and store delivery as a function of order size and type of vehicle driven by consumers","output":"Carbon emissions reductions in last mile and grocery deliveries utilizing air and ground autonomous vehicles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, several genetic variants have been associated with increased or decreased risks of becoming infected and/or seriously ill with COVID-19-not only offering important potential medical benefits but also posing critical ethical questions. These genetic factors, some of which are associated with blood type, may account for variations in observed responses to COVID-19. Hence, assessments of these genetic differences and blood type could provide possible benefits in gauging patients' risks of disease acquisition and prioritising allocation of interventions or vaccines, if supplies are limited. The media has widely reported these findings, and people online are now discussing their blood type and its possible effects on their COVID-19 risks, but several ethical concerns arise. Individuals possessing genetic variants or blood types associated with lower risk may engage in 'risk compensation', erroneously assuming that they can protect themselves less, and hence less frequently wearing masks or washing hands. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many physicians, hospitals, patients, policymakers, members of the public, testing companies and others may well consider these factors in making critical prevention/treatment decisions. Researchers, providers and others should thus begin to address these concerns. Increased awareness and education aimed at providers, patients, family members, public health officials, political leaders and the public-at-large are critical. Attitudinal research is vital to examine how providers, patients and the public understand these findings. Ethical frameworks and guidelines are needed, addressing whether such genetic information should be incorporated into decisions regarding allocation of scarce resources-including hospital and ICU beds, ventilators, medications (eg, remdesivir) and vaccines-and if so, how.","output":"Roles of genetics and blood type in clinical responses to COVID-19: ethical and policy concerns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective The aim of this study was to examine the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the malignancy-related clinical course and overall survival, and to determine the factors affecting mortality.

This paper aims to provide an insight into how the COVID-19 pandemic, associated public health restrictions and international guidance on the conduct of clinical research impacted two clinical rheumatology research trials - the Physiotherapist-led Intervention to Promote Physical Activity in Rheumatoid Arthritis (PIPPRA) and the MEDiterranean diet in Rheumatoid Arthritis (MEDRA) projects. Methods : The March 2019 public health restrictions imposed to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 occurred at a time when PIPPRA was in the process of delivering assessment and intervention on a face-to-face basis (n=48) and MEDRA had commenced recruitment. Participants in PIPPRA and MEDRA had a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, with some being immunosuppressed and thus at a higher risk for COVID-19. The decision-making processes of both trials is outlined to demonstrate the required amendments to continue in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results : Amendments to PIPPRA and MEDRA trial protocols were agreed and received ethical and funder approval. Both trials switched from a face-to-face delivery to a telehealth using online platforms. The PIPPRA study was paused for five months (April-August 2020), resulting in n=33 (60%) deviations from assessment protocol. MEDRA switched from face-to-face to online recruitment with 20% (n=35/44) deviation in recruitment. Of the n=18 participants who consented to participating in a face-to-face trial, just n=2 (11%) opted to engage with telehealth delivery of the intervention. MEDRA assessment and intervention deviations were 100% as no sessions were completed as planned in 2020. Conclusions : The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the PIPPRA and MEDRA clinical trials. Moving face-to-face clinical research to telehealth delivery may not be the panacea it is purported to be.

With disruption comes the opportunity for innovation. Telehealth had been growing rapidly in many fields of medicine prior to the pandemic, however, the necessities of social distancing, scarcity of personal protective equipment, and mandates to prevent unnecessary exposures for healthcare workers and patients alike, brought opportunities for the exponential expansion of telehealth. With expansion of telehealth services came the need to expand curriculum in telehealth to prepare medical students to return to vastly transformed clinical settings as well as prepare them for a future clinical landscape likely to incorporate telehealth to a much greater degree. The University of Colorado School of Medicine (CUSOM) rapidly developed a course in telehealth to prepare students for this changing clinical environment. Simultaneously, a faculty development curriculum was created to support clinical faculty new to telehealth in basic skills and teaching in a virtual environment. Lastly, adaptations were made to the summative Clinical Practice Exam administered to students at the completion of clerkships to incorporate telehealth. Recognizing the importance of achieving competence in telehealth, the CUSOM has taken steps to invest in the development of comprehensive and integrated telehealth curricula. Many creative and innovative solutions have been adopted in the wake of this pandemic to allow medical education to continue despite many hurdles and barriers; many of these will not persist past the pandemic.

Weather components recently came to notice as the northern hemisphere was hit by escalated incidence in winter. This study investigated the association between COVID-19 cases and two components, average temperature and relative humidity, in the 16 states of Germany. Three main approaches were carried out in this study, namely temporal correlation, spatial auto-correlation, and clustering-integrated panel regression. It is claimed that the daily COVID-19 cases correlate negatively with the average temperature and positively with the average relative humidity. To extract the spatial auto-correlation, both global Moran's [Formula: see text] and global Geary's [Formula: see text] were used whereby no significant difference in the results was observed. It is evident that randomness overwhelms the spatial pattern in all the states for most of the observations, except in recent observations where either local clusters or dispersion occurred. This is further supported by Moran's scatter plot, where states' dynamics to and fro cold and hot spots are identified, rendering a traveling-related early warning system. A random-effects model was used in the sense of case-weather regression including incidence clustering. Our task is to perceive which ranges of the incidence that are well predicted by the existing weather components rather than seeing which ranges of the weather components predicting the incidence. The proposed clustering-integrated model associated with optimal barriers articulates the data well whereby weather components outperform lag incidence cases in the prediction. Practical implications based on marginal effects follow posterior to model diagnostics.","output":"Interrelationship between daily COVID-19 cases and average temperature as well as relative humidity in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Age is considered as one of the most important risk-factor for many types of solid and hematological cancers, as their incidence increases with age in parallel to the ever-growing elderly population. Moreover, cancer incidence is constantly increasing as a consequence of the increase in life expectancy that favors the process of cellular senescence. Geriatric assessment has been increasingly recognized as predictive and prognostic instrument to detect frailty in older adults with cancer. In particular, the G8 score is a simple and reproducible instrument to identify elderly patients who should undergo full geriatric evaluation. Due to their frailty, elderly patients may be often under-treated and a therapeutic choice based also on a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is recommended. With these premises, we aim to test the impact of the CGA based interventions on the quality of life (QoL) of frail elderly onco-hematological patients, identified by the G8 screening, candidate for innovative target directed drugs or treatments including the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy (RT + CT). METHODS: Patients aged > 65 years, candidate to target directed agents or to RT + CT treatments are screened for frailty by the G8 test; those patients classified as frail (G8  14) are randomized to receive a CGA at baseline or to conventional care. The primary endpoint is QoL, assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30C. As collateral biological study, the potential prognostic/predictive role of T-cell senescence and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are evaluated on plasma samples. DISCUSSION: This trial will contribute to define the impact of CGA on the management of frail elderly onco-hematologic patients candidate to innovative biological drugs or to integrated schedules with the association of RT + CT. Furthermore, the use of plasma samples to assess the potential prognostic value of imbalance of immune-competent cells is expected to contribute to the individualized care of elderly patients, resulting into a fine tuning of the therapeutic strategies.

Here, we developed and implemented multiplex microsphere-based immunoassay strategies for COVD-19 antibody studies that incorporates spike protein trimers of SARS-CoV-2 and the endemic seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoV), enabling high throughout measurement of pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies. We varied SARS-CoV-2 antigen compositions within the multiplex assay, allowing direct comparisons of the effects of spike protein, receptor-binding domain protein (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) based SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection.

This is especially true with regard to the production of cereal, produce widely used to represent food security. Although studies have attempted to disentangle the effect of demand vis  vis projected population growth on cereal production across the region, the contradiction between cereal production and climate disaster preparedness remains poorly resolved. Therefore, literature on the subject matter is scanty. The present study is motivated by the need to overcome this paucity of literature and thus, deepen our understanding of cereal production and climate disaster preparedness in the region. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to assess public institutional support structures that are currently being employed for climate disaster preparedness in the cereal value chain across Zambia as perceived by small scale farmers. After a comprehensive assessment of focus group discussions (FGDs), several points emerge specifically highlighting four salient findings: first, results show that a government-led Farmer Input Support Programme (FISP) is the only strategy particularly targeted at disaster preparedness. All other initiatives are targeted at improving or safeguarding livelihoods with some components having a ripple effect on the cereal value chain. Second, results show that climate forecasts that are supposed to trigger early action are generally characterized by low prediction skill with more false alarms and misses than hits. Third, forecasts were found to lack geographical specificity with generalities over large areas being common thus, diminishing their usefulness at the local scale. Fourth, end-users found forecasts to usually contain technical jargon that is difficult to decipher especially that most small-scale farmers are illiterate.

In this study, we isolated a wild-type FIPV HRB-17 epidemic strain from the blood sample of household pet cat exhibiting the characteristic wet-form FIP symptoms, which has been confirmed further by animal infection. Further, we developed an EvaGreen-based real-time RT-PCR assay for the accurate detection of FCoV based on the amplification of the highly conserved FIPV N gene. Then, using a combination of the real-time RT-PCR approach and a serum chemistry assay, we performed an epidemiological survey of FIPV infection in cats living in Harbin City, Northeast China. The results indicated that the EvaGreen-based real-time RT-PCR assay can be used for screening FCoV infection in the affected cats at an analytical detection limit of 8.2  101 viral genome copies/L, but could not effectively distinguish FIPVs from FECVs. Additionally, the results of the epidemiological survey investigating feline blood samples (n = 1523) collected between July 2017 to July 2019 revealed an FIPV prevalence of approximately 12% (189/1523). Maybe, the prevalence would be less than 12% due to the real-time RT-PCR assay could not accurately differentiate FIPV and FECV. Nevertheless, it still highlighted the severity of the FIP epidemic in cats and reiterated the urgent need to develop effective anti-FIP therapeutic agents and anti-FIPV vaccines. As pet cats are household animals, risk communication and continuous region-extended surveillance cat programs are recommended.","output":"Epidemiological investigation of feline infectious peritonitis in cats living in Harbin, Northeast China from 2017 to 2019 using a combination of an EvaGreen-based real-time RT-PCR and serum chemistry assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on natural resource-based theory, this study constructed a relational model between green intellectual capital, green innovation, and an agricultural corporate sustainable competitive advantage.

The objective of this study was to investigate the frequency and type of changes in functional, cognitive and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), and caregivers stress during the period of quarantine in 2020 in patients affected by dementia/MCI living in Palermo, Sicily. METHODS: Outpatients affected by MCI/dementia were evaluated before and after COVID-19 quarantine. Functional status was investigated using basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL); cognitive performance with the mini-mental state examination; BPSD through the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI). All scales were reported as pre/post-COVID-19 quarantine and a logistic regression analysis was performed for investigating the factors associated with worsening in NPI in patients and their caregivers. RESULTS: One hundred patients (mean age 77.1; females = 59%) were evaluated over a median of 10 months. In the sample as whole, a significant decline in functional and cognitive status was observed (p < 0.001 for both comparisons). The NPI significantly increased by 3.56  8.96 points after the COVID-19 quarantine (p < 0.0001), while the caregivers stress increased by 1.39  3.46 points between the two evaluations (p < 0.0001). The decline was more evident in people with milder dementia. Higher values of instrumental ADL at baseline were associated with a significant lower worsening in NPI and caregivers stress.

However, the scientific landscape on the integration of GIS in COVID-related studies is largely unknown. In this systematic review, we assessed the current evidence on the implementation of GIS and other geospatial tools in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We systematically retrieved and reviewed 79 research articles that either directly used GIS or other geospatial tools as part of their analysis. We grouped the identified papers under six broader thematic groups based on the objectives and research questions of the study- environmental, socio-economic, and cultural, public health, spatial transmission, computer-aided modeling, and data mining. Results: The interdisciplinary nature of how geographic and spatial analysis was used in COVID-19 research was notable among the reviewed papers. Although GIS has substantial potential in planning to slow down the spread, surveillance, contact tracing, and identify the trends and hotspots of breakdowns, it was not employed as much as it could have been. This review not only provided an overarching view on how GIS has been used in COVID-19 research so far but also concluded that this geospatial analysis and technologies could be used in future public health emergencies along with statistical and other socio-economic modeling techniques. Our systematic review also provides how both scientific communities and policymakers could leverage GIS to extract useful information to make an informed decision in the future. Conclusions: : Despite the limited applications of GIS in identifying the nature and spatio-temporal pattern of this raging pandemic, there are opportunities to utilize these techniques in handling the pandemic. The use of spatial analysis and GIS could significantly improve how we understand the pandemic as well as address the underserviced demographic groups and communities.","output":"Applications of GIS and geospatial analyses in COVID-19 research: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Skin problems are often overlooked due to a lack of robust and patient-friendly monitoring tools. Herein, we report a rapid, noninvasive, and high-throughput analytical chemical methodology, aiming at real-time monitoring of skin conditions and early detection of skin disorders. Within this methodology, adhesive sampling and laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry are coordinated to record skin surface molecular mass in minutes. Automated result interpretation is achieved by data learning, using similarity scoring and machine learning algorithms. Feasibility of the methodology has been demonstrated after testing a total of 117 healthy, benign-disordered, or malignant-disordered skins. Remarkably, skin malignancy, using melanoma as a proof of concept, was detected with 100% accuracy already at early stages when the lesions were submillimeter-sized, far beyond the detection limit of most existing noninvasive diagnosis tools. Moreover, the malignancy development over time has also been monitored successfully, showing the potential to predict skin disorder progression.

This interest has sparked new methodological work focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of different forms of remote data collection, the use of incentives to increase response rates and how to address sample representativeness. By contrast, attention given to associated response fatigue and its implications remains limited. To assess this, we designed and implemented an experiment that randomized the placement of a survey module on women's dietary diversity in the survey instrument. We also examine potential differential vulnerabilities to fatigue across food groups and respondents. We find that delaying the timing of mothers' food consumption module by 15 minutes leads to 8-17 percent decrease in the dietary diversity score and a 28 percent decrease in the number of mothers who consumed a minimum of four dietary groups. This is driven by underreporting of infrequently consumed foods;the experimentally induced delay in the timing of mothers' food consumption module led to a 40 and 11 percent decrease in the reporting of consumption of animal source foods, and fruits and vegetables, respectively. Our results are robust to changes in model specification and pass falsification tests.

However, many countries in Europe and elsewhere implemented strict, horizontal lockdowns because of extensive viral spread in the community which challenges the capacity of the healthcare systems. However, strict lockdowns have various untintended adverse social, economic and health effects, which have yet to be fully elucidated, and have not been considered in models examining the effects of various mitigation measures. Unlike commonly suggested, the dilemma is not about health vs wealth because the economic devastation of long-lasting lockdowns will definitely have adverse health effects in the population. Furthermore, they cannot provide a lasting solution in pandemic containment, potentially resulting in a vicious cycle of consecutive lockdowns with in-between breaks. Hospital preparedness has been the main strategy used by governments. However, a major characteristic of the COVID-19 pandemic is the rapid viral transmission in populations with no immunity. Thus, even the best hospital system could not cope with the demand. Primary, community and home care are the only viable strategies that could achieve the goal of pandemic mitigation. We present the case example of Greece, a country which followed a strategy focused on hospital preparedness but failed to reinforce primary and community care. This, along with strategic mistakes in epidemiological surveillance, resulted in Greece implementing a second strict, horizontal lockdown and having one of the highest COVID-19 death rates in Europe during the second wave. We provide recommendations for measures that will reinstate primary and community care at the forefront in managing the current public health crisis by protecting hospitals from unnecessary admissions, providing primary and secondary prevention services in relation to COVID-19 and maintaining population health through treatment of non-COVID-19 conditions. This, together with more selective social distancing measures (instead of horizontal lockdowns), represents the only viable and realistic long-term strategy for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation.","output":"Improved strategies to counter the COVID-19 pandemic: Lockdowns vs. Primary and Community Healthcare"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND We assessed the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery (BS) versus conservative management (CM) for treating morbid obesity in Spain.

Combined common BS procedures were compared with CM. Clinical and utility inputs were obtained from the literature and resource use and costs from local sources (2017). RESULTS Over the 10-year horizon, BS led to a cost increment of 9,386 and 1.6 additional QALY (5,966/QALY). Leading to 0.6 LYG and 4.4 QALY gains and 300/patient average cost savings over lifetime, BS could potentially significantly reduce diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk over the considered horizons.

OBJECTIVE: To assess clinician burnout and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and guide healthcare system improvement efforts. DESIGN: A survey asking about clinician burnout, well-being, and work experiences. PARTICIPANTS: Surveys distributed to 8141 clinicians from June to August 2020 in 9 medical groups and 17 hospitals at Sutter Health, a large healthcare system in Northern California. MAIN MEASURES: Burnout was the primary outcome, and other indicators of well-being and work experience were also measured. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. All statistical inferences were based on weighted estimates adjusting for response bias. KEY RESULTS: A total of 3176 clinicians (39.0%) responded to the survey. Weighted results showed 29.2% reported burnout, and burnout was more common among women than among men (39.0% vs. 22.7%, p<0.01). In multivariate models, being a woman was associated with increased odds of reporting burnout (OR=2.19, 95% CI: 1.51C3.17) and being 55+ years old with lower odds (OR=0.54, 95% CI: 0.34C0.87). More women than men reported that childcare/caregiving was impacting work (32.9% vs. 19.0%, p<0.01). Even after controlling for age and gender, clinicians who reported childcare/caregiving responsibilities impacted their work had substantially higher odds of reporting burnout (OR=2.19, 95% CI: 1.54C3.11). Other factors associated with higher burnout included worrying about safety at work, being given additional work tasks, concern about losing ones job, and working in emergency medicine or radiology. Protective factors included believing ones concerns will be acted upon and feeling highly valued. CONCLUSIONS: This large survey found the pandemic disproportionally impacted women, younger clinicians, and those whose caregiving responsibilities impacted their work.

In this study, we aimed to characterize the phenotype of headache attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection and to test the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) phenotypic criteria for migraine and tension-type headache. METHODS: The study design was a cross-sectional study nested in a cohort. We screened all consecutive patients that were hospitalized and had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. We included patients that described headache if the headache was not better explained by another ICHD-3 diagnosis. Patients were interviewed by two neurologists. RESULTS: We screened 580 patients and included 130 (mean age 56 years, 64% female). Headache was the first symptom of the infection in 26% of patients and appeared within 24 hours in 62% of patients. The headache was bilateral in 85%, frontal in 83%, and with pressing quality in 75% of patients. Mean intensity was 7.1, being severe in 64%. Hypersensitivity to stimuli occurred in 57% of patients. ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to systemic viral infection were fulfilled by 94% of patients; phenotypic criteria for migraine were fulfilled by 25% of patients, and tension-type headache criteria by 54% of patients. CONCLUSION: Headache attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized patients has severe intensity, frontal predominance and oppressive quality. It occurs early in the course of the disease. Most patients fulfilled ICHD-3 criteria for headache attributed to systemic viral infection; however, the phenotype might resemble migraine in a quarter of cases and tension-type headache in half of the patients.","output":"Phenotypic characterization of acute headache attributed to SARS-CoV-2: An ICHD-3 validation study on 106 hospitalized patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious virus of the coronavirus family that causes coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in humans and a number of animal species.

Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common type of pulmonary cancer. Although there have been some improvements in the traditional therapy of lung cancer, the outcome and prognosis of patients remain poor. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with 1.8 million new cases being diagnosed each year. Precision medicine based on genetic alterations is considered a new strategy of lung cancer treatment that requires highly specific biomarkers for precision diagnosis and treatment. Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) plays important roles in both innate and adaptive immunity. However, the diagnostic value of FGL2 in lung cancer is largely unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated the expression profile and potential functions of FGL2 in lung adenocarcinoma. We used the TCGA and Oncomine datasets to compare the FGL2 expression levels between lung adenocarcinoma and adjacent normal tissues. We utilized the GEPIA, PrognoScan and Kaplan-Meier plotter databases to analyze the relationship between FGL2 expression and the survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients. Then, we investigated the potential roles of FGL2 in lung adenocarcinoma with the TIMER database and functional enrichment analyses. We found that FGL2 expression was significantly lower in lung adenocarcinoma tissue compared with adjacent normal tissue. A high expression level of FGL2 was correlated with better prognostic outcomes of lung adenocarcinoma patients, including overall survival and progression-free survival. FGL2 was positively correlated with the infiltration of immune cells, including dendritic cells, CD8(+) T cells, macrophages, B cells, and CD4(+) T cells, in lung adenocarcinoma. Functional enrichment analyses also showed that a high expression level of FGL2 was positively correlated with enhanced T cell activities, especially CD8(+) T cell activation. Thus, we propose that high FGL2 expression, which is positively associated with enhanced antitumor activities mediated by T cells, is a beneficial marker for lung adenocarcinoma treatment outcomes.","output":"FGL2 is positively correlated with enhanced antitumor responses mediated by T cells in lung adenocarcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To identify effective interventions that promote healthy screen time use and reduce sedentary behavior in school-age children and adolescents (SACA) in all settings, over the last 20 years.

Beyond cardiovascular risk factors associated with age, some young adults without medical or cardiovascular history had stroke as a presenting feature of Covid-19. Suggested stroke mechanisms in this setting are inflammatory storm, subsequent hypercoagulability, and vasculitis. To date, a handful of pediatric stroke cases associated with Covid-19 have been reported, either with a cardioembolic mechanism or a focal cerebral arteriopathy. We report the case of an adolescent who presented with febrile meningism and stupor. Clinical, biological, and radiological features favored the diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome (LS), with Fusobacterium necrophorum infection (sphenoid sinusitis and meningitis) and intracranial vasculitis.

A safe, effective vaccine is urgently needed and remains a global health priority. Subunit vaccines are used successfully against other viruses when administered in the presence of an effective adjuvant. METHODS: We evaluated three different clinically tested adjuvant systems in combination with the SARS-CoV-2 pre-fusion stabilized (S-2P) spike protein using a one-dose regimen in mice. FINDINGS: Whilst spike protein alone was only weakly immunogenic, the addition of either Aluminum hydroxide, a squalene based oil-in-water emulsion system (SE) or a cationic liposome-based adjuvant significantly enhanced antibody responses against the spike receptor binding domain (RBD). Kinetics of antibody responses differed, with SE providing the most rapid response. Neutralizing antibodies developed after a single immunization in all adjuvanted groups with ID50 titers ranging from 86-4063.

Noninvasive sampling methods are advantageous for reducing the need for venipuncture, which may be a barrier to investigations, particularly in pediatric populations. Oral fluids are obtained by gingiva-crevicular sampling from children and adults and are very well accepted. Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) based on these samples have acceptable sensitivity and specificity compared to conventional serum-based antibody EIAs and are suitable for population-based surveillance. We describe the development and evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 IgG EIAs using SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleoprotein (NP) and spike (S) proteins in IgG isotype capture format and an indirect receptor-binding-domain (RBD) IgG EIA, intended for use in children as a primary endpoint. All three assays were assessed using a panel of 1,999 paired serum and oral fluids from children and adults participating in school SARS-CoV-2 surveillance studies during and after the first and second pandemic wave in the United Kingdom. The anti-NP IgG capture assay was the best candidate, with an overall sensitivity of 75% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 71 to 79%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI: 78 to 99%) compared with paired serum antibodies. Sensitivity observed in children (80%, 95% CI: 71 to 88%) was higher than that in adults (67%, CI: 60% to 74%). Oral fluid assays (OF) using spike protein and RBD antigens were also 99% specific and achieved reasonable but lower sensitivity in the target population (78%, 95% CI [68% to 86%] and 53%, 95% CI [43% to 64%], respectively). IMPORTANCE We report on the first large-scale assessment of the suitability of oral fluids for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibody obtained from healthy children attending school. The sample type (gingiva-crevicular fluid, which is a transudate of blood but is not saliva) can be self collected. Although detection of antibodies in oral fluids is less sensitive than that in blood, our study suggests an optimal format for operational use. The laboratory methods we have developed can reliably measure antibodies in children, who are able to take their own samples. Our findings are of immediate practical relevance for use in large-scale seroprevalence studies designed to measure exposure to infection, as they typically require venipuncture. Overall, our data indicate that OF assays based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are a tool suitable for population-based seroepidemiology studies in children and highly acceptable in children and adults, as venipuncture is no longer necessary.","output":"SARS Antibody Testing in Children: Development of Oral Fluid Assays for IgG Measurements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, Roma Pentecostal converts in England continued to meet for religious gatherings and communal prayer, either outdoors or in private homes of church members, despite measures put in place by the British government that limited the number of social contacts between individuals and at times forbade visiting other households. Among the members of the Life and Light church are many who belong to one of the high-risk categories for complications from Covid-19. Why would converts take part in activities that involved increased risk of virus transmission and increase their possibility of getting ill? This paper draws on informal online and in-person conversations with Roma that took place during the summer and autumn of 2020 and reflects on religion and communal prayer as a strategy of coping with the heightened uncertainty brought by the pandemic. It argues that participating in religious meetings where people jointly pray for others, both those who present and those who are absent, is an intangible form of care that helps to forge, shape, and maintain social relationships and creates a sense of belonging and continuity. In addition, praying is an embodied expression of one's relationship to a transcendental entity, Jesus, and of placing oneself into the caring hands of God and Jesus. Lastly, the Church provides material support for members who are in a difficult financial situation. Participating in Church activities like prayer meetings is an expression of belonging to a religious collectivity and can help gain access to this material help in situations when access to state-provided care and material support is limited or absent, thus opening for church members the possibility of tangible forms of care. The paper looks at the role of religion in dealing with the uncertainty that Roma migrants experience when dealing with the state and going about their everyday lives and the upheaval and increased uncertainty brought by the pandemic.

However, in Scotland during the first wave of the pandemic testing capacity was severely limited, meaning that large numbers of infected people were not formally diagnosed as having the virus. As a result, data on confirmed cases are unlikely to represent the true infection rates, and due to the small numbers of positive tests these data are not available at the small-area level for confidentiality reasons. Therefore to estimate the small-area dynamics in Covid-19 incidence this paper analyses the spatio-temporal trends in telehealth data relating to Covid-19, because during the first wave of the pandemic the public were advised to call the national telehealth provider NHS 24 if they experienced symptoms of the virus. Specifically, we propose a multivariate spatio-temporal correlation model for modelling the proportions of calls classified as either relating to Covid-19 directly or having related symptoms, and provide software for fitting the model in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. The model was developed in partnership with the national health agency Public Health Scotland, and here we use it to analyse the spatio-temporal dynamics of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Scotland between March and July 2020, specifically focusing on the spatial variation in the peak and the end of the first wave.","output":"Quantifying the small-area spatio-temporal dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic in Scotland during a period with limited testing capacity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mentors at seven United States and Australian academic institutions partnered with seven leading Indian academic palliative care and cancer centers to undertake a program combining remote and in-person mentorship, didactic instruction, and project-based learning in quality improvement.

Testing a closed loop system in an inpatient environment with supervised challenges allows for initial evaluation of performance and safety of the system. METHODS Adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) were enrolled into two similar studies (n=10/study), with 3-day inpatient analysis periods. Participants tested a Lilly hybrid closed loop (HCL) system comprised an investigational insulin pump, insulin lispro, a pump-embedded model predictive control algorithm, a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and an external, dedicated controller. Each protocol included meal-related and exercise challenges to simulate real-world diabetes self-management errors. Only study staff interacted with the HCL system. Performance was assessed using standard CGM metrics overall and within prespecified periods. RESULTS Participants (25% male) had meanSD age 44.714.2 years, T1D duration 30.211.1 years, A1C 7.20.8%, and insulin usage 0.530.21 U/kg/day. Percent TIR 70-180 mg/dL (meanSD) was 81.28.4 overall, 85.28.1 outside of challenge periods, 97.35.3 during the nocturnal periods, and 74.516.2 for the postprandial periods. During challenge periods, percent TIR for the over-bolus challenge was 65.429.2 and for the delayed bolus challenge was 57.125.1. No adverse events, serious adverse events or unanticipated adverse device events occurred while participants were using the HCL system. CONCLUSION In participants with T1D, Lilly AID system demonstrated expected algorithm performance and safety with satisfactory glycemic outcomes overall and in response to simulated diabetes management challenges.

As it is a new variant of SARS, there is no approved drug or vaccine available against this virus. This study aims to predict some promising cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome utilizing immunoinformatic approaches. Firstly, we identified 21 epitopes from 7 different proteins of SARS-CoV-2 inducing immune response and checked for allergenicity and conservancy. Based on these factors, we selected the top three epitopes, namely KAYNVTQAF, ATSRTLSYY, and LTALRLCAY showing functional interactions with the maximum number of MHC alleles and no allergenicity. Secondly, the 3D model of selected epitopes and HLA-A*29:02 were built and Molecular Docking simulation was performed. Most interestingly, the best two epitopes predicted by docking are part of two different structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, namely Membrane Glycoprotein (ATSRTLSYY) and Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein (KAYNVTQAF), which are generally target of choice for vaccine designing. Upon Molecular Docking, interactions between selected epitopes and HLA-A*29:02 were further validated by 50 ns Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. Analysis of RMSD, Rg, SASA, number of hydrogen bonds, RMSF, MM-PBSA, PCA, and DCCM from MD suggested that ATSRTLSYY is the most stable and promising epitope than KAYNVTQAF epitope. Moreover, we also identified B-cell epitopes for each of the antigenic proteins of SARS CoV-2.

Among gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the predominant causative agent for diabetic foot ulcer infections in low-resource countries. P. aeruginosa possesses a variety of virulence factors, including biofilm formation. Biofilm formation is an important benchmark characteristic in the pathophysiology of diabetic foot ulceration. The main objective of the current study was to identify the most commonly isolated organisms and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in diabetic foot patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also determined the genes associated with bacterial persistence and biofilm formation in the predominantly isolated organism. Accordingly, 100 wound swab samples were collected from diabetic foot patients from different hospitals in Alexandria, Egypt. Through phenotypic detection of biofilm formation, 93% (40) of the 43 P. aeruginosa isolates examined were categorized as biofilm producers. Molecular detection of the biofilm-encoding genes among the 43 P. aeruginosa isolates was as follows: algD (100%), pelF (88%) and pslD (49.7%), and this highlights a need for biofilm formation inhibitors to prevent the persistence of bacterial pathogens, and thus achieve better clinical outcomes in diabetic foot ulcer infections.

Although elevated in most COVID-19 patients, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels were higher in patients with primary co-infections than in those without (median CRP 110 mg/l, IQR 51C222 vs. 36, IQR 11C101, respectively; p < 0.0001). Nosocomial bloodstream and respiratory infections occurred in 47/309 (15.2%) and 91/309 (29.4%) of patients, respectively, and were associated with need for invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 45.6 95%CI 13.7C151.8 and 104.6 95%CI 41.5C263.5, respectively), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR 14.3 95%CI 6.5C31.5 and 16.5 95%CI 6.5C41.6, respectively), and haemodialysis (OR 31.4 95%CI 13.9C71.2 and OR 22.3 95%CI 11.2C44.2, respectively). The event of any nosocomial infection was significantly associated with in-hospital death (33/99 (33.3%) with nosocomial infection vs. 23/210 (10.9%) without, OR 4.1 95%CI 2.2C7.3). CONCLUSIONS: Primary co-infections are rare, yet antimicrobial use was frequent, mostly based on clinical worsening and elevated inflammation markers without clear evidence for co-infection. More reliable diagnostic prospects may help to reduce overtreatment. Rates of nosocomial infections are substantial in severely ill patients on organ support and associated with worse patient outcome.

METHODS: We analyzed the complete blood count and biochemical parameters of 186 COVID-19 patients by using the polymerase chain reaction test. Whether these parameters can be used to predict intensive care unit admission and mortality in the COVID-19 patients was investigated. RESULTS: The complete blood count and biochemical parameters of COVID-19 patients and in those admitted to intensive care unit were compared. The red cell distribution width, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, prothrombin time, and creatinine levels were found to be the most significant parameters. We found that these parameters are significant for predicting not only intensive care unit admission, but also the mortality of the patients admitted to the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: We determined that the most effective parameters to predict intensive care unit admission and mortality in COVID-19 patients are ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, red cell distribution width, creatinine, and intensive care unit.

In many studies, the numerical solutions of some models cannot fit very well with the real data. Thus, to show the dynamics of the Ebola epidemic, the GorenfloCMainardiCMorettiCParadisi scheme (GMMP) is taken to get the numerical solution of the SEIR fractional order Ebola system and the modified grid approximation method (MGAM) is used to acquire the parameters of the SEIR fractional order Ebola system.

Unfortunately, no effective drugs or vaccines have been reported yet. The main protease (MPRO) remains the most validated pharmacological target for the design and discovery of inhibitors. OBJECTIVE The purpose of the study was to find a prospective natural scaffold as an inhibitor for MPRO main protease in SARS-CoV-2 and compare it with repurposed antiviral drugs lopinavir and nelflinavir. METHODS Natural compound libraries were screened for potential scaffold against MPRO main protease. Molecular dynamics simulation, MM-GBSA and principle component analyses of enzyme-ligand complexes were carried out with the top-ranking hits and compared with the repurposed antiviral drugs lopinavir and nelfinavir. RESULTS The structure-based virtual screening indicated phenylbenzopyrone of flavonoids as one of the top-ranking scaffolds that have the potential to inhibit the main protease with O-glycosidic form performing better than corresponding aglyconic form. Simulation studies indicated that glycosidic form of flavonoid as more suitable inhibitor with compounds rutin, procyanidin B6, baicalin and galloylquercetin, demonstrating high affinity and stability, and rutin emerging as one of the best candidate compound. Interestingly, rutin was reported to have inhibitory activity against similar protease (3Cprotease of enterovirus A71) as well as implicated in lung fibrosis.

An innovative mobile health (mHealth)-enabled hierarchical diabetes management intervention was introduced and evaluated in China with the purpose of achieving better control of type 2 diabetes in primary care. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A community-based cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted among registered patients with type 2 diabetes in primary care from June 2017 to July 2019. A total of 19,601 participants were recruited from 864 communities (clusters) across 25 provinces in China, and 19,546 completed baseline assessment. Moreover, 576 communities (13,037 participants) were centrally randomized to the intervention and 288 communities (6,509 participants) to usual care. The intervention was centered on a tiered care teamCdelivered mHealth-mediated service package, initiated by monthly blood glucose monitoring at each structured clinic visit. Capacity building and quarterly performance review strategies upheld the quality of delivered primary care. The primary outcome was control of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; <7.0%), assessed at baseline and 12 months. The secondary outcomes include the individual/combined control rates of blood glucose, blood pressure (BP), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); changes in levels of HbA1c, BP, LDL-C, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and body weight; and episodes of hypoglycemia. Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat (ITT) generalized estimating equation (GEE) models, accounting for clustering and baseline values of the analyzed outcomes. After 1-year follow-up, 17,554 participants (89.8%) completed the end-of-study (EOS) assessment, with 45.1% of them from economically developed areas, 49.9% from urban areas, 60.5 (standard deviation [SD] 8.4) years of age, 41.2% male, 6.0 years of median diabetes duration, HbA1c level of 7.87% (SD 1.92%), and 37.3% with HbA1c <7.0% at baseline. Compared with usual care, the intervention led to an absolute improvement in the HbA1c control rate of 7.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.0% to 10.0%) and a relative improvement of 18.6% (relative risk [RR] 1.186, 95% CI 1.105 to 1.267) and an absolute improvement in the composite ABC control (HbA1c <7.0%, BP <140/80 mm Hg, and LDL-C <2.6 mmol/L) rate of 1.9% (95% CI 0.5 to 3.5) and a relative improvement of 21.8% (RR 1.218, 95% CI 1.062 to 1.395).

Recently, monomeric SARS-CoV2 M pro , drug repurposing and docking methods have facilitated the identification of several potential inhibitors. Results were refined through the assessment of dimeric SARS-CoV2 M pro , which represents the functional state of enzyme. Docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) studies indicated that dimeric M pro most significantly impacts binding affinity tendency compared with the monomeric state, which suggesting that dimeric state is most useful when performing studies aimed to identify drugs targeting M pro . In this study, we extend previous research by performing docking and MD simulation studies coupled with an MM/GBSA approach to assess binding of dimeric SARS-CoV2 M pro to 12 FDA-approved drugs (darunavir, indinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir, diosmin, hesperidin, rutin, raltegravir, velpatasvir, ledipasvir, rosuvastatin and bortezomib), which were identified as the best candidates for treatment of COVID-19 in some previous dockings studies involving monomeric SARS-CoV2 M pro .

Following infection, patients with a history of neurological complications may be at a higher risk of developing long-term neurological conditions associated with the -synuclein prion, such as Parkinsons disease and Lewy body dementia. Compelling evidence has been published to indicate that the spike protein, which is derived from SARS-CoV-2 and generated from the vaccines currently being employed, is not only able to cross the bloodCbrain barrier but may cause inflammation and/or blood clots in the brain. Consequently, should vaccine-induced expression of spike proteins not be limited to the site of injection and draining lymph nodes there is the potential of long-term implications following inoculation that may be identical to that of patients exhibiting neurological complications after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, further studies are needed before definitive conclusions can be made.","output":"How Does Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 Affect the Brain and Its Implications for the Vaccines Currently in Use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Selecting medical students for residency is a competitive process, with a narrow range of scores separating middle-ranked applicants. Self-assessment is a fundamental skill for any competent physician with a demonstrated correlation to diagnostic ability, examination scores, and technical skills, but has yet to be investigated in residency selection. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between self-assessment and interview performance as a potential adjunct to discriminate between applicants. METHODS At the University of Ottawa in 2020, 55 applicants completed a 9-station interview circuit assessing different characteristics or skills important for a career in general surgery, followed by a self-assessment questionnaire evaluating their perceived performance at each station. Pearson's correlation was used to determine the relationship between self-assessment scores (SASs) and interviewer scores (ISs). RESULTS There was a negative correlation between SASs and ISs for all interview stations. High performers underestimated their interview performance, and low performers overestimated their performance. Seven of the nine stations reached statistical significance (r = 0.60-0.73, P < 0.001). There was significant variability in the SAS of middle-ranked applicants, with a range three times greater than the range of ISs and demonstrating distinct self-assessment skills in candidates with very similar scores.

Investigational therapies for COVID-19 may cause clinically important drug-drug interactions (DDIs). We aimed to study potential DDIs (pDDIs) and their risk factors in COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a tertiary respiratory hospital dedicated to COVID-19 patients. The Lexi-Interact database was used to investigate clinically important pDDIs. The database output including interacting drug pairs, risk rating, reliability rating, mechanism, and management was evaluated. Associations between the occurrence of pDDIs and probable risk factors were assessed by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Medical charts of 227 patients were reviewed. About 38% of the patients had at least one clinically important pDDI. More than half of the interactions were between protease inhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir) and regularly prescribed medications for the management of comorbidities or COVID-19 symptoms (e.g., atorvastatin, alprazolam, salmeterol, and tamsulosin). Ischemic heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, and ICU admission were significantly associated with the occurrence of pDDIs.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a challenging period in human history, causing large-scale impacts on society and the environment as governments shift priorities and divert funding in response to this pandemic. Through a literature survey, this manuscript is intended to provide critical insights into the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the SDGs as outlined by the United Nations. We briefly describe this pandemic's positive and short-term effects on the environment, followed by a critical evaluation of its potential long-term impacts on the environment, society, and the SDGs. On the basis of COVID-19 effects, the SDGs are classified into three categories: directly-affected SDGs, indirectly-affected SDGs, and a stand-alone category. The COVID-19-induced lockdowns and restrictions resulted in a short-term decline in environmental pollution and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, providing valuable data for climate advocates. These positive impacts were essentially temporary due to the synchronized global response to the pandemic. The halted focus and development of the SDGs greatly impacts the global green transition to a healthy and sustainable world. COVID-19 threatens to impede the progress toward a prosperous, environment-friendly, and sustainable global development in multiple ways. These multi-dimensional threats have been critically evaluated, along with a description of potential solutions to curtail the adverse effects of COVID-19 on the SDGs. Considering the limited data regarding the impacts of the pandemic on the SDGs, diverse collaborative studies at the regional and global levels are recommended.","output":"Sustainable Development Goals Under Threat?

With over 5 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced globally over the last 2 years, there is unprecedented data to decipher how competitive viral evolution results in the emergence of fitter SARS-CoV-2 variants. Much attention has been directed to studying how specific mutations in the Spike protein impact its binding to the ACE2 receptor or viral neutralization by antibodies, but there is limited knowledge of a genomic signature that is shared primarily by the sequential dominant variants. Here we introduce a methodology to quantify the genome-wide distinctiveness of polynucleotide fragments of various lengths (3-to 240-mers) that constitute SARS-CoV-2 sequences (freely available at https://academia.nferx.com/GENI). Compared to standard phylogenetic distance metrics and overall mutational load, the quantification of distinctive 9-mer polynucleotides provides a higher resolution of separation between VOCs (Reference = 89, IQR: 65-108; Alpha = 166, IQR: 150-182; Beta 130, IQR: 113-147; Gamma = 165, IQR: 152-180; Delta = 234, IQR: 216-253; and Omicron = 294, IQR: 287-315). Omicrons exceptionally high genomic distinctiveness may confer a competitive advantage over both prior VOCs (including Delta) and the recently emerged and highly mutated B.1.640.2 (IHU) lineage. Expanding on this analysis, evaluation of genomic distinctiveness weighted by intra-lineage 9-mer conservation for 1,363 lineages annotated in GISAID highlights that genomic distinctiveness has increased over time (R2=0.37) and that VOCs score significantly higher than contemporary non-VOC lineages, with Omicron among the most distinctive lineages observed till date. This study demonstrates the value of characterizing new SARS-CoV-2 variants by their genome-wide polynucleotide distinctiveness and emphasizes the need to go beyond a narrow set of mutations at known functionally or antigenically salient sites on the Spike protein. The consistently higher distinctiveness of each emerging VOC compared to prior VOCs suggests that real-time monitoring of genomic distinctiveness would aid in more rapid assessment of viral fitness.","output":"Genomic diversification of long polynucleotide fragments is a signature of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feline calicivirus (FCV) is 1 of the most common causes of upper respiratory tract disease in cats.

Social distancing and quarantining during the pandemic have affected mental health as well. This study set out to determine the impact of COVID-19 and the use of telemedicine on managing patients with mental illness. It evaluates the impact of the COVID-19 infection on 403 patients who are United States military veterans: 160 patients with chronic mental illnesses and 243 without mental illness. The patients were observed remotely using a telehealth clinic until they were free of COVID-19 symptoms or tested negative for coronavirus RNA. Telemedicine was used successfully to manage patients with mental illness and acute COVID-19 infections. These patients maintained their therapeutic engagement using telephone or video-on-demand encounters. The use of this technology allowed for follow-up visits over an extended period of time, including resolution of their symptoms, re-test results, and management of their comorbidities. The outcomes of their infections mirrored those of patients without preexisting mental illness. They did require more intense psychiatric interventions, primarily with medications, but no hospitalizations for mental health occurred. Although the pandemic has several elements known to impact greatly on mental health (social illness, loneliness, fear, and uncertainty), the effect on patients with COVID-19 infection and mental illness diagnosis does not appear to cause psychiatric decompensation. Telemedicine offered a means for more intense engagement on follow-up of these patients, which may have played a role. Because of the small numbers in this study and the unique resources available for veterans, more extensive study is required to determine the effect of the pandemic in patients with mental illness who are not veterans.

By contrast, GPe projections activate GABA-A receptors on the soma and proximal dendrites but do not result in rebounding.

This study aimed to estimate the theoretical cost-optimal capacity requirement for 'step down' intermediate care services within a major healthcare system in England, at a time when considerable uncertainty remained regarding vaccination uptake and the easing of societal restrictions. Methods: Demand for intermediate care was projected using an epidemiological model (for COVID-19 demand) and regressing upon public mobility (for non-COVID-19 demand). These were inputted to a computer simulation model of patient flow from acute discharge readiness to bedded and home-based Discharge to Assess (D2A) intermediate care services. Cost-optimal capacity was defined as that which yielded the lowest total cost of intermediate care provision and corresponding acute discharge delays. Results: Increased intermediate care capacity is likely to bring about lower system-level costs, with the additional D2A investment more than offset by substantial reductions in costly acute discharge delays (leading also to improved patient outcome and experience). Results suggest that completely eliminating acute 'bed blocking' is unlikely economical (requiring large amounts of downstream capacity), and that health systems should instead target an appropriate tolerance based upon the specific characteristics of the pathway. Conclusions: Computer modelling can be a valuable asset for determining optimal capacity allocation along the complex care pathway. With results supporting a Business Case for increased downstream capacity, this study demonstrates how modelling can be applied in practice and provides a blueprint for use alongside the freely-available model code.","output":"Optimising the balance of acute and intermediate care capacity for the complex discharge pathway: computer modelling study during COVID-19 recovery in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented extraordinary challenges to worldwide healthcare systems, however, prevalence remains low in some countries.

All patients are offered Telehealth at baseline and at 4 weeks after interventions making sure they remain adherent to their ART, with enough supply of ART for 4 weeks, and discussed harm reduction strategies (hand washing, use of hand sanitizer & face mask, social distancing, shelter-at-home) via telehealth and video clips. The goal was an increase of hand hygiene performance by 25% at 4 weeks after interventions. The number of hand washing and hand sanitizer use per day was categorized as < 5, 5C10, and >10 per day and was analyzed by Cochran-Armitage test for trend.

Consequences of the ongoing pandemic may have a negative impact on the mental health of affected individuals. This particularly refers to those quarantined. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is currently one of the biggest health issues worldwide, a higher demand emerges for research concentrating on the worsening of psychological well-being among the general and the quarantined population, as well as on individual coping strategies that may moderate the occurrence of psychopathologies. Method: Data were collected within the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. Participants represented quarantine (+) and quarantine (C) groups. Quarantine (+) group, different from quarantine (C), consisted of people who experienced it themselves or someone close to them did after contacting an infected individual. To measure psychopathological symptoms a General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) was used. For measuring PTSD symptoms, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was used. This study followed the coping strategies manifested among the participants using the MiniCope questionnaire. Results: A total of 2,036 individuals participated in this study. Quarantine (+) individuals had significantly higher total and subscales GHQ-28 scores (anxiety, insomnia, and somatic symptoms) as well as a higher IES-R arousal score. The quarantine (+) individuals were more likely to use self-distraction as a coping strategy. This research identified positive and negative correlations between presented coping styles and manifested psychopathology.

Keeping the antimicrobial potential of rutin in mind, we studied its role in the inhibition of essential proteins of SARS-CoV-2 including main protease (M(pro)), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), papain-like protease (PL(pro)), and spike (S)-protein through different in silico approaches. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: Molecular docking, inhibition constant, hydrogen bond calculations, and ADMET-properties prediction were performed using different software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Molecular docking study showed that rutin bound effectively with M(pro), RdRp, PL(pro), and S-proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Out of these four proteins, M(pro) exhibited the strongest binding affinity with the least binding energy (-8.9 Kcal/mol) and stabilized through hydrogen bonds with bond lengths ranging from 1.18 ? to 3.17 ? as well as hydrophobic interactions. The predicted ADMET and bioactivity showed its optimal solubility, non-toxic, and non-carcinogenic properties. The values of the predicted inhibitory constant of the rutin with SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins ranged between 5.66 M to 6.54 M which suggested its promising drug candidature. This study suggested rutin alone or in combination as a dietary supplement may be used to fight against COVID-19 after detailed in vitro and in vivo studies.","output":"Molecular Docking Analysis of Rutin Reveals Possible Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Vital Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To evaluate the completion of nursing records through scheduled audits to analyse risk outcome indicators. BACKGROUND: Nursing records support clinical decision-making and encourage continuity of care, hence the importance of auditing their completion in order to take corrective action where necessary. METHOD: This was an observational descriptive study carried out from February to November 2020 with a sample of 1131 electronic health records belonging to patients admitted to COVID-19 hospital units during three observation periods: pre-pandemic, first wave, and second wave. RESULTS: A significant reduction in nursing record completion rates was observed between pre-pandemic period and first and second waves: Braden scale 40.97%, 28.02%, and 30.99%; Downton scale: 43.74%, 22.34%, and 33.91%; Gijn scale: 40.12%, 26.23%, and 33.64% (p < 0.001). There was an increase in the number of records completed between the first and second waves following the measures adopted after the quality audit. CONCLUSIONS: The use of scheduled audits of nursing records as quality indicators facilitated the detection of areas for improvement, allowing timely corrective actions. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Support from nursing managers at health care facilities to implement quality assessment programmes encompassing audits of clinical record completion will encourage the adoption of measures for corrective action.","output":"Auditing completion of nursing records as an outcome indicator for identifying patients at risk of developing pressure ulcers, falling, and social vulnerability: An observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The 76-day lockdown of Wuhan city has successfully contained the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak However, to date few studies have evaluated the hospital bed shortage for COVID-19 during the lockdown and none for non-COVID-19 patients, although such data are important for better preparedness of the future outbreak Methods: We built a compartmental model to estimate the daily numbers of hospital bed shortage for patients with mild, severe and critical COVID-19, taking account of underreport and diagnosis delay Results: The maximal daily shortage of inpatient beds for mild, severe and critical COVID-19 patients was 43,960 (95% confidence interval: 35,246, 52,929), 2,779 (1,395, 4,163) and 196 (143, 250) beds in early February 2020 An earlier or later lockdown would have greatly increased the shortage of hospital beds in Wuhan The overwhelmed healthcare system might have delayed the provision of health care to both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients during the lockdown The second wave in Wuhan could have occurred in June 2020 if social distancing measures had waned in early March 2020 The hospital bed shortage was estimated much smaller in the potential second wave than in the first one Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the timing and strength of lockdown is important for the containment of the COVID-19 outbreaks The healthcare needs of non-COVID-19 patients in the pandemic warrant more investigations","output":"The shortage of hospital beds for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients during the lockdown of Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization declared on March 11, 2020 that the COVID-19 epidemic has become a pandemic In Tunisia, the Ministry of Health has recommended enhanced preventive hygiene measures to contain and limit the spread of the virus Following the entry of Tunisia into phase 4 of the COVID-19 epidemic, the Tunisian Association of Surgery proposed recommendations related to surgical activity Surgical emergencies must be treated urgently and without delay Non-tumor pathologies which require surgery in an elective situation and for which the risk of aggravation or complication is considered low shoud be postponed For digestive tumor pathology, and apart from complicated forms, neoadjuvant treatment is highly recommended in the context of multidisciplinary concertation staff","output":"Recommandations of the tunisian association of surgery for the practice of visceral surgery during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transmission of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mainly occurs through direct contact with an infected person via droplets. A potential role of contaminated surfaces in SARS-CoV-2 transmission has been suggested since the virus has been extensively detected on environmental surfaces. These findings have driven the investigation of virus stability on surfaces under several conditions. However, it remains unclear how long the infectious virus survives on surfaces under different climate conditions, which could play a role in predicting the seasonality of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the virus stability and its biological half-life on various types of surfaces under indoor and seasonal climate conditions. This study revealed that SARS-CoV-2 survived the longest on surfaces under winter conditions, with a survival post-contamination on most surfaces up to 21 days, followed by spring/fall conditions, with a survival up to 7 days. Infectious virus was isolated up to 4 days post-contamination under indoor conditions, whereas no infectious virus was found at 3 days post-contamination under summer conditions. Our study demonstrates the remarkable persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on many different common surfaces, especially under winter conditions, and raises awareness to the potential risk of contaminated surfaces to spread the virus.","output":"Environmental Stability of SARS-CoV-2 on Different Types of Surfaces under Indoor and Seasonal Climate Conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) experienced prolonged interruption of their rehabilitation palliative care routines due to restrictive COVID-19 pandemic public health measures. This study assesses the effects of before and after the lockdown on functionality rates and quality of life (QoL) in patients with ALS. METHODS A longitudinal observational study was conducted. Participants were assessed three times - early January (T0), before mandatory lockdown (T1), and during lockdown (T2) - using the ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRS-R), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and the ALS-Specific Quality of Life-Short Form (ALSSQOL-SF). The paired-sample t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used. RESULTS Thirty-two patients were included with a mean age of 56.9 (SD 14.2) years and mean symptoms onset of 27.1 (SD 14.3) months. ALSFRS-R mean scores decayed significantly over time when comparing T0-T1 (0.26  0.38) and T1-T2 (1.36  1.43) slopes (p < 0.001). Significant differences were observed between T1 and T2 for ALSSQOL-SF scores (115.31  17.06 vs. 104.31  20.65), especially in four specific domains, and FSS scores (34.06  16.84 vs. 40.09  17.63).

Methods China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), PubMed, and Embase were extensively searched using the search terms Shuanghuanglian injection and Shuanghuanglian fenzhen to retrieve articles relevant to SHLI (1992C2020). Retrieved articles were further investigated by two authors to exclude those unrelated to SHLI. The bibliographical references of the included articles were exported as raw data and then treated using the CiteSpace tool to visualize the mapping of the SHLI research domain. Essential clusters and highly frequent keywords were quantified for further analysis. The clusters were automatically labeled by the algorithm of tf*idf for objective analysis. Basic bibliometric features, including article types and yearly trend in article numbers were also determined and discussed. Results The modules of the keywords of interest presented clear boundaries with a high modularity score (Q = 0.73). High-confidence clusters were identified, including bioactivity fingerprint (S = 0.99), equal pupils (S = 0.91), drug preparation department (S = 0.87), difficulty in respiration (S = 0.85), peristalsis (0.88), and Danshen powder injection (S = 0.94).

Conclusion In the field of SHLI study, there are five major topic categories: bioactivity fingerprint; ADR mechanism and cause detection; proper preparation; clinical evidence accumulation; and efficacy in diseases with no effective treatment and combination usage. The trend for using modern methodologies from a science-based perspective to study SHLI will continue to exist.

Hitherto, no antiviral drug is available to combat this viral outbreak. METHODS: Keeping in mind the urgency of the situation, the current study was designed to devise new strategies for drug discovery and/or repositioning against SARS-CoV-2. In the current study, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which regulates viral replication, is proposed as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit viral infection. RESULTS: Evolutionary studies of whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 represent high similarity (> 90%) with other SARS viruses. Targeting the RdRp active sites, ASP760 and ASP761, by antiviral drugs could be a potential therapeutic option for inhibition of coronavirus RdRp, and thus viral replication. Target-based virtual screening and molecular docking results show that the antiviral Galidesivir and its structurally similar compounds have shown promise against SARS-CoV-2.

The demand for those products increases exponentially as the number of infected grows, outpacing any growth that local production facilities can achieve (Ranney et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020). Disruptions in the global supply chain by closing factories or scaled-down transport routes can further increase resource scarcity (McMahon et al., 2020). During the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed a reflex of \`our people first' in many regions, countries, and continents (Baldwin and Evenett, 2020). In this paper, however, we show that a cooperative sharing mechanism can substantially improve the ability to face epidemics. We present a stylized model in which communities share their resources such that each can receive resources whenever a local epidemic flares up. This can potentially prevent local resource exhaustion and reduce the total number of infected cases. We also show that the success of sharing resources heavily depends on having a sufficiently long delay between the onset of epidemics in different communities. This means that a global sharing mechanism should be paired with measures to slow down the spread of infections from one community to the other. Our work is a first step towards designing a resilient global supply chain mechanism that can deal with future pandemics by design, rather than being subjected to the coincidental and unequal distribution of opportunities per community at present.","output":"A global sharing mechanism of resources: modeling a crucial step in the fight against pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on education.

From March 19 to May 26, all elective total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures were deferred. The purpose of this study was to review the unit sales data of THA and TKA procedures in Ontario over this time period to identify any trends in surgical activity. METHODS Unit sales data for all THA and TKA procedures performed in Ontario between January 2019 and December 2020 were reviewed. All orthopedic companies contributed to the data set. Femoral stems were considered an indicator of THA procedures, while primary femurs were considered an indicator of TKA procedures. Data were analyzed to determine trends in THA and TKA procedures during the deferral period and the relative change in THA and TKA activity following resumption. RESULTS There was a 53% reduction in THA activity between March and May of 2020 when compared to the same interval in 2019. From June to September of 2019, THA sales activity was 87.3% that of TKA. From June to September of 2020, THA sales activity was 122.8% that of TKA. CONCLUSION Provincial directives aimed at controlling the outbreak of COVID-19 contributed to a substantial reduction in THA and TKA activity in 2020.

Recent studies have identified preliminary evidence of widening disparities in suicidal behaviors across sex, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status among college students. Few systematic reviews and meta-analyses offer a comprehensive understanding of on-campus and off-campus suicide interventions, nor is collated information available for different types of screening, assessment, treatment, and postvention plans. Further challenges have been identified since the COVID-19 pandemic, calling for cost-effective and innovative interventions to address increased rates of suicidal behaviors among college students facing unprecedented stressors. OBJECTIVE: This research protocol describes the first systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the most effective and cost-effective intervention components for universal and targeted (indicated and selected) suicide prevention among college students in a global context. Special attention will be placed on disparities in suicide prevention across sociodemographic subgroups, inclusive interventions beyond campus, global context, and intervention responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A sensitive search strategy will be executed across MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, PsycINFO (EBSCO), ERIC (EBSCO), Cochrane Library, Dissertations and Theses Global (ProQuest), Scopus, Global Index Medicus, SciELO, African Journals Online, Global Health (CABI), and Google Scholar. Data extraction and evaluation will be conducted by three independent researchers. Risk of bias will be assessed. A multilevel meta-regression model and subgroup analysis will be used to analyze the data and estimate effect sizes. RESULTS: The initial search was completed in December 2020 and updated with additional other-language studies in March 2020. We expect the results to be submitted for publication in mid-2021. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increasing rates of suicidal behaviors among college students, few preventative efforts have targeted this population, and fewer focus on factors that might place specific demographic groups at heightened risk. The impact of COVID-19 on suicidal behaviors among college students highlights and exacerbates the urgent need for rapid and effective interventions that might differ from traditional approaches. This equity-focused study will address these gaps and provide a valuable analysis of the effectiveness of suicide prevention programs and interventions.

The causative agent is a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2), which is similar to SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Adult infection with respiratory symptoms was considered in the beginning of the pandemic. Now, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 infects children and other organs such as the gastrointestinal tract. SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells through angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors as the main receptor expressed in various organs such as the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Studies on children and the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 do not completely explain the natural course of infection in children, and precisely how the GI tract is involved is not understood. The present article highlights the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings in children with COVID-19. According to the evidence, SARS-CoV-2 infection is milder in children and may present different clinical symptoms from adults. Common clinical manifestations of pediatric COVID-19 include cough, fever, sore throat, malaise, fatigue, and GI symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Furthermore, liver and pancreatic enzymes may be elevated during the pediatric COVID-19 course. Asymptomatic children carriers are potential sources of infection for adults, especially elderly ones.

As such, it is used as stratification criteria in clinical trials evaluating novel immunostimulating therapies. Preanalytical constraints relative to the short delay between blood sampling and flow cytometry staining have nevertheless limited its use in multicentric studies. The objective of the present work was to compare mHLA-DR expression between whole blood samples simultaneously drawn in EDTA or Cyto-Chex BCT tubes. METHODS: In two university hospitals, mHLA-DR was assessed in fresh whole blood from septic patients (n = 12) and healthy donors (n = 6) simultaneously sampled on EDTA and Cyto-Chex BCT tubes. Staining was performed immediately after sampling and after blood storage at room temperature. RESULTS: We confirmed that samples collected in Cyto-Chex tube had substantially enhanced stability for mHLA-DR results (48-72 h) over those collected in EDTA. On baseline values, despite good correlation between tubes (r = 0.98, p < 0.001), mHLA-DR expression was systematically lower with Cyto-Chex BCT. CONCLUSION: The present reports confirms the potential of Cyto-Chex BCT tubes to stabilize mHLA-DR expression before staining and extends the work of Quadrini et al. [Cytometry B 2021;100:103-114]. In centers without rapid access to flow cytometry facilities, it enables to tolerate delays in mHLA-DR staining. However, a 30% gap exists between results obtained with EDTA and Cyto-Chex BCT tubes.

DESIGN: National survey. SETTING: UK maternity services during the COVID-19 pandemic. POPULATION OR SAMPLE: Healthcare professionals working within maternity services. METHODS: A national electronic survey was developed to investigate local modifications to general and specialist maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the context of the contemporaneous national pandemic guidance. After a pilot phase, the survey was distributed through professional networks by the RCOG and co-authors. The survey results were presented descriptively in tabular and graphic formats, with proportions compared using chi-square tests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Service modifications made during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 81 respondent sites, 42% of the 194 obstetric units in the UK, were included. They reported substantial and heterogeneous maternity service modifications. Seventy percent of units reported a reduction in antenatal appointments and 56% reported a reduction in postnatal appointments; 89% reported using remote consultation methods. A change to screening pathways for gestational diabetes mellitus was reported by 70%, and 59% had temporarily removed the offer of births at home or in a midwife-led unit. A reduction in emergency antenatal presentations was experienced by 86% of units. CONCLUSIONS: This national survey documents the extensive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternity services in the UK. More research is needed to understand the impact on maternity outcomes and experience.

This research focuses on one of the aspects of this problem, aiming to analyse interregional interactions, the activation of which can become a driver of growth. Based on the idea of double circulation from the Chinas 14th Five-Year Plan, we demonstrate that Russia also has the ability to shift the focus of economic policy towards expanding the domestic market and developing ties between regions. The paper draws parallels between the early 1920s and 2020s. It is noted that the need to overcome economic depression was determined by justifying close cooperation of individual regions in Russia. The article describes the use of interregional interactions as a tool for spatial development based on the existing federal strategic plans. The study demonstrates that that the task of strengthening interregional interactions is only briefly touched upon in the plans. However, it is important to note that this process balances the constraints and opportunities for the development of the whole country. The analysis of the spatial markets hierarchy in the context of economic macroregions revealed their incomplete nature as complete economic systems. The obtained results show that in order for the idea of macro-regions to actually work, real interregional projects should appear inside of these macro-regions. It is determined that on the international level the demand for special tools for enhancing interregional interactions is gradually growing. The author proposes measures based on successful examples to support such interregional interactions in Russia. Finally, the author concludes that in the current situation the increase in interregional interactions can positively affect the economic development of Russia as well as create new spatially distributed value-added chains. ?  .., 2021","output":"The Territory Requires Coherent Work: The Role of Interregional Interactions in Economic Recovery (To the 100th Anniversary of I.G.

In this retrospective study of 328 trainees at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, we administered a survey to assess risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 February and 30 June 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by self-reported and laboratory-confirmed IgG antibody and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test results. We used Bayesian generalized linear mixed effect regression to examine associations between hypothesized risk factors and infection odds. The cumulative incidence of infection was 20.1%.

Considering the timetemperature profile of refrigerators as a food safety indicator, the purpose of this study is to gain insight into refrigeration temperatures in parallel with refrigerator and household characteristics that could potentially influence the refrigeration temperatures. During a 24 h period in 15-min intervals, internal temperature of the test product, refrigerator air and ambient air temperatures were measured with one penetration and two air probes coupled with a data logger. The internal temperature of the test product was measured with pre-prepared Karlsruhe Test Material, which had thermal properties similar to those of lean beef. Refrigerator and household characteristics were collected with a predefined observational sheet and short, structured questionnaire. In total, 50 households and their refrigerators were included. Gaps related to the cold storage and cross-contamination were observed. Temperature displays were present in 16% while control thermometers were not observed at all; 20% of the refrigerators enabled 24 h average internal temperature lower than 4 C, 30% between 4 and 6 C and 50% over 6 C. Refrigerator age, type and load were observed but had no significant impact, which suggests thermostat setting as a key factor influencing refrigerator temperatures. Food distribution inside refrigerators was related to the refrigerator load with significant risk for cross-contamination in overpacked refrigerators. High temperatures combined with a non-systematic distribution of food in the refrigerator, expired dates of durability, and non-systematic cleaning strategies allow favourable preconditions for food infections occurring at the end of the food supply chain.

The autophagy machinery adopted the structural architecture of ubiquitin and employs two ubiquitin-like protein conjugation systems for autophagosome biogenesis. Ubiquitin chains that are attached as labels to protein aggregates or subcellular organelles confer selectivity, allowing autophagy receptors to simultaneously bind ubiquitinated cargos and autophagy-specific ubiquitin-like modifiers (Atg8-family proteins). Moreover, there is tremendous crosstalk between autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

This is significant since policies and other discursive signals about selection processes can influence the behaviour of aspiring physicians. The purpose of this study is to describe the ways through which Canadian medical schools articulate the importance of research experiences in publicly available policy documents. METHODS From January to June 2021, the authors reviewed publicly available selection criteria, application materials, institutional and research-related web pages associated with the 17 Canadian medical schools alongside high-level Canadian articulations of important competencies for physicians. These materials were analyzed using a qualitative descriptive approach. The authors considered concordance and/or discordance within each school's stance on the importance of research experiences in their selection criteria and application materials. RESULTS Research experiences are typically not explicitly required for entry into a Canadian Doctor of Medicine (MD) program; however, there are expectations that graduating physicians should understand research. All 17 Canadian medical schools signal an appreciation for the value of research on an institutional level. Review of selection criteria and application materials show that five Canadian medical schools suggest to aspiring physicians that research experiences are important for admission and four do not suggest that research experiences are important for admission. There were both intra-institution and inter-institution discordance concerning the importance of research experiences for medical school applicant selection in one and seven medical schools respectively. CONCLUSIONS Given the significant variance among the 17 Canadian medical schools, it is worthwhile for medical schools to evaluate their front-facing admission policies with consideration of the potential impact it might have on the behaviour of aspiring physicians, to ensure best selection of future physicians.","output":"Research experiences for Canadian aspiring physicians: a descriptive analysis of medical school admission policies concerning research involvement in Canada."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To investigate the association of voice analysis with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients and methods A vocal biomarker, a unitless scalar with a value between 0-1, was developed based on 434 voice samples. The biomarker training was followed by a prospective, multi-center, observational study. All subjects were tested for SARS-CoV-2, had their voice recorded to a smartphone application and gave their informed consent to participate in the study. The association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the vocal biomarker was evaluated. Results Final study population included 80 subjects with a median age of 29 [23-36], of whom 68% were men. Forty patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Infected patients were 12 times more likely to report at least one symptom (odds ratio 11.8, p<.001). The vocal biomarker was significantly higher among infected patients (0.11 [0.06-0.17] vs. 0.19 [0.12-0.3], p=.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) evaluating the association of the vocal biomarker with SARS-CoV-2 status was 72%. With a biomarker threshold of 0.115, the results translated to a sensitivity and specificity of 85% [95% CI: 70-94%] and 53% [95% CI: 36-69%], respectively. When added to a self-reported symptom classifier, the AUC significantly improved from 0.775 to 0.85. Conclusion Voice analysis is associated with SARS-CoV-2 status and holds the potential to improve the accuracy of self-reported symptom-based screening tools.

We investigated the mechanisms that drive strong T(FH) responses during infection. Infection induces viral replication and antigen (Ag) presentation lasting through the CD4 effector phase, but Ag and pathogen recognition receptor signals are short-lived after vaccination. We analyzed the need for both infection and Ag presentation at the effector phase, using an in vivo sequential transfer model to time their availability. Differentiation of CD4 effectors into T(FH) and GC-T(FH) required that they recognize Ag locally in the site of T(FH) development, at the effector phase, but did not depend on specific Ag-presenting cells (APCs). In addition, concurrent signals from infection were necessary even when sufficient Ag was presented. Providing these signals with a second dose of live attenuated influenza vaccine at the effector phase drove T(FH) and GC-T(FH) development equivalent to live infection. The results suggest that vaccine approaches can induce strong T(FH) development that supports GC responses akin to infection, if they supply these effector phase signals at the right time and site. We suggest that these requirements create a checkpoint that ensures T(FH) only develop fully when infection is still ongoing, thereby avoiding unnecessary, potentially autoimmune, responses.","output":"Strong influenza-induced T(FH) generation requires CD4 effectors to recognize antigen locally and receive signals from continuing infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The one-drug/one-target/one-disease approach to drug discovery is presently facing many challenges of safety, efficacy, and sustainability.

In the context of clinical management for venous thromboembolism, this could result in suboptimal therapy with warfarin. We aimed to determine the impact of the pandemic on utilization of International Normalized Ratio (INR) testing and the percentage of high and low results. METHODS: INR data from 11 institutions were extracted to compare testing volume and the percentage of INR results &#8805;3.5 and &#8804;1.5 between a pre-pandemic period (January-June 2019, period 1) and a portion of the COVID-19 pandemic period (January-June 2020, period 2). The analysis was performed for inpatient and outpatient cohorts. RESULTS: Testing volumes showed relatively little change in January and February, followed by a significant decrease in March, April, and May, and then returned to baseline in June. Outpatient testing showed a larger percentage decrease in testing volume compared to inpatient testing. At 10 of the 11 study sites, we observed an increase in the percentage of abnormal high INR results as test volumes decreased, primarily among outpatients. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted INR testing among outpatients which may be attributable to several factors. Increased supratherapeutic INR results during the pandemic period when there was reduced laboratory utilization and access to care is concerning because of the risk of adverse bleeding events in this group of patients.

Disease outcomes range from asymptomatic to fatal. The virus initiates entry into host cells by the binding of its spike protein to the ACE2 receptor. Entry is finalized by the activation of spike glycoprotein by proteases including transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and FURIN which cleave the spike protein of the virus. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TMPRSS2 may lead to functional changes which could underlie differences in disease severity. TMPRSS2 is also known to activate different respiratory illnesses including coronaviruses and influenza A (Shen et al., 2020). Previous studies have shown that knockout TMPRSS2 mice appeared healthy, experienced a decrease in viral spread within the respiratory system, and had a less severe immune response when infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Baughn et al., 2020). Thus, we asked whether genetic variations in TMPRSS2 in humans lead to differences in infection rates or severity of disease symptoms of SARS-CoV-2. We examined the NCBI dbSNP database to identify SNPs in the TMPRSS2 gene. As of 10 December 2020, we found there were 11,023 intron variants, 393 missense variants, 186 synonymous variants, 3 in-frame insertion variants, 2 in-frame deletion variants, and 1 initiator codon variant reported. To narrow these down to 23 SNPs of interest, we first searched the ClinVar database to identify SNPs with general clinical significance, followed by searching the literature to determine SNPs specifically related to SARS-CoV-2 severity. One missense variant, rs12329760, results in an amino acid substitution, V160M, which has been predicted to alter TMPRSS2 function. A subset of these SNPs show differences in frequency in world populations, and we wondered if these SNPs had structural and functional consequences for the protein. A crystal structure of TMPRSS2 is not currently available. To visualize the structural consequences of amino acid substitutions, we performed homology modeling on TMPRSS2 (UniProt O15393) using the structure prediction software HHPred, RaptorX, and SwissModel based on the ~30% similarity to hepsin. The predicted structures of TMPRSS2 with various amino acid substitutions were then docked to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using I-TASSER and Haddock 2.4 to observe differences in binding interactions and therefore determine which sequence changes are predicted to alter binding interactions, potentially contributing to the wide variation of symptoms caused by COVID-19.

This study describes successful recovery strategies for an urban, multi-specialty ophthalmology department serving a high-risk patient population. METHODS: The study took place at a large multi-specialty tertiary care academic ophthalmology department in a metropolitan city during a seven-month period (MarchCOctober 2020). Five recovery ad hoc committees were charged with formulating metrics and initiatives to manage clinical volumes while maintaining safe practices, providing patient access, and minimizing financial damage. A six-tier system was created to resume non-urgent appointments in May 2020. Educational and research activities were maintained through the development of virtual curricula and research platforms. RESULTS: The number of clinical and surgical visits per month in 2020 compared to 2019 and the time to reach 95% of pre-COVID patient volumes were monitored. In October 2020, 95% of pre-COVID volumes were attained (11,975 vs 12,337 patient visits in October 2019; 266 vs 272 surgical cases in October 2019). Despite significant financial losses, the department surpassed December 2019 collections in December 2020. No faculty, staff, or trainees received furloughs or pay cuts. There was no COVID-19 transmission between faculty, staff, and patients.

We discuss the dual role of microglia in disease development, the beneficial functions crucial for bacterial clearing, and the destructive properties through triggering neuroinflammation, characterized by cytokine and chemokine release which leads to leukocyte trafficking through the brain vascular endothelium and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier integrity. Due to intrinsic complexity of microglia and up until recently lack of specific markers, the study of microglial response to bacterial pathogens is challenging. New experimental models and techniques open up possibilities to accelerate progress in the field. We review existing models and discuss possibilities and limitations. Finally, we summarize recent findings where bacterial virulence factors are identified to be important for the microglial response, and how manipulation of evoked responses could be used for therapeutic or preventive purposes. Among promising approaches are: modulations of microglia phenotype switching toward anti-inflammatory and phagocytic functions, the use of non-bacterolytic antimicrobials, preventing release of bacterial components into the neural milieu and consequential amplification of immune activation, and protection of the blood-brain barrier integrity.","output":"The Role of Microglia in Bacterial Meningitis: Inflammatory Response, Experimental Models and New Neuroprotective Therapeutic Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Urban food markets can promote sustainable development through the generation of social value in the spaces where they are located and contribute to sustainability on a global scale.

Stress is known to have a negative impact on parentCchild feeding interactions;hence, the purpose of this study is to examine how COVID-related parenting stress, which was measured using a newly developed scale, is related to parent mental health, nonresponsive feeding, and childrens self-regulation of eating. 119 parents of children ages 2C7 years old filled out questions about COVID-related parenting stress, mental health, nonresponsive feeding behaviors, and childrens self-regulation of eating. A series of multiple regressions were run to predict parent anxiety and psychological distress from COVID-related parenting stress. COVID-related parenting stress was found to be a significant predictor of both parent anxiety and psychological distress. When COVID-related parenting stress was further broken down into COVID-Related Job/Financial Security Stress and COVID-Related Family Safety/Stability Stress, COVID-Related Job/Financial Security Stress predicted psychological distress while COVID-Related Family Safety/Stability Stress predicted parent anxiety. Moderation analyses were also run to test the difference across the parents of children under 5 years of age and those of children who were 5 years of age and older regarding the association of COVID-related parenting stress and either parent anxiety or psychological distress. There was no significant difference across age. Lastly, COVID-related parenting stress and nonresponsive feeding practices were simultaneously entered into a multiple regression to predict childrens self-regulation of eating, and COVID-related parenting stress and parent distrust in appetite were both found to decrease childrens ability to self-regulate energy intake. Based on findings from this study, researchers interested in improving childrens self-regulation of eating and long-term health outcomes should continue to target the reduction of nonresponsive parent feeding behaviors, but they should also aim to look beyond specific parent feeding behaviors by attempting to help parents manage stressors in their lives.

Humans consume CQAs in mg-to-gram quantities through dietary consumption of plant products. CQAs are considered beneficial for human health, mainly due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Recently, new biosynthetic pathways via a peroxidase-type p-coumaric acid 3-hydroxylase enzyme were discovered. More recently, a new GDSL lipase-like enzyme able to transform monoCQAs into diCQA was identified in Ipomoea batatas. CQAs were recently linked to memory improvement; they seem to be strong indirect antioxidants via Nrf2 activation. However, there is a prevalent confusion in the designation and nomenclature of different CQA isomers. Such inconsistencies are critical and complicate bioactivity assessment since different isomers differ in bioactivity and potency. A detailed explanation regarding the origin of such confusion is provided, and a recommendation to unify nomenclature is suggested. Furthermore, for studies on CQA bioactivity, plant-based laboratory animal diets contain CQAs, which makes it difficult to include proper control groups for comparison. Therefore, a synthetic diet free of CQAs is advised to avoid interferences since some CQAs may produce bioactivity even at nanomolar levels. Biotransformation of CQAs by gut microbiota, the discovery of new enzymatic biosynthetic and metabolic pathways, dietary assessment, and assessment of biological properties with potential for drug development are areas of active, ongoing research.

METHODS Dorsal diaphragmatic excursion (DDE) and ventral diaphragmatic excursion (VDE) were measured using anatomic M-mode ultrasonography of the right hemidiaphragm as PEEP was randomized to -6, -3, +3, and +6 cm H2O from baseline to achieve a positive transpulmonary pressure. Inter-operator variability of DDE was assessed in 10 separate subjects. RESULTS A total of 14 subjects ventilated for ARDS were enrolled. Subjects had a mean age of 54  12 y, mean P aO2 /F IO2 = 137  54 mm Hg, and mean sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score = 14  1). Transpulmonary pressure, DDE, and DDE/VDE ratio increased with incremental PEEP titration (-1.15 cm H2O vs 3.63 cm H2O, P < .001; 4.9 mm vs 8.2 mm, P < .001; and 62% vs 93%, P < .001, respectively). When transpulmonary pressure became positive, a visual increase in DDE and DDE/VDE ratio 0.60 to 0.93 was observed (from 0.48 cm to 0.82 cm, R 2 = 0.87, P = .02; and R 2 = 0.93, P = .006, respectively). There was high agreement in DDE measurements between 2 ultrasonographers (intra-class correlation 0.987, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS DDE was affected by incremental PEEP titration toward a positive transpulmonary pressure. The ultrasound assessment using anatomic M-mode allowed for specific measurement of regional diaphragmatic excursion. This pattern of motion in the dependent regions of the diaphragm during PEEP titration in subjects with ARDS achieving a positive transpulmonary pressure may reflect a potential target for future studies in the bedside assessment for lung recruitment.","output":"Ultrasound Assessment of Diaphragmatic Motion in Subjects With ARDS During Transpulmonary Pressure-Guided PEEP Titration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alternative care sites can provide essential overflow capacity for cities or regions whose health care systems are overtaxed by Covid-19, but their design and operation will vary depending on specific local needs.","output":"Alternative Care Sites for the Covid-19 Pandemic: The Early U.S. and U.K. Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new series of ethyl-(E)-4-(2-(2-arylidenehydrazinyl)-2-oxoethyl)piperazine-1-carboxylates (hydrazones) 4a-4e and 5a-5c were designed and synthesized from 1-ethoxycarbonylpiperazine.

Immunocompromised individuals are highly susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Whether vaccine-induced immunity in these individuals involves the oral cavity, a primary site of infection, is presently unknown. Methods. Immunocompromised individuals (n=404) and healthy controls (n=82) participated in a prospective clinical trial encompassing two doses of the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. Immunocompromised individuals included primary immunodeficiencies (PID) and secondary immunodeficiencies caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)/chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T), solid organ transplantation (SOT), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Saliva and serum samples were collected at four time points from the first vaccine dose until 2 weeks after second dose. SARS-CoV-2 spike specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses were quantified by a multiplex bead-based assay in saliva and correlated to paired serum IgG titers determined by Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay. Results. IgG responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike full-length trimeric glycoprotein (Spike-f) and S1 subunit in saliva in the HIV and HSCT/CAR-T groups were comparable to healthy controls. In contrast, PID, SOT, and CLL patients all displayed weaker responses which were mainly influenced by disease parameters or immunosuppressants. Salivary IgG levels strongly correlated with serum IgG titers on days 21 and 35 (rho=0.8079 and 0.7768, p=<0.0001).

The eConsult program manager provided billing information and provider reimbursement. A total of 548 eConsults were submitted to the gynecology service between July 2017 and June 2020 (4.5% of institutional eConsult volume). Ninety-five percent of the eConsults were completed by a senior specialist within our department. Abnormal pap smear management, abnormal uterine bleeding, and contraception questions were the most common queries. Over half (59.3%) of all inquiries were answered on the same day as they were received, with an average of 9% declined. Gynecology was the 10th largest eConsult provider at our institution in 2020. The present investigation describes one large university-based experience with eConsults in gynecology. Results demonstrate that eConsults permit appropriate, efficient triaging of time-sensitive conditions affecting patients especially in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. eConsult services provide the potential to improve access, interdisciplinary communication, and patient and provider satisfaction.","output":"Experiences in Electronic Consultation (eConsult) Service in Gynecology from a Quaternary Academic Medical Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) struck Pakistan with a magnitude that required micro- and macro-level adjustments at national and provincial levels. Access to medical consultation became a challenge; hospitals were flooded with cases beyond their capacity and transport was halted due to lockdown. Global Health Directorate of The Indus Health Network supported the provincial government by rolling out several walk-in community-based testing initiatives across Karachi. Results were conveyed to the patients through each district government. With a disproportionate rise in cases, an increasing delay in reporting results was observed. Methods: To help the district government bridge this gap, two physicians were engaged to convey timely results to patients who tested positive, through a helpline. Subsequently, proactive teleconsultation was initiated. We present a retrospective review of data collected during teleconsultation for COVID-19 cases identified through community-based testing between April 5 and June 10, 2020. Results: A total of 4,279 tests were conducted, revealing a 28% positivity rate (1,196 cases). Out of these, 752 (62.9%) baseline positive patients were contactable. Most patients identified either a close contact (46.8%) or a household contact (30.1%) as the source of infection. 41.8% patients were asymptomatic, 52.9% had mild to moderate illness, and 1.1% needed referral to the emergency department. 82.7% patients reported no comorbidities. Conclusion: The rapid surge of cases could not be handled by a small team and an institutional strategy of integration into an existing call center service was adopted. We share our insights to help develop evidence-based policies to effectively tackle current or future threats in similar settings.","output":"Proactive Teleconsultation for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Cases Identified Through the Community-Testing Initiative in Karachi, Pakistan: A Low-Cost Value-Added Service to Support a Pandemic Response in a Resource-Limited Setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remdesivir is an adenosine analogue drug that targets RNA dependent RNA polymerase enzyme and inhibits the viral replication. As on 22nd of October 2020, US FDA fully approved drug Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 patients who requires hospitalisation. Many clinical studies reported the derangement in hepatic and renal function tests which is alarming considering the health conditions of the COVID-19 patients. In view of these results, the present study was envisaged to review the safety of Remdesivir in COVID-19 patients. The PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases was searched using 'Remdesivir', 'veklury', 'SARS' and 'COVID' till 1st of December 2020. The studies included in this meta-analysis were either randomised or non-randomised studies that evaluated Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 against Placebo [standard of care]. The Adverse events [AEs], Serious adverse events [SAEs] and Treatment Discontinuation due to Adverse Events (TDAE) was used as primary outcome measures. The quality of studies was evaluated by using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessment of RoB. Data analysis was performed by two authors (MK & DB) using statistical software Review manager [Revman] version 5.3. The pooled Risk Ratios (RR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated by using a random-effects model for both primary and secondary outcomes. A total of four RCTs were included for the meta-analysis. Out of the four included clinical trials accepted for its methodological quality, three were of excellent quality and one study was of moderate quality. The pooled estimates of the three studies showed that Remdesivir had 24% lower risk of SAEs compared to placebo arm. However, the pooled estimates of two studies showed that 10 days of Remdesivir had 56% higher risk of SAEs compared to 5 days of Remdesivir regimen. Similarly, the 10 days of Remdesivir had two times higher risk of TDAEs compared to 5 days Remdesivir regimen. In conclusion, our meta-analysis demonstrated that Remdesivir is a safe therapeutic option. Our metanalysis revealed 5 days' regimen have better safety profile than 10 days' regimen of drug Remdesivir with respect to SAEs and TDAEs. For hospitalized patients, a 5-day course could be preferable with fewer safety concerns and lower drug costs.","output":"A Meta-Analysis of Safety of Different Regimens of Remdesivir in COVID-19 Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is increasingly common for secondary care to provide advice to primary care without an outpatient appointment.

In particular, it can considerably help to perform tasks like data clustering and classification. Recently, embedding methods have emerged as a promising direction for improving clustering accuracy. They can preserve the local structure and simultaneously reveal the global structure of data, thereby reasonably improving clustering performance. In this paper, we investigate how to improve the performance of several clustering algorithms using one of the most successful embedding techniques: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection or UMAP. This technique has recently been proposed as a manifold learning technique for dimensionality reduction. It is based on Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. Our main hypothesis is that UMAP would permit to find the best clusterable embedding manifold, and therefore, we applied it as a preprocessing step before performing clustering. We compare the results of many well-known clustering algorithms such ask-means, HDBSCAN, GMM and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering when they operate on the low-dimension feature space yielded by UMAP. A series of experiments on several image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method allows each of the clustering algorithms studied to improve its performance on each dataset considered. Based on Accuracy measure, the improvement can reach a remarkable rate of 60%.","output":"Considerably Improving Clustering Algorithms Using UMAP Dimensionality Reduction Technique: A Comparative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liver transplantation (LT) for patients with hepatitis D virus (HDV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection is uncommon in the United States.

In this paper, a framework called the Fused Attentive Generative Adversarial Networks(FA-GAN) is proposed to generate the super-resolution MR image from low-resolution magnetic resonance images, which can reduce the scanning time effectively but with high resolution MR images. In the framework of the FA-GAN, the local fusion feature block, consisting of different three-pass networks by using different convolution kernels, is proposed to extract image features at different scales. And the global feature fusion module, including the channel attention module, the self-attention module, and the fusion operation, is designed to enhance the important features of the MR image. Moreover, the spectral normalization process is introduced to make the discriminator network stable. 40 sets of 3D magnetic resonance images (each set of images contains 256 slices) are used to train the network, and 10 sets of images are used to test the proposed method. The experimental results show that the PSNR and SSIM values of the super-resolution magnetic resonance image generated by the proposed FA-GAN method are higher than the state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.","output":"FA-GAN: Fused Attentive Generative Adversarial Networks for MRI Image Super-Resolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Framers of the Sixth and Seventh Amendments to the United States Constitution recognized that jury trials were essential institutions for maintaining democratic legitimacy and avoiding epistemic crises. As an institution, the jury trial is purpose-built to engage citizens in the process of deliberative, participatory democracy with ground rules. The jury trial provides a carefully constructed setting aimed at sorting truth from falsehood.Despite its value, the jury trial has been under assault for decades. Concededly, jury trials can sometimes be inefficient, unreliable, unpredictable, and impractical. The Covid-19 pandemic rendered most physical jury trials unworkable but spurred some courts to begin using technology to transcend time-and-place limitations. These reforms inspire more profound changes.Rather than abolishing or cabining the jury trial, it should be reinvented with the benefit of modern science and technology. Features to be reconsidered include having local juries even for national civil cases, using unrepresentative groups of only six to twelve jurors, allowing attorneys to arbitrarily exclude jurors during voir dire, having synchronous and chronological presentations of cases over days or weeks, asking jurors to ignore inadmissible evidence and arguments that arise during live trials, and relying on secretive deliberations infected by implicit bias.Several of these extant practices work to disenfranchise or disempower Americans along racial, gender, and class lines, thereby undermining one of the jurys core functions. Other features cause jurors to err in resolving cases accurately, which can sometimes mean the difference between life and death. A reinvented, modernized jury institution can better serve its purposes by increasing citizen engagement;better fostering civic education and democratic deliberation;improving accuracy in sorting truth from falsehood;and enhancing efficiency in terms of both time and cost.","output":"The Jury Trial Reinvented"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study examined the influence of COVID-19 on the perception and behaviours of hygiene practices for food safety in South Korea. STUDY DESIGN: This study employed COVID-19 status (i.e. before or after the outbreak), gender and age groups as independent variables, and perceived relevance and behaviour frequency of hygiene practices for food safety as dependent variables. METHODS: Respondents were asked to answer questions about the perceived relevance and behaviour frequency of hygiene practices before and after the COVID-19 outbreak in an online survey with a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: Respondents perceived relevance and behaviour frequency of hygiene practices increased after the COVID-19 outbreak. This trend was seen in both genders and across all age groups. In addition, the enhanced perception that hygiene practices are related to food safety had a strong relationship with following hygiene practices. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that COVID-19 made people more aware of maintaining personal hygiene, leading to a noticeable change in the food safety environment, and subsequently prevention of viral transmission. In particular, the COVID-19 outbreak has influenced the communal eating culture by highlighting good hygiene practices, such as taking individual servings of food from communal dishes and using personal plates.","output":"COVID-19 impact on hygiene practices for food safety in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There are increasing reports of a pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that presents with varying clinical features, but includes features of Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome. Symptoms include fever, rash, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Many patients present without any respiratory symptoms and testing for SARS-CoV-2 is often negative. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed. RESULTS: A 7-year-old previously healthy male presented with 3 days of fevers up to 102.4F, headaches, abdominal pain, and intractable vomiting. Both parents had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 four weeks prior. Nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Echocardiogram was normal. CT venogram of his head was negative for any pathology. He developed severe neck pain and persistent headache during his hospitalization. Soon after receiving hydroxychloroquine, he developed a facial rash and altered mental status with episodes of aphasia, agitation, and pinpoint pupils. He then became unresponsive with left gaze deviation. A non-contrast head CT and CT angiography were negative. He was given levetiracetam and cefazolin and transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no epileptiform activity. Over the following 7 hours, the EEG demonstrated left frontotemporal slowing, which progressed into a loss of fast activity over the right hemisphere with increased delta activity in the left hemisphere, then abruptly changed to generalized voltage attenuation.He rapidly lost brainstem reflexes, developing fixed and dilated pupils. Repeat CT scan revealed diffuse cerebral edema with loss of gray-white differentiation. Lab results then were consistent with severe inflammation. An intracranial pressure monitor revealed pressures greater than 76 mmHg. His exam soon became consistent with brain death. Pathologic evaluation showed diffuse cerebral edema with perivascular mononuclear infiltrates. CONCLUSION: The cause of this pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome is unclear and the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the nervous system is unknown. Pediatric patients with COVID-19 and neurologic symptoms should be closely monitored as they can rapidly decline due to fulminant cerebral edema.","output":"Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome With Fatal Cerebral Edema in a Patient With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 crisis has highlighted innovative high-frequency dataset allowing to measure in real-time the economic impact. In this vein, we explore how satellite data measuring the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2, a pollutant emitted mainly by industrial activity) in the troposphere can help predict industrial production. We first show how such data must be adjusted for meteorological patterns which can alter data quality and pollutant emissions. We use machine learning techniques to better account for non-linearities and interactions between variables. We then find evidence that nowcasting performances for monthly industrial production are significantly improved when relying on daily NO2 data compared to benchmark models based on PMIs and auto-regressive (AR) terms. We also find evidence of heterogeneities suggesting that the contribution of daily pollution data is particularly important during crisis episodes and that the elasticity of NO2 pollution to industrial production for a country depends on the share of manufacturing in the value added.

Many health professionals and organizations have undertaken injury mitigation strategies to prevent sport injuries through protective equipment, training protocols, and a host of other evidence-based practices. Many of these specialized training methods were disrupted due to protocols to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This research examines the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to the prevalence of athletic injuries in the National Football League (NFL). OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, NFL teams and athletes across all levels of sport were reported to have reduced training in preparation for their seasons due to protocols to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This study compares the prevalence of injury during the 2018, 2019, and 2020 NFL seasons, with the aim to determine the potential causes of the differences in injury prevalence. METHODS: Official injury reports from each team were counted during the 17-week regular season of each year (2018, 2019, and 2020). The data were analyzed using an unpaired t test to compare the injury prevalence between each of the three seasons. RESULTS: The 2018 season produced a total of 1561 injuries and a mean of 48.8 injuries per team. The 2019 season produced a total of 1897 injuries and a mean of 59.3 injuries per team, while the 2020 season produced a total of 2484 injuries and a mean of 77.6 injuries per team. An unpaired t test was performed using the data to compare the mean number of injuries per team during each of the seasons. Comparison of the 2020 season against the 2019 season showed a statistically significant difference (P<.001); comparison of the 2020 season to the 2018 season found a statistically significant difference (P<.001); and comparison between the 2019 and the 2018 seasons found a statistically significant difference (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Although the 2019 and 2018 seasons showed a statistically significant difference (P=.03), this difference is not as large when we compare the 2020 seasons versus the 2019 (P<.001) and 2018 (P<.001) seasons. The astronomical increase in injury prevalence during the 2020 season over the previous years raises the possibility that there was a reduced physiological adaptation to stress, due to the limited amount of training as a result of the closure of practice facilities in order to slow the spread of COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 Return to Sport: NFL Injury Prevalence Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic. A classifier combining chest X-ray (CXR) with clinical features may serve as a rapid screening approach. Methods: The study included 512 patients with COVID-19 and 106 with influenza A/B pneumonia. A deep neural network (DNN) was applied, and deep features derived from CXR and clinical findings formed fused features for diagnosis prediction. Results: The clinical features of COVID-19 and influenza showed different patterns. Patients with COVID-19 experienced less fever, more diarrhea, and more salient hypercoagulability. Classifiers constructed using the clinical features or CXR had an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.909 and 0.919, respectively. The diagnostic efficacy of the classifier combining the clinical features and CXR was dramatically improved and the AUC was 0.952 with 91.5% sensitivity and 81.2% specificity. Moreover, combined classifier was functional in both severe and non-serve COVID-19, with an AUC of 0.971 with 96.9% sensitivity in non-severe cases, which was on par with the computed tomography (CT)-based classifier, but had relatively inferior efficacy in severe cases compared to CT. In extension, we performed a reader study involving three experienced pulmonary physicians, artificial intelligence (AI) system demonstrated superiority in turn-around time and diagnostic accuracy compared with experienced pulmonary physicians.

The ongoing changes in population demographics increase the relevance of dignified aging across Europe. Community-based health care (CBHC) organizations are necessary to provide sustainable strategies for organizing care for older persons in need of support. To support the digitalization of these organizations, new business models and suitable web platforms are necessary. OBJECTIVE: This study, which is part of the European Active and Assisted Living (AAL) project called ICareCoops, aimed to explore concepts, approaches, and workflows of CBHC organizations to achieve a comprehensive understanding of extant services offered and relevant requirements to support these services with information and computer technology (ICT) solutions. METHODS: A qualitative study with six focus groups (FGs) with 40 participants was conducted in Switzerland and Slovenia to identify potential stakeholders needs and requirements for the user-centered development of a web platform. Data were collected from three different stakeholder groups: (1) older persons in need of support as care receivers, (2) significant others of older persons in need of support, and (3) managers or care providers of CBHC organizations. A semistructured interview guide with open questions was used for data collection. FG sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze the content of the FG sessions. To assist with further web platform development, the responses of the FG participants were translated into user stories to describe technical requirements. RESULTS: By analyzing the transcripts, five main categories were identified: (1) ICT usage behavior of users, (2) challenges of web platform usage, (3) content and technical requirements for the web platform, (4) form and services of CBHC organizations, and (5) rationales of CBHC organizations. The main issues identified were the need for seniors to have individual contact with the CBHC organization and the possibility to coordinate routine services via the web platform, such as ordering meals-on-wheels or booking a caregiver to accompany an older person to the doctor. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of participants showed a lack of familiarity with the usage of ICT. Nevertheless, they were open-minded regarding web platform usage to facilitate workflows and to benefit CBHC organizations. Cooperatives as an organizational model demonstrate a high potential to address users needs. Therefore, the web platform offers an essential tool for innovative health care models in the future. Searching for care services, contacting care providers, and communicating with care providers was preferred via personal contact and seemed to be the key element for user acceptance and for the successful implementation of a web platform like ICareCoops to support CBHC organizations.","output":"User-Centered Development of a Web Platform Supporting Community-Based Health Care Organizations for Older Persons in Need of Support: Qualitative Focus Group Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The model organism Drosophila melanogaster was increasingly applied in nutrition research in recent years.

In the second part, the practical application of the phenotyping of flies is demonstrated via a discussion of obese phenotypes in response to high-sugar diet (HSD) and high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. HSD feeding and HFD feeding are dietary interventions that lead to an increase in fat storage and affect carbohydrate-insulin homeostasis, lifespan, locomotor activity, reproductive capacity and stress tolerance. Furthermore, studies regarding the impacts of HSD and HFD on the transcriptome and metabolome of D. melanogaster are important for relating phenotypic changes to underlying molecular mechanisms.

The putative viral-induced inhibition of ACE2 could result in the defective degradation of bradykinin, a potent inflammatory substance. We hypothesize that increased bradykinin in the lungs is an important mechanism driving the development of pneumonia and respiratory failure in COVID-19. METHODS: This is a phase II, single-center, three-armed parallel-group, open-label, active control superiority randomized clinical trial. One hundred eighty eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either the inhibitor of C1e/kallikrein 20 U/kg intravenously on day 1 and day 4 plus standard care; or icatibant 30 mg subcutaneously, three doses/day for 4 days plus standard care; or standard care alone, as recommended in the clinical trials published to date, which includes supplemental oxygen, non-invasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, prophylactic antithrombotic therapy, vasopressor support, and renal replacement therapy. DISCUSSION: Accumulation of bradykinin in the lungs is a common side effect of ACE inhibitors leading to cough. In animal models, the inactivation of ACE2 leads to severe acute pneumonitis in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the inhibition of bradykinin almost completely restores the lung structure. We believe that inhibition of bradykinin in severe COVID-19 patients could reduce the lung inflammatory response, impacting positively on the severity of disease and mortality rates.

We report how a decision might be reached and reported on, to include or exclude these participants. We illustrate using a motivating scenario from the BREATHE trial (Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02426112) evaluating azithromycin for the treatment of chronic lung disease in people aged 6-19 years with HIV in Zimbabwe and Malawi. KEY POINTS: Including all enrolled and randomised participants in the primary analysis of a trial ensures an unbiased estimate of the intervention effect using intention-to-treat principles, and minimises the effects of confounding through balanced allocation to trial arm. Ineligible participants are sometimes enrolled, due to measurement or human error. Of 347 participants enrolled into the BREATHE trial, 11 (3.2%) were subsequently found to be ineligible based on lung function criteria. We assumed no safety risk of azithromycin treatment; their inclusion in the trial and subsequent analysis of the intervention effect therefore mirrors clinical practice. Senior trial investigators considered diurnal variations in the measurement of lung function, advantages of retaining a higher sample size and advice from the Data Safety and Monitoring Board and Trial Steering Committee, and decided to include these participants in primary analysis. We planned and reported analyses including and excluding these participants, and in our case the interpretation of treatment effect was consistent. CONCLUSION: The decision, by senior investigators, on whether to exclude enrolled participants, should reflect issues of safety, treatment efficacy, statistical power and measurement error. As long as decisions are made prior to finalising the statistical analysis plan for the trial, the risk of exclusions creating bias should be minimal. The decision taken should be transparently reported and a sensitivity analysis can present the opposite decision.","output":"Exclusion of enrolled participants in randomised controlled trials: what to do with ineligible participants?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lymphedema (LE) affects millions of people worldwide. It is a chronic progressive disease with massive development of fibrosclerosis when untreated. There is no pharmacological treatment of lymphedema. The disease is associated with swelling of the interstitium of the affected organ, mostly arm or leg, impressive development of adipose tissue, fibrosis and sclerosis with accumulation of huge amounts of collagen, and Papillomatosis cutis. Malnutrition and reduced oxygenation of the affected tissues is a hallmark of lymphedema. Here, we investigated if the hypoxia of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) might contribute to fibrosis. We applied RNASeq and qPCR to study the concordant changes of the exome of three human foreskin-derived LEC isolates after 4 days of hypoxia (1% O(2)) vs. normoxia (21% O(2)). Of the approximately 16,000 genes expressed in LECs, 162 (1%) were up- or down-regulated by hypoxia. Of these, 21 genes have important functions in the production or modification of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In addition to the down-regulation of elastin, we found up-regulation of druggable enzymes and regulators such as the long non-coding RNA H19, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain family member 5 (ITIH5), lysyl-oxidase (LOX), prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 1 (P4HA1), procollagen-lysine 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2 (PLOD2), and others that are discussed in the paper.

METHODS: This is a qualitative content analysis at a university hospital in Riyadh, KSA. Since May 15th, 2020, due to the pandemic, our PICU utilized Zoom? as a remote conferencing App, instead of face-to-face handover. After the IRB approval, data were collected over two weeks (July 1-14th, 2020) through an online structured questionnaire. Demographic data and open-ended questions about the perceived efficacy of the remote handover were collected. The analysis process included open coding, creating categories, and abstraction.

Radiomics features were extracted from chest CT of the patients. The data of the cohort were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets using a 7:1:2 ratio. A ML pipeline consisting of a model to predict severity and time-to-event model to predict progression to critical illness were trained on radiomics features and clinical variables. The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC), concordance index (C-index), and time-dependent ROC-AUC were calculated to determine model performance, which was compared with consensus CT severity scores obtained by visual interpretation by radiologists. RESULTS: Among 981 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 274 patients developed critical illness. Radiomics features and clinical variables resulted in the best performance for the prediction of disease severity with a highest test ROC-AUC of 0.76 compared with 0.70 (0.76 vs. 0.70, p = 0.023) for visual CT severity score and clinical variables.

METHODS: A literature review was performed in the PubMed/Medline database, Scopus, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Academic Search Complete, Google Scholar, and CINAHL databases using the keywords COVID-19; phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors; cytokine storm; respiratory distress. RESULTS: Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, still no drugs are validated to have significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in large-scale studies. While the progress toward a curative agent and/or vaccine is certainly hopeful, the principal limiting factor in such public health emergencies is always the time. Therefore, a preexisting licensed therapeutic(s) might offer a reprieve to the healthcare systems operating at the edge of capacity. In this context, the innovation of oral PDE5 inhibitors with their valuable effects on erection have provided a breakthrough in the treatment of erectile dysfunction and opened new fields of clinical application for this class of drugs. Oral PDE5 inhibitors have been demonstrated to possess many beneficial useful additional implications with acknowledged anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immune response regulation, and antiapoptotic properties. These properties have been elucidated through the nitric oxide/soluble guanylyl cyclase/cyclic guanylate monophosphate pathway in addition to the emerged hemeoxygenase-1 enzyme as well as hydrogen sulfide pathways. These properties could support repurposing oral PDE5 inhibitors' potential adjuvant use in targeting different aspects of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Oral PDE5 inhibitors retain several acknowledged off-labeled useful implications with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immune response regulation, and antiapoptotic properties. These properties may support repurposing oral PDE5 inhibitors' potential adjuvant use in the protocols combating COVID-19 manifestations. Mostafa T.

The virus was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and continues to be endemic in the region. Most of the initial MERS-CoV cases in 2012 and early 2013 were sporadic, and it remains unclear whether MERS-CoV was circulating before 2012 or not. Therefore, we tried here to find any molecular evidence of MERS-CoV circulation in humans before or during 2012 in the city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODOLOGY We examined 349 archived respiratory samples collected between January 2010 and December 2012 from patients with acute respiratory illnesses from the city of Jeddah in Western Saudi Arabia. All samples were screened for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR targeting the upstream E-gene (UpE) and the open reading frame 1 a (ORF1a). RESULTS All tested samples which were originally found negative for influenza A H1N1 virus were also found to be negative for MERS-CoV.

The only thing certain about this strain, with a large number of mutations in the spike protein, is that it spreads quickly, seems to evade immune defense, and mitigates the benefits of existing vaccines. Based on the ultra-large-scale ab initio computational modeling of the receptor binding motif (RBM) and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) interface, we provide the details of the effect of Omicron mutations at the fundamental atomic scale level. In-depth analysis anchored in the novel concept of amino acid-amino acid bond pair units (AABPU) indicates that mutations in the Omicron variant are connected with (i) significant changes in the shape and structure of AABPU components, together with (ii) significant increase in the positive partial charge, which facilitates the interaction with ACE2. We have identified changes in bonding due to mutations in the RBM. The calculated bond order, based on AABPU, reveals that the Omicron mutations increase the binding strength of RBM to ACE2.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore psychiatrists opinions about the potential impact innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice METHODS: In Spring 2019, we conducted a web-based survey of 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries worldwide. The survey measured opinions about the likelihood future technology would fully replace physicians in performing ten key psychiatric tasks. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (comments) to three open-ended questions in the survey. RESULTS: Comments were classified into four major categories in relation to the impact of future technology on: (1) patient-psychiatrist interactions; (2) the quality of patient medical care; (3) the profession of psychiatry; and (4) health systems. Overwhelmingly, psychiatrists were skeptical that technology could replace human empathy. Many predicted that man and machine would increasingly collaborate in undertaking clinical decisions, with mixed opinions about the benefits and harms of such an arrangement. Participants were optimistic that technology might improve efficiencies and access to care, and reduce costs. Ethical and regulatory considerations received limited attention.

METHODS: Between February 15, 2011 and January 18, 2012, 371 pediatric patients with CAP were enrolled at Beijing Children's Hospital. Sixteen respiratory viruses and two bacteria were detected from tracheal aspirate specimens using commercially available multiplex real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) kits. RESULTS: A single viral pathogen was detected in 35.3% of enrolled patients, multiple viruses in 11.6%, and virus/bacteria coinfection in 17.8%. In contrast, only 6.5% of patients had a single bacterial pathogen and 2.2% were infected with multiple bacteria. The etiological agent was unknown for 26.7% of patients. The most common viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (43.9%), rhinovirus (14.8%), parain?uenza virus (9.4%), and adenovirus (8.6%). In patients under three years of age, RSV (44.6%), rhinovirus (12.8%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.9%) were the most frequent pathogens. In children aged 3C7 years, S. pneumoniae (38.9%), RSV (30.6%), Haemophilus in?uenzae (19.4%), and adenovirus (19.4%) were most prevalent. Finally in children over seven years, RSV (47.3%), S. pneumoniae (41.9%), and rhinovirus (21.5%) infections were most frequent.

We found that the distribution of Wuhans migrants is centred in Hubei Province (approximately 75%) at a provincial level, gradually decreasing in the surrounding provinces in layers, with obvious spatial characteristics of circle layers and echelons. The scale of Wuhans migrants, whose origins in Hubei Province give rise to a gradient reduction from east to west within the province, and account for 66% of Wuhans total migrants, are from the surrounding prefectural-level cities of Wuhan. The distribution comprises 94 districts and counties in Hubei Province, and the cumulative percentage of the top 30 districts and counties exceeds 80%. Wuhans migrants have a large proportion of middle-aged and high-risk individuals. Their social characteristics include nuclear family migration (84%), migration with families of 3C4 members (71%), a rural household registration (85%), and working or doing business (84%) as the main reason for migration. Using a quasi-experimental analysis framework, we found that the size of Wuhans migrants was highly correlated with the daily number of confirmed cases. Furthermore, we compared the epidemic situation in different regions and found that the number of confirmed cases in some provinces and cities in Hubei Province may be underestimated, while the epidemic situation in some regions has increased rapidly.

Spiders are riveting animal biomarkers for evaluating Cd-induced toxicity, yet the effects of long-term Cd toxicity on spider reproductive function and its underlying mechanism remain unclear. In the present study, we found that Cd exposure impaired the antioxidant enzyme system in the wolf spider Pardosa pseudoannulata and decreased the concentration of four antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidase) (p < 0.05). The content of vitellogenin and the number of hatched spiderlings were also dramatically reduced under Cd stress (p < 0.05), indicating that Cd stress could vitiate the fecundity of P. pseudoannulata. Moreover, a total of 10,511 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 391 proteins (DEPs) were yielded from the ovarian transcriptome and proteome, and a mass of genes and proteins involved in protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were significantly down-regulated. DEGs and DEPs directly encoding the antioxidant enzyme system and/or vitellogenesis were also distinctively down-regulated.

The aim of this prospective case-controlled study was to assess the feasibility, safety, and cost of day case robotic ventral rectopexy compared with routine day case laparoscopic ventral rectopexy. METHODS Between February 28, 2014 and March 3, 2015, 20 consecutive patients underwent day case laparoscopic ventral rectopexy for total rectal prolapse or deep enterocele at Michallon University Hospital, Grenoble. Patients were selected for day case surgery on the basis of motivation, favorable social circumstances, and general fitness. One out of every two patients underwent the robotic procedure (n = 10). Demographics, technical results, and costs were compared between both groups. RESULTS Patients from both groups were comparable in terms of demographics and technical results.

The time after vaccination in IgG seronegative PLWH was significantly longer compared with PLWH with IgG seropositive (43.38  34.96 vs 30.27  20.12 days, P=0.005). In PLWH with IgG seropositivity, CD4+ T cell counts before antiretroviral therapy (ART) (P=0.015) and at IgG detection (P<0.001) were higher. Multivariable analysis indicated CD4+ T cells at IgG detection (OR=1.004, P=0.006) and time after vaccination (OR=0.977, P=0.014) were independently associated with humoral response in PLWH after vaccination. Neutralizing antibody (NeuAb) titers in PLWH against wild type SARS-CoV-2 were similar compared with the Control group (P=0.160). The proportion of seropositive NeuAb against wild type SARS-CoV-2 were also similar (95% in Control group vs 97% in PLWH group, P=0.665). Similar results were obtained when NeuAb were detected against the delta variants with similar titers (P=0.355) and with similar proportion of humoral response (P=0.588). All side effects observed in our study were mild and self-limiting. There was no significant difference in occurrence of side effects in the control and PLWH groups.

Many of these critical minerals are found in the deep seabed, the only place on earth where mineral resources have not been exploited yet. There is a strong need to ensure that these critical minerals will be extracted in a sustainable way, verifying the protection of the marine environment and biodiversity. The regulatory, financial and engineering challenges for deep sea mining are considerable, but in fact are not considered prohibitive, taking into account the remarkable achievements in recent years. On the other hand, it is evident that the existing modern ecosystem-based management approaches cannot be applied to deep sea areas without detailed knowledge of the individual species and ecosystems;most of the species living on the deep-sea floor remain unknown up until now. There is a need for the development of a new environmental management approach for each specific area.

The impact of the pandemic on illicit drug market remains scant. We expose the potential consequences the COVID-19 pandemic could have on the ability of people who use drugs to source their illicit drugs via cryptomarkets. METHODS: We analyzed 262 self-reported submissions of illicit drug transactions on the darkweb. The self-reports include the date of the transaction, the types of illicit drugs bought/sold, and whether the shipment of the illicit drugs succeeded, had issues (ex. unusually long delivery, an error in the type of drug shipped, quantity or concentration of the drug), or failed. RESULTS: Between January 1st, 2020 and March 21, 2020, successful deliveries represented 60% to 100% of transactions. Starting on March 21 however, the share of shipments that had issues or failed increased rapidly and represented a majority of all shipments. At the peak of the market disruption, the successful deliveries represented only 21% of all transactions. CONCLUSION: Illicit drug transactions on the darkweb were disrupted at the same time as lockdowns were put in place in the United States and in the United Kingdom. While no causation link can be established, the correlation suggests that lockdowns could have disrupted drug cryptomarkets activities. We discuss the market disruption in light of the literature.","output":"Preliminary findings of the impact of COVID-19 on drugs crypto markets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global initiatives to improve environmental sustainability have centered on reducing energy consumption and developing technological solutions for greener power generation. Current insights on innovations for environmental sustainability are primarily from developed countries, with limited studies originating from developing countries. This study focuses on solar paver technology, a potential innovation for sustainable generation of power. The interest in this technology lies in its dual-purpose ability to enable both functional road surfaces and the use of solar roadways that can generate electricity to power other road infrastructure such as electric lights. To maximize the potential of success of deployment of solar pavers, it is important to investigate the practicalities of solar pavers and understand the perceptions of stakeholders that will be responsible for the implementation of solar pavers. This research addresses this gap in knowledge. Thirty construction industry stakeholders in Malaysia were interviewed through focus group discussions and interviews. This study applied the diffusion of innovation theory to develop an understanding of the nuances of solar pavers. The findings identified three superordinate categories (motivation, opportunity, and ability) and nine categories (compliance with green initiatives, promote corporate social responsibility, dual functionality, financial incentives, sunny climate, increased environmental awareness, green experience, experts network and familiarity with solar technology) as the key enablers. Key barriers constitute two superordinate categories (challenges and weaknesses) and ten categories (reluctant authority, vandalism, complexity of installation and maintenance, high humidity and rainfall, negative environmental impact, high cost, design flaws, low efficiency, questionable practicality, and better comparative opportunities). There is an acceptance of solar pavers by the stakeholders and cost and ownership structures are the key to the deployment. The findings provide fresh insights into a new form of sustainable solar paver engendering new streams of research in construction engineering and technology management. Implications for management and organizational research are discussed.","output":"Key enablers and barriers of solar paver technologies for the advancement of environmental sustainability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES. To present a methodology for the simultaneous setting of quantitative targets that reflect both an improvement in the national average of an indicator for Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3), as well as a reduction in its geographic inequality. METHODS. A five-step algorithm was developed: (a) calculate the national average annual percent change (AAPC) for an SDG3 indicator; (b) normatively define geographic strata from the subnational distribution of the indicator in a baseline year; (c) apply a proportional progressivity criterion to the AAPC to project the stratum-specific indicator value for the target year; (d) set the national target as the weighted average of the indicator in the subnational territorial units for the target year; and (e) set the inequality reduction targets by calculating the absolute and relative gaps between the bottom and top strata for the target year. RESULTS. The algorithm was applied to SDG indicator 3.1.1 (maternal mortality ratio, MMR), disaggregated by Guatemalas 22 departments at the baseline year 2014 (MMR = 113 per 100,000 live births). By sustaining the AAPC rate attained from 2009 to 2014 (-4.3%) and focalizing its actions with territorial progressivity, by 2030 the country could reduce its MMR to 53 per 100,000 and its absolute and relative inequality gaps by 72% and 48%, respectively.

Here, we report an efficient computational approach, including the simple energy minimizations and binding free energy calculations, starting from an experimental structure of the binding complex along with experimental calibration of the calculated binding free energies, to rapidly and reliably predict the binding affinities of the N501Y mutant with human ACE2 (hACE2) and recently reported miniprotein and hACE2 decoy (CTC-445.2) drug candidates.

The miniproteins are predicted to have a??10,000- to 100,000-fold diminished binding affinities with the N501Y mutant, creating a need for design of novel therapeutic candidates to overcome the N501Y mutation-induced drug resistance. The N501Y mutation is also predicted to decrease the binding affinity of a hACE2 decoy (CTC-445.2) binding with the spike protein by a??200-fold.

Kriging interpolation was used to get the clustering distribution of air quality and fluctuation in China, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to analyze the main factors affecting the clustering results. The results show that: (1) Most areas in China are low-value regions, while the high-value region is the smallest and more concentrated. Air quality in northern China is worse, and the annual fluctuations of the indicators are more dramatic. (2) Compared with AQI, AQFI has a strong indication significance for the comprehensive situation of air quality and its fluctuation.

The current COVID-19 pandemic poses a challenge to nursing staff, who are in a key position to provide high-quality palliative care for people with dementia and their families. OBJECTIVE: To formulate practice recommendations for nursing staff with regard to providing palliative dementia care in times of COVID-19. DESIGN AND METHOD: A rapid scoping review following guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Eligible papers focused on COVID-19 in combination with palliative care for older people or people with dementia and informed practical nursing recommendations for long-term care facilities. After data extraction, we formulated recommendations covering essential domains in palliative care adapted from the National Consensus Project's Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care. DATA SOURCES: We searched the bibliographic databases of PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO for academic publications. We searched for grey literature using the search engine Google. Moreover, we included relevant letters and editorials, guidelines, web articles and policy papers published by knowledge and professional institutes or associations in dementia and palliative care. RESULTS: In total, 23 documents (7 (special) articles in peer-reviewed journals, 6 guides, 4 letters to editors, 2 web articles (blogs), 2 reports, a correspondence paper and a position paper) were included. The highest number of papers informed recommendations under the domains 'advance care planning' and 'psychological aspects of care'. The lowest number of papers informed the domains 'ethical care', 'care of the dying', 'spiritual care' and 'bereavement care'. We found no papers that informed the 'cultural aspects of care' domain. CONCLUSION: Literature that focuses specifically on palliative care for people with dementia in long-term care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic is still largely lacking. Particular challenges that need addressing involve care of the dying and the bereaved, and ethical, cultural and spiritual aspects of care. Moreover, we must acknowledge grief and moral distress among nursing staff. Nursing leadership is needed to safeguard the quality of care and nursing staff should work together within an interprofessional care team to initiate advance care planning conversations in a timely manner, to review and document advance care plans, and to adapt goals of care as they may change due to the COVID-19 situation.

However, it is unknown whether these risk factors differ between women and men. METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched to identify studies assessing the risk of psychological factors for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in samples with IHD. Psychological factors included anger/hostility, anxiety, depression, psychological distress, social support, Type A behavior pattern, Type D personality, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). RESULTS A total of 44 articles (64 separate reports) including 227,647 women and 321,894 men reporting confounder-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) or relative risks (RRs) were included in the primary analysis. Results based on random-effects models showed that the association between psychological factors (all combined) and MACE was stronger in men (n = 321,236; 57 reports; HR = 1.37, 95%CI 1.27-1.48) than in women (n = 226,886; 56 reports; HR = 1.21, 95%CI 1.12-1.30; p = .017). A subset of the studies focusing on women showed significant associations between anger/hostility, depression, and distress with MACE. For men, statistically significant associations were found for anxiety, depression, and distress with MACE. CONCLUSIONS Psychological factors are associated with MACE in samples with IHD in both women and men, with a small, but significant higher risk for men.

In some clinical conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), inflammation functions as a double-edged sword by either enabling or inhibiting cancer development and progression. Generally, cancer develops through evasion mechanisms that regulate cell growth, causing a high rate of uncontrolled proliferation, and mechanisms for evading cell death, such as apoptosis. Moreover, chronic inflammation is a factor that contributes to colorectal cancer (CRC), as observed in individuals with IBD; all these conditions favor an increased rate of angiogenesis and eventual metastasis. Lactoferrin (Lf) is a mammalian iron-binding multifunctional glycoprotein regarded as a natural compound that up- and downregulates both humoral and cellular components of immunity involved in regulating the inflammatory response and maintaining gut homeostasis.

Bovine Lf from milk is considered a safe molecule and is commercially available in large quantities. This review mainly focuses on the regulatory effects of orally administered bovine Lf on the inflammatory response associated with CRC; this approach indicates that CRC is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers and affects the intestinal tract with high clinical and epidemiologic relevance.

Over the past few years, the world has seen several outbreaks caused by viral diseases that for a long time seemed to possess no risk. These are diseases that have been forgotten for a long time and, until nowadays, there are no approved drugs or vaccines, leading the pharmaceutical industry and several research groups to run out of time in the search for new pharmacological treatments or prevention methods. In this context, drug repurposing proves to be a fast and economically viable technique, considering the fact that it uses drugs that have a well-established safety profile. Thus, in this review, we present the main advances in drug repurposing and their benefit for searching new treatments against emerging viral diseases. METHODS: We conducted a search in the bibliographic databases (Science Direct, Bentham Science, PubMed, Springer, ACS Publisher, Wiley, and NIH's COVID-19 Portfolio) using the keywords 'drug repurposing', 'emerging viral infections' and each of the diseases reported here (CoV; ZIKV; DENV; CHIKV; EBOV and MARV) as an inclusion/exclusion criterion. A subjective analysis was performed regarding the quality of the works for inclusion in this manuscript. Thus, the selected works were those that presented drugs repositioned against the emerging viral diseases presented here by means of computational, high-throughput screening or phenotype-based strategies, with no time limit and of relevant scientific value. RESULTS: 291 papers were selected, 24 of which were CHIKV; 52 for ZIKV; 43 for DENV; 35 for EBOV; 10 for MARV; and 56 for CoV and the rest (72 papers) related to the drugs repurposing and emerging viral diseases. Among CoV-related articles, most were published in 2020 (31 papers), updating the current topic. Besides, between the years 2003 - 2005, 10 articles were created, and from 2011 - 2015 there were 7 articles, portraying the outbreaks that occurred at that time. For ZIKV, similar to CoV, most publications were during the period of outbreaks between the years 2016 - 2017 (23 articles). Similarly, most CHIKV (13 papers) and DENV (14 papers) publications occur at the same time interval. For EBOV (13 papers) and MARV (4 papers), they were between the years 2015 - 2016. Through this review, several drugs were highlighted that can be evolved in vivo and clinical trials as possible used against these pathogens showed that remdesivir represent potential treatments against CoV. Furthermore, ribavirin may also be a potential treatment against CHIKV; sofosbuvir against ZIKV; celgosivir against DENV, and favipiravir against EBOV and MARV, representing new hopes against these pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: The conclusions of this review manuscript show the potential of the drug repurposing strategy in the discovery of new pharmaceutical products, as from this approach, drugs that could be used against emerging viral diseases. Thus, this strategy deserves more attention among research groups and is a promising approach to the discovery of new drugs against emerging viral diseases and also other diseases.","output":"Drug Repurposing: A Strategy for Discovering Inhibitors against Emerging Viral Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, and rapidly spread throughout China. Patients with mild symptoms were admitted to Fangcang shelter hospitals for centralized quarantine. We aimed to clarify the medication usage, related adverse reactions, and pharmaceutical interventions in patients with mild COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We innovatively carried out targeted pharmacy services. We provided online and off-line pharmaceutical services to patients in the Fangcang shelter hospital. The use of medication, related adverse reactions, and the effects of pharmaceutical intervention were analyzed. RESULTS: Lower blood lymphocyte count was proposed as the most significant risk factor in patients with mild illness. All patients received antiviral treatment (arbidol, oseltamivir, and ribavirin); 78.4% of patients received antibiotic therapy (moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and cefdinir); patients in the moderate disease group received more antibiotic therapy than those in the mild disease group. Most of the patients were treated with traditional Chinese medicine. Patients with moderate disease preferred to receive sedative hypnotic therapy. Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, arrhythmia, and constipation were the most common adverse reactions. The rate of mild-to-moderate illness in the pharmaceutical intervention and non-intervention groups was 20.6% and 31.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Most patients with mild illness were treated with antiviral, antibiotic, and Chinese medicine therapy. However, attention should be paid to patients with mild illness presenting with hypertension and low lymphocyte count at the onset; these patients are more likely to develop moderate or severe disease. Moreover, there were many drug-related problems in Fangcang shelter hospital; pharmaceutical care might contribute to alleviate the progress of the patients condition. Pharmacists should be prepared to provide skilled and effective services to patients, with the aim to ensure medication safety and promote the overall control of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Analysis of Influencing Factors and Pharmaceutical Care of Patients with COVID-19 in Fangcang Shelter Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about massive declines in wellbeing around the world. This paper seeks to quantify and compare two important components of those losses C increased mortality and higher poverty C using years of human life as a common metric. We estimate that almost 20 million life-years were lost to Covid-19 by December 2020. Over the same period and by the most conservative definition, over 120 million additional years were spent in poverty because of the pandemic. The mortality burden, whether estimated in lives or in years of life lost, increases sharply with GDP per capita. The poverty burden, on the contrary, declines with per capita national incomes when a constant absolute poverty line is used, or is uncorrelated with national incomes when a more relative approach is taken to poverty lines. In both cases the poverty burden of the pandemic, relative to the mortality burden, is much higher for poor countries. The distribution of aggregate welfare losses C combining mortality and poverty and expressed in terms of life-years C depends both on the choice of poverty line(s) and on the relative weights placed on mortality and poverty. With a constant absolute poverty line and a relatively low welfare weight on mortality, poorer countries are found to bear a greater welfare loss from the pandemic. When poverty lines are set differently for poor, middle and high-income countries and/or a greater welfare weight is placed on mortality, upper-middle and rich countries suffer the most.","output":"Death and Destitution: The Global Distribution of Welfare Losses from the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate the relationship between novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) and kidney injury Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on COVID-19 confirmed patients in the Central Theater Command General Hospital of Chinese PLA on March 12, 2020 A total of 87 hospitalized COVID-19 confirmed patients were enrolled in the study, and they were hospitalized at least one week The recorded information included clinical data and indicators of kidney-related laboratory tests Results: The average age of patients was (65 2+/-17 1) years, and 34 5% (30/87) patients were &gt;/= 75 years old and 31 0% (27/87) patients were 60~74 years old Male and female patients accounted for 59 8% (52/87) and 40 2% (35/87), respectively There were 29 9% (26/87) and 12 6% (11/87) patients who had already showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) at admission Moreover, 25 3% (22/87) and 4 6% (4/87) patients still exhibited mild elevation of BUN and SCr one week after admission However, 28 7% (25/87) patients showed an elevation of BUN one week later after admission, though their BUN levels were normal at admission Likewise, 16 1% (14/87) patients showed an elevation of SCr one week later after admission, while their SCr levels were normal at admission Only two patients had an increase of SCr &gt;/=26 5 mumol/L, and both of them were over 75 years old Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with severe acute kidney injury are uncommon However, attention should be paid to acute kidney injury of the elderly patients in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19","output":"[Clinical analysis of kidney injury in patients with COVID-19]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increasing use of thermoluminescence (TL) materials as radiation detectors with application in different areas of ionizing radiation has motivated research on new materials with adequate luminescent characteristics.

Theoretical frameworks for resource allocation have provided much needed ethical guidance but hospitals still need to address objective practicalities and legal vetting to operationalize scarce resource allocation schemata. To develop operational scarce resource allocation processes for public health catastrophes, including the COVID-19 pandemic, five health systems in Maryland formed a consortium - with diverse expertise and representation - representing more than half of all hospitals in the state. Our efforts built on a prior statewide community engagement process, which determined the values and moral reference points of citizens and healthcare professionals regarding the allocation of ventilators during a public health catastrophe. Through a partnership of health systems, we developed a scarce resource allocation framework informed by citizens' values and by general expert consensus. Allocation schema for mechanical ventilators, intensive care unit resources, blood components, novel therapeutics, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and renal replacement therapies were developed. Creating operational algorithms for each resource posed unique challenges; each resource's varying nature and underlying data on benefit prevented any single algorithm from being universally applicable. The development of scarce resource allocation processes must be iterative, legally vetted, and tested.

METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study to explore ICU nurses willingness to provide care during the COVID-19 pandemic was undertaken between 25 March to 3 April 2020 at a large principal and referral teaching hospital in Sydney, NSW Australia. RESULTS: A total of 83 ICU nurses completed the survey. Approximately 60% reported receiving sufficient information from managers regarding COVID-19 and about caring for a patient with COVID-19. Ninety percent of nurses were concerned about spreading COVID-19 to their family. Sixty one percent of the nurses indicated that they were willing to care for patients with COVID-19. Receiving timely communication from managers was the only predictor of willingness to care among ICU nurses.

The ongoing ELECTRA-STROKE study investigates the diagnostic accuracy of dry electrode electroencephalography (EEG) for LVO-a stroke in the prehospital setting. To determine which EEG features are most useful for this purpose and assess EEG data quality, EEG recordings are also performed in the emergency room (ER). Here, we report data of the first 100 patients included in the ER. METHODS: Patients presented to the ER with a suspected stroke or known LVO-a stroke underwent a single EEG prior to EVT. Diagnostic accuracy for LVO-a stroke of frequency band power, brain symmetry and phase synchronization measures were evaluated by calculating receiver operating characteristic curves. Optimal cut-offs were determined as the highest sensitivity at a specificity of  80%. RESULTS: EEG data were of sufficient quality for analysis in 65/100 included patients. Of these, 35/65 (54%) had an acute ischemic stroke, of whom 9/65 (14%) had an LVO-a stroke. Median onset-to-EEG-time was 266 min (IQR 121C655) and median EEG-recording-time was 3 min (IQR 3C5). The EEG feature with the highest diagnostic accuracy for LVO-a stroke was thetaCalpha ratio (AUC 0.83; sensitivity 75%; specificity 81%). Combined, weighted phase lag index and relative theta power best identified LVO-a stroke (sensitivity 100%; specificity 84%). CONCLUSION: Dry electrode EEG is a promising tool for LVO-a stroke detection, but data quality needs to be improved and validation in the prehospital setting is necessary.

However, determining properties of individual muscles in vivo remains a challenge because muscles usually function within a synergistic group. Modeling has been used to estimate the properties of an individual muscle from the experimental measurement of the muscle group properties. While this approach can be valuable, the models and the associated predictions are difficult to validate. In this study, we measured the in situ F-V properties of the maximally activated kangaroo rat plantarflexor group and used two different assumptions and associated models to estimate the properties of the individual plantarflexors. The first model (Mdl1) assumed that the percent contributions of individual muscles to group force and power were based upon the muscles' cross-sectional areas and were constant across the different isotonic loads applied to the muscle group. The second model (Mdl2) assumed that the F-V properties of the fibers within each muscle were identical, but due to differences in muscle architecture, the muscles' contributions to the group properties changed with isotonic load. We compared the two model predictions to independent estimates of the muscles' contributions based upon sonomicrometry (SONO) measurements of muscle lengths. We found that predictions from Mdl2 were not significantly different from SONO based estimates while those from Mdl1 were significantly different. The results of this study show that incorporating appropriate fiber properties and muscle architecture is necessary to parse the individual muscles' contributions to the group F-V properties.","output":"Estimation of the force-velocity properties of individual muscles from measurement of the combined plantarflexor properties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 can cause chronic and acute disease.

In contrast, the availability and usage of various technological resources bore no relation to a childs motivation. Finally, the current data showed that Indian parents most frequently used TV time, words of encouragement, and play/game time as motivators;the least popular motivators were money, new toys, and physical punishment.

Design The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases. We searched four databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI (Chinese Database), to identify studies reporting COVID-19.

Setting This study was take place at Jouf University, Sakaka, Al-Jouf, Saudi Arabia. Results The review showed that AKI patients, who were susceptible to a cytokine storm, showed clinical deterioration. This result allowed the current research team to develop a hypothesis of a set of adverse events in COVID-19 that proposes the modification of inflammatory pathways by stimulation of nAChR7. The stimulation could occur by way of IL-6 / JAK2 / STAT3 / SOCS3 and NF-B (p65)/IL-18, which work together to induce AKI and increase overall renal-related diagnostic markers, such as plasma creatinine and tubular cell damage. In addition, the functioning of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway may be determined by nicotine. Pharmacological nicotine products are widely available, and their role in COVID-19-mediated AKI can be further evaluated.

Social interactions determine the contact network among individuals, while spreading, requiring individual-to-individual transmission, takes place on top of the network. Studying the topological aspects of a contact network, therefore, not only has the potential of leading to valuable insights into how the behavior of individuals impacts spreading phenomena, but it may also open up possibilities for devising effective behavioral interventions. Because of the temporal nature of interactions - since the topology of the network, containing who is in contact with whom, when, for how long, and in which precise sequence, varies (rapidly) in time - analyzing them requires developing network methods and metrics that respect temporal variability, in contrast to those developed for static (i.e., time-invariant) networks. Here, by means of event mapping, we propose a method to quantify how quickly agents mingle by transforming temporal network data of agent contacts. We define a novel measure called 'contact sequence centrality', which quantifies the impact of an individual on the contact sequences, reflecting the individual's behavioral potential for spreading. Comparing contact sequence centrality across agents allows for ranking the impact of agents and identifying potential 'behavioral super-spreaders'. The method is applied to social interaction data collected at an art fair in Amsterdam. We relate the measure to the existing network metrics, both temporal and static, and find that (mostly at longer time scales) traditional metrics lose their resemblance to contact sequence centrality.

Twenty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 GPs at two time-points: autumn 2020 (14 interviews) and spring 2021 (10 interviews). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically, taking a longitudinal approach. Participants reported a lower threshold for antibiotic prescribing (and fewer consultations) for respiratory infections and COVID-19 symptoms early in the pandemic, then returning to more usual (pre-pandemic) prescribing. They perceived the pandemic as having had less impact on antibiotic prescribing for urinary and skin infections. Participants perceived the changing ways of working and consulting (e.g., proportions of remote and in-person consultations) in addition to changing patient presentations and GP workloads as influencing the fluctuations in antibiotic prescribing. This was compounded by decreased engagement with, and priority of, AMS due to COVID-19-related urgent priorities. Re-engagement with AMS is needed, e.g., through reviving antibiotic prescribing feedback and targets/incentives. The pandemic disrupted, and required adaptations in, the usual ways of working and AMS.

To start exploring the molecular events that follow host cell infection, we queried VirusCircBase and identified a circular RNA (circRNA) predicted to be synthesized by SARS-CoV-2, circ_3205, which we used to probe: (i) a training cohort comprised of two pools of cells from three nasopharyngeal swabs of SARS-CoV-2 infected (positive) or uninfected (negative, UCs) individuals; (ii) a validation cohort made up of 12 positive and 3 negative samples. The expression of circRNAs, miRNAs and miRNA targets was assayed through real-time PCR. CircRNACmiRNA interactions were predicted by TarpMiR, Analysis of Common Targets for circular RNAs (ACT), and STarMir tools. Enrichment of the biological processes and the list of predicted miRNA targets were retrieved from DIANA miRPath v3.0. Our results showed that the predicted SARS-CoV-2 circ_3205 was expressed only in positive samples and its amount positively correlated with that of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) mRNA and the viral load (r values = 0.80952 and 0.84867, Spearmans correlation test, respectively). Human (hsa) miR-298 was predicted to interact with circ_3205 by all three predictive tools. KCNMB4 and PRKCE were predicted as hsa-miR-298 targets. Interestingly, the function of both is correlated with blood coagulation and immune response. KCNMB4 and PRKCE mRNAs were upregulated in positive samples as compared to UCs (6 and 8.1-fold, p values = 0.049 and 0.02, Students t test, respectively) and their expression positively correlated with that of circ_3205 (r values = 0.6 and 0.25, Spearmans correlation test, respectively). We propose that our results convincingly suggest that circ_3205 is a circRNA synthesized by SARS-CoV-2 upon host cell infection and that it may behave as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA), sponging hsa-miR-298 and contributing to the upregulation of KCNMB4 and PRKCE mRNAs.

In particular, improved early assessment of the emergence of resistance potential will become a greater focus in MIDD, as this is poorly mitigated by current development approaches. MIDD breadth refers to greater adoption of model\\\\centered approaches to anti\\\\infective development. Specifically, this means how various MIDD approaches and translational tools can be integrated or connected in a systematic way that supports decision making by key stakeholders (sponsors, regulators, and payers) across the entire development pathway.","output":"Model\\\\Informed Drug Development for Anti\\\\Infectives: State of the Art and Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: We estimated that how many hospital workers in the United States (US) might get infected or die in the COVID-19 pandemic. We also estimated the impact of personal protective equipment (PPE) and age restrictions on these estimates. Methods: Our secondary analyses estimated hospital worker infections in the US based on health worker infection and death rates per 100 deaths from COVID-19 in Hubei and Italy. We used Monte Carlo simulations to compute point estimates with 95% confidence intervals for hospital worker infections in the US based on the two scenarios. We computed potential decrease in infections if the PPE were available only to those involved in direct care of COVID-19 patients (~ 30%) and if workers aged  60 years are restricted from patient care. Estimates were adjusted for hospital workers per bed in the US compared to China and Italy. Results: The hospital worker infections per 100 deaths were 108.2 in Hubei and 94.1 in Italy. Based on Hubei scenario, we estimated that about 53,640 US hospital workers (95% CI: 43,160 to 62,251) might get infected from COVID-19. The Italian scenario suggested 53,097 US hospital worker (95% CI: 37,133 to 69,003) might get infected during the pandemic. Availability of PPE to high-risk workers could reduce counts to 28,100 (95% CI: 23,048 to 33,242) considering Hubei and to 28,354 (95% CI: 19,829 to 36,848) considering Italy. Restricting hospital workers aged  60 years from direct patient care reduced counts to 1,985 (95% CI: 1,627 to 2,347) considering Hubei and to 2,002 (95% CI: 1,400 to 2,602) considering the Italian scenario. Conclusion: We estimated significant burden of illness due to COVID-19 if no strategies are adopted. Making PPE available to all hospital workers and reducing exposure of hospital workers above the age of 60 could have significant reductions in hospital worker infections.","output":"ESTIMATING COVID-19 INFECTIONS IN HOSPITAL WORKERS IN THE UNITED STATES"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypertension is accompanied by the over-activation of macrophages. Diuretics administered alone or in combination with hypotensive drugs may have immunomodulatory effects. Thus, the influence of tested drugs on mouse macrophage-mediated humoral immunity was investigated. Mice were treated intraperitoneally with captopril (5 mg/kg) with or without hydrochlorothiazide (10 mg/kg) or furosemide (5 mg/kg) by 8 days. Mineral oil-induced peritoneal macrophages were harvested to assess the generation of cytokines in ELISA, and the expression of surface markers was analyzed cytometrically. Macrophages were also pulsed with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and transferred to naive mice for evaluation of their ability to induce a humoral immune response. Tested drugs increase the expression of surface markers important for the antigen phagocytosis and presentation. SRBC-pulsed macrophages from mice treated with captopril combined with diuretics increased the secretion of antigen-specific antibodies by recipient B cells, while macrophages of mice treated with hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide with captopril increased the number of antigen-specific B cells. Tested drugs alter the macrophage secretory profile in favor of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Our results showed that diuretics with or without captopril modulate the humoral response by affecting the function of macrophages, which has significant translational potential in assessing the safety of antihypertensive therapy.","output":"Anti-Inflammatory Activities of Captopril and Diuretics on Macrophage Activity in Mouse Humoral Immune Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Vessel sealing technologies have improved surgical efficiency and outcomes. Ferromagnetic technology has potential utility in this area. The aim of this study was to evaluate ferromagnetic heating in sealing and dividing vessels. METHODS A novel ferromagnetic (FM) sealer, FMsealer, was developed for sealing and dividing vessels. Using a swine in vivo model, the following endpoints were evaluated: (1) proof of concept, (2) 21-day survival surgery, and (3) comparison with ultrasonic (US) and/or bipolar (BP) devices for subjective outcomes. Seal burst strengths were measured in vitro. Mann-Whitney and Student's t test were used. RESULTS After showing proof of concept, 5 swine underwent survival splenectomy, nephrectomy, hysterectomy, and mesenteric vessel division (arteries ranging from 1 to 7 mm in diameter) with necropsy after day 21 showing no evidence of surgical site bleeding. FM was equivalent to BP in tissue retention and superior to BP in spread/tissue desiccation, sticking, and charring (P  .01). The FM was superior to US and BP in speed of 10 cm mesentery division (mean  SD seconds): FM (12.9  1.0 seconds), US (23.3  4.4 seconds), BP (46.1  5.2 seconds) (P  .01 FM vs US or BP).

Therefore, this study attempts to enlighten the possible reasons for the deterioration in teachers job-related well-being and proposes an integrated application of three models of prediction for job-related affective well-being and burnout as teachers indicators for the well-being in online teaching settings. The first model includes personality traits (extroversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness) measured with the revised neuroticism, extroversion, and openness personality inventory (NEO-PI-R). The second model integrates an indispensable skill for the online teaching which is technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) as technology-related teaching skill conceptualized by the TPACK framework. The TPACK model is a technology integration that identifies three types of knowledge instructors need to combine for successful EdTech integration - technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (i.e., TPACK). The third model, a multidimensional one, includes coping mechanisms (e.g., problem-focused coping, emotion-focused coping, social support coping, and avoidant coping) as mediators in the relationship between personality traits and TPCK on the one side, and job-related well-being indicators on the other side. Findings from regression analyses were used to test the first two models, and the findings from a mediation analysis were used to test the third model to show that teachers TPCK explains a significant amount of variance in the job-related affective well-being of the teachers. The analyses also demonstrate that avoidant coping particularly mediates the relation between burnout and job-related affective well-being during COVID-19 school closures. Results indicate the efficacy of the TPACK model in increasing the job-related well-being of the teachers. The analysis of the data led to recommend that teachers should improve their personal technology-related teaching skills and adopt coping strategies in consistent with their personality traits. Moreover, public schools, as organizations, could advance educational technology programs to enhance technology-related teaching skills with the aim of increasing the well-being of their employees in online teaching settings.","output":"Personality Traits, Technology-Related Teaching Skills, and Coping Mechanisms as Antecedents of Teachers Job-Related Affective Well-Being and Burnout in Compulsory and Higher Education Online Teaching Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anatomical models to study aerosol delivery impose huge limitations and extrapolation to humans remains controversial.

Several networks were created to detail the interactions among case-specific genes, especially case-specific lncRNAs-mediated regulation of case-specific genes. Also, interaction networks were created for the common lncRNAs and genes. HCL analyses showed that differential genes and lncRNAs, especially the common genes and lncRNAs, kept similar expression patterns in both case populations. Furthermore, function enrichment analyses just indicated the common biological processes, namely, extracellular matrix organization and cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules.

METHOD: Patients from a regional endocrine surgery practice and referring endocrinologists were sent surveys about their perspectives on telemedicine use. RESULTS: Fifty two patients responded: average age was 58.3 years; 78% were female; 33% were Black. Sixteen referring endocrinologists responded: average age was 52.4 years; 62.5% were female. Nearly all patients (92%) and providers (100%) would try telemedicine or use it again. Providers were more likely than patients to use telemedicine because of COVID-19 (100% versus 70.6%, P = 0.03). Patients were more concerned about the lack of personal connection with telemedicine than providers (60.8% versus 25.0%, P = 0.02).

For many patients, audio-visual appointments offered a practical, time efficient way of accessing their reconstructive team for assessment, advice and post-operative care. However, a subset of patients was identified by the team as requiring at least one in-person appointment to minimize perceived clinical risk and to optimize quality outcomes. In order to understand more fully the challenges and successes of technology-enabled care to date, a national survey of practice across hand units in the UK was conducted. We present here some of our key findings and propose the need to develop nationally agreed screening criteria to determine how and when technology enabled outpatient care can be used in the management of acute upper limb trauma. The results of this survey forms part of a series of projects currently underway looking at the efficacy of audio-visual care in upper limb trauma, including a multicentre observational study.","output":"Defining clinical decision making in the provision of audio-visual outpatient care for acute upper limb trauma services: A review of practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several studies of food literacy emphasise the acquisition of critical knowledge over context.

The way the implant surfaces are affected with advantages and disadvantages, that typically bring each methodology, is also the purpose of this study. The study is of review type, based on finding articles about implant surface modification, with the aim of promoting the mesenchymal cell activation, utilizing keyword combination. CONCLUSIONS: Implant success beyond the human element of the practicioner and the protocol element of implant treatment, also relies on the application of the right type of implant, at the right implant site, in accordance with oral and individual health status of the patient. Implant success does not depend on type of \\"coating\\" material of the implants.

While workload increased for many front-line providers, other health care workers were furloughed. Here, we describe the redeployment of occupational therapy (OT) to the ED and the subsequent impact on operations. Methods: This project falls under an IRB human subjects research waiver as QI. During the COVID-19 pandemic, OT employees of a regional health care network were reassigned to the ED from inpatient care rather than be furloughed. The ED serves as the regional Level 1 trauma center and comprehensive stroke center and hosts a PGY 1-4 EM residency. Daily average volumes pre-COVID were 265 patients per day. The task assigned to redeployed OT principally involved patient transport. CT turnaround time (TAT) is defined as time from provider order entry to initiation of CT. Data is presented descriptively, with times as means. Results: CT TAT was tracked from November 2020 through February 2021. OT focus on CT transport began 1/1/21. FTE redeployment averaged 2 staff for 7-3 (day) and 3-11 (evening) shifts. No changes were made to night shift (11-7). Day shift saw CT TAT decrease from 91.4 minutes to 73.0 (20.1%). The impact was greater during evening shift peak demand, with CT TAT falling from 99.8 to 71.4 minutes (28.5%). Figure 1 demonstrates after the first two weeks (1/1 to 1/13/21) of this workflow, CT TAT was down to 60.0 minutes (39.9%) for 1/13/21 onward. Variation also decreased as shown by the control limits. Night shift saw a decrease from 98.0 to 91.7 minutes (6.4%) despite no additional FTE. CT scanner availability, laboratory TAT, and the number of CT scan orders placed were monitored during the time period and did not appear to impact CT TAT. Conclusion: This single site experience describes a positive impact on ED operations, specifically CT TAT, by engaging health care workers who would have otherwise been furloughed due to the pandemic. These findings suggest an increase in patient transport staff will improve CT TAT when pandemic redeployment ends.

The demogrant has received surprisingly little scholarly attention, but this article locates it in Buchanans broader constitutional political economy project and shows it was a logical application of his theoretical framework to the problem of inefficient and unfair welfare systems when reform to the basic institutions of majoritarian democracy was not forthcoming. The demogrant aims to end the problems of majority cycling and rent seeking that plague contemporary welfare states and therefore offers a model of welfare without rent seekinga constitutional welfare state.

It was defined as a pandemic by the world health organization in March 2020. It is stated that this virus is usually transmitted by droplets caused by sneezing or coughing, or by touching infected surfaces. The presence of the virus is detected by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests with the help of a swab taken from the nose or throat. In addition, X-ray and CT imaging methods are also used to support this method. Since it is known that the accuracy sensitivity in rRT-PCR test is low, auxiliary diagnostic methods have a very important place. Computer-aided diagnosis and detection systems are developed especially with the help of X-ray and CT images. Studies on the detection of COVID19 in the literature are increasing day by day. In this study, the effect of different batch size (BH=3, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50) parameter values on their performance in detecting COVID19 and other classes was investigated using data belonging to 4 different (Viral Pneumonia, COVID19, Normal, Bacterial Pneumonia) classes. The study was carried out using a pre-trained ResNet50 convolutional neural network. According to the obtained results, they performed closely on the training and test data. However, it was observed that the steady state in the test data was delayed as the batch size value increased. The highest COVID19 detection was 95.17% for BH = 3, while the overall accuracy value was 97.97% with BH = 20. According to the findings, it can be said that the batch size value does not affect the overall performance significantly, but the increase in the batch size value delays obtaining stable results.","output":"Effect of Different Batch Size Parameters on Predicting of COVID19 Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurodegenerative diseases are a horrendous burden for their victims, their families, and society as a whole. For half a century scientists have pursued the hypothesis that these diseases involve a chronic viral infection in the brain. However, efforts to consistently detect a specific virus in brains of patients with such diseases as Alzheimers or multiple sclerosis have generally failed. Neuropathologists have become increasingly aware that most patients with neurodegenerative diseases demonstrate marked deterioration of the brain olfactory bulb in addition to brain targets that define the specific disease. In fact, the loss of the sense of smell may precede overt neurological symptoms by many years. This realization that the olfactory bulb is a common target in neurodegenerative diseases suggests the possibility that microbes and/or toxins in inhaled air may play a role in their pathogenesis. With regard to inhaled viruses, neuropathologists have focused on those viruses that infect and kill neurons. However, a recent study shows that a respiratory virus with no neurotropic properties can rapidly invade the mouse olfactory bulb from the nasal cavity. Available data suggest that this strain of influenza is passively transported to the bulb via the olfactory nerves (mechanism unknown), and is taken up by glial cells in the outer layers of the bulb. The infected glial cells appear to be activated by the virus, secrete proinflammatory cytokines, and block further spread of virus within the brain. At the time that influenza symptoms become apparent (15 h post-infection), but not prior to symptom onset (10 h post-infection), proinflammatory cytokine-expressing neurons are increased in olfactory cortical pathways and hypothalamus as well as in the olfactory bulb. The mice go on to die of pneumonitis with severe acute phase and respiratory disease symptoms but no classical neurological symptoms. While much remains to be learned about this intranasal influenza-brain invasion model, it suggests the hypothesis that common viruses encountered in our daily life may initiate neuroinflammation via olfactory neural networks. The numerous viruses that we inhale during a lifetime might cause the death of only a few neurons per infection, but this minor damage would accumulate over time and contribute to age-related brain shrinkage and/or neurodegenerative diseases. Elderly individuals with a strong innate inflammatory system, or ongoing systemic inflammation (or both), might be most susceptible to these outcomes. The evidence for the hypothesis that common respiratory viruses may contribute to neurodegenerative processes is developed in the accompanying article.","output":"Neuroinflammation resulting from covert brain invasion by common viruses C A potential role in local and global neurodegeneration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionClozapine is the most effective antipsychotic for treatment resistant schizophrenia but adverse reactions to clozapine include neutropenia.

METHODS: A hybrid model of virtual and in-person clinics was established, supported by a multidisciplinary team consisting of respiratory, critical care, infectious diseases, psychiatry, and psychology services. This model identifies patients who need enhanced follow-up following COVID-19 pneumonia and aims to support patients with complications of COVID-19 and those who require integrated community care.

BKPyV virions are small non-enveloped particles of 40C45 nm in diameter, with an icosahedral symmetry, resistant to heat, and environment exposure (Hirsch and Steiger 2003). Structurally, BKPyV consists of a circular 5.1 kb double-stranded DNA genome within a capsid made of proteins Vp1 on the outside and Vp2 and Vp3 on the inside. The BKPyV genome is divided into three regions: the noncoding control region (NCCR); the early viral gene region (EVGR); the late viral gene region (LVGR). The NCCR is responsible for DNA replication and bidirectional viral gene expression; the EVGR encodes the regulatory nonstructural proteins called small tumor antigen (sTag), large tumor antigen (LTag), and spliced variants called truncated Tag; the LVGR contains the genes for the structural proteins Vp1, Vp2, Vp3, and a small accessory protein of unknown function called agnoprotein. The Vp1 capsid protein is the main target of BKPyV-specific antibodies while LTag is used as target for immunohistochemical diagnosis in tissue samples. BKPyV was isolated for the first time in a patient (B.K.) who underwent a kidney transplant and presented in the urine particular epithelial cells with nuclear viral inclusions called decoy cells (Gardner et al. 1971). Subsequently, BKPyV has been associated with hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (Apperley et al. 1987; Arthur et al. 1986), and nephropathy after kidney transplantation (Binet et al. 1999; Randhawa et al. 1999). Serologic studies showed that up to 90% of the adult population has been exposed to BKPyV during infancy and childhood (Egli et al. 2009). The infection can be asymptomatic or causes flu-like symptoms indistinguishable from other causes of viral community respiratory tract infections. The transmission is thought to be by direct person-to-person contact or by exposure to respiratory secretions. After primary infection, the virus remains latent in renal tubular epithelial and urothelial cells and asymptomatic viruria can be detected in 5C10% of healthy individuals (Hirsch and Steiger 2003; Egli et al. 2009). The urinary shedding increases to 60C80% in patients undergoing HSCT, as well as the BKPyV viruria load increases to less than 3 log(10) to >7 log(10) copies/mL (Cesaro et al. 2018a; Cesaro et al. 2015).","output":"Polyomavirus, Adenovirus, and Viral Respiratory Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Backgroud : The outbreak of COVID-19 has brought unprecedented perils to human health and raised public health concerns in more than two hundred countries.

As hospitals work to acquire enough personal protective equipment and brace for potential cases, the role of infection prevention efforts and programs has become increasingly important. Lessons from the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak in Toronto and 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea have unveiled the critical role that hospitals play in outbreaks, especially of novel coronaviruses. Their ability to amplify the spread of disease can rapidly fuel transmission of the disease and often those failures in infection prevention and general hospital practices contribute to such events. While efforts to enhance infection prevention measures and hospital readiness are underway in the United States, it is important to understand why these programs were not able to maintain continued, sustainable levels of readiness. History has shown that infection prevention programs are primarily responsible for preparing hospitals and responding to biological events but face under-staffing and focused efforts defined by administrators. The current U.S. healthcare system though, is built upon a series of priorities that often view biopreparedness as a costly endeavor.

Reduced temperature and sunlight could drive unprecedented reductions in agricultural production, endangering global food security.

We simulate the climatic effects of six war scenarios on fish biomass and catch globally, using a state-of-the-art Earth system model and global process-based fisheries model. We also simulate how either rapidly increased fish demand (driven by food shortages) or decreased ability to fish (due to infrastructure disruptions), would affect global catches, and test the benefits of strong prewar fisheries management. We find a decade-long negative climatic impact that intensifies with soot emissions, with global biomass and catch falling by up to 18  3% and 29  7% after a USCRussia war under business-as-usual fishingsimilar in magnitude to the end-of-century declines under unmitigated global warming. When war occurs in an overfished state, increasing demand increases short-term (1 to 2 y) catch by at most 30% followed by precipitous declines of up to 70%, thus offsetting only a minor fraction of agricultural losses. However, effective prewar management that rebuilds fish biomass could ensure a short-term catch buffer large enough to replace 43  35% of todays global animal protein production.

The use of the internet and TV news increased during the lockdown and the use of newspapers, radio, and magazine declined significantly. The anxiety due to COVID-related news through mass media was reported highest (27.3 %) in the 40C49 years age group and lowest (14.49%) in the 20C29 age group. About 43.18% of people of 30C39 years of age group developed fear, and 28% of 50C59 age groups felt panic due to COVID-related news in media. It has been found that the use of social media is highest in the 20C29 age group followed by 10C19 years age group CONCLUSION: Mass media is playing a very important role in the dissemination of the COVID-related information to the general public in north India.

Evidence indicates that SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been circulating from animals to humans since before the 2002-2003 outbreak, suggesting that another pandemic may occur. This possibility has focused continuous action on SARS vaccine research. Inactivated vaccines, viral and bacterial vector vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines, and live-attenuated virus vaccines have been studied in different animal models. Although different animal models are used in vaccine studies, the most appropriate model for studying SARS is ferret since it develops the typical clinical signs, viral replication patterns and lung pathology compatible with that of SARS pathogenesis in humans. While there is much evidence that various vaccine strategies against SARS are safe and immunogenic, vaccinated animals still display significant disease upon challenge. Moreover, potential vaccine enhancement of SARS have also been shown in some studies. Data from the studies give an important information of the demand for further vaccine development research, especially focusing on mucosal immunization, T-cell immunity and combinations of heterologous vaccines in prime-boost regimens.

However, the extent to which otolaryngologists provide telemedicine services is unclear. Objective To characterize recent trends in the use of telemedicine by otolaryngologists to deliver care to Medicare beneficiaries. Design, Setting, and Participants A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was conducted between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018, using publicly available Medicare Physician/Supplier Procedure Summary data on physicians practicing in the field of otolaryngology and benchmark specialties (dermatology and psychiatry) that provided telemedicine services to Medicare beneficiaries. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes were the mean annual number of telemedicine services delivered per active physician and mean annual payment per active physician for these services. Secondary outcomes included the number, setting, and complexity of telemedicine services. Results Between 2010 and 2018, otolaryngologists provided 2127 total telemedicine services (7 unique service types) to Medicare beneficiaries and received $88 574 in total payment for these services. During this period, the mean number of telemedicine services increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.0%, and the mean Medicare payment per otolaryngologist increased at a CAGR of 21.8%. In comparison, telemedicine use during this period generally increased at a higher rate in the fields of dermatology (mean number of services per active physician at CAGR of 13.0%; mean Medicare payment per active physician at CAGR of 12.5%) and psychiatry (mean number of services per active physician at CAGR of 25.8%; mean Medicare payment per active physician at CAGR of 26.6%). In 2018, outpatient evaluation and management visits accounted for most telemedicine services provided (337 of 353 [95.5%]) and the payments received ($17 542.13 of $18 470.47 [95.0%]) by otolaryngologists. In contrast, physicians in other specialties also provided substantial portions of telemedicine services in the inpatient (psychiatry, 18 403 of 198 478 [9.3%]; dermatology, 231 of 1034 [22.3%]) and skilled nursing facility settings (psychiatry, 14 690 of 198 478 [7.4%]; dermatology, 46 of 1034 [4.4%]). Conclusions and Relevance This study suggests that the extent to which otolaryngologists used telemedicine to deliver care to Medicare beneficiaries between 2010 and 2018 was rare. Although there was relative growth in the use of telemedicine by otolaryngologists during this period, absolute growth remained low. Policy makers and provider organizations should support otolaryngologists in the adoption of telemedicine technologies, especially while coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) viral suppression efforts necessitate prolonged restriction of physical clinic throughput.","output":"Telemedicine Services Provided to Medicare Beneficiaries by Otolaryngologists Between 2010 and 2018."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the absence of vaccines or therapeutics, and with cases of COVID-19 continuing to grow each day, most countries are relying on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

This qualitative case study highlights one online parent education and training (PET) program developed during the pandemic to offer home-intervention strategies to parents of children with ASD in mainland China. This exploratory study sought to examine the emic perspectives of the trainers and parents who participated in the 12-week intensive training program while considering the cultural context in China and the transnational, remote nature of the program. METHODS The primary data focused on the experiences of the trainers and parents within PET program's structure and strategies, which were adapted from the Training of Trainers model, and were collected from semi-structured, in-depth individual and focus group interviews conducted virtually with trainers (n = 4). Supplemental data sources included training session materials and feedback forms collected from parents (n = 294) at the midpoint and end of the program. After the collected data were sorted and condensed, a thematic analysis was performed using the data analysis spiral to further organize and code the data, and the codes were finally collapsed into themes. FINDINGS Three overarching themes were identified: (1) training as modeling with resources, (2) dilemmas in cultural contexts and expectations, and (3) cultivating parent support networks. CONCLUSION The online PET program became a hub of support networks and learning spaces for parents of children with ASD in different regions in China during the pandemic. Through the interactive virtual training sessions, parents were supported by continuous feedback on their home intervention and coached to cultivate support networks among themselves despite tensions arising from cultural differences and to implement effective intervention strategies that were individualized and authenticated to their specific familial needs.","output":"While quarantined: An online parent education and training model for families of children with autism in China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of the study is to investigate the long-run and short-run dynamic relationship between crude oil prices and the movement of Sensex for the period of 2000C2018 Design/methodology/approach: The study uses the augmented DickeyCFuller test for the presence of unit root, Johansen cointegration test for estimating the cointegration among the variables Further, in the case of no cointegration found, the study employed the vector autoregression (VAR) model to estimate the long-run relationship and the Granger causality/Wald test for short-run relationship The study also conducted tests for the prerequisites of the model: serial correlation, heteroskedasticity and normality of data Findings: The study found that both the variables, crude oil prices and Sensex are integrated of order 1, that is, I (1), and there is no cointegration between them Further, the results proliferated from the VAR model unfold the marked effect of previous month crude oil prices (lag 1) on the movement of Indian stock market represented by Sensex considered as the benchmark index Furthermore, VARCGranger causality/block exogeneity Wald tests results indicated that there is a causal relationship between the crude oil prices and Sensex under the VAR environment The model does not have any serial correlation and heteroskedasticity indicating toward the unbiased and robust estimates Research limitations/implications: The study is conducted till the year 2018, and data for the present period (post-2018) is excluded due to ongoing trade issues between the USA and oil-exporting countries such as Iran The current COVID-19 outbreak has also put serious issues Due to limited time and availability of standardized data, researchers have considered Sensex as equity index only, but for more generalized research outcome few other equity indexes could have been taken for study Originality/value: The study is completely original in nature and is an extensive study of the relationship between the crude oil price and Indian stock market with reference to causality between the variables ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"A dynamic relationship between crude oil price and Indian equity market: an empirical study with special reference to Indian benchmark index Sensex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the most important Orientalists, EusbeRenaudot (1648-1720), was central in at least three major debates of his time: the late confessionalist anti-Protestant debate about the conceptions of the Eucharist; the hundred-year-long clash between the Jesuits and their enemies during the controversy of rites; and the Querelle des Anciens et des Modernes.

METHODS: We used routine care data from 36 hospitals in France and Luxembourg to assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids with at least 0.4 mg/kg/day equivalent prednisone (treatment group) versus standard of care (control group). Participants were adults aged 80 years or older with PCR-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or CT scan images typical of COVID-19 pneumonia, requiring oxygen &#8805;3 L/min, and with an inflammatory syndrome (C-reactive protein &#8805;40 mg/L). The primary outcome was overall survival at day 14. In our main analysis, characteristics of patients at baseline (i.e. time when patients met all inclusion criteria) were balanced by using propensity-score inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: Among the 267 patients included in the analysis, 98 were assigned to the treatment group. Their median age was 86 years (interquartile range 83-90 years) and 95% had a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed diagnosis. In total, 43/98 (43.9%) patients in the treatment group and 84/166 (50.6%) in the control group died before day 14 (weighted hazard ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.99).

Material: and Methods: Data were collected from medical records, and a detailed oral physical examination was performed on 663 critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation. Data were statistically analysed using univariate and logistic regression models relating the development of VAP with the oral findings. Results: : At oral physical examination, the most frequent findings were tooth loss (568 - 85.67%), coated tongue (422 - 63.65%) and oral bleeding (192 - 28.96%). Patients with a coated tongue or oral bleeding on the first day of ICU hospitalization developed more VAP than did patients without these conditions (20.14% vs 13.69%: p=0.02;23.44% vs 15.50%: p=0.01, respectively). In the logistic regression, a coated tongue and oral bleeding were considered independent risk factors for VAP development [OR=1.60 (1.02-2.47) and OR=1.59 (1.05 C 2.44), respectively]. Conclusions: : The presence of a coated tongue and oral bleeding in ICU admission could be considered markers for the development of VAP. Clinical relevance: The results of this paper reinforces the importance of proper maintenance of oral hygiene before intubation, which may lead to a decrease in the incidence of VAP in the ICU. This is particularly important in the COVID-19 current scenario, where more people are expected to need mechanical ventilation, consequently increasing cases of VAP.","output":"Analysis of oral risk-factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia in critically ill patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background ADHD is one of the commonest reasons for prescribing psychotropic medications for children and young people (CYP), and the efficacy is up to 70%. Three of the four medications licensed for ADHD in the UK (Methylphenidate, Dexamfetamine/Lisdexamfetamine, and Atomoxetine) are sympathomimetic amines that exert their beneficial effect by increasing levels of dopamine and or noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex. These sympathomimetic amines also stimulate adrenergic receptors in the heart and blood vessels;hence are associated with small but statistically significant increases in Blood Pressure (BP). Thus, while medications for ADHD are effective and generally well tolerated and safe, patients need to be monitored for cardiovascular and other side effects. Clinical guidelines recommend that if children and young people (CYP) taking medication for ADHD experience raised BP above cut-off for hypertension, dose reduction and cardiology referral should be made. However, guidelines do not specify the need to consider contextual factors. Objectives We aimed to test the hypothesis that the most plausible explanation for elevated BP among CYP with ADHD during the Covid-19 lockdown was related to Covid-linked stress and the additional anxiety about coming to the clinic during the pandemic. Methods We carried out a prospective cardiovascular assessment of a cohort of 41 CYP (88% males) attending routine medical reviews for ADHD treatment in the Borough district of Halton in North West England within the first 6 weeks of the UK-wide Covid-19 lockdown in March-May 2020. Mean age was 12 years (range 5-18 years), and 92.5% were on psycho- stimulants while 7.5% were on non-stimulants. All the medications were within the lower range of normally approved doses. Their Blood Pressures were measured with regularly calibrated electronic sphygmomanometers based on standard clinical procedures and compared to BP recorded within the previous one year. Definition of Hypertension (HT) or Pre- HT was based on the British reference charts for CYP. The CYP were followed up with non-clinic-based BP monitoring at home or by GP. Results We identified 32 CYP seen within the first 6 weeks of the UK-wide Covid-19 lockdown who had BP above cut-off for prehypertension (44%) or hypertension (37%) (figure 1), all of whom previously had their BP in the normal range. Their medication types and doses had not changed. Their medical histories and anthropometric centiles were stable. By August 2020 when the lockdown had eased, their BP were back in the normal range without any further investigations or interventions. Conclusions This audit highlights the point that clinical evaluation of changes in BP among CYP taking medications for ADHD should take the socio-ecological context into account and not automatically translate into making major clinical changes to treatment such as dose reduction or referral for cardiology review. A conservative approach of non-clinic-based monitoring may be in the best interest of such young people, who, otherwise, may lose treatment efficacy following dose reduction. This conservative approach could also prevent the affected CYP being exposed to the inconvenience and risks associated with unnecessary medical investigations. There could also be additional efficacy gains for the wider health economy.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the blood pressure of children and adolescents with ADHD: Implications for clinical practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the association between preoperative glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) and cardiac surgery associated with acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV version 1.0) database was used to identify adults patients who performed cardiac surgery during ICU stay. The primary outcome was the development of AKI based on the KDIGO criteria. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to investigate the association between GLR and clinical outcomes, and propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were also used to validate our findings. RESULTS: The optimal cut-off value for GLR was 1.28.

The third study tested the effectiveness of a cognitive health management model for community-dwelling older adults including healthy and mild cognitively impaired (MCI) ones in Shanghai, China. Older adults with MCI who received the management service showed better cognition outcomes compared to their counterparts in the control group. The fourth study focused on a community program named Carer Caf, developed to support dementia family caregiver in Taiwan. Participants (n=375) reported reduced stress and increased access to service referrals. The last study examined the stakeholders perceptions of dementia friendly initiatives (DFI) being implemented in U.S.A, mainland China, and Taiwan to support persons with dementia and family caregivers.

Autonomous Communities such as Cantabria continue without supplying tetravalent vaccine. The aim of this study was to analyse epidemiological characteristics of influenza type B in Cantabria (2019-2020 season) as well as to establish the predominant lineage and its relation to the recommended vaccine. METHODS: Retrospective study whereby flu diagnosis and lineage analysis were determined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: All samples belonged to the Victoria lineage. Most prevalent viral co-infection was due to SARS-CoV-2. The population affected by influenza B was mainly paediatric and non-vaccinated patients more frequently required hospital admittance. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza type B has a higher incidence in the paediatric population and type A affects more the adult population. Only 28.8% of patients with Influenza B that presented with some underlying condition or risk factor were vaccinated. This shows the need to increase coverage with tetravalent vaccines in order to reduce the burden of disease associated with the Influenza B virus.","output":"Descripcin de la epidemia estacional por Gripe B en Cantabria durante los inicios de la pandemia por SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this chapter, a series of cases is presented that have provoked significant thought on the part of the consulting and consulted pathologists.

Since COVID-19 is contagious from 2 days prior to symptom onset and the viral load is the maximal just after the onset of symptoms, we thought that household infection could have already occurred even if the patient is isolated at a facility soon after the diagnosis. Therefore, we examined the relationship between the period from 2 days before symptom onset and the start of isolation at a facility (the infection exposure period) and the household secondary attack incidence rate among 1,075 index cases in households who were under isolation at facilities. We defined transmissions in households as cases in which household secondary transmission occurred to more than one person, and the household secondary attack incidence rate as the value obtained by dividing the number of households in which secondary transmission occurred by the total number of households. Evaluation of the household secondary attack incidence rate for each infection exposure period revealed that household secondary transmission did not occur in cases with an infection exposure period of 3 days, and the household secondary incidence rate was 22.6% (95% CI, 16.9%-29.5%) for an infection exposure period of 7 days, and 45.5% (95% CI, 21.3%-72.0%) for infection exposure periods of 12 days or more (regression analysis: y=0.037x-0.047;R2=0.863;p < 0.01). These findings suggest that the household secondary attack incidence rate increased as the infection exposure period increased, and that the household secondary attack incidence rate could be reduced to half (from 45.5% for an infection exposure period of 12 days to 22.6% for a period of 7 days) if we could start isolation so as to keep the infection exposure period at 7 days or less (5 days or less after the onset).","output":"The relationship between the time of start of isolation at facilities and prevention of household transmission in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) variants having a large deletion in the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit of spike (S) protein were designated as S1 NTD-del PEDVs. They replicate well in experimentally infected pigs. However, on farms they often co-infect pigs with the PEDV containing an intact S protein (S-intact PEDV). We aimed to characterize viral replication and pathogenesis in neonatal gnotobiotic pigs infected simultaneously with the two types of PEDV using two recombinant PEDVs: icPC22A and its S1 NTD-del form icPC22A-S1197. Additionally, viral replication was compared in Vero and IPEC-DQ cells at the presence of bovine mucin (BM), porcine gastric mucin (PGM), swine bile and bile acids during inoculation. In the pigs coinfected with icPC22A and icPC22A-S1197, icPC22A replicated to a higher peak titer than its infection of pigs without the presence of icPC22A-S1197. The severity of diarrhea and intestinal atrophy were similar between icPC22A and the coinfection groups, but were significantly higher than icPC22A-S1197 group. In Vero and IPEC-DQ cells, certain concentrations of BM, PGM, bile and bile acids increased significantly the infectivity of icPC22A but had no or negative effects on icPC22A-S1197. These results indicated that the replication of the S-intact PEDV was enhanced during coinfection in piglets.

Based on the data, influence of SARS-CoV-2 on human cells was analyzed and potential therapeutic compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 were screened. MATERIALS AND METHODS: R package \\"DESeq2\\" was used for differential gene analysis on the data of cells infected or non-infected with SARS-CoV-2. The \\"ClusterProfiler\\" package was used for GO functional annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was constructed through STRING website, and the key subset in the PPI network was identified after visualization by Cytoscape software. Connectivity Map (CMap) database was used to screen known compounds that caused genomic change reverse to that caused by SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: By intersecting DEGs in two datasets, a total of 145 DEGs were screened out, among which 136 genes were upregulated and 9 genes were downregulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that these genes were mainly associated with the pathways involved in viral infection, inflammatory response, and immunity. The CMap research found that there were three compounds with a median_tau_score less than -90, namely triptolide, tivozanib and daunorubicin. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can cause abnormal changes in a large number of molecules and related signaling pathways in human cells, among which IL-17 and TNF signaling pathways may play a key role in pathogenic process of SARS-CoV-2.

Firstly, the overall structure of the explosion-expulsion manipulator is introduced. The redundant degrees of freedom are formed by the parallel joint axes of the shoulder joint, elbow joint and wrist pitching joint, which increase the flexibility of the mechanism. Aiming at a complex system with multiple degrees of freedom and strong coupling of the manipulator, the virtual joint is introduced, the corresponding forward kinematics model is established by DCH method, and the inverse kinematics solution of the manipulator is derived by analytical method. In the MATLAB platform, the workspace of the manipulator is analyzed by Monte Carlo pseudo-random number method. The quintic polynomial interpolation method is used to simulate the deflagration task in joint space. Finally, the actual prototype experiment is carried out using the data obtained by simulation. The trajectory planning using the quintic polynomial interpolation method can ensure the smooth movement of the manipulator and high accuracy of operation. Furthermore, the trajectory is basically consistent with the simulation trajectory, which can realize the work requirements of putting the object into the explosion-proof tank. The new 5-DOF folding deflagration manipulator designed in this paper has stable motion and strong robustness, which can be used for deflagration during the COVID-19 epidemic.","output":"Research on Kinematics Analysis and Trajectory Planning of Novel EOD Manipulator"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) is one of the most complex abdominal operations to perform, and it is usually conducted for tumours of the periampullary region and chronic pancreatitis. Minimally invasive surgery has been progressively being developed for pancreatic surgery, first with the advent of hybrid-laparoscopy and recently with total laparoscopic surgery. Issues including the safety and efficacy of total laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (TLPD) and open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD) are currently being debated. Studies comparing these two surgical techniques are emerging, and large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are lacking but are clearly required. METHODS AND ANALYSIS TJDBPS01 is a multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled, parallel-group, superiority trial in 14 centres with pancreatic surgery experts who have performed 104 TLPDs and OPDs. A total of 656 patients who will undergo PD are randomly allocated to the TLPD group or OPD group in a 1:1 ratio. The trial hypothesis is that TLPD has superior or equivalent safety and advantages in postoperative recovery compared with OPD. The primary outcome is the postoperative length of stay.

In this paper we examine whether daily news sentiment of several companies and Twitter sentiment from their CEOs have an impact on their market performance and whether traditional news sources and Twitter activity of heads of government impact the benchmark indexes of major world economies over a period spanning the outbreak of the SAR-COV-2 pandemic. Our results indicate that there is very limited correlation between Twitter sentiment and price movements and that this does not change much when returns are taken relative to the market or when the market is calm or turbulent. There is almost no correlation under any circumstances between non-financial news sources and price movements, however there is some correlation between financial news sentiment and stock price movements. We also find this correlation gets stronger when returns are taken relative to the market. There are fewer companies correlated in both turbulent and calm economic times. There is no clear pattern to the direction and strength of the correlation, with some being strongly negatively correlated and others being strongly positively correlated, but in general the size of the correlation tends to indicate that price movement is driving sentiment, except in the turbulent economic times of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic in 2020.","output":"Comparing traditional news and social media with stock price movements; which comes first, the news or the price change?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A unique and sudden need for virtual medical visits created by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented expansion of telemedicine across nearly all medical specialties in the United States.

However, the literature regarding telehealth accessibility for low-income, non-English-speaking, and minority patients remains limited. Through a cross-sectional analysis comparing 2019 clinic visits with 2020 telehealth visits at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, we demonstrate specialty-specific changes in patient demographics, including a younger population, fewer non-English-speaking patients, and a relative preservation of minority, Medicaid, and Medicare patients among telehealth visits in comparison to clinic visits.

Its allocation involves ethical considerations that may be different to usual times. There is limited pre-pandemic literature on the ethical factors that ECMO physicians consider during ECMO allocation. During the pandemic, there has been relatively little professional guidance specifically relating to ethics and ECMO allocation; although there has been active ethical debate about allocation of other critical care resources. We report the results of a small international exploratory survey of ECMO clinicians views on different patient factors in ECMO decision-making prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We then outline current ethical decision procedures and recommendations for rationing life-sustaining treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, and examine the extent to which current guidelines for ECMO allocation (and reported practice) adhere to these ethical guidelines and recommendations. METHODS: An online survey was performed with responses recorded between mid May and mid August 2020. Participants (n = 48) were sourced from the ECMOCard study groupan international group of experts (n = 120) taking part in a prospective international study of ECMO and intensive care for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey compared the extent to which certain ethical factors involved in ECMO resource allocation were considered prior to and during the pandemic. RESULTS: When initiating ECMO during the pandemic, compared to usual times, participants reported giving more ethical weight to the benefit of ECMO to other patients not yet admitted as opposed to those already receiving ECMO, (p < 0.001). If a full unit were referred a good candidate for ECMO, participants were more likely during the pandemic to consider discontinuing ECMO from a current patient with low chance of survival (53% during pandemic vs. 33% prior p = 0.002). If the clinical team recommends that ECMO should cease, but family do not agree, the majority of participants indicated that they would continue treatment, both in usual circumstances (67%) and during the pandemic (56%). CONCLUSIONS: We found differences during the COVID-19 pandemic in prioritisation of several ethical factors in the context of ECMO allocation. The ethical principles prioritised by survey participants were largely consistent with ECMO allocation guidelines, current ethical decision procedures and recommendations for allocation of life-sustaining treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Clinical records were reviewed for laboratory results and neurological symptoms at initial presentation. Imaging results were reported in consensus by two experienced radiologists at each center.Findings: Twenty-eight consecutive patients were evaluated (16 female, mean age 36.6  8.6 years). Most patients suffered from headache (89%), followed by fatigue and common cold symptoms (11%). Further neurological findings included visual, sensory and speech or language impairment (7% each), and dizziness (4%).

Topics covered included safety measures, protective equipment used and protocols around the use of flexible nasendoscopy (FNE) in clinic. RESULTS: 117 participants completed the survey covering 66 Trusts across the UK. There was a significant reduction in face-to-face clinic patients compared to pre-pandemic numbers. Room down-time after FNE ranged from 0-6 hours and there was a significant increase in allocated down-time after the patient had coughed or sneezed. Natural ventilation existed in 36% of clinics and the majority of responders didnt know the calculated Air Change Per Hour (ACPH) of the room (77%). Where ACPH was known, it often did not match the allocated room down-time.

Two approaches were exploited to assess the historical building: the first approach is inductive (review of the case study before and after restoration, its impacts on livability);and second is a field approach based on site visits to collect data on the environmental and energy consumption (energy audit);social sustainability (visitors patterns);and economic sustainability (jobs opportunity). Results revealed that the social and cultural values prioritized and the youth represents 71% of the visitors/hr during COVID-19. The environmental and energy audit assessment shows that the restoration met RIBAs energy efficiency benchmark (50kWh/m2 (good) and 70kWh/m2 (typical)). For the economic sustainability, tickets are affordable and the palace creates 38 jobs. The social media analysis indicates a high interaction.

COVID-19 has largely impacted on our societies through both direct and indirect effects transmitted by the policy measures to counter the spread of viruses. We quantitatively analysed the multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our societies including people's mobility, health, and social behaviour changes. People's mobility has changed significantly due to the implementation of travel restriction and quarantine measurements. Indeed, the physical distance has widened at international (cross-border), national and regional level. At international level, due to the travel restrictions, the number of international flights has plunged overall at around 88 percent during March. In particular, the number of flights connecting Europe dropped drastically in mid of March after the United States announced travel restrictions to Europe and the EU and participating countries agreed to close borders, at 84 percent decline compared to March 10th. Similarly, we examined the impacts of quarantine measures in the major city: Tokyo (Japan), New York City (the United States), and Barcelona (Spain). Within all three cities, we found the significant decline in traffic volume. We also identified the increased concern for mental health through the analysis of posts on social networking services such as Twitter and Instagram. Notably, in the beginning of April 2020, the number of post with #depression on Instagram doubled, which might reflect the rise in mental health awareness among Instagram users.

This has prompted the emergence of critical just-in-time COVID-19 education, including rapid simulation preparedness, evaluation and training across all healthcare sectors. Simulation has been proven to be pivotal for both healthcare provider learning and systems integration in the context of testing and integrating new processes, workflows, and rapid changes to practice (e.g., new cognitive aids, checklists, protocols) and changes to the delivery of clinical care. The individual, team, and systems learnings generated from proactive simulation training is occurring at unprecedented volume and speed in our healthcare system. Establishing a clear process to collect and report simulation outcomes has never been more important for staff and patient safety to reduce preventable harm. Our provincial simulation program in the province of Alberta, Canada (population = 4.37 million; geographic area = 661,848 km2), has rapidly responded to this need by leading the intake, design, development, planning, and co-facilitation of over 400 acute care simulations across our province in both urban and rural Emergency Departments, Intensive Care Units, Operating Rooms, Labor and Delivery Units, Urgent Care Centers, Diagnostic Imaging and In-patient Units over a 5-week period to an estimated 30,000 learners of real frontline team members.

METHODS: A mixed study design (retrospective record data review and case study) was employed among 67 malaria officers from all zones in the region by using proportional allocation and the 1995 to 2020 malaria document review. 1995 to 2020 trend analysis was conducted using RStudio-1.2.5033. Vignette Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were used to dig the possible factors for malaria case buildup using the purposive sampling technique, and a qualitative content analysis was used. RESULTS: The overall mean test positivity rate (TPR) was 21.9%, and about 80% of the land of the region was malarious, and 68% of the population was at risk of malaria in the study area from the data records of 1995 to 2020. The year 2012 to 2016 had the peak confirmed malaria cases, while the year 2016 to 2018 dramatically reduced followed by an increase in 2019/2020. The vignette FGDs identified that poor performance on Larval Source Management (LSM) and net utilization, no stock of some antimalarial medicine and supply, quality of malaria diagnosis services, the low commitment of leaders, and climatic anomalies facilitated surge of the disease in 2019/2020. No real accountability at all levels, low coverage of targeted vector control interventions, resource constraint, data quality and use for informed decision making, security issues and Internally Displaced Population (IDP) in various parts of the country, and the COVID-19 pandemic were the possible causes for case buildup.

Although, different forms of vaccines are being rolled out for vaccination programs around the globe, the mutation of the virus is still a cause of concern among the research communities. Hence, it is important to study the constantly evolving virus and its strains in order to provide a much more stable form of cure. This fact motivated us to conduct this research where we have initially carried out multiple sequence alignment of 15359 and 3033 global dataset without Indian and the dataset of exclusive Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes respectively, using MAFFT. Subsequently, phylogenetic analyses are performed using Nextstrain to identify virus clades. Consequently, the virus strains are found to be distributed among 5 major clades or clusters viz. 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B and 20C. Thereafter, mutation points as SNPs are identified in each clade. Henceforth, from each clade top 10 signature SNPs are identified based on their frequency i.e. number of occurrences in the virus genome. As a result, 50 such signature SNPs are individually identified for global dataset without Indian and dataset of exclusive Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes respectively. Out of each 50 signature SNPs, 39 and 41 unique SNPs are identified among which 25 non-synonymous signature SNPs (out of 39) resulted in 30 amino acid changes in protein while 27 changes in amino acid are identified from 22 non-synonymous signature SNPs (out of 41). These 30 and 27 amino acid changes for the non-synonymous signature SNPs are visualised in their respective protein structure as well. Finally, in order to judge the characteristics of the identified clades, the non-synonymous signature SNPs are considered to evaluate the changes in proteins as biological functions with the sequences using PROVEAN and PolyPhen-2 while I-Mutant 2.0 is used to evaluate their structural stability. As a consequence, for global dataset without Indian sequences, G251V in ORF3a in clade 19A, F308Y and G196V in NSP4 and ORF3a in 19B are the unique amino acid changes which are responsible for defining each clade as they are all deleterious and unstable. Such changes which are common for both global dataset without Indian and dataset of exclusive Indian sequences are R203M in Nucleocapsid for 20B, T85I and Q57H in NSP2 and ORF3a respectively for 20C while for exclusive Indian sequences such unique changes are A97V in RdRp, G339S and G339C in NSP2 in 19A and Q57H in ORF3a in 20A.","output":"Characterisation of SARS-CoV-2 Clades based on Signature SNPs unveils Continuous Evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Covid-19 has created an emergency of epic proportions While a vaccine may be forthcoming, this is not guaranteed, as discussed herein The potential problems and ominous signs include: a) Lung injury that developed in animals given an experimental vaccine for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1);b) A perversion of adaptive immune responses called antibody-dependent-enhancement (ADE) of infection that occurs in SARS-CoV-1 and that may occur in people vaccinated for Covid-19;c) The frequent and recurrent infections that are caused by respiratory coronaviruses;and d) The appearance of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which raise the specter of vaccine escape mutants Because success is uncertain, alternatives to vaccines need to be vigorously pursued during this critical moment in the pandemic Alternatives include: a) Engineered monoclonal antibodies that do not cause ADE;b) Cocktails of antiviral drugs and inhibitors of the cellular proteins required for SARS-CoV-2 replication;c) Interferons;and d) Anticoagulants, antioxidants, and immune modulators To organize and coordinate the systematic investigation of existing therapies and new therapies (as they emerge), a Covid-19 clinical trials network is needed to provide: a) Robust funding (on a par with vaccine funding) and administration;b) An adaptive trial design committee to prioritize interventions and review results in real-time;c) A computer interface to facilitate patient enrollment, make data available to investigators, and present findings;d) A practice guidelines study group;and e) A mobile corps of Covid-19 experts available for rapid deployment to assist local healthcare providers and enroll patients in trials as outbreaks occur To combat the Covid-19 pandemic and future mass contagions, the network would be a cornerstone of a comprehensive infectious diseases research program","output":"How to survive Covid-19 even if the vaccine fails"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A recent article showed that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients quarantined in isolation facilities instead of in their homes help control the spread of the virus.

Laparoscopic technique includes the placement of an intraperitoneal onlay mesh with fixation achieved using spiral tacks or sutures. An additional step is the closure of the fascial defect depending upon its size. Key outcomes in the evaluation of ventral abdominal hernia surgery include postoperative pain, the presence of infection, seroma formation and hernia recurrence. TACKoMESH is a randomised controlled trial that will provide important information on the laparoscopic repair of an incisional hernia; 1) with fascial closure, 2) with an IPOM mesh and 3) comparing the use of an articulating mesh-fixation device that deploys absorbable tacks with a straight-arm mesh-fixation device that deploys non-absorbable tacks. METHODS A prospective, single-centre, double-blinded randomised trial, TACKoMESH, will establish whether the use of absorbable compared to non-absorbable tacks in adult patients undergoing elective incisional hernia repair produces a lower rate of pain both immediately and long-term. Eligible and consenting patients will be randomized to surgery with one of two tack-fixation devices and followed up for a minimum one year. Secondary outcomes to be explored include wound infection, seroma formation, hernia recurrence, length of postoperative hospital stay, reoperation rate, operation time, health related quality of life and time to return to normal daily activity. DISCUSSION With ongoing debate around the best management of incisional hernia, continued trials that will add substance are both necessary and important. Laparoscopic techniques have become established in reducing hospital stay and rates of infection and report improvement in some patient centered outcomes whilst achieving similarly low rates of recurrence as open surgical techniques. The laparoscopic method with tack fixation has developed a reputation for its tendency to cause post-operative pain. Novel additions to technique, such as intraoperative-sutured closure of a fascial defect, and developments in surgical technology, such as the evolution of composite mesh design and mesh-fixation devices, have brought about new considerations for patient and surgeon. This study will evaluate the efficacy of several new technical considerations in the setting of elective laparoscopic incisional hernia repair.

While miRNAs are increasingly recognized for their roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in animals and plants, miRNAs in fungi were less well studied and their potential roles in fungal dimorphism were largely unknown. Based on P. marneffei genome sequence, we hypothesize that miRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) may be expressed in the dimorphic fungus. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We attempted to identify milRNAs in P. marneffei in both mycelial and yeast phase using high-throughput sequencing technology. Small RNAs were more abundantly expressed in mycelial than yeast phase. Sequence analysis revealed 24 potential milRNA candidates, including 17 candidates in mycelial and seven in yeast phase. Two genes, dcl-1 and dcl-2, encoding putative Dicer-like proteins and the gene, qde-2, encoding Argonaute-like protein, were identified in P. marneffei. Phylogenetic analysis showed that dcl-2 of P. marneffei was more closely related to the homologues in other thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungi than to Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus spp., suggesting the co-evolution of dcl-2 among the thermal dimorphic fungi. Moreover, dcl-2 demonstrated higher mRNA expression levels in mycelial than yeast phase by 7 folds (P<0.001). Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression of two milRNAs, PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, only in mycelial phase. Using dcl-1(KO), dcl-2(KO), dcl(DKO) and qde-2(KO) deletion mutants, we showed that the biogenesis of both milRNAs were dependent on dcl-2 but not dcl-1 or qde-2. The mRNA expression levels of three predicted targets of PM-milR-M1 were upregulated in knockdown strain PM-milR-M1 (KD), supporting regulatory function of milRNAs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings provided the first evidence for differential expression of milRNAs in different growth phases of thermal dimorphic fungi and shed light on the evolution of fungal proteins involved in milRNA biogenesis and possible role of post-transcriptional control in governing thermal dimorphism.","output":"Identification of MicroRNA-Like RNAs in Mycelial and Yeast Phases of the Thermal Dimorphic Fungus Penicillium marneffei"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare personnel are at risk to aquire the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

It is not clear, though, how much risk of mortality their different levels of elevations entail, and which marker signifies more risk than others and how much. This study was undertaken to describe their levels and to answer these questions regarding eight inflammatory markers, namely, CRP, D-dimer, ferritin, IL-6, LDH, CPK, troponin-I. MethodsThe data were retrieved from the electronic records of 19852 CoViD-19 patients admitted to a chain of hospitals in north India from March 2020 to July 2021. Levels for most markers were available for more than 10,000 patients. In view of widely different ranges of values of different markers, we divided their values into quintiles (Qs) and studied the pattern of mortality and for running the logistic regression. In addition, logarithm transformation was also tried. The statistical distribution of the values was compared by Mann-Whitney test. Relative importance was judged by the mortality rates, area under the ROC curves (AUROCs), and the odds ratios. ResultsAlthough the mortality increased with decreasing ALC and increasing level of all the other markers, more than 70% survived even with levels in the extreme quintile. The adjusted odds ratio was the highest (7.62) for the Q5 levels of IL-6, closely followed by D-dimer (OR = 6.04). The AUROC was the highest (0.817) for LDH and the least (0.612) for CPK. However, the optimal cut-off for any marker could correctly classify not more than 80% deaths and the multivariable logistic regression could correctly classify patients with mortality in less than 24% cases. ConclusionAlthough elevated levels of all the markers and low values of ALC were significant risk factor but no firm evidence was available for any of the eight markers to be a major indicator of the mortality in COVID-19 unless they reach to a critical threshold. Among those studied, D-Dimer (>192 ng/mL) followed by IL-6 (>4.5 pg/mL) had stronger association with mortality even with moderate and higher end of the normal levels and LDH (>433 U/L) and troponin-I (>0.002ng/mL) with only steeply increased levels. Ferritin had modest association, and CPK, CRP and ALC were a relatively poor risk of mortality.","output":"Relative Importance of Various Inflammatory Markers and Their Critical Thresholds for COVID-19 Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The role of combination immunomodulatory therapy with systemic corticosteroids and tocilizumab (TCZ) for aged patients with COVID19 associated cytokine release syndrome remains unclear.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a carboxypeptidase that degrades angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7, has been identified as a potent receptor for SARSCoV-2. In the last decades, ACE inhibition has assumed a central role in reducing cardiovascular and renal events. However, with the advent of COVID-19, attention has been turned to ACE-2 as a possible target to reduce virus binding to different human cells. This review aims to discuss recent developments related to medicinal properties of natural compounds as ACE/ACE-2 inhibitors, which should be highlighted in the future development of studies looking for modulators in SARSCoV-2 infection. Data show that bioactive compounds isolated from several natural products act by inhibiting ACE/ACE2, which changes the entire axis of this system. Of the compounds addressed in this review, 7 phenolic compounds, including quercetin, curcumin, naringenin, luteolin, hesperidin, mangiferin, and gallic acid showed binding affinity with molecular ACE-2 target in silico, and 1, esculetin, decreased ACE-2 expression in vivo. Regarding terpenoids and alkaloids, nimbin, withaferin A, andrographolide, zingiberene and, berberine, piperine and thebaine, respectively, showed binding affinity with molecular ACE-2 target in silico. These findings reinforce the need for future preclinical and clinical studies on these compounds and specific inhibitory effects on ACE-2 of all the other compounds described herein only as nonspecific ACE inhibitors.

The daily trend in reported cases has been rapidly rising in Latin America since March 2020 with the great majority of the cases reported in Brazil followed by Peru as of April 15th, 2020. Although Peru implemented a range of social distancing measures soon after the confirmation of its first case on March 6th, 2020, the daily number of new COVID-19 cases continues to accumulate in this country. We assessed the early COVID-19 transmission dynamics and the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima, Peru. We estimated the reproduction number, R, during the early transmission phase in Lima from the daily series of imported and autochthonous cases by the date of symptoms onset as of March 30th, 2020. We also assessed the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima by generating short-term forecasts grounded on the early transmission dynamics before interventions were put in place. Prior to the implementation of the social distancing measures in Lima, the local incidence curve by the date of symptoms onset displays near exponential growth dynamics with the mean scaling of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.9 (95%CI: 0.9,1.0) and the reproduction number at 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.5). Our analysis indicates that school closures and other social distancing interventions have helped slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus, with the nearly exponential growth trend shifting to an approximately linear growth trend soon after the broad scale social distancing interventions were put in place by the government.

Innovative affinity assays are needed due to the low throughput and/or limited dynamic range of available technologies. We combined microfluidic technology with quantum-mechanical scattering theory, in order to develop a high-throughput, broad-range methodology to measure affinity. Fluorescence intensity profiles were generated for out-of-equilibrium solutions of labelled mAbs and their antigen-binding fragments migrating along micro-columns with immobilized cognate antigen. Affinity quantification was performed by computational data analysis based on the Landau probability distribution. Experiments using a wide array of human or murine antibodies against bacterial or viral, protein or polysaccharide antigens, showed that all the antibody-antigen capture profiles (n = 841) generated at different concentrations were accurately described by the Landau distribution. A scale parameter W, proportional to the full-width-at-half-maximum of the capture profile, was shown to be independent of the antibody concentration. The W parameter correlated significantly (Pearsons r [pCvalue]: 0.89 [3  10(?8)]) with the equilibrium dissociation constant K(D), a gold-standard affinity measure. Our method showed good intermediate precision (median coefficient of variation: 5%) and a dynamic range corresponding to K(D) values spanning from ~10(?7) to ~10(?11) Molar. Relative to assays relying on antibody-antigen equilibrium in solution, even when they are microfluidic-based, the methods turnaround times were decreased from 2 days to 2 h.

ProLung?-budesonide enables the sustained, low dose administration of budesonide within a delivery vehicle similar to lung surfactant. ProLung?-budesonide may offer anti-inflammatory and protective effects to the lung in COVID-19, yet its effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of ProLung?-budesonide against SARS-CoV-2-infection in vitro, evaluate its ability to decrease inflammation, and airway hyperresponsiveness in an animal model of lung inflammation. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero 76 cells were treated with ProLung?-budesonide ([0.03C100 g/ml]) for 3 days, and virus yield in the supernatant was measured. Ovalbumin-sensitized C57BL/6 mice received aerosolized (a) ProLung?-budesonide weekly, (b) only budesonide, either daily or weekly, or (c) weekly empty ProLung? carrier (without budesonide). All treatment groups were compared to sensitized untreated, or normal mice using histopathologic examination, electron microscopy (EM), airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to Methacholine (Mch) challenge, and eosinophil peroxidase activity (EPO) measurements in bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL). RESULTS: ProLung?-budesonide showed significant inhibition of viral replication of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with the selectivity index (SI) value >24. Weekly ProLung?-budesonide and daily budesonide therapy significantly decreased lung inflammation and EPO in BAL. ProLung?-budesonide localized in type II pneumocytes, and was the only group to significantly decrease AHR, and EPO in BAL with Mch challenge CONCLUSIONS: ProLung?-budesonide significantly inhibited viral replication in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.

As India already has inadequate waste treatment facilities, and the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has led to significant growth of Bio-medical waste (BMW), consequently safe disposal of a large quantity of waste has become a more serious concern. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of BMW of India before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this article highlights the gaps in the implementation of BMW rules in India. This study uses various government and non-government organizations, reports and data specifically from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The finding of the study demonstrated that most of the States/Union Territories (UTs) of India are lacking in terms of COVID-19 waste management. India has generated over 32,996 mt of COVID-19 waste between June and December 2020. During this period, Maharashtra (789.99 mt/month) is highest average generator of COVID-19 waste, followed by Kerala (459.86 mt/month), Gujarat (434.87 mt/month), Tamil Nadu (427.23 mt/month), Uttar Pradesh (371.39 mt/month), Delhi (358.83 mt/month) and West Bengal (303.15 mt/month), and others respectively. We draw attention to the fact that many gaps were identified with compliance of BMW management rules. For example, out of all 35 States/UTs, health care facilitates (HCFs), only eight states received authorization as per BMW management rules. Moreover, the government strictly restricted the practice of deep burials; however, 23 States/UTs are still using the deep burial methods for BMW disposal. The present research suggests that those States/UTs generated on an average of 100 mt/month COVID-19 waste in the last 7 months (June-December 2020) should be considered as a high priority state. These states need special attention to implement BMW rules and should upgrade their BMW treatment capacity.","output":"Assessment of bio-medical waste before and during the emergency of novel Coronavirus disease pandemic in India: A gap analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Fellow Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Drug induced pneumonitis is a major cause of adverse events during cancer therapy, and has become increasingly common with the use of immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Due to its rarity, ICI pneumonitis is a diagnosis of exclusion, and infection and malignancy must be ruled out. While multiple types of infection are typically assessed for, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) pneumonia is often not considered. We report the case of a 75 year old man with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on pembrolizumab who died despite aggressive treatment for a presumed ICI pneumonitis, and was found on autopsy to have had HSV pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 75 year old man with NSCLC presented to hospital with two days of dyspnea. The patient was being treated with a multi-drug chemotherapy regimen, including pembrolizumab. His last cycle was five days prior to admission. On admission, he was found to be hypoxic, saturating 70% on room air, with course bilateral crackles, and extensive bilateral ground glass opacities on chest CT. He did not have leukocytosis. Multiple infectious studies, including COVID-19, CMV, respiratory viral panel, legionella, mycoplasma, beta-D glucan, and galactomannan were negative. ICI pneumonitis was highest on the differential, and the patient was therefore started on solumedrol. After two days of no improvement, the solumedrol was increased and infliximab was added. The patient's respiratory status continued to worsen, and he was ultimately intubated. The patient underwent bronchoscopy once intubated, however, he expired before the studies resulted. Autopsy revealed a severe HSV pneumonia. DISCUSSION: ICI pneumonitis occurs in approximately 5% of patients treated with PD(L)-1 inhibitors, of which approximately 25% of cases are graded as severe or life-threatening. While the vast majority of patients with non-severe disease are successfully treated by withholding the ICI alone or in conjunction with glucocorticoids, those with more severe disease may require additional immunosuppression, and a small number of these patients die despite treatment. Due to its rarity, ICI pneumonitis is a diagnosis of exclusion, and diagnoses such as infection and malignancy should always be ruled out. The fact that its radiographic presentation is so heterogenous, with patterns as variable as those seen with COP, NSIP, HP, and AIP/ARDS, makes it all the more difficult to diagnose. HSV pneumonia is known to infrequently cause pneumonia in severely immunocompromised patients. A prospective observational study conducted in 2018 on immunocompromised adults with pneumonia not responding to empiric antibiotic therapy found it to be much more common than expected, with 42% of patients testing positive for HSV-1 on BAL, and 24% meeting criteria for HSV pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: HSV pneumonia should be more frequently considered in immunocompromised patients suspected of having an ICI pneumonitis. REFERENCE #1: Nishino M, et al.

The aim of this report was to provide a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis on the use of HCQ/CQ with respect to safety and clinical efficacy of these medications. Methods: : We performed a systematic search of the medical databases and included studies if they focused on patients with COVID-19 who received HCQ or CQ alone, or in combination with other treatments, and were compared with a control group. We analyzed two important clinical objectives;viral clearance rate by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity and all-cause mortality. Results: : A total of 14 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. The use of HCQ/CQ was associated with higher viral clearance rate compared with control group (OR: 3.12, 95% CI: 2.17-4.49 p<0.0001). In the sensitivity analysis, the effect on viral clearance disappeared (OR 1.44, 95% CI: 0.87-2.37, p=0.155). The use of HCQ/CQ was associated with a higher risk of mortality (OR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.05-1.51, p<0.0001). Due to huge heterogeneity between the studies ( I 2 = 86%, p < 0.01), we performed a meta regression analysis. Both treatment within 24 hours (p=0.047) and comorbidities [hypertension (p=0.025), diabetes (p=0.049) and chronic lung disease (p=0.0064)] contributed to the heterogeneity.

Overall, the use of HCQ/CQ resulted in longer QTc intervals. Conclusions: : Our meta-analysis did not reveal a clinical benefit of HCQ/CQ on in-hospital outcomes for patients with COVID-19. The use of HCQ/CQ did not result in rapid viral clearance on RT-PCR.

To explore the role of eccentricity and the extra mass removal by jets in the GEE we use the stellar evolutionary code MESA~binary. The initial primary and secondary masses are M1i=15Mo and M2i=2.5Mo, respectively. We examine initial semi-major axes of 600-1000Ro, and eccentricities in the range of e=0-0.9. Both Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) and mass removal by jets, followed by a wind from the SN IIb progenitor, leave a hydrogen mass in the exploding star of M(H,f)=0.05Mo. This is compatible with a SN IIb progenitor. We find that in many cases, with and without the extra mass removal by jets, the system can enter a common envelope evolution (CEE) phase, and then gets out from it. Despite the large uncertainties, extra mass removal by jets substantially increases the likelihood of the system to get out from a CEE. This strengthens earlier conclusions for circular orbits. In some cases RLOF alone, without mass removal by jets, can form SN IIb progenitors. We estimate that the extra mass removal by jets in the GEE channel increases the number of progenitors relative to that by RLOF alone by about a factor of two.","output":"Eccentric grazing envelope evolution towards type IIb supernova progenitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Currently there are no reported series determining the Covid-19 infected lung cancer patients characteristics and outcome that allow us to clarify strategies to protect our patients.

We also describe clinical and demographic factors associated with poor prognosis and Covid-19 treatment outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 1878 medical records of all Covid-19 patients who were admitted at Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor of Madrid between March 5, 2020 and April 7, 2020, in order to detect cumulative incidence of Covid-19 in lung cancer patients. We also described Covid-19 treatment outcome, mortality and associated risk factors using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 17/1878 total diagnosis in our center had lung cancer (0.9%) versus 1878/320,000 of the total reference population (p = 0.09). 9/17 lung cancer patients with Covid-19 diagnosis died (52.3%) versus 192/1878 Covid-19 patients in our center (p<0.0001).

Objective: To determine whether fluvoxamine, given during mild COVID-19 illness, prevents clinical deterioration and decreases the severity of disease. Design, Setting, and Participants: Double-blind, randomized, fully remote (contactless) clinical trial of fluvoxamine vs placebo. Participants were community-living, nonhospitalized adults with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, with COVID-19 symptom onset within 7 days and oxygen saturation of 92% or greater. One hundred fifty-two participants were enrolled from the St Louis metropolitan area (Missouri and Illinois) from April 10, 2020, to August 5, 2020. The final date of follow-up was September 19, 2020. Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of fluvoxamine (n = 80) or placebo (n = 72) 3 times daily for 15 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was clinical deterioration within 15 days of randomization defined by meeting both criteria of (1) shortness of breath or hospitalization for shortness of breath or pneumonia and (2) oxygen saturation less than 92% on room air or need for supplemental oxygen to achieve oxygen saturation of 92% or greater. Results: Of 152 patients who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 46 [13] years; 109 [72%] women), 115 (76%) completed the trial.

The liposomes were prepared by thin-film hydration method, where BRD4 siRNA complexed with cationic lipid and exhibited 96.24  18.01 nm size and stable even in the presence of RNase. BRD4 siRNA lipoplexes (BRD4-siRNA-LP) inhibited inflammatory cells in lungs and suppressed the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced the neutrophil infiltration and mast cell accumulation. Also, BRD4 siRNA based nanomedicine significantly reduced the LPS induced cytokine storm followed by inflammatory signaling pathways. Interestingly, BRD4-siRNA-LP suppressed the LPS-induced p65 and STAT3 nuclear translocation and ameliorated the lung inflammation. Thus, BRD4-siRNA-LP could be a plausible therapeutic option for treating ARDS and might be useful for combating the COVID-19 associated respiratory illness.","output":"BRD4 targeting nanotherapy prevents lipopolysaccharide induced acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Failure to resolve inflammation underlies many prevalent pathologies. Recent insights have identified lipid mediators, typified by lipoxins (LXs), as drivers of inflammation resolution, suggesting potential therapeutic benefit.

StructureCactivity relationship (SAR) studies showed that (R)-6 (also referred to as AT-02-CT) was the most efficacious and potent anti-inflammatory compound of those tested. (R)-6 significantly attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and tumor-necrosis-factor- (TNF-)-induced NF-B activity in monocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. The molecular target of (R)-6 was investigated. (R)-6 activated the endogenous LX receptor formyl peptide receptor 2 (ALX/FPR2). The anti-inflammatory properties of (R)-6 were further investigated in vivo in murine models of acute inflammation. Consistent with in vitro observations, (R)-6 attenuated inflammatory responses.

The alarming health context coupled with the emergence of resistant M. tuberculosis strains highlights the urgent need to expand the range of anti-TB antibiotics. A subset of anti-TB drugs in use are prodrugs that require bioactivation by a class of M. tuberculosis enzymes called Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs), which remain understudied. To examine the prevalence and the molecular function of BVMOs in mycobacteria, we applied a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis that identified six BVMOs in M. tuberculosis, including Rv3083 (MymA), Rv3854c (EthA), Rv0565c, and Rv0892, which were selected for further characterization. Homology modeling and substrate docking analysis, performed on this subset, suggested that Rv0892 is closer to the cyclohexanone BVMO, while Rv0565c and EthA are structurally and functionally similar to MymA, which is by far the most prominent type I BVMO enzyme. Thanks to an unprecedented purification and assay optimization, biochemical studies confirmed that all four BVMOs display BV-oxygenation activity. We also showed that MymA displays a distinctive substrate preference that we further investigated by kinetic parameter determination and that correlates with in silico modeling. We provide insights into distribution of BVMOs and the structural basis of their substrate profiling, and we discuss their possible redundancy in M. tuberculosis, raising questions about their versatility in prodrug activation and their role in physiology and infection. IMPORTANCE Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The rise in drug resistance highlights the urgent need for innovation in anti-TB drug development. Many anti-TB drugs require bioactivation by Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs). Despite their emerging importance, BVMO structural and functional features remain enigmatic. We applied a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis and confirmed the presence of six BVMOs in M. tuberculosis, including MymA, EthA, and Rv0565cactivators of the second-line prodrug ethionamideand the novel BVMO Rv0892. Combining in silico characterization with in vitro validation, we outlined their structural framework and substrate preference. Markedly, MymA displayed an enhanced capacity and a distinct selectivity profile toward ligands, in agreement with its catalytic site topology. These features ground the molecular basis for structure-function comprehension of the specificity in these enzymes and expand the repertoire of BVMOs with selective and/or overlapping activity for application in the context of improving anti-TB therapy.","output":"Bioinformatic Mining and Structure-Activity Profiling of Baeyer-Villiger Monooxygenases from Mycobacterium tuberculosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The relatively low partial pressure of oxygen, reduced oxygen saturation, and aberrant plasma metabolites in COVID-19 may alter energy metabolism in peripheral immune cells. However, little is known regarding the immunometabolic defects of T cells in COVID-19 patients, which may contribute to the deregulated immune functions of these cells. In this study, we longitudinally characterized the metabolic profiles of resting and activated T cells from acutely infected and convalescent COVID-19 patients by flow cytometry and confirmed the metabolic profiles with a Seahorse analyzer. Non-COVID-19 and healthy subjects were enrolled as controls. We found that ex vivo T cells from acutely infected COVID-19 patients were highly activated and apoptotic and displayed more extensive mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction, especially cells in CD8+ T cell lineages, than those from convalescent COVID-19 patients or healthy controls, but slightly disturbed mitochondrial metabolic activity was observed in non-COVID-19 patients. Importantly, plasma IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels positively correlated with mitochondrial mass and negatively correlated with fatty acid uptake in T cells from COVID-19 patients. Additionally, compared with those from healthy controls, in vitro-activated T cells from acutely infected COVID-19 patients showed signs of lower glycolysis, a reduced glycolytic capacity, and a decreased glycolytic reserve, accompanied by lower activation of mTOR signaling. Thus, newly identified defects in T cell mitochondrial metabolic functions and metabolic reprogramming upon activation might contribute to immune deficiency in COVID-19.","output":"Metabolic Defects of Peripheral T Cells in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine is considered as the \\"Natural evolution of healthcare in the digital world.\\" In India, considering the vast geographical spread, predominant rural population, and sound medicinal services overwhelmingly accessible in urban areas, telemedicine has immense potential to grow from its nascent stages.

However, infection with COVID-19 is currently rare in children. Objective To discuss the latest findings and research focus on the basis of characteristics of children confirmed with COVID-19, and provide an insight into the future treatment and research direction. Methods: We searched the terms \\"COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2\\" AND \\"Pediatric OR children\\" on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, NIH, CDC, and CNKI. The authors also reviewed the guidelines published on Chinese CDC and Chinese NHC. Results: We included 25 published literature references related to the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, accessary examination, treatment, and prognosis of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: The numbers of children with COVID-19 pneumonia infection are small, and most of them come from family aggregation. Symptoms are mainly mild or even asymptomatic, which allow children to be a risk factor for transmission. Thus, strict epidemiological history screening is needed for early diagnosis and segregation. This holds especially for infants, who are more susceptible to infection than other age groups in pediatric age, but have most likely subtle and unspecific symptoms. They need to be paid more attention to. CT examination is a necessity for screening the suspected cases, because most of the pediatric patients are mild cases, and plain chest X-ray do not usually show the lesions or the detailed features. Therefore, early chest CT examination combined with pathogenic detection is a recommended clinical diagnosis scheme in children. The risk factors which may suggest severe or critical progress for children are: Fast respiratory rate and/or; lethargy and drowsiness mental state and/or; lactate progressively increasing and/or; imaging showed bilateral or multi lobed infiltration, pleural effusion or rapidly expending of lesions in a short period of time and/or; less than 3 months old or those who underly diseases. For those critical pediatric patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, polypnea may be the most common symptom. For treatment, the elevated PCT seen in children in contrast to adults suggests that the underlying coinfection/secondary infection may be more common in pediatric patients and appropriate antibacterial treatment should be considered. Once cytokine storm is found in these patients, anti-autoimmune or blood-purifying therapy should be given in time. Furthermore, effective isolation measures and appropriate psychological comfort need to be provided timely.","output":"A Mini Review on Current Clinical and Research Findings for Children Suffering from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While successful containment measures of COVID-19 in China and many European countries have led to flattened curves, case numbers are rising dramatically in other countries, with the emergence of a second wave expected.

This study examined the prevalence of and temporal changes in CPD, its early and follow-up predictors and the extent to which it was predictive of mental health problems. METHODS: The study took a two-wave design approach and was conducted during and 3-4 months after the nationwide lockdown in France. Baseline participants were 1,123 (79.5% women; M age = 33.82; range: 18-80). They completed validated measures assessing CPD, posttraumatic stress (PTS), depression, and anxiety symptoms. Descriptive, correlational, and path model analyses were used. FINDINGS: Both baseline and follow-up groups presented similar psychosocial profiles. Overall, 35.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 32.7-38.4) baseline participants and 17.2% (95% CI: 12.6-22.7) follow-up participants developed clinical cases of CPD. The baseline CPD levels predicted 14 to 20% of the variances of PTS (b = 0.55), depression (b = 0.16) and anxiety symptoms (b = 0.16). After accounting for the effect of the baseline CPD levels, the current CPD levels predicted the three investigated mental health outcomes in high proportions (43 to 47%). Further findings revealed important temporal changes in baseline predictors of CPD. However, the chronic CPD and PTS symptoms were prevalent among students and individuals developing worries about the COVID-19 crisis while depression and anxiety symptoms were prevalent among single people and those with pre-existing mental health problems.

A variety of recommended home fluids (RHF) exist as alternative forms of ORT; however, it is unclear whether RHF prevent child mortality. Previous studies have shown considerable variation between countries in ORS and RHF use, but subnational variation is unknown. This study aims to produce high-resolution geospatial estimates of relative and absolute coverage of ORS, RHF, and ORT (use of either ORS or RHF) in LMICs. METHODS We used a Bayesian geostatistical model including 15 spatial covariates and data from 385 household surveys across 94 LMICs to estimate annual proportions of children younger than 5 years of age with diarrhoea who received ORS or RHF (or both) on continuous continent-wide surfaces in 2000-17, and aggregated results to policy-relevant administrative units. Additionally, we analysed geographical inequality in coverage across administrative units and estimated the number of diarrhoeal deaths averted by increased coverage over the study period. Uncertainty in the mean coverage estimates was calculated by taking 250 draws from the posterior joint distribution of the model and creating uncertainty intervals (UIs) with the 25th and 975th percentiles of those 250 draws. FINDINGS While ORS use among children with diarrhoea increased in some countries from 2000 to 2017, coverage remained below 50% in the majority (626%; 12 417 of 19 823) of second administrative-level units and an estimated 6 519 000 children (95% UI 5 254 000-7 733 000) with diarrhoea were not treated with any form of ORT in 2017. Increases in ORS use corresponded with declines in RHF in many locations, resulting in relatively constant overall ORT coverage from 2000 to 2017. Although ORS was uniformly distributed subnationally in some countries, within-country geographical inequalities persisted in others; 11 countries had at least a 50% difference in one of their units compared with the country mean. Increases in ORS use over time were correlated with declines in RHF use and in diarrhoeal mortality in many locations, and an estimated 52 230 diarrhoeal deaths (36 910-68 860) were averted by scaling up of ORS coverage between 2000 and 2017. Finally, we identified key subnational areas in Colombia, Nigeria, and Sudan as examples of where diarrhoeal mortality remains higher than average, while ORS coverage remains lower than average. INTERPRETATION To our knowledge, this study is the first to produce and map subnational estimates of ORS, RHF, and ORT coverage and attributable child diarrhoeal deaths across LMICs from 2000 to 2017, allowing for tracking progress over time. Our novel results, combined with detailed subnational estimates of diarrhoeal morbidity and mortality, can support subnational needs assessments aimed at furthering policy makers' understanding of within-country disparities. Over 50 years after the discovery that led to this simple, cheap, and life-saving therapy, large gains in reducing mortality could still be made by reducing geographical inequalities in ORS coverage.

As a result, growing numbers of clinicians are being encouraged to pursue research as part of their clinical roles, including in allied health (AH). However, while the benefits of having clinician researchers embedded in AH services have been well established, the career needs of those engaged in these dual roles are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine perspectives of the career pathway for AH clinicians engaged in clinician researcher roles within Australian health services. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted, utilizing semi-structured interviews. Purposive sampling was used to ensure selection of varied locations, professions and role types. Results were analysed using thematic analysis. Trustworthiness was established using regular peer debriefing during theme development, and respondent validation of final themes. RESULTS: Fifty-seven AH clinician researchers, including those who did and did not have research as a formal component of their current role, participated in semi-structured interviews. Key themes were as follows: (1) clinician researchers prefer roles which are embedded in health services; (2) current opportunities for clinician researcher roles in health are insufficient; (3) there are deficiencies in the pathway for clinician researcher careers; (4) clinician researchers are not always valued or incentivized by health services; (5) the current career challenges impair the viability of clinician researcher careers; and (6) the clinician researcher career path has been improving, and there is hope it will continue to improve. CONCLUSION: This study outlines a number of weaknesses in the current career structure and opportunities for AH clinician researchers in Australian health services. In particular, while there are strong intrinsic drivers to pursue this dual career, extrinsic drivers are poorly developed, including a lack of job opportunities, an unstable career pathway and a lack of valuing or incentivizing this career choice within health services. This often means that clinician researchers feel compelled to choose between a research or clinical career, leading to loss of this valuable combined skill set. The findings of this research may assist health services in developing and supporting improved clinician researcher career pathways.

The paper utilizes a biopsychosocial approach to expound on the link between immunosenescence and COVID-19 risk factors. The article explores biological factors such as malnutrition, comorbidities, substance abuse, and sex. It also expands on psychosocial factors such as mental health disorders, homelessness, unemployment, lack of physical exercises, stigma, and discrimination. The article calls for gerontological social work to assume a developmental-clinical social work perspective to prevent the early onset and progression of immunosenescence.

A unique feature of LAMS is their ability to approximate the adjoining structures, thereby minimizing the potential for leak and perforation. Consequently, the innovation has advanced our ability to carry out complex therapeutic interventions and obviate the need for high-risk surgical procedures, particularly in morbid patients. However, a keen awareness of the technical design of LAMS and its implication on treatment effect is important to minimize adverse events and to improve clinical outcomes.

Conventional carotid artery sacrifice with detachable coils alone often requires numerous coils to complete occlusion. OBJECTIVE To describe the initial human experience with balloon-augmented Onyx and coil vessel sacrifice based on our previous experience with animals. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent carotid artery sacrifice between 2008 and 2012 in accordance with local investigational review board approval. Two methods were used to occlude carotid arteries-namely, combined Onyx and coil embolization and traditional coil embolization. We compared the two methods for the cost of embolizate, time to occlude the vessels, and the number of coils. RESULTS Eight consecutive patients (combined group n=3, traditional group n=5) were assessed. The median cost of embolic material was $6321 in the combined Onyx and coil embolization group and $29 996 in the traditional coil embolization group. The median time from first coil placement to achievement of vessel occlusion was 52 min in the Onyx group and 113 min in the coil embolization group. The median number of coils used was 4 in the Onyx group and 35 in the coil embolization group (p<0.05). No symptomatic complications or recurrences were seen in the combined group. CONCLUSIONS Balloon-augmented Onyx endovascular ligation may reduce costs and fluoroscopy times during vessel sacrifice. Further studies in a larger number of patients are needed to confirm these findings.","output":"Balloon-augmented Onyx endovascular ligation: initial human experience and comparison with coil ligation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online supplemental material is available for this article.","output":"Imaging Publications in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Applying New Research Results to Clinical Practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The extensive production and use of nanomaterials have resulted in the continuous release of nano-sized particles into the environment, and the health risks caused by exposure to these nanomaterials in the occupational population and the general population cannot be ignored.

This association is not exclusively mediated by mechanical factors and may reflect direct pulmonary injury by adipose-derived mediators. RESEARCH QUESTION Is adipose tissue involved in the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease (ILD)? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We evaluated the association of CT measures of pericardial, abdominal visceral, and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue, with high attenuation areas (HAA) and interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) in a large multi-center cohort study of community-dwelling adults, using multivariable-adjusted models. We secondarily evaluated the association of adipose depot size with FVC and biomarkers of obesity and inflammation. RESULTS In fully adjusted models, every doubling in pericardial adipose tissue volume was associated with a 63.4-unit increase in HAA (95%CI 55.5-71.3), 20% increased odds of ILA (95%CI -2% to 50%), and a 5.5% decrease in percent-predicted FVC (95%CI -6.8% to -4.3%). Interleukin-6 levels accounted for 8% of the association between pericardial adipose tissue and HAA. Every doubling in visceral adipose tissue area was associated with a 41.5-unit increase in HAA (95%CI 28.3-54.7), 30% increased odds of ILA (95%CI -10% to 80%), and a 5.4% decrease in percent-predicted FVC (95%CI -6.6% to -4.3%). Interleukin-6 and leptin accounted for 17% and 18%, respectively, of the association between visceral adipose tissue and HAA.

Objective This retrospective cohort study assessed changes from in-person to virtual care during the pandemic in patients with persistent asthma compared the same time period prior to the pandemic. Methods Kaiser Permanente Colorado members aged 18-99 with persistent asthma, were evaluated during two time periods (March to October 2019 and March to October 2020). Comparison of asthma exacerbations (hospitalizations, emergency department visits, courses of oral prednisone) and asthma medication metrics were evaluated between the two time periods and by type of care received during the pandemic (no care, virtual care only, in-person care only or a mix of virtual and in-person care). Population characteristics by type of care received during the pandemic were also evaluated. Results Among 7,805 adults with persistent asthma, those who used more virtual care or sought no care during the pandemic were younger, had fewer co-morbidities, mental health diagnoses, or financial barriers. Exacerbations decreased (0.264 to 0.214, p <.001) as did courses of prednisone (0.213 to 0.169), asthma medication adherence (0.53 to 0.54, p <.001) and the Asthma Medication Ratio, a quality-of-care metric, (0.755 to 0.762, p <.001) increased slightly. Patients receiving a mix of in-person and virtual care had the highest rate of exacerbations (0.83) and lower AMR (0.74) despite having the highest adherence.

However, relatively little is known about whether the volatility is dominated by housing demand or supply, and how different priced markets contribute to the volatility. This article first examines the temporal effect of COVID-19 on house prices, housing demand, and supply in Los Angeles, and second explores the effect heterogeneity in luxury and low-end housing markets within the city. For identification, the article employs a revised difference-in-differences (DID) method that controls more rigorously for unobservables and improves on the traditional DID with smaller prior trends. Using individual level data, the result first shows that, in response to the outbreak, house prices, demand, and supply all decreased in March to May 2020 and increased in July and August 2020, with demand dominating the process. Second, the heterogeneity exploration identifies diverging COVID-19 impacts in higher- and lower- priced markets. Particularly, the decline in overall price and demand before June originates mainly from the lower-priced market while the higher-priced one experienced limited changes in demand. After July, higher-priced markets led housing markets surge in price, demand, and supply, whereas the lower-priced market has not fully recovered from decreases in house prices and housing demand. Finally, a larger price decline in lower-priced markets is found to be associated with higher service shares and lower homeownership rates. The results not only facilitate market participants in their decision making but also aid local governments in formulating policies and allocating subsidies to mitigate the effects of the outbreak.","output":"Housing market volatility under COVID-19: Diverging response of demand in luxury and low-end housing markets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study compared postpartum and control women on depressive, anxiety, and OCD-type symptoms, and eating disorder symptoms during the 2019-nCOV pandemic and evaluated if associations between 2019-nCOV distress and these mental health symptoms differed for postpartum compared to control women.

Our research group conducted a large pragmatic cluster randomized influenza vaccine trial in 965 nursing homes (NCT03965195). Due to the pandemic and its impact after the influenza season, we prospectively collected reports of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and performed a prospective study on the association between contract staffing and reported outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized those using more contract nursing care would have higher risk of an outbreak. METHODS: From February through April, we collected monthly facility-level, self-reported data on SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. Facility characteristics were taken from public data from Centers for Medicaid and Medicare services. Predictors of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks were identified using a LASSO variable selection procedure, with a generalized linear, Poisson family model. Facility characteristics evaluated include demographics (e.g. number of residents), influenza vaccination rates, quality measures (e.g. % with UTI), and functional status (e.g. % with tube feedings). Facilities with contract staffing hours in the upper 25% quantile of direct care (RN, LPN, CNA) were considered heavy use. RESULTS: Of 965 randomized NHs, 663/965 (69%) reported data on SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. On average, 13% of facilities had at least one outbreak, with 5/842 (0.5%) outbreaks in February, 91/835 (10.8%) in March and 217/686 (30%) in April. SARS-CoV-2 (+) facilities were larger (average total beds, 151 vs. 117), but were mostly similar by functional and cognitive status. Occupancy rate, total residents, Influenza vaccination rate, % with UTI, receiving respiratory treatments, tube feedings, and Medicaid payers were adjusted for in the analysis. The heavy use of contract staffing included those with >223 hours per quarter. A multivariable regression found the relative risk SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was 1.56 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.22, 1.99) with heavy use of contract staffing. CONCLUSION: The participating nursing homes in our vaccine trial with SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks were larger.

However, even tough hypovitaminosis D has been suggested to interfere with Hcy catabolism, no study has so far addressed the interaction of vitamin D and Hcy and their impact on CAD, that was the aim of present study. A cohort of consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography in a single center were included and analyzed within the year 2019. Significant CAD was defined as at least 1 vessel stenosis > 50%, while severe CAD as left main and/or three-vessel disease. Hcy and vitamin D levels were assesssed at admission. We included 3150 patients undergoing coronary angiography at our centre, who were divided according to the quartiles values of vitamin D. Patients with lower levels of Vitamin D displayed a higher cardiovascular risk profile and a higher prevalence of CAD. We observed an inverse linear relationship between lower levels of vitamin D and higher Hcy (r = ? 0.092, p < 0.001) and a higher prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with lower quartiles values of vitamin D (p < 0.001). By forward conditional regression model, low vitamin D appeared as independent predictors of Homocysteine levels above the median (OR[95%CI] = 1.79[1.37C2.33], p < 0.001). In addition, patients with low vitamin D (below the median) and increased Hcy displayed a non-significantly higher rate of CAD (81% vs 77.7%, p = 0.13, adjusted OR[95%CI] = 1.16[0.88C1.54], p = 0.29) but a significant increase in the rate of severe left main/3-vessel CAD (37.4% vs 30.5%, p = 0.005, adjusted OR[95%CI] = 1.29[1.02C1.67], p = 0.04). Among patients with vitamin D levels above the median, Hcy levels did not impact on the prevalence and extent of CAD (77.7 vs 77.2%, p = 0.81, adjusted OR[95%CI] = 0.94[0.73C1.20], p = 0.60 for CAD and 31.8% vs 27.7%, p = 0.08, adjusted OR[95%CI] = 0.97[0.75C1.25], p = 0.81 for severe left main/3-vessel CAD). No significant interaction between Hcy and vitamin D with CAD or severe CAD was observed. The present study shows an independent inverse linear relationship between vitamin D and Hcy values. Moreover, the association of Hcy with the extent of CAD was significant only among patients with hypovitaminosis D, and not in the cohort of subjects with vitamin D levels above the median, suggesting that a normal vitamin D status can prevent the deleterious effects of hyperhomocysteinemia on coronary atherosclerosis, a hypothesis that certainly needs further confirmation in larger randomized trials.

Our data revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary B cells, macrophages and monocytes, which express variable levels of FcR, could be enhanced by convalescent serum from COVID-19 patients. We also determined the factors associated with ADE, and found which showed a time-dependent but not viral-dose dependent manner. Furthermore, the ADE effect is not associated with the neutralizing titer or RBD antibody level when testing serum samples collected from different patients.

Different countries have utilised a variety of containment policies with an emphasis on social distancing as a strategy to stop the spread of COVID-19. Quantifying the effects of such policies in different time-scales and comparing the efficacy of various available policies is of utmost importance for policy-makers in different countries. That is even more important when the policy-makers want to plan for long-term strategies and to weigh each option based on its epidemiological effects and socio-economic costs. In the absence of detailed knowledge of the interactions between individuals in a population and the characteristics of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, quantifying the effects of these policies is very difficult. Hence, there is an immediate need for models that can predict the spread of COVID-19 in a population, without the need for such detailed information. In this manuscript, a method is presented that can be used to predict the spread of COVID-19 in any country and under any containment policy imposed separately on different groups in the population. The method tunes the parameters of a known stratified model based on the available data on the spread of COVID-19. The model includes a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and is easy to simulate and easy to understand. As it is presented in this manuscript, the population is divided into age-groups. But given the availability of the data, there is no reason to limit the stratification into only age-groups and we can consider any relevant groups. To estimate the parameters of the model such that it reflects the characteristics of the spread of COVID-19 in a population, the method relies on an optimisation scheme. More specifically, the optimisation scheme estimates the contact rates between different age groups in the population. But a very important and useful feature of the model is that the estimated parameters for one population can be translated and used for any other population with a known age-structure, which in this day and age, includes almost any country or city in the world. Also, it is shown that the method is quite insensitive to the underlying assumptions in the optimisation scheme and also to deliberate or non-deliberate errors that might have occurred in collecting the data. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated using a case study under different containment policies, from an uncontained population to mitigation and suppression policies. Also, we can use the model to quantify the effects of strategies which include switching between different containment policies at pre-determined points in time. The model allows us to quantify the effects of each of these policies on the spread of the disease in a population, in particular, the instantaneous and total numbers of infectious individuals in a population which are important parameters for policy-makers. The simulation results, as explained in the following, provide some insight into various policies and some of the results are possibly counter-intuitive for many people. For example, the model predicts that closing down schools and universities without any other containment policy imposed on older age-groups has almost no impact on the number of patients that might need support-care in hospitals. The method provides an easy-to-use tool to use the information collected on the spread of COVID-19 in a country or region and then use that information in another population which might not have been as widely affected by the disease yet.","output":"A Stratified Model to Quantify the Effects of Containment Policies on the Spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and importanceDrugs used for COVID-19 (lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine) have a large number of interactions If any of these drugs are used, we should be cautious and monitor the clinical evolution of each patient closely The hospital pharmacist plays an important role in the revision of treatment to ensure its safety and efficacy Aim and objectivesTo analyse potential drug interactions of treatment for COVID-19 and to evaluate physician acceptance of pharmacist recommendations Material and methodsThis was a prospective interventional study from March to May 2020 We included all patients who started antiviral treatment for COVID-19 with a positive PCR test and hospital admission Data were collected from the electronic medical record (DIRAYA) and the prescription programme (PRISMA) The databases used for the detection of interactions were: Drugs com and COVID-19 drug interactions org (University of Liverpool) Collected data wereage, sex, concomitant medication, interaction classified according to severity (major/moderate), mechanism of the interaction (MI) (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic), drugs that prolong QT interval and pharmaceutical recommendation (PR) Detection of an interaction was reported in the clinical course of the patient In the case of a serious interaction or clinical risk situation, the prescribing doctor was notified directly Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the results Results178 patients (56 2% men) were analysed, with a median age of 63 (range 22C90) years 267 interactions were detected (56 9% moderate/43 1% major) The MI involved was pharmacokinetic (63 9%)/pharmacodynamic (36 1%) 22 8% of the collected drugs could affect the QT interval Antiviral therapy used waslopinavir/ritonavir (96 6%) and hydroxychloroquine (94 9%) 72 5% of patients had at least one interaction The main therapeutic groups involved were: 15 7% selective calcium channel blockers, 11 2% topical nasal corticosteroids, 10 5% angiotensin II receptor blockers and 8 8% HMG-COA reductase inhibitors 185 PR were made The rate of acceptance was 70 8%: 35 2% change dose, 24 1% change treatment and 11 5% drug suspension Conclusion and relevancePharmacist participation in the multidisciplinary COVID team was relevant for the detection of multiple interactions, helping doctors in decision making about drugs not commonly used in an overwhelmed healthcare situation References and/or acknowledgementshttps://www drugs com/https://www druginteractions org/Conflict of interestNo conflict of interest","output":"4CPS-260 Analysis of drugs interactions between coronavirus (COVID-19) antiviral treatment and concomitant medication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral fusion proteins are attached to the membrane of enveloped viruses (a group that includes Coronaviruses, Dengue, HIV and Influenza) and catalyze fusion between the viral and host membranes, enabling the virus to insert its genetic material into the host cell.

The Irish Health Service Executive (HSE) Making Every Contact Count (MECC) Programme supports healthcare professionals to offer patients brief opportunistic behavioural interventions during routine consultations. The potential for MECC to impact public health depends on its uptake and implementation. Aim: This protocol outlines the Making MECC Work research programme, a HSE/Health Behaviour Change Research Group collaboration to develop an implementation strategy to optimise uptake of MECC in Ireland. The programme will answer three research questions: (1) What determines delivery of MECC brief interventions by healthcare professionals at individual and organisational levels? (2) What are patient attitudes towards, and experiences of, receiving MECC interventions from healthcare professionals? (3) What evidence-informed implementation strategy options can be consensually developed with key stakeholders to optimise MECC implementation? Methods: In Work Package 1, we will examine determinants of MECC delivery by healthcare professionals using a multi-methods approach, including: (WP1.1) a national survey of healthcare professionals who have participated in MECC eLearning training and (WP1.2) a qualitative interview study with relevant healthcare professionals and HSE staff. In Work Package 2, we will examine patient attitudes towards, and experiences of, MECC using qualitative interviews. Work Package 3 will combine findings from Work Packages 1 and 2 using the Behaviour Change Wheel to identify and develop testable implementation strategy options (WP 3.1). Strategies will be refined and prioritised using a key stakeholder consensus process to develop a collaborative implementation blueprint to optimise and scale-up MECC (WP3.2).

Human leukocyte antigen alleles (HLA) have been suggested as potential genetic host factors that affect individual immune response to SARS-CoV-2. We sought to evaluate this hypothesis by conducting a multicenter study using HLA sequencing. METHODS: We analyzed the association between COVID-19 severity and HLAs in 435 individuals from Germany (n = 135), Spain (n = 133), Switzerland (n = 20) and the United States (n = 147), who had been enrolled from March 2020 to August 2020. This study included patients older than 18 years, diagnosed with COVID-19 and representing the full spectrum of the disease. Finally, we tested our results by meta-analysing data from prior genome-wide association studies (GWAS). FINDINGS: We describe a potential association of HLA-C*04:01 with severe clinical course of COVID-19. Carriers of HLA-C*04:01 had twice the risk of intubation when infected with SARS-CoV-2 (risk ratio 1.5 [95% CI 1.1C2.1], odds ratio 3.5 [95% CI 1.9C6.6], adjusted p-value = 0.0074). These findings are based on data from four countries and corroborated by independent results from GWAS. Our findings are biologically plausible, as HLA-C*04:01 has fewer predicted bindings sites for relevant SARS-CoV-2 peptides compared to other HLA alleles. INTERPRETATION: HLA-C*04:01 carrier state is associated with severe clinical course in SARS-CoV-2. Our findings suggest that HLA class I alleles have a relevant role in immune defense against SARS-CoV-2.

To describe the current nature of this disease in the UK, data was gathered on patients with clinical pneumonia from whom Streptococcus pyogenes was cultured principally from blood or other relevant normally sterile sites. In the Harrogate and Northallerton districts of North Yorkshire, pneumonia accounted for nine (20%) cases and a quarter of all deaths in a complete sequence of 45 patients with Streptococcus pyogenes bacteraemia detected during the 16-year-period 1981C1996. An analysis is presented of those cases together with eight recent cases from counties York, Durham and Isle of Wight during 1995C1997. Of the total 17 cases, nine occurred in women and eight in men; the age range was 30C92 years. The organism was isolated from blood culture in 15 (88%) patients. Eight (47%) patients died, five within 1 day of hospitalisation. Fourteen (82%) cases occurred in the winter months October to March, including all the fatal cases and all eight in which a clinical 'viral' prodrome was observed. Predisposing medical or surgical conditions were present in 65% of the patients. Major complications included septicaemia, pleural reaction, shock, pulmonary cavitation, osteomyelitis and metastatic abscesses. Seven serotypes of Streptococcus pyogenes were encountered, with M-type 1 predominating (the cause in 60% of cases).

Studies on the epidemiology and clinical associations of the four human non-SARS human coronaviruses (HCoVs) using sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of HCoV infections worldwide. Pediatric respiratory specimens (1,683) submitted to a diagnostic virology laboratory over a 1-year period (December 2004CNovember 2005) that were negative for seven respiratory viruses by conventional methods were tested for RNA of four HCoVs using sensitive RT-PCR assays. Coronavirus RNAs were detected in 84 (5.0%) specimens: HCoV-NL63 in 37 specimens, HCoV-OC43 in 34, HCoV-229E in 11, and HCoV-HKU1 in 2. The majority of HCoV infections occurred during winter months, and over 62% were in previously healthy children. Twenty-six (41%) coronavirus positive patients had evidence of a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), 17 (26%) presented with vomiting and/or diarrhea, and 5 (8%) presented with meningoencephalitis or seizures. Respiratory specimens from one immunocompromised patient were persistently positive for HCoV-229E RNA for 3 months. HCoV-NL63-positive patients were nearly twice as likely to be hospitalized (P = 0.02) and to have a LRTI (P = 0.04) than HCoV-OC43-positive patients.

AIMS: To describe a case series of SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs in a large public healthcare organization in Milan (Italy) during the most devastating weeks of the epidemic and analyse the sources, symptoms and duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This study included 172 SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs who were infected between the 25th of February and the 7th of April 2020. A nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and RT-PCR were used to indicate. RESULTS: Initially, the most common sources of infection were other positive HCWs (49%). Medical doctors and nursing assistants were most frequently infected, with infection rates of 53/1000 and 50/1000, respectively. COVID-19 departments were less affected than internal medicine, surgery, intensive care, or emergency room. The most commonly reported symptom was mild cough, while loss of smell (anosmia) and loss of taste (ageusia) were reported as moderate and severe by 30-40% of HCWs. The time necessary for 50% of workers to recover from the infection was 23 days, while it took 41 days for 95% of HCWs to become virus-free. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs are commonly infected due to close contacts with other positive HCWs, and non-COVID departments were most affected. Most HCWs were asymptomatic or subclinical but contact tracing and testing of asymptomatic HCWs help identify and isolate infected workers.","output":"Source and symptoms of COVID-19 among hospital workers in Milan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over recent months, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has swept the world as a global pandemic, largely changing the practice of medicine because it was previously known.

This manuscript summarizes the key output from a collaborative workshop, organized by the Cardiovascular Round Table and the European Affairs Committee of the European Society of Cardiology, involving clinicians, academic researchers, trialists, European and US regulators, and pharmaceutical industry researchers. Specific questions in four key areas were selected as priorities for changes in regulatory guidance: patient selection, endpoints, methodologic issues and issues related to the research for novel agents. Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI) should be studied separately for therapies aimed at the specific pathophysiology of either condition, particularly for treatment of the acute phase, but can be studied together for other treatments, especially long-term therapy. Unstable angina patients should be excluded from acute phase ACS trials. In general, cardiovascular death and reinfarction are recommended for primary efficacy endpoints; other endpoints may be considered if specifically relevant for the therapy under study. New agents or interventions should be tested against a background of evidence-based therapy with expanded follow-up for safety assessment. In conclusion, new guidance documents for randomized controlled trials in ACS should consider changes regarding patient and endpoint selection and definitions, and trial designs.

Motivated by this notion, integrating embedded hardware kit like Jetson Nano with deep learning algorithms for automating the entire process is indispensable. Further, to improve the performance of deep learning-based object identifiers, YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm utilizes a single-step locator methodology by computing pairwise distance to detect the objects. Using bounding boxes, YOLO algorithm identifies the presence of multiple objects, and thereby multiple bounding boxes are formed and update the shade of the jumping box to red. An alarm message is sent to the respective authority via WhatsApp. A real-time case study is detailed in this chapter for social control, thereby preventing the spread of COVID-19 with the aid of YOLO algorithm.

These people, already exposed to a range of diseases, are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19. According to studies, places that have poor sanitation allow the proliferation of the coronavirus, been observed a greater number of infected people being found in these regions. This social problem is strongly related to the lack of effective management of water resources, since they are the sources for the population's water supply and the recipients of effluents stemming from sanitation services (household effluents, urban drainage and solid waste).

Seven electrode configurations were tested on the electric field of the precentral gyrus (hand motor area). We determined that the Cz-CP1 configuration was optimal, as it resulted in higher electric field values and minimized the intra-individual differences in the electric field. Therefore, tACS was delivered to the hand motor area through this arrangement at a fixed frequency of 10 Hz (alpha-tACS) or 20 Hz (beta-tACS) with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.6 mA for 20 min. We found that alpha- and beta-tACS resulted in larger alpha and beta oscillations, respectively, compared with the oscillations observed after sham-tACS. In addition, alpha- and beta-tACS decreased the amplitudes of conditioned motor evoked potentials and increased alpha and beta activity, respectively. Correspondingly, alpha- and beta-tACSs enhanced cortical inhibition.

SUMMARY: As the pandemic has continued, there have been significant shifts in pharmacy workflow, staffing, and patient care delivery. Pharmacy students are slowly being reintegrated into these learning environments. Although preceptors are willing and eager to teach, many lack the resources, tools, and support to create remote learning experiences at their facilities. The University of the Pacific Thomas J. Long School of Pharmacy has a decentralized experiential education model in which faculty regional coordinators with clinical practices and diverse expertise are disseminated throughout California. This model allowed us to collaborate and understand preceptor needs from a local level. We created a preceptor COVID-19 guidance document, introduced innovative virtual playbooks to pivot up to 100% remote rotations, and promoted the layered learning model to integrate pharmacy residents into the remote teaching space. Communication and flexibility are key to ensure student and preceptor safety while maintaining high-quality advanced pharmacy practice experiences and preserving patient-student relationships in telehealth. CONCLUSION: Overall, we successfully created innovative solutions and leveraged our decentralized experiential model to meet the teaching and learning demands during an unanticipated crisis.

Large-scale replication of previous associations is needed, however. We investigated the association between MBL2 polymorphisms and the frequency of RTI in a large population-based birth cohort of white children. Methods. The frequency of RTI was prospectively assessed by annual parental questionnaires until children were 4 years of age. Thirteen polymorphisms in MBL2 were determined in 987 Dutch children. Haplotypes, previously shown to be associated with functional levels of MBL, were constructed, and their associations with the frequency of RTI during year 1, year 2, and the first 4 years of life were assessed. High-producing, intermediate-producing, and deficient MBL2 genotypes were defined on the basis of exon 1 and Y/X promoter polymorphisms. Results. No differences were found between investigated polymorphisms and haplotype frequencies in the population as a whole or between the groups with frequent, moderately frequent, or no RTIs reported. Deficient MBL2 genotypes were not associated with an increased risk of RTI (odds ratio, 0.71 [95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 2.05]) during years 1C4 of life.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A random sample of men 50C60 years in the G?teborg area, Sweden, identified from the Total Population Register, were randomised to either a screening or control group (CG). Participants in the screening group (SG) were further randomised into one of three arms: (1) PSA-test; if PSA  3 ng/mL, then MRI and systematic biopsy, plus targeted biopsy to suspicious lesions as per Prostate Imaging C Reporting and Data System, version 2 (PI-RADSv2) 3C5; (2) PSA-test; if PSA  3 ng/mL, then MRI, and targeted biopsy only if PI-RADSv2 3C5; (3) identical to Arm 2, except lower PSA-cut-off 1.8 ng/mL. The primary outcome is the detection rate of clinically insignificant PC (defined as Gleason Score 3 + 3 [Grade Group 1]) comparing all men with PSA  3 ng/mL in Arm 1 vs. Arm 2 + 3.

In recent years, these surgery schools have evolved from primarily informing patients of what to expect before and after surgery, to providing support and encouragement for patients to prehabilitate prior to surgery, through improving physical fitness, nutrition and emotional wellbeing. METHOD: A survey aimed at clinicians delivering surgery schools was employed to capture a national overview of activity to establish research and practice priorities in this area. The survey was circulated online via the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery UK Society and the Centre for Perioperative Care mailing lists as well as social media. RESULTS: There were 80 responses describing 28 active and 4 planned surgery schools across the UK and Ireland. Schools were designed and delivered by multidisciplinary teams, contained broadly similar content and were well attended. Most were funded by the National Health Service. The majority included aspects of prehabilitation most commonly the importance of physical fitness. Seventy five percent of teams collected patient outcome data, but less than half collected data to establish the clinical effectiveness of the school. Few describe explicit inclusion of evidence-based behavior change techniques, but collaboration and partnerships with community teams, gyms and local charities were considered important in supporting patients to make changes in health behaviors prior to surgery. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that teams work with patients when designing surgery schools and use evidence-based behavior change frameworks and techniques to inform their content. There is a need for high-quality research studies to determine the clinical effectiveness of this type of education intervention.

Clinical Case: A 40-year-old Hispanic male presented to the ER complaining of fatigue, polyuria, and polydipsia. A screening COVID-19 PCR was positive but he denied URI symptoms. His admission labs were notable for hyperglycemia (434 mg/dL; n 71C99), metabolic acidosis (pH 7.1 [n 7.35C7.45]; HCO3 3 mmoL/L [n 21C32]), increased anion gap (27 mmoL/L; n < 12) and elevated HbA1c (7.9%; n < 5.7%). The patients fructosamine was also high (464 umol/L; n 200C285) and discordant from his HbA1c. There was no evidence of pancreatitis, lactic acidosis, renal impairment or hepatic dysfunction. The patient had no known medical problems, did not drink alcohol to excess, and reported good access to nutrition. He had a strong family history of T2DM, but his BMI (23.3 kg/m(2)) and lipid panel were normal. The DKA was managed in the medical ICU using fluids and IV insulin per protocol. The patient required 180 units of IV insulin/24-hours (2.5 units/kg/day) to maintain blood glucose 180C250 mg/dL. After 48-hours of IV insulin, he was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin and prescribed multiple daily injections at discharge. There were concerns about possible T1DM and/or glucose toxicity leading to further diagnostics. His GAD-65 (<5 [IU]/mL; n 0C5 [IU]/mL) and IA-2 (<5.4 U/mL; n <5.4 U/mL) antibodies were negative but his c-peptide was suppressed (0.64 ng/mL; n 0.8C3.85). The patient was reevaluated at three months post-discharge. His glycemic control and insulin requirements had improved but repeat c-peptide level was undetectable. He was thought to have beta-cell failure and referred to a diabetologist.

At the clinical level, HMPV is associated to several diseases including bronchitis, croup, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, reactive airway disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma exacerbations, specifically in children less than 5 years. Here, we carried out a retrospective pilot study, based on the processing of nasopharyngeal swabs, with a focus on the epidemiology and molecular characteristics of HMPV in Senegal. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted from January 2012 to December 2016. Briefly, all outpatients presenting to healthcare sentinel sites were screened for surveillance enrollment and included if they met criteria for ILI. Naso-oropharyngeal swabs were collected from eligible participants. For viral respiratory pathogens detection, including HMPV, the Anyplex? II RV16 Detection kit was used. A fragment of the hMPV F gene was targeted for sequencing. RESULTS: In total, 8209 patients with ILI were enrolled. Half of them (49.7%) were children under 5 years. Fever was the most common symptom followed by cough, and rhinitis. Three hundred eight patients were positive for HMPV (3.75%). 89 (28.9%) were detected as single infection. In co-infection cases, the most common co-infecting viruses were influenza, adenovirus and rhinovirus. HMPV detection rates in the different age groups varied significantly with the children under 5 years group accounting for 71.7% of positive patients. The temporal distribution pattern for HMPV infection showed a clear seasonal pattern with a higher activity during the rainy period (JulyCSeptember). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that HMPV specimens circulating in Senegal were distributed into the two main genetic lineages, A and B. We also noted a co-circulation of both genetic lineages during the whole study period except in 2014. CONCLUSION: In summary, the present study characterized the recent prevalence, seasonality and genetic diversity of HMPV in a large outpatient population presented with ILI in Senegal between 2012 and 2016. Globally our results show a clear seasonal circulation pattern of HMPV in Senegal. Our findings identified children less than 5 years as more susceptible group to HMPV infection. Molecular studies identified A2, B1 and B2 as the major genotypes circulating.","output":"Epidemiological, clinical and genotypic features of human Metapneumovirus in patients with influenza-like illness in Senegal, 2012 to 2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection is mild in the majority of individuals but progresses into severe pneumonia in a small proportion of patients.

METHODS: Our study prospectively included 26 consecutive patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysm managed at our institution in context of COVID-19 pandemic between March 1st, 2020 and April, 26th, 2020 (2020 group). A group control included other 28 consecutive patients managed at the same institution for the same disease in 2019, during the same time frame (2019 group). On admission, poor neurological status was defined as WFNS score >3. Severe radiological status was defined by the presence of intracerebral hematoma, or/and acute hydrocephalus requiring further EVD or/and the presence of vasospasm on presentation. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the 2 distinct groups. RESULTS: Rates of poor neurological presentation and severe radiological presentation on hospital admission were higher in the 2020 group (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively). The delayed hospital admission was 2.7 days in 2020 group and 0.75 days in 2019 group (p = 0.005). Therefore, vasospasm's rate on presentation was also higher in the 2020 group (p = 0.04).

However, the low-mass end of AGN has never been explored in detail. In this work, we extend the existing scaling relations to lower-mass AGN, which serve as anchors between the normal-mass AGN and BHXRBs. For this purpose, we construct a sample of low-mass AGN ($M_{\\\\rm BH}<3\\\\times 10^{6} M_{\\\\rm \\\\odot}$) from the XMM-Newton archive and measure frequency-resolved time delays between the soft (0.3-1 keV) and hard (1-4 keV) X-ray emission.

At low frequencies ($\\\\sim[3-8]\\\\times 10^{-4}$ Hz), the hard band lags behind the soft band variations, which we explain in the context of the inward propagation of luminosity fluctuations through the corona. We find that the X-ray source for the sample extends at an average radius of around $8r_{\\\\rm g}$ and a median height of around $15r_{\\\\rm g}$ above the disc plane, assuming a lamppost geometry for the corona.

There is a clear need for biomarkers which quantify tissue injury, predict clinical outcomes and guide the clinical management of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We herein report the quantification by droplet-based digital PCR (ddPCR) of the SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and the plasmatic release of a ubiquitous human intracellular marker, the ribonuclease P (RNase P) in order to evaluate tissue injury and cell lysis in the plasma of 139 COVID-19 hospitalized patients at admission. RESULTS: We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia was associated with clinical severity of COVID-19 patients. In addition, we showed that plasmatic RNase P RNAemia at admission was also highly correlated with disease severity (P<0.001) and invasive mechanical ventilation status (P<0.001) but not with pulmonary severity. Altogether, these results indicate a consequent cell lysis process in severe and critical patients but not systematically due to lung cell death. Finally, the plasmatic RNase P RNA value was also significantly associated with overall survival. CONCLUSION: Viral and ubiquitous blood biomarkers monitored by ddPCR could be useful for the clinical monitoring and the management of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Moreover, these results could pave the way for new and more personalized circulating biomarkers in COVID-19, and more generally in infectious diseases, specific from each patient organ injury profile.","output":"Circulating ubiquitous RNA, a highly predictive and prognostic biomarker in hospitalized COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Gray wolves (Canis lupus) were reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park (YNP) after a >70 year absence, and as part of recovery efforts, the population has been closely monitored. In 1999 and 2005, pup survival was significantly reduced, suggestive of disease outbreaks. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed sympatric wolf, coyote (Canis latrans), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) serologic data from YNP, spanning 1991C2007, to identify long-term patterns of pathogen exposure, identify associated risk factors, and examine evidence for disease-induced mortality among wolves for which there were survival data. We found high, constant exposure to canine parvovirus (wolf seroprevalence: 100%; coyote: 94%), canine adenovirus-1 (wolf pups [0.5C0.9 yr]: 91%, adults [1 yr]: 96%; coyote juveniles [0.5C1.5 yrs]: 18%, adults [1.6 yrs]: 83%), and canine herpesvirus (wolf: 87%; coyote juveniles: 23%, young adults [1.6C4.9 yrs]: 51%, old adults [5 yrs]: 87%) suggesting that these pathogens were enzootic within YNP wolves and coyotes. An average of 50% of wolves exhibited exposure to the protozoan parasite, Neospora caninum, although individuals odds of exposure tended to increase with age and was temporally variable. Wolf, coyote, and fox exposure to canine distemper virus (CDV) was temporally variable, with evidence for distinct multi-host outbreaks in 1999 and 2005, and perhaps a smaller, isolated outbreak among wolves in the interior of YNP in 2002. The years of high wolf-pup mortality in 1999 and 2005 in the northern region of the park were correlated with peaks in CDV seroprevalence, suggesting that CDV contributed to the observed mortality. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Of the pathogens we examined, none appear to jeopardize the long-term population of canids in YNP. However, CDV appears capable of causing short-term population declines.

However, there have been several recent reports of more severe hyperinflammatory presentation in pediatric COVID-19 patients. This review article aims to summarize the current literature available on the main clinical features and management approaches of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). METHODS: The authors searched different indexing databases for observational and interventional studies using search terms including Coronavirus, COVID-19, pediatric, MIS-C, Kawasaki, and inflammation. The retrieved publications were further assessed for relevance to the topic. Only relevant articles were included in writing this review article. MAIN BODY: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a hyperinflammatory syndrome temporally related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pediatrics. It is characterized by persistent fever, rash, elevated inflammatory markers, and multiorgan failure with increasing rates of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal involvement. The exact pathophysiologic mechanisms of MIS-C are still unknown, but it is postulated to be due to an exaggerated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is diagnosed by exclusion of other underlying causes of organ failure. There is a lack of clinical evidence on the management of MIS-C. The current guidelines depend mainly on expert opinion based on the management of other hyper-inflammatory syndromes in children. Patients suffering from MIS-C are treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), corticosteroids, infliximab, tocilizumab, and anakinra. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the growing reports on COVID-19 in children, there is still a lot to elucidate on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and subsequent management of MIS-C. Further trials are needed to investigate new approaches to manage MIS-C. Specific evidence-based guideline for management of MIS-C should be tailored to the current available information on MIS-C.","output":"COVID-19 in children: an approach for multisystem inflammatory syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autopsies of deceased with a confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can provide important insights into the novel disease and its course.

In the northern German Federal State of Hamburg, all deaths of Hamburg citizens with ante- or postmortem PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection have been autopsied since the outbreak of the pandemic in Germany. Our evaluation provides a systematic overview of the first 80 consecutive full autopsies. A proposal for the categorisation of deaths with SARS-CoV-2 infection is presented (category 1: definite COVID-19 death; category 2: probable COVID-19 death; category 3: possible COVID-19 death with an equal alternative cause of death; category 4: SARS-CoV-2 detection with cause of death not associated to COVID-19). In six cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed postmortem by a positive PCR test in a nasopharyngeal or lung tissue swab. In the other 74 cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection had already been known antemortem. The deceased were aged between 52 and 96 years (average 79.2 years, median 82.4 years). In the study cohort, 34 deceased were female (38%) and 46 male (62%). Overall, 38% of the deceased were overweight or obese.

AIM: The aim of this study was to understand the self-management of youth following the unexpected loss of a family member to HIV. SETTING: Khayelitsha, Western Cape province, South Africa. METHODS: A descriptive phenomenological design was followed, with an accessible population of youth who lost a family member to HIV. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 purposively selected participants after obtaining written informed consent. The sessions, held with an interview schedule, did not take longer than 45 min to conduct until data saturation was reached. A digital recorder was used and field notes held. Open coding was followed after transcribing interviews. RESULTS: Individuals had different experiences during different stages of the bereavement process, not necessarily similar or following the same sequence. Individuals had to manage their guilt of being unable to do more before the family member passed away, struggling to realise that they have a future purpose, and hardship having fond memories. CONCLUSION: Youth find it difficult to view death as a natural loss of life and to manage themselves after the loss of their loved one to HIV.

Methods This was a prospective study done on 68 patients at four serial time points. Patients between 18-85 years admitted to the hospital as in-patients and ICU with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-PCR were included. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, patients below and above the mentioned age, previously known coagulopathy, systemic anticoagulants or anti-platelet therapy or vitamin K antagonists and moribund patients. Patients were divided into three categories based on SOFA score at admission, presence (group 1) or absence (group 2) of ARDS and outcome (dead or alive). Routine and specialized coagulation tests were performed on patients' platelet-poor plasma at the time of study inclusion (day 0), days 3, 7 and at discharge on STAR Max?3 (Diagnostica Stago France) automated coagulation analyzer and included prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR) (STA? -NeoPTimal), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (STA? -Cephascreen), fibrinogen (STA?

ELISA did testing for tissue plasminogen activator (Asserachrom? tPA) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Results Sixty-eight patients, including 43 (63%) males and 25 (37%) females, with a median age of 48 years (IQR 20-85), were recruited in this study. The incidence of ARDS was 34%, with a mortality of 13%. History of contact with a COVID-19 case was present in 71% (48/68) of the patients. Fever was the most common presenting symptom in 84% (57/68) of the patients. The most common comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM) in 22% (15/68) and 21% (14/68) of the patients. DM (p=0.07) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (p=0.03) were significantly associated with ARDS. DM (p=0.02), hypertension (p=0.01), and COPD (p=0.02) were also significantly associated with mortality. APTT was markedly prolonged among non-survivors at day 0 (D0) and D7 (p=0.03, p=0.02). D-Dimer was elevated in 38/68 (56%) patients at D0. D-Dimer levels were significantly higher in non-survivors (p<0.001), in ARDS patients (p=0.001) and patients with higher SOFA scores (p=0.001). ROC curve showed that D-dimer cut-off > 2.13 (AUC of 0.86) and >0.85 (AUC of 0.74) predicts mortality and ARDS, respectively. Among the natural anticoagulants, protein C was significantly associated with a high SOFA score at D0 and D3 (p=0.04). Conclusion Diabetes mellitus, hypertension and COPD were associated with poor outcomes. D-dimer levels must be monitored in COVID patients due to their association with ARDS and mortality. We observed that the levels of natural anticoagulants fell during the illness, making them prone to coagulopathies; however, none were seen in this study.

To this end, we confirmed SARS-CoV-2 entry factor and antigen expression in post-mortem COVID-19 patient ocular surface tissue and observed productive viral replication in cadaver samples and eye organoid cultures, most notably in limbal regions. Transcriptional analysis of ex vivo infected ocular surface cells and hESC-derived eye cultures revealed robust induction of NF-B in infected cells as well as diminished type I/III interferon signaling. Together these data suggest that the eye can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2 and implicate limbus as a portal for viral entry.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infects human adult donor eyes and hESC-derived ocular epithelium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A single undiagnosed COVID-19 positive patient admitted in the green zone has the potential to infect many Health Care Workers (HCWs) and other patients at any given time with resultant spread of infection and reduction in the available workforce. Despite the existing triaging strategy at the Obstetric unit of a tertiary hospital in New Delhi, where all COVID-19 suspects obstetric patients were tested and admitted in orange zone and non-suspects in green zone, asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients were found admitted in the green zone. This was the trigger to undertake a quality improvement (QI) initiative to prevent the admission of asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients in green zones. The QI project aimed at reducing the admission of COVID-19 positive patients in the green zone of the unit from 20% to 10% in 4 weeks' time starting 13/6/2020 by means of dynamic triaging. A COVID-19 action team was made and after an initial analysis of the problem multiple Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles were run to test the change ideas. The main change ideas were revised testing strategies and creating gray Zones for patients awaiting COVID-19 test results. The admission of unsuspected COVID-19 positive cases in the green zone of the unit reduced from 20% to 0% during the stipulated period. There was a significant reduction in the number of HCWs, posted in the green zone, being quarantined or test positive for COVID-19 infection as well.

METHODS: Search volume was collected from Google Trends for hand sanitizer, social distancing, COVID testing, and contact tracing for each state. Bivariate correlations were computed to analyze associations between public interest in preventive measures, changes in confirmed COVID-19 cases after SAH expirations, COVID-19 case-fatality rates, and by-state presidential voting percentages. RESULTS: A higher interest in preventive measures was associated with lower rates of confirmed cases after SAH orders had expired (r = ?0.33), higher state-wide deaths per capita (r = 0.42), and case-fatality rates (r = 0.60). Moderate to strong negative correlations were found between states percentage of voters supporting the Republican nominee in 2016 and proportion of queries for average preventive measures (r = ?0.77).

The 3C protease has been regarded as a valid target due to its structural similarity among different picornaviruses and minimal sequence similarity with host proteins; therefore, the development of potent inhibitors against the 3C protease as an antiviral drug is ongoing. Duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) belongs to the Picornavidea family and is a major threat to the poultry industry. To date, little is known about the roles of the DHAV 3C protease plays during infection. METHODS: In this study, we compared the full-length DHAV 3C protein sequence with other 3C sequences to obtain an alignment for the construction of a phylogenetic tree. Then, we expressed and purified recombinant DHAV 3C protease in the BL21 expression system using nickel-NTA affinity chromatography. The optimization of the cleavage assay conditions and the kinetic analysis for DHAV 3C protease were done by in vitro cleavage assays with a fluorogenic peptide respectively. The inhibitory activity of rupintrivir against the DHAV 3C protease was further evaluated. The localization of the 3C protease in infected and transfected cells was determined using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Under different expression conditions, the 3C protease was found to be highly expressed after induction with 1 mM IPTG at 16 C for 10 h. We synthesized a fluorogenic peptide derived from the cleavage site of the DHAV polyprotein and evaluated the protease activity of the DHAV 3C protease for the first time. We used fluorimetric based kinetic analysis to determine kinetic parameters, and V(max) and K(m) values were determined to be 16.52 nmol/min and 50.78 M, respectively. Rupintrivir was found to exhibit inhibitory activity against the DHAV 3C protease. Using polyclonal antibody and an indirect immunofluorescence microscopy assay (IFA), it was determined that the DHAV 3C protease was found in the nucleus during infection. In addition, the DHAV 3C protease can enter into the nucleus without the cooperation of viral proteins. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to examine the activity of the DHAV 3C protease, and the activity of the DHAV 3C protease is temperature-, pH- and NaCl concentration- dependent. The DHAV 3C protease localizes throughout DHAV-infected cells and can enter into the nucleus in the absence of other viral proteins. The kinetic analysis was calculated, and the V(max) and K(m) values were 16.52 nmol/min and 50.78 M, respectively, using the LineweaverCBurk plot.","output":"Biochemical characterization of recombinant Avihepatovirus 3C protease and its localization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Isolated abducens palsy is a rare clinical entity.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recent phenomenon and may take a while to understand its transmission routes from less traveled territories, ranging from fomite exposure routes to wastewater transmission. The critical challenge is how to negotiate with such catastrophic pandemics in high-income countries (HICs ~20% of the global population) and low-and middle-income countries (LMICs ~ 80% of the global population) with a total global population size of approximately eight billion, where practical mass testing and tracing is only a remote possibility, particularly in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Keeping in mind the population distribution disparities of high-income countries (HICs) and LMICs and urbanisation trends over recent years, traditional wastewater-based surveillance such as that used to combat polio may help in addressing this challenge. The COVID-19 era differs from any previous pandemics or global health challenges in the sense that there is a great deal of curiosity within the global community to find out everything about this virus, ranging from diagnostics, potential vaccines/therapeutics, and possible routes of transmission. In this regard, the fact that the gut is the common niche for both poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2, and due to the shedding of the virus through faecal material into sewerage systems, the need for long-term wastewater surveillance and developing early warning systems for better preparedness at local and global levels is increasingly apparent. This paper aims to provide an insight into the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, how it can be managed, and what measures are required to deal with a current global international public health concern. Additionally, it shed light on the importance of using wastewater surveillance strategy as an early warning practical tool suitable for massive passive screening, as well as the urgent need for microfluidic technology as a rapid and cost-effective approach tracking SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater.","output":"COVID-19 Crisis Creates Opportunity towards Global Monitoring & Surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a global pandemic. The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presents with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild to critical illness requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a major complication in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Currently, there are no recognized pharmacological therapies for COVID-19. However, a large number of COVID-19 patients require respiratory support, with a high percentage requiring invasive ventilation. The rapid spread of the infection has led to a surge in the rate of hospitalizations and ICU admissions, which created a challenge to public health, research, and medical communities. The high demand for several therapies, including sedatives, analgesics, and paralytics, that are often utilized in the care of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, has created pressure on the supply chain resulting in shortages in these critical medications. This has led clinicians to develop conservation strategies and explore alternative therapies for sedation, analgesia, and paralysis in COVID-19 patients. Several of these alternative approaches have demonstrated acceptable levels of sedation, analgesia, and paralysis in different settings but they are not commonly used in the ICU. Additionally, they have unique pharmaceutical properties, limitations, and adverse effects.

Objective: We sought to analyse the role of pre-existing chronic disease (chronic respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension and diabetes mellitus) in the development of cardiac complications from SARS-CoV-2. Data Sources: We retrospectively investigated published (including pre-prints), publicly released, de-identified, data made available between Dec 1, 2019, and May 11, 2020. Information was accessed from PubMed, Embase, medRxiv and SSRN. Study Selection: 379 full-text articles were reviewed and 321 excluded for lack of original research, irrelevance to outcome, inappropriate cohort, or small patient numbers (case reports of <10 patients). Data were extracted from two studies and the remaining 56 contacted to request appropriate data, to which three responded with data contributions. A final of five studies were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis: This systematic review was conducted based on PRISMA and MOOSE statements. Included studies were critically appraised using Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS). Data were extracted independently by multiple observers. A fixed-effects model was selected for the meta-analysis based on relatively low heterogeneity between the studies (I2<50%). Main Outcome and Measures: Cardiac complications were determined via blood levels of cardiac biomarkers above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit, abnormalities in electrocardiography, and/or abnormalities in echocardiography. Results: SARS-CoV-2-infected patients who developed cardiac complications were, on average, 10 years older than those that did not. Pooled analyses showed the development of cardiac complications from SARS-CoV-2 was significantly increased in patients with underlying chronic respiratory illness (OR 2.88[1.45,5.71]), CVD (OR 5.12[3.09,8.48]), hypertension (OR 4.37[2.99,6.39]) and diabetes mellitus (OR 2.61[1.67,4.09]).

In the clinical part, 80 (30 females) subject with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 with mild and moderate symptoms were enrolled in the study. Subjects were treated with azithromycin or doxycycline, and nitazoxanide were added to the treatment if the subject had diarrhea. Subjects were divided into 4 groups: Group 1: subjects treated with azithromycin (20 subjects); Group 2: subjects treated with doxycycline (20 subjects); Group 3: subjects treated with a combination of nitazoxanide and doxycycline (20 subjects); and Group 4: subjects treated with a combination of nitazoxanide and azithromycin (20 subjects). In the computational part, we docked the three drugs against all currently available COVID-19 related protein targets (viral and non-viral). Subsequently, top hits were subjected to molecular dynamic simulations (50 ns) and binding free energy calculations to further validate the docking experiments and to investigate the binding modes of the potential inhibitors. RESULTS: The symptomatic improvement of mild to moderate subjects was seen on the 5th day after starting treatment in Group 3 and Group 4 and on the 7th day in Group 2. However, for Group 1, the symptomatic improvement of mild to moderate subjects was not seen on the 5th day and required replacement by doxycycline to get the symptomatic improvement. None of the subjects needed intensive care admission and no deaths were reported. In silico, results were in good accordance with the clinical outcomes, where both nitazoxanide and doxycycline achieved the best docking scores against the viral ADP-ribose phosphatase (ADPRP) and the human Adaptor-Associated Kinase 1 (AAK1). Molecular dynamic simulations revealed that both drugs were stable in their bindings indicating that they can be considered as lead molecules for targeting ADPRP and AAK1. CONCLUSION: The clinical and computational studies applied on three FDA-approved antimicrobials together with their recent clinical findings revealed that both nitazoxanide and doxycycline have great therapeutic potential against COVID-19.

Accordingly, the current study aimed to summarize the magnitudes and determinants of the psychological impact of coronavirus among health care professionals. Methods: The studies from Medline via PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar were searched from 5 September to 19 October 2020. The review was conducted as per PRISMA-2009 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses). Result: Initially, 6316 articles were searched from three databases (PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar). Finally, 20 articles were filtered to be included in our review. Among different types of psychological impact, stress was reported that lies within the range from 5.2% to 100%, anxiety was reported from 11.1% to 100%, depression was from 10.6% to 58%, and insomnia was from 28.75% to 34%. Several factors were related to the negative psychological state of health care workers due to coronavirus disease-19 like educational level, occupation, gender, age, working environment, work experience, legal status, ethnicity, psychological comorbidity, social support, personal/family exposure, and feeling of health care providers. Conclusion: The most common psychological impacts among health care workers were anxiety and stress. Besides different sociodemographic factors that determine the psychological impacts, front-line health care workers and participants having psychological comorbidity have a high risk of negative psychological state impacts as compared to their counterparts.

However, a literature review shows that relatively few studies have focused on the effect of loneliness on the life satisfaction of older adults. Some researchers have acknowledged that the character of the relationship between loneliness and life satisfaction is still unclear, and this association is much more complex that it appears to be. Therefore, the main purpose of the current study was to understand how loneliness is associated with satisfaction, and whether self-esteem and educational involvement in the University of the Third Age (U3A) courses can affect this relationship among elderly people. METHODS: The research was conducted on a group of 179 elderly adults (65% women). We measured loneliness, satisfaction, and self-esteem. The data were collected via the paper-and-pencil format through convenience sampling, just before the COVID-19 pandemic began. RESULTS: The results obtained show that loneliness correlated negatively with self-esteem and life satisfaction. Self-esteem was associated positively with life satisfaction. Self-esteem acted as a suppressor between loneliness and life satisfaction. The participation of older adults in U3A moderated the strength of the relationship between loneliness and life satisfaction (direct effect) and between loneliness and life satisfaction mediated by self-esteem (indirect effect). CONCLUSION: The mediatory role of self-esteem and the moderating role of educational activities in the relationship between loneliness and life satisfaction in late adulthood have important developmental and social implications. It appears that although feelings of loneliness and social isolation have a negative association on the life satisfaction of older adults, this relationship may be altered by empowering seniors self-esteem through their involvement in lifelong learning.

We have cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli the full-length SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) as well as a truncated form containing only the catalytic domains. The recombinant proteins have been characterized enzymatically using a fluorescently labeled substrate; their structural stability in solution has been determined by differential scanning calorimetry, and novel inhibitors have been discovered. Expression of the catalytic region alone yields a protein with a reduced catalytic efficiency consistent with the proposed regulatory role of the alpha-helical domain. Differential scanning calorimetry indicates that the alpha-helical domain does not contribute to the structural stability of the catalytic domains. Analysis of the active site cavity reveals the presence of subsites that can be targeted with specific chemical functionalities. In particular, a cluster of serine residues (Ser139, Ser144, and Ser147) was identified near the active site cavity and was susceptible to being targeted by compounds containing boronic acid.

By the end of oogenesis, the oocyte has entered a transcriptionally silenced state, the mechanisms and significance of which remain poorly understood. Histone H3.3, an H3 variant, has unique cell cycle-independent functions in chromatin structure and gene expression. Here we characterised H3.3 chaperone Hira/Cabin1/Ubn1 complex showing that loss-of-function of any of these subunits causes early embryogenesis failure. Transcriptome and nascent RNA analyses revealed that transcription is aberrantly silenced in mutant oocytes. Histone marks including H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 are reduced and chromatin accessibility is impaired in Hira/Cabin1 mutants. Misregulated genes in mutant oocytes include Zscan4, a 2-cell specific gene involved in zygote genome activation. Overexpression of Zscan4 in the oocyte partially recapitulates the phenotypes of Hira mutants and Zscan4 knockdown in Cabin1 mutant oocytes partially restored their developmental potential, illustrating that temporal and spatial expression of Zscan4 is fine-tuned at the oocyte-to-embryo transition.

We investigated safety and immunogenicity of the BNT162B2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in 34 SOT young adults as compared to 36 healthy controls (HC). Methodsimmunogenicity was measured through the analysis of anti SARS-CoV2 IgG Antibodies and antigen specific CD4 T cells (CD40L+), detected by flow cytometry before vaccination, 21 days after priming (T21), 7 days after booster dose (T28) and 2-4 months after priming (T120). Baseline T and B cell immune phenotype was deeply investigated. The safety profile was investigated by close monitoring and self-reported diary. ResultsAnti-S and anti-Trimeric Ab responses were significantly lower in SOT vs HC at T21 (p<0.0001) and at T28 (p<0.0001). Ten out of 34 SOT (29%) at T28 and 3 out of 33 (9%) at T120 had undetectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG.

Lithium inhibits inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), a probable key therapeutic mechanism. The anti-inflammatory drug, ebselen, also inhibits IMPase and appears well-tolerated and safe. OBJECTIVES To assess the efficacy of adjunctive ebselen in mania using the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) (primary outcome) and the Altman Self-Rating Mania (ASRM) Scale and Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale (CGI-S) among the secondary outcomes. METHODS Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted between October 2017 and June 2019, at Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust. Pharmacy-controlled randomisation was computer-generated, with full allocation concealment. In/outpatients (n = 68) aged 18-70, experiencing mania or hypomania, were assigned to 3 weeks ebselen (600 mg bd) (n = 33) or placebo (n = 35). Participants received usual clinical care and psychotropic medication. RESULTS Ebselen was numerically, but not statistically, superior to placebo in lowering scores on the YMRS (adjusted mean difference and 95% confidence interval, - 1.71 (- 5.34 to 1.91), p = 0.35) and ASRM (- 1.36 (- 3.75 to 1.17), p = 0.29). However, scores on the CGI-S were significantly lower at week 3 in ebselen-treated participants (adjusted mean difference, - 0.58 (- 1.14 to - 0.03), p = 0.04). A post hoc analysis excluding patients taking concomitant valproate treatment magnified the difference between ebselen and placebo on the YMRS. Adverse events were comparable between groups, and mild. CONCLUSIONS Ebselen merits further investigation where concomitant psychotropic medication is better controlled and participants taking valproate are excluded. If effective, ebselen's superior tolerance and safety could make it a useful alternative to lithium.

These models evaluate YouTube's impact on sharing of videos from a curated set of alternative political channels and popular videos shared in three conspiracy-oriented Reddit subreddits; we compare these models to a placebo dataset of makeup-oriented videos that should be unaffected by YouTube's announcement. Results suggest YouTube's de-recommending AIN-produced content has a significant suppressive effect on sharing of AIN videos in both Twitter and Reddit, with our models showing a significant and downward trend in sharing.

The presence of radiologic findings of bronchiectasis should alert clinicians to explore other causes including congenital defects, chronic inflammation, immune deficiencies, opportunistic infections and assess functional lung capacity as multiple etiologies contributed to bronchiectasis in our patient. We present the case of a middle-aged Hispanic male diagnosed with bronchiectasis in the setting of active Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), and cystic fibrosis carrier. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old Hispanic male with a history of SARS-CoV 2 infection presented with worsening cough and fatigue. He reported subjective fever, night sweats, weight loss, and yellowish sputum production. CT chest showed diffuse bronchial dilatation and thickening, diffuse bronchiectasis, multifocal cavitary lesions in bilateral upper lobes, and tree in bud nodularity. QuantiFERON-TB Gold was indeterminate. However, acid fast bacilli was seen on smear and culture. PCR confirmed MTB complex. He was found to have low IgG and IgM levels 661 and 26 respectively. Genetic testing showed a heterozygous cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) D508 gene mutation. He was treated with quadruple therapy with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and referred to an immunologist for immunoglobulin therapy. DISCUSSION: Bronchiectasis is a cycle of airway damage creating an environment conductive to chronic colonization of bacteria causing an inflammatory response leading to further injury. Our biggest diagnostic challenge was to determine if bronchiectasis was due to an infection or developed due to an underlying predisposition. His clinical symptoms were worrisome for tuberculosis;however, diffuse bronchial dilation was concerning for other concurrent pathologies which warranted further work up. Bronchiectasis may be classified as cystic fibrosis induced bronchiectasis and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder. While bronchiectasis is classically associated in CF patients, it has also been reported in patients having one gene mutation, like our patient. Furthermore, MTB and CVID are also documented causes of bronchiectasis. Pharmacological treatment is challenging and depends on the etiology. However, non-pharmacological treatment, such as chest physiotherapy centered on mobilizing and eliminating mucosal secretion, is used to manage bronchiectasis. CONCLUSIONS: The rise in the incidence of bronchiectasis in the US annually demands the understanding of the disease's etiology and characteristic features as effective treatment is directed towards its cause.

We obtained data from a social networking service (SNS) messaging application that monitors self-reported COVID-19 related symptoms in real time in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. We aimed at not only understanding the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in the prefecture, but also highlighting the usefulness of symptomatic monitoring approaches that rely on self-reporting using SNS during a pandemic, and informing the assessment of Japan's emergency declaration over COVID-19. Methods We analysed symptoms data (fever over 37.5 and a strong feeling of weariness or shortness of breath), reported voluntarily via SNS chatbot by 227,898 residents of Fukuoka Prefecture during March 27 to May 3, 2020, including April 7, when a state of emergency was declared. We estimated the spatial correlation coefficient between the number of the self-reported cases of COVID-19 related symptoms and the number of PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases in the period (obtained from the prefecture website); and estimated the empirical Bayes age- and sex-standardised incidence ratio (EBSIR) of the symptoms in the period, compared before and after the declaration. The number of symptom cases was weighted by age and sex to reflect the regional population distribution according to the 2015 national census. Findings Of the participants, 3.47% reported symptoms. There was a strong spatial correlation of 0.847 (p < 0.001) at municipality level between the weighted number of self-reported symptoms and the number of COVID-19 cases for both symptoms. The EBSIR at post-code level was not likely to change remarkably before and after the declaration of the emergency, but the gap in EBSIR between high-risk and low-risk areas appeared to have increased after the declaration. Interpretation While caution is necessary as the data was limited to SNS users, the self-reported COVID-19 related symptoms considered in the study had high epidemiological evaluation ability. In addition, though based on visual assessment, after the declaration of the emergency, regional containment of the infection risk might have strengthened to some extent. SNS, which can provide a high level of real-time, voluntary symptom data collection, can be used to assess the epidemiology of a pandemic, as well as to assist in policy assessments such as emergency declarations.

OBJECTIVES: We categorized the pathological diagnoses and investigated the predictive value for short-term mortality. METHOD: Three electronic databases (MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched for the included studies. The QUADAS-2 was used to evaluate the risk of bias and its applicability. The types and populations of pathological diagnoses were investigated. The pooled sensitivity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), negative likelihood ratio (LR-), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were estimated at a fixed specificity. Hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies that enrolled 758 patients were included. The pathological diagnoses were as follows: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) 29.9%; infection 24.7%; interstitial lung disease 17.2%; malignancy 3.6%; cardiovascular disease 3.6%; drug toxicity 2.3%; connective tissue disease 2.2%; allergic disease 1.1%; and nonspecific diagnosis 15.4%. To predict short-term mortality, 13 studies that enrolled 613 patients used DAD as an index test and recorded a mortality rate of 56.9% (349 of 613 patients). A total of 3 studies that used index tests other than DAD were excluded.

This effect could reflect the (re-)distribution of a global, limited attentional inhibition resource. Accordingly, changing the frequency of distractor appearance in one display region should also affect the magnitude of interference generated by distractors in a different region. Alternatively, distractor-location learning may reflect a local response (e.g., habituation) to distractors occurring at a particular location. In this case, the local distractor frequency in one display region should not affect distractor interference in a different region. To decide between these alternatives, we conducted three experiments in which participants searched for an orientation-defined target while ignoring a more salient orientation distractor that occurred more often in one vs. another display region. Experiment 1 varied the ratio of distractors appearing in the frequent vs. rare regions (60/40C90/10), with a fixed global distractor frequency. The results revealed the cueing effect to increase with increasing probability ratio. In Experiments 2 and 3, one (test) region was assigned the same local distractor frequency as in one of the conditions of Experiment 1, but a different frequency in the other region C dissociating local from global distractor frequency. Together, the three experiments showed that distractor interference in the test region was not significantly influenced by the frequency in the other region, consistent with purely local learning.

Previous studies have shown that knowledge of the location(s) where a distractor is most likely to occur helps the observer to mitigate distraction. In this study we compared different theories of how the frequency and spatial distribution of distractor occurrence in different locations could influence the ability to avoid distraction.

METHODS: This clinical trial included 252 subjects (312 eyes) in The Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University from March 7, 2020, to March 28, 2020. Sixty subjects (120 eyes) with normal IOP were divided into two groups. One group used an NCT without a baffle, another group used an NCT with a baffle. Another 192 subjects (192 eyes) were divided into four groups: Group A1 (without a baffle+normal IOP), Group A2 (without a baffle+high IOP), Group B1 (with a baffle+normal IOP) and Group B2 (with a baffle+high IOP). Particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and PM10 generated by all subjects were quantified during the NCT measurement. The IOP values were recorded simultaneously. Effects of baffle and IOP on aerosols generated during the NCT measurement were analyzed. RESULTS: In the normal eye group with a baffle, the aerosol density decreased in a wave-like shape near the NCT with the increase in the number of people measured for IOP, demonstrating no cumulative effect. However, in the normal eye group without a baffle, there was a cumulative effect. PM2.5 and PM10 in Group A2 were higher than Group A1 (both P<0.001). The PM2.5 and PM10 in Group B2 were higher than Group B1 (P<0.01, P<0.001 respectively). The PM10 of Group B1 was lower than Group A1 (P<0.01). PM2.5 in Group B2 were lower than Group A2 (P<0.01). The median of per capita PM2.5 and PM10 in the combined Group A1+A2 were 0.80 and 1.10 g/m3 respectively, which were higher than 0.20 and 0.60 g/m3 in the combined Group B1+B2 (both P<0.01). The median of per capita PM2.5 and PM10 in the combined Group A1+B1 were 0.10 and 0.20 g/m3 respectively, which were lower than 1.30 and 1.70 g/m3 in the combined Group A2+B2 (both P<0.001). CONCLUSION: More aerosols could be generated in patients with high IOP. After the NCT is equipped with a baffle, per capita aerosol density generated decreased significantly near the NCT; And with the increase in the number of people measured for IOP, the aerosols gradually dissipated near the NCT, demonstrating no cumulative effect.

The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) statistic, the comparative fit index (CFI) and the Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) were used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the model. RMSEA values 0.08 and  0.10 indicate a good and acceptable fit respectively. CFI and TLI values 0.90 indicate good model fit. A second cross-sectional study enrolled 461 respondents (18-29 years old) to conduct the multivariable analysis. The fit indices values were as follows: 2/df = 181.74/84 = 2.16, TLI = .92, CFI = .94 and RMSEA = .076 [95% CI .061-.091] respectively, indicating an excellent fit of the model. The results of the multiple linear regression using the ENTER model, when taking the phubbing score as the dependent variable, showed that female gender ( = 0.11;t(454) = 2.50;p = .013), more stress ( = 0.27;t(454) = 3.94;p < .001), more anxiety ( = 0.30;t(454) = 4.24;p < .001), and older age ( = 0.28;t(454) = 6.12;p < .001) were positively correlated with higher phubbing, or higher household crowding index ( = ?0.15;t(454) = ?3.62;p < .001) was significantly correlated with less phubbing. The results of this study were able to confirm the validity of the Arabic version of the GSP scale. This will allow Lebanese clinicians to use this validated tool to screen for the presence of the phubbing phenomenon within this age group. We propose finding possible correlation between phubbing and others factors (such as obsession and loneliness) and validating this scale in other Arabic-speaking countries.","output":"Phubbing among Lebanese young adults: Scale validation and association with mental health (depression, anxiety, and stress)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), with or without endoscopic resection effectively eradicates Barrett's esophagus (BE) containing high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and/or early-stage cancer. We followed patients who received RFA for BE containing high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and/or early-stage cancer for 5 years to determine the durability of treatment response. METHODS We followed 54 patients with BE (2-12 cm), previously enrolled in 4 consecutive cohort studies in which they underwent focal endoscopic resection in case of visible lesions (n = 40 [72%]), followed by serial RFA every 3 months. Patients underwent high-resolution endoscopy with narrow-band imaging at 6 and 12 months after treatment and then annually for 5 years (median, 61 months; interquartile range, 53-65 months); random biopsy samples were collected from neosquamous epithelium and gastric cardia. After 5 years, endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic resection of neosquamous epithelium were performed. Outcomes included sustained complete remission of neoplasia or intestinal metaplasia (IM), IM in gastric cardia, or buried glands in neosquamous epithelium. RESULTS After 5 years, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed sustained complete remission of neoplasia and intestinal metaplasia in 90% of patients; neoplasia recurred in 3 patients and was managed endoscopically. Focal IM in the cardia was found in 19 of 54 patients (35%), in 53 of 1143 gastric cardia biopsies (4.6%). The incidence of IM of the cardia did not increase over time; and IM was diagnosed based on only a single biopsy in 89% of patients. Buried glands were detected in 3 of 3543 neosquamous epithelium biopsies (0.08%, from 3 patients). No endoscopic resection samples had buried glands. CONCLUSIONS Among patients who have undergone RFA with or without endoscopic resection for neoplastic BE, 90% remain in remission at 5-year follow-up, with all recurrences managed endoscopically.

Research has shown the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in the most marginalized communities. Objectives: We examined the associations between COVID-19 cumulative incidence (CI) and case-fatality risk (CFR) and the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a composite score assessing historical marginalization and thus vulnerability to disaster events. Methods: Using county-level data from national databases, we used population density, Gini index, percent uninsured, and average annual temperature as covariates, and employed negative binomial regression to evaluate relationships between SVI and COVID-19 outcomes. Optimized hot spot analysis identified hot spots of COVID-19 CI and CFR, which were compared in terms of SVI using logistic regression. Results: As of 2/3/21, 26,452,031 cases of and 448,786 deaths from COVID-19 had been reported in the U.S. Negative binomial regression showed that counties in the top SVI quintile reported 13.7% higher CI (p<0.001) than those in the bottom SVI quintile. Additionally, each unit increase in a county's SVI score was associated with a 0.2% increase in CFR (p<0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that counties in the lowest SVI quintile had significantly greater odds of being in a CI hot spot than all other counties, yet counties in the highest SVI quintile had 63% greater odds (p=0.008) of being in a CFR hot spot than counties in the lowest SVI quintile. Conclusion: We demonstrated a significant relationship between SVI and CFR, but the relationship between SVI and CI is complex and warrants further investigation. SVI may help elucidate unequal impacts of COVID-19 and guide prioritization of vaccines to communities most impacted by structural injustices.","output":"Injustices in pandemic vulnerability: A spatial-statistical analysis of the CDC Social Vulnerability Index and COVID-19 outcomes in the U.S."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge the globalized world.

As a transfer of methods used in reliability engineering for analyzing occurrence of infection, Weibull distribution models are used to evaluate the spreading behavior of COVID-19. Key issues of this study are the differences of spreading behavior in first and second pandemic phase and the various impacts of lockdown measures with different characteristics (hard, light). Therefore, the occurrence of infection in normed time periods with and without lockdown measures are analyzed in detail on the example of Germany representing the spreading behavior in Europe. Additional information in comparison to classical infection analyzes models like SIR model is generated by the application of Weibull distribution models with easy interpretable parameters and the dynamic development of COVID-19 is outlined. In a further step, the occurrence of infection of COVID-19 is put into the context of other common infectious diseases in Germany like Influenza or Norovirus to evaluate the infectiousness.

Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms such as respiratory symptoms, cough, dyspnea, fever, and viral pneumonia and recover without any special cure. However, some others need special and emergency treatment to get rid of this widespread disease. Till now, there are numbers of proposed novel compounds as well as standards therapeutics agent existed for other conditions seems to have efficacy against the 2019-nCoV. Some which are being tested for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are validated that could be also efficient against this new coronavirus. However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations introduced for 2019-nCoV specifically that be supported by high-level evidence.

This extended duration of prone positioning puts patients at risk of developing orbital compartment syndrome if direct pressure to the orbit and the globe occurs and concomitant protection of the eyes is not undertaken. Objective To report 2 cases of orbital compartment syndrome, as well as optic disc edema and retinal hemorrhages, in the setting of prolonged prone positioning of patients in the intensive care unit during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants The cases took place from April 27, 2020, to May 4, 2020, at a COVID-19 intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital. Four of 16 patients in the intensive care unit required prolonged prone-position ventilation. A bedside eye examination was performed on 4 selected patients due to the observed presence of substantial periorbital edema. Main Outcomes and Measures Intraocular pressures and fundus findings of 4 patients with periorbital edema. Results Two of 4 patients who were in the prone position for extended periods of time had bilateral fundoscopic findings of optic disc edema and retinal hemorrhages, possibly consistent with a papillophlebitis. Additionally, both patients had a substantial increase in intraocular pressure of 2- to 3-fold in the prone position compared with the supine position. Conclusions and Relevance Prolonged prone positioning of patients with COVID-19 can be associated with elevated intraocular pressure from periorbital edema, direct compression on the eye, and increased orbital venous pressure. Orbital compartment syndrome can be avoided by the use of protective cushioning around the eyes and maintaining the patient's head position above heart level during prone positioning. Patients with COVID-19 may also develop papillophlebitis with optic disc edema and retinal hemorrhages, which may be associated with a hypercoagulable state caused by COVID-19. These observations suggest awareness for the possible presence of these ophthalmic findings while treating severely ill patients with COVID-19.","output":"Eye Protection for Patients With COVID-19 Undergoing Prolonged Prone-Position Ventilation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Developments in digital health have the potential to transform the delivery of health and social care to help citizens manage their health. Currently, there is a lack of consensus about digital health research priorities in palliative care and a lack of theories about how these technologies might improve care outcomes. Therefore, it is important for health care leaders to identify innovations to ensure that an increasingly frail population has appropriate access to palliative care services. Consequently, it is important to articulate research priorities as the first step in determining how finite resources should be allocated to a field saturated with rapidly developing innovation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify research priority areas for digital health in palliative care. METHODS: We selected digital health trends, most relevant to palliative care, from a list of emerging trends reported by a leading institute of quantitative futurists. We conducted 2 rounds of the Delphi questionnaire, followed by a consensus meeting and public engagement workshop to establish a final consensus on research priorities for digital technology in palliative care. We used the views of public representatives to gain their perspectives on the agreed priorities. RESULTS: A total of 103 experts (representing 11 countries) participated in the first Delphi round. Of the 103 experts, 55 (53.3%) participated in the second round. The final consensus meetings were attended by 10.7% (11/103) of the experts. We identified 16 priority areas, which involved many applications of technologies, including care for patients and caregivers, self-management and reporting of diseases, education and training, communication, care coordination, and research methodology. We summarized the priority areas into eight topics: big data, mobile devices, telehealth and telemedicine, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, smart home, biotechnology, and digital legacy. CONCLUSIONS: The priorities identified in this study represent a wide range of important emerging areas in the fields of digital health, personalized medicine, and data science. Human-centered design and robust governance systems should be considered in future research. It is important that the risks of using these technologies in palliative care are properly addressed to ensure that these tools are used meaningfully, wisely, and safely and do not cause unintentional harm.","output":"Identification of Digital Health Priorities for Palliative Care Research: Modified Delphi Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human-robot interaction has extended its application horizon to simplify how human beings interact with each other through a remotely controlled telepresence robot.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic had significant impacts on clinical education. The central purpose of this research was to recognize student perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on their face-to-face clinical experiences during the global pandemic. Methods A Qualtrics survey was sent to 80 physical therapist assistant students whose clinical education was affected during the 2019 to 2020 academic year. Subjects were asked about the following: factors that influenced their decision to complete clinical rotations during the pandemic;perceptions of learning, safety, and stress under these conditions as well as perceptions of the effectiveness of clinical preparatory activities. Results Twenty-six responses to the survey were received and analyzed using descriptive statistics and nonpaired t -tests calculated for each scaled survey item to compare groups. A majority (83.3%) of the respondents reported graduation followed by professional experience (58.3%) as extremely important factors of consideration for participation in clinical education. Personal safety (33.3%) ranked the lowest of the extremely important factors. In preparing for the clinical experience, 75% reported that individual or small group meetings with the faculty member were extremely helpful. The majority of students (78.26%) strongly agreed that they learned a great deal from the clinical experiences under global pandemic;however, 52.17% reported they found the clinical experiences to be stressful. Conclusion During the global pandemic, students placed greater value on interpersonal, trusted relationships when seeking information. Even though students felt stressed during their clinical education, they perceived that learning did occur. As the impacts of COVID-19 remain, physical therapy programs can use this data to recognize areas that require increased support and preparation for students' clinical experiences to encourage an impactful and sustainable future in clinical education.","output":"Students' Perceptions of Clinical Education during a Global Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There exists a dilemma in the treatment of microsatellite stability (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) owing to limited therapeutic options.

Materials and methods A total of 1562 responders from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region completed a questionnaire-based survey on the awareness, knowledge, and infection control practices related to COVID-19 infection in the healthcare setting. The questionnaire was adapted from the current interim guidance and information for healthcare workers published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Convenient sampling method was used for data collection and the distribution of responses was presented as frequencies and percentages. Descriptive statistics were performed for all groups and subgroups based on the percentage of correct responses. Individual pairwise comparisons were done using the median test for the percentage of correct responses. Results The overall awareness for all subgroups was adequate with 71.2% reporting correct answers. The highest percentage of correct responses were from undergraduate medical students and the lowest was from non-clinical/administrative staff. Less than half of the total respondents could correctly define close contact. More than three-fourths of the responders were aware of the various infection control measures like rapid triage, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette and having a separate, well ventilated waiting area for suspected COVID-19 patients. However, only 45.4% of the responders were aware of the correct sequence for the application of a mask/respirator, and only 52.5% of the responders were aware of the preferred hand hygiene method for visibly soiled hands.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed publicly-distributed nationwide statistics summarizing the monthly number of public LTC insurance users in Japan in the period between April 2018 and March 2021. The degree of decline was quantified as odds ratio (OR), where the ratio of a certain month to the reference month was divided by the ratio in the previous year. Results: The use of LTC services showed unimodal serial change: it started to decline in March 2020 and reached its largest decline in May 2020, which had insufficiently recovered even as of late 2020. The degree of decline was specifically large in services provided in facilities for community-dwelling elderly individuals (adjusted OR 0.719 (95%CI: 0.664 ~ 0.777) in short-stay services and adjusted OR 0.876 (95%CI: 0.820 ~ 0.935) in outpatient services) but was non-significant in other types of service, including those provided for elderly individuals living in nursing homes.

However, longitudinal studies on the relationship between self-efficacy and major depressive disorder (MDD) are scarce. The objectives were to investigate: (1) the associations between self-efficacy and the 1-year and 2-year risks of first onset of MDD and (2) the associations between self-efficacy and the 1-year and 2-year risks of the persistence/recurrence of MDD, in a sample of first-year university students. METHODS We followed 8079 first-year university students for 2 years from April 2018 to October 2020. MDD was ascertained by the Chinese version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-3.0) based on self-report. Self-efficacy was measured by the 10-item General Self-efficacy (GSE) scale. Random effect logistic regression modeling was used to estimate the associations. RESULTS Among participants without a lifetime MDD, the data showed that participants with high baseline GSE scores were associated with a higher risk of first onset of MDD over 2 years [odds ratio (OR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.08]. Among those with a lifetime MDD, participants with high baseline GSE scores were less likely to have had a MDD over 2 years (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.99) compared to others.

The patient complained of prolonged fever and coughs for 7 days which had not improved after oral treatment with sultamicillin for 5 days, prescribed by the patient's general practitioner. Physical examination showed high blood pressure due to previously known hypertension. Other vital signs without pathological findings. Pulmonary auscultation showed basal soft crackling noises of the left lung FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSIS: Laboratory examination showed increased values for LDH, pro-BNP and CRP and normal values for leucocytes and procalcitonin. Conventional X-Ray of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral atypical infiltrates. After the first PCR turned in negative another PCR-analysis for SARS-CoV-2 of a deep oral swab-sample was performed since the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings were typical for COVID-19. Again, SARS-CoV-2-RNA was not detected. A CT-scan of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral ground-glass attenuation, again typical for COVID-19 associated pneumonia. After a third attempt for a PCR-analysis of a deep oral swab-sample was negative, analysis of a sputum was performed which finally confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. THERAPY AND COURSE OF EVENTS: The patient was admitted for evaluation of syncopes and suspect of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. The patient was prophylactically isolated while the result of SARS-CoV-2-PCR from a deep oral swab was pending. Suspecting a possible secondary bacterial infection at the beginning, intravenous antibiotic treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam was initiated. While further examinations showed no indication for bacterial infection, antibiotics were discontinued after 3 days. Due to clinical recovery antiviral therapy was not performed after confirming the diagnosis. The patient was discharged 17 days after onset of first symptoms without any requirements for further isolation. CONCLUSION: This casuistic describes a case of COVID-19 associated pneumonia presenting with typical clinical features, laboratory and radiological findings. Detection of viral RNA was not successful from deep oral swab-samples despite repeated attempts. Finally, PCR-analysis of sputum confirmed the diagnosis.

DTB time and operation time were similar between the two groups (60.0  12.39 vs 58.83  12.85 min, p = 0.636; 61.46  9.91 vs 62.55  10.72 min, p = 0.592). Hospital stay time in COVID-19 group was significantly shorter (6.78  2.14 vs 8.85  2.64 days, p < 0.001). The incidences of malignant arrhythmia and Takotsubo Syndrome in COVID-19 group were higher than 2019 group significantly (16.22% vs 5.21%, p = 0.039; 10.81% vs 1.04% p = 0.008). During hospitalization and 3-month follow-up, the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality in the two groups were statistically similar (35.13% vs 14.58%, p = 0.094; 16.22% vs 8.33%, p = 0.184). The risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was associated with cardiogenic shock (OR, 11.53; 95% CI, 2.888-46.036; p = 0.001), malignant arrhythmias (OR, 7.176; 95% CI, 1.893-27.203; p = 0.004) and advanced age (&#8805; 75 years) (OR, 6.718; 95% CI, 1.738-25.964; p = 0.006).

Nowadays wearing masks have become a norm and lifestyle around the globe. The present investigation was carried out to evaluate the feasibility of developing masks loaded with analytical grade sodium chloride (NaCl), Iodized salts (IS) and Omani sea salt (OSS) with or without sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Methods The saline loaded masks were prepared by soaking the middle layer of the mask in 30 % (w/v) saline solutions (NaCl, IS, OSS) with or without 10% NaHCO3 for 24 hours followed by drying at room temperature. The prepared saline solutions and its combinations were evaluated for antimicrobial efficacy against the bacteria like Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhi, and Staphylococcus aureus, and antifungal activity against the Penicillium spp and Rhizopusspp by agar diffusion. Optical microscopy was employed to observe the formation of salt crystal in the mask material. Survivability of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa was tested on the mask material loaded with 30% OSS+10% NaHCO3 at particular time intervals. Results The results showed that a combination of 30% OSS+10% NaHCO3 exhibited promising antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria as well as Rhizopusspp compared to the 30% IS+10% NaHCO3. Moreover, the middle layer of the mask loaded with saline solutions of 30% OSS+10% NaHCO3 or 30% IS+10% NaHCO3 have antibacterial activity, particularly for oral microbiome. On dehydration, the masks materials showed the presence of a significant amount of salt crystals. Survivability tests showed that both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were killed within 3 hours of contact with the salt crystals on the mask materials. Conclusions A combination of 30% OSS+10% NaHCO3 possessed significant antimicrobial activities on the tested microorganisms. Presence of a significant amount of salt crystals on dehydration of the saline loaded masks can be used as an effective protective barrier to infectious respiratory agents.","output":"Development of saline loaded mask materials, evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy and survivability of selected bacteria on these mask materials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The economic populism said to be represented by the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump and the breakdown in trade and investment following the COVID-19 outbreak have rekindled interest in the redistributive consequences of trade liberalisation Against this backdrop, the authors in this Special Section consider the broader drivers of inclusion and exclusion in trade governance, focusing on the trade politics of Canada, the European Union and the United States This short introduction spells out the importance of considering the interplay between redistributive and deliberative drivers of inclusion and exclusion in producing trade policy contestation It focuses on the three key drivers of inclusion and exclusion that the authors subsequently draw on in their contributions: discursive factors;institutional mechanisms and inter-scalar and multi-level dynamics ?

It was declared by the WHO as a public health emergency. The most susceptible populations, needing mechanical ventilation, are the elderly and people with associated comorbidities. There is an important risk of contagion for anesthetists, dentists, head and neck surgeons, maxillofacial surgeons, ophthalmologists, and otolaryngologists. Health workers represent between 3.8% and 20% of the infected population; some 15% will develop severe complaints and among them, many will lose their lives. A large number of patients do not have overt signs and symptoms (fever/respiratory), yet pose a real risk to surgeons (who should know this fact and must therefore apply respiratory protective strategies for all patients they encounter). All interventions that have the potential to aerosolize aerodigestive secretions should be avoided or used only when mandatory. Health workers who are: pregnant, over 55 to 65 years of age, with a history of chronic diseases (uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and all clinical scenarios where immunosuppression is feasible, including that induced to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and organ transplants) should avoid the clinical attention of a potentially infected patient. Health care facilities should prioritize urgent and emergency visits and procedures until the present condition stabilizes; truly elective care should cease and discussed on a case\\\\by\\\\case basis for patients with cancer. For those who are working with COVID\\\\19 infected patients' isolation is compulsory in the following settings: (a) unprotected close contact with COVID\\\\19 pneumonia patients; (b) onset of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and other symptoms (gastrointestinal complaints, anosmia, and dysgeusia have been reported in a minority of cases). For any care or intervention in the upper aerodigestive tract region, irrespective of the setting and a confirmed diagnosis (eg, rhinoscopy or flexible laryngoscopy in the outpatient setting and tracheostomy or rigid endoscopy under anesthesia), it is strongly recommended that all health care personnel wear personal protective equipment such as N95, gown, cap, eye protection, and gloves.

Methods In this observational study, we utilized a large nationwide registry of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Japan. Patients baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared according to the immunosuppressed state of the patient. The impact of different therapeutic agents on the clinical courses of the patients was evaluated. Results Data of 14,977 patients were included, and 887 (5.9%) were immunosuppressed. The immunosuppressed state of the patient resulted from solid tumor (43.3%, n=384), chemotherapy within 3 months (15.6%, n=138), collagen disease (16.9%, n=150), use of immunosuppressive agents (16.0%, n=142), and metastatic solid tumor (13.5%, n=120). Immunosuppressed patients were older and had a higher severity of illness at admission and during hospitalization than non-immunosuppressed patients. The mortality rates for major diseases causing immunosuppression were as follows: solid tumor, 12.5% (48/384; P < 0.001; relative risk [RR], 3.41); metastatic solid tumor, 31.7% (38/120; P < 0.001; RR, 8.43); leukemia, 23.1% (9/39; P < 0.001; RR, 5.87); lymphoma, 33.3% (20/60; P < 0.001; RR, 8.63); and collagen disease, 15.4% (23/150; P <0.001; RR 3.97).

Fifty-one patients (28 boys, 23 girls) with acute bronchiolitis positive for RSV by direct immunoenzyme assay in nasal secretions (Group A) were studied. Thirty healthy children (17 boys, 13 girls) constituted the control group (Group B). Subjects in both groups were matched for age and gender. The ages (mean+/-SE) in Groups A and B were 4.5+/-0.41 and 5.0+/-0.65 mo, respectively. Venous blood and nasal secretions were taken from patients in group A on 1, 5, and 15 days after admission and once from controls (Group B) for determinations of HNE in nasal lavage and serum, as well as white blood counts (WBC). The peripheral blood eosinophil and neutrophil counts were elevated in 22/51 patients (43.1%) and 15/51 patients (29.4%), respectively. In nasal lavage specimens, neutrophils represented>or=75% and eosinophils>2% of all cells in 42/51 (82.0%) patients and 11/51 (21.5%) patients, respectively. There was strong correlation between the level of HNE and the percentage of neutrophils in nasal lavage (r=0.92). The mean nasal HNE concentrations of the patients on 1, 5, and 15 days after admission were higher than those of Group B (p<0.0001, p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively). Mean serum HNE concentrations on 1, 5, and 15 days after admission were higher in Group A than in Group B (p<0.0001, p<0.0001, p<0.0001, respectively). Nasal and serum HNE concentrations showed no correlations with the clinical score of disease severity (r=0.28 and r=0.29, respectively). This study shows that (a) serum and nasal HNE concentrations were significantly higher in RSV bronchiolitis patients than in controls, (b) they did not return to normal after the respiratory symptoms had improved, and (c) they showed no significant correlations with clinical score of severity. The results indicate that neutrophils contribute significantly to airway inflammation in these subjects and HNE levels in serum and nasal lavage may be useful markers of inflammation in acute RSV bronchiolitis.","output":"Human neutrophil elastase in RSV bronchiolitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lecture capture (LC), the process of recording face-to-face lectures for future viewing, has become a common technology in Western universities in the twenty-first century, yet research on its effectiveness has lagged behind its implementation.

It is still unclear if there is a causal or a correlated relationship between attainment and usage of LC. This systematic review sought to collate and compare the current literature on the efficacy of LC in tertiary mathematics education and provide practical advice for institutions that use or plan to use LC. The literature is consistent in the opinion that students and administrators positively view LC for its utility and flexibility despite the moderately strong evidence that most institutions face attendance drops. However, most students do tend to see attending lectures/watching recordings as an either-or. The literature predominantly reports a negative association between attainment and the use of LC as a substitute to live lectures. The proportion of students who choose to skip live lectures has steadily increased over the last decade as the student campus culture adjusts to LC. Within this group, LC is used imperfectly, providing false benefits and promoting surface learning strategies. There is evidence that regular use of LC by this large group of students may diminish the quality of their learning.

RESULTS: We analyzed 257 remote monitoring visits in 211 patients. Two hundred and six patients answered the follow-up interview; 177 patients (85.9%) remembered the monitoring visit, 140 (67.9%) the health care professional and 181 patients (87.9%) the reason of contact; 169 patients were alone during the visit, 37 with a relative. Patients judged useful both the monitoring during pandemic (4.35  0.28 on a maximum of five) and the possibility to continue after the lockdown (4.34  0.23 on a maximum of five).

Real-time RT-PCR assays are recommended for diagnosis of COVID-19. Here we report a rare case of COVID-19 with multiple negative results for PCR assays outside Wuhan, China. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year old male was admitted to our hospital because of 6 days of unexplained fever on January 29, 2020. He had come from Wuhan city 10 days before admission. Five days before admission, no abnormality was noted in laboratory test, chest radiography, and nasopharyngeal swab test for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. The patient was treated with ibuprofen for alleviating fever. On admission, chest computed tomography showed multiple ground-glass opacities in right lower lung field. COVID-19 was suspected. Three times of nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected after admission. However, none of the specimens were positive. The patient was confirmed with COVID-19 after fifth SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. He was treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, recombinant human interferon alfa-2b inhalation, methylprednisolone. After 18 days of treatment, he was discharged with improved symptoms, lung lesions and negative results of nasopharyngeal swab. CONCLUSION: This case reminds clinician that a patient with high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 but multiple negative RT-PCR result should not be taken out of isolation. A combination of patients exposure history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and typical imaging findings plays a vital role in making preliminary diagnosis and guide early isolation and treatment.

However, evidences reported that real time RT-PCR has a lower sensitivity compared with the droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) leading to possible false negative in low viral load cases. Methods: We used ddPCR for viral genes N1 and N2 on 20 negative (no detection) samples from symptomatic hospitalized COVID-patients presenting fluctuating real time RT-PCR results and 10 suspected samples (Ct value>35) from asymptomatic not hospitalized subjects. Results: ddPCR performed on RNA revealed 65% of positivity for at least one viral target in the hospitalized patients group of samples (35% for N1 and N2, 10% only for N1 and 20% only for N2) and 50% in the suspected cases (30% for N1 and N2, while 20% only for N2). On hospitalized patientssamples, we applied also a direct ddPCR approach on the swab material, achieving an overall positivity of 83%. Conclusion: ddPCR, in particular the direct quantitation on swabs, shows a sensitivity advantage for the SARS-CoV-2 identification and may be useful to reduce the false negative diagnosis, especially for low viral load suspected samples.","output":"Direct Quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 Using Droplet Digital PCR in Suspected Samples With Very Low Viral Load"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-induced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a global spread.

Hospitals throughout the world made life-altering resource allocation decisions and prioritised the care of COVID-19 patients. Without effective models to evaluate resource allocation strategies encompassing COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 care, hospitals face the risk of making sub-optimal local resource allocation decisions. A discrete-event-simulation model is proposed in this paper to describe COVID-19, elective surgery, and emergency surgery patient flows. COVID-19-specific patient flows and a surgical patient flow network were constructed based on data of 475 COVID-19 patients and 28,831 non-COVID-19 patients in Addenbrooke's hospital in the UK. The model enabled the evaluation of three resource allocation strategies, for two COVID-19 wave scenarios: proactive cancellation of elective surgery, reactive cancellation of elective surgery, and ring-fencing operating theatre capacity. The results suggest that a ring-fencing strategy outperforms the other strategies, regardless of the COVID-19 scenario, in terms of total direct deaths and the number of surgeries performed. However, this does come at the cost of 50% more critical care rejections. In terms of aggregate hospital performance, a reactive cancellation strategy prioritising COVID-19 is no longer favourable if more than 7.3% of elective surgeries can be considered life-saving. Additionally, the model demonstrates the impact of timely hospital preparation and staff availability, on the ability to treat patients during a pandemic. The model can aid hospitals worldwide during pandemics and disasters, to evaluate their resource allocation strategies and identify the effect of redefining the prioritisation of patients.","output":"Balancing scarce hospital resources during the COVID-19 pandemic using discrete-event simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed the nature of our social interactions. In order to understand how protective equipment and distancing measures influence the ability to comprehend others emotions and, thus, to effectively interact with others, we carried out an online study across the Italian population during the first pandemic peak.

They were asked to evaluate the expressed emotions as well as to assess the degree to which one would adopt physical and social distancing measures for each stimulus. Results demonstrate that, despite the covering of the lower-face, participants correctly recognized the facial expressions of emotions with a polarizing effect on emotional valence ratings found in females. Noticeably, while females ratings for physical and social distancing were driven by the emotional content of the stimuli, males were influenced by the covered condition.

Systematic microbiological monitoring of deaths provides a fundamental basis to particularly assess underrecording of community-acquired mortality. It should be further elucidated whether a death cohort of previously unreported cases may be structurally different from the cohort of officially registered cases. Methods: A systematic reverse transcription (RT) qPCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 infections from nasopharyngeal swab samples was carried out. A representative sample of corpses from crematoria and the Institute of Legal Medicine of the Federal State of Hamburg were included. A comparative analysis of primarily reported and unreported fatalities in an 8-week period after occurrence of the first pandemic-related deaths in Hamburg was performed. Results: A total of 1231 deaths were included, all of which were previously unsuspicious for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thereof 29 cases of previously unknown infections were recorded. In the first phase of the pandemic, incidental findings predominantly occurred among younger people from domestic environments with unclear or unnatural manner of death at the Institute of Legal Medicine. Over time, incidental findings investigated at the crematoria increased, mostly related to nursing home residents. The overall cohort showed no significant sociodemographic differences to a comparative collective of known SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths. Primarily unreported cases showed a significantly lower proportion of COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death.

DESIGN Qualitative study embedded within a randomised controlled trial. Semistructured interviews were conducted with patients. Transcripts were analysed using qualitative template analysis. SETTING In the Comprehensive Care Programme (CCP) Study, in Illinois, USA, Medicare patients at increased risk of hospitalisation are randomly assigned to: (1) care by a CCP physician who serves as a PCP across both inpatient and outpatient settings or (2) care by a PCP as outpatient and by hospitalists as inpatients (standard care). PARTICIPANTS Twelve standard care and 12 CCP patients were interviewed. RESULTS Themes included: (1) Positive attitude towards PCP; (2) Longitudinal continuity with PCP valued; (3) Patient preference for PCP involvement in hospital care; (4) Potential for in-depth involvement of PCP during hospitalisation often unrealised (involvement rare in standard care; in CCP, frequent interaction with PCP fostered patient involvement in decision making); and (5) PCP collaboration with hospital-based providers frequently absent (no interaction for standard care patients; CCP patients emphasising PCP's role in interdisciplinary coordination).

Instead of representing interventions as modulations of the parameters of a free running epidemic we introduce a model structure that accounts for the actions but does not assume the results. The disease is modelled in terms of the progression of viremia reported in scientific works. The emergence of symptoms in the model reflects the statistics of a nation-wide highly detailed database consisting of more than 62000 cases (about a half of the confirmed by RT-PCR tests) with recorded symptoms in Argentina. The stochastic model displays several of the characteristics of COVID-19 such as a high variability in the evolution of the outbreaks, including long periods in which they run undetected, spontaneous extinction followed by a late outbreak and unimodal as well as bimodal progressions of daily counts of cases (second waves without ad-hoc hypothesis). We show how the relation between undetected cases (including the 'asymptomatic' cases) and detected cases changes as a function of the public policies, the efficiency of the implementation and the timing with respect to the development of the outbreak. We show also that the relation between detected cases and total cases strongly depends on the implemented policies and that detected cases cannot be regarded as a measure of the outbreak, being the dependency between total cases and detected cases in general not monotonic as a function of the efficiency in the intervention method. According to the model, it is possible to control an outbreak with interventions based on the detection of symptoms only in the case when the presence of just one symptom prompts isolation and the detection efficiency reaches about 80% of the cases.

Since this requires the production of special molds and the sintering is typically carried out in a continuous furnace, this process is time-consuming and cost-intensive. Therefore, it is only worthwhile for medium and large batches. Another influencing factor of the powder metallurgical process route is the high thermal load during the sintering process. Due to their high thermal sensitivity, superabrasives such as diamond or cubic boron nitride are very difficult to process in this way. In this study, a novel and innovative approach is presented, in which superabrasive grinding wheels are manufactured by thermal spraying. For this purpose, flat samples as well as grinding wheel bodies were coated by low-pressure (LP) cold gas spraying with a blend of a commercial Cu-Al(2)O(3) cold gas spraying powder and nickel-coated diamonds. The coatings were examined metallographically in terms of their composition. A well-embedded superabrasive content of 12 % was achieved. After the spraying process, the grinding wheels were conditioned and tested for the grinding application of cemented carbides and the topographies of both the grinding wheel and the cemented carbide were evaluated. Surface qualities of the ground surface that are comparable to those of other finishing processes were reached.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and preventive practices of Iranians toward the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of 925 people who completed an online questionnaire in March 2020. The study used 21 and 14 questions, respectively, to assess the knowledge and preventive practices of the population in regard to COVID-19. Cronbach's alpha was 0.75 for the knowledge scale and 0.71 for the practice scale. To determine the importance of each independent variable in explaining the participant's practice, a multiple regression model was applied. KEY RESULTS: The results indicated a moderate level of knowledge and preventive practices in regard to COVID-19 in most of the respondents (56.8% and 56.5%, respectively). According to the multiple regression analysis, knowledge showed the highest effect on the practice of the participants ( = 0.479). The determination coefficient for the model (R(2) = 0.509) also showed approximately 51% of the variance in practice was explained by gender, occupational status, knowledge, cost of hand sanitizer, and the belief in the effectiveness of using such necessities. CONCLUSIONS: Acceptable rates of knowledge and practice were observed in most Iranians. However, approximately 10% of the participants were unaware of the effective measures for preventing the infection, which can cause active transmission of the virus.

Yet, most studies have explored sexual harassment among female professionals. This study departs from current research practices and investigates the frequency of sexual harassment in male nurses working in the Greek NHS and the reasons for not reporting their experiences. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted using the Sexual Experiences Questionnaire (SEQ) to collect data from 507 male nurses working in Greece's various settings during October and February 2021. The electronic survey was sent to male nurses (n=3,091 registered with the Hellenic Association of Nurses. Survey items were consent form, demographics, three-dimensions of sexual harassment, silencing and negative consequences. Questions were measured using five-point Likert scales, binary scale and multiple-choice questions. ANOVA and T-tests were used to investigate whether specific groups more frequently dealt with sexual harassment. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate the association between independent variables (sexually harassing behaviours) and the dependent variable (participants' negative physical, mental, and job-related outcomes). RESULTS 40% of male nurses have experienced sexual harassment at least once in their working lives, and the most common form of sexual harassment faced was gender harassment, followed by unwanted sexual attention. Male doctors and male nurses were the most common perpetrators. Private and younger male nurses with up to 5 years of experience experienced more frequent sexual harassment. 30% did not report sexual harassment due to the fear that no one would believe them, and because of beliefs, no action would be taken against the wrongdoer. Multiple regression analyses showed that unwanted sexual attention and sexual coercion were associated with physical and job-related outcomes. Cronbach Alpha was 0.91. CONCLUSION A high proportion of male nurses have experienced sexual harassment during their careers. Being younger with limited working experience and working in the private sector were positively associated with sexual harassment.

The extent to which ischemia contributes to ischemia/reperfusion injury has not been thoroughly studied.

This injury was drastically reduced in C3-deficient mice, suggesting C3 involvement. Depletion of circulating complement with cobra venom factor eliminated, as expected, injury recorded at the end of the reperfusion phase but failed to eliminate injury that occurred during the ischemic phase. Immunohistochemical studies showed that tissue damage during ischemia was associated with increased expression of C3/C3 fragments primarily in the intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting local involvement of complement. In vitro studies using Caco2 intestinal epithelial cells showed that in the presence of LPS or exposure to hypoxic conditions the cells produce higher C3 mRNA as well as C3a fragment. Caco2 cells were also noted to produce cathepsins B and L, and inhibition of cathepsins suppressed the release of C3a. Finally, we found that mice treated with a cathepsin inhibitor and cathepsin B-deficient mice suffer limited intestinal injury during the ischemic phase. To our knowledge, our findings demonstrate for the first time that significant intestinal injury occurs during ischemia prior to reperfusion and that this is due to activation of C3 within the intestinal epithelial cells in a cathepsin-dependent manner. Modulation of cathepsin activity may prevent injury of organs exposed to ischemia.","output":"Intracellular Activation of Complement 3 Is Responsible for Intestinal Tissue Damage during Mesenteric Ischemia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Malaysias tourism is affected by the Covid19 pandemic and the MCO implementation, where borders are closed and non-essential activities are halted Negative effects are also felt by Malaysians and are reflected in social media This study examines two research questions, finding the issues that Twitter users have been addressing on tourism activities during the MCO period and analyze users sentiment regarding their ability to travel after MCO 5000 data were extracted manually from 11357 data scraped from Twitter, of which 3243 were pre-processed keywords using RapidMiner The results show that the topic of the debate focuses on three themes, namely the destination of tourism, future planning, and public emotions In addition, 63% gave a positive view and 22% negative sentiment on domestic tourism Overall, users of Twitter gave an optimistic outlook on domestic travel and hoped that Covid19 would soon be over","output":"A Social Media Mining Using Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis on Tourism in Malaysia During Covid19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many of the policies that were put into place during the Covid-19 pandemic had a common goal: to flatten the curve of the number of infected people so that its peak remains under a critical threshold This letter considers the challenge of engineering a strategy that enforces such a goal using control theory We introduce a simple formulation of the optimal flattening problem, and provide a closed form solution This is augmented through nonlinear closed loop tracking of the nominal solution, with the aim of ensuring close-to-optimal performance under uncertain conditions A key contribution of this paper is to provide validation of the method with extensive and realistic simulations in a Covid-19 scenario, with particular focus on the case of Codogno -a small city in Northern Italy that has been among the most harshly hit by the pandemic IEEE","output":"Covid-19 and Flattening the Curve: a Feedback Control Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, caused by SARS CoV-2, is an acute respiratory viral illness We present the experience of treating patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in a Role 3 hospital in an active warzone METHODS: This is a retrospective care series of patients treated for COVID-19 at Craig Joint Theater Hospital, Bagram, Afghanistan from May to August 2020 Data extracted included demographics, admission and disposition information, past medical history, comorbidities, Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) severity classification (i e Category A, Category B), and treatments received RESULTS: This series included 15 Category A and 55 Category B patients Most patients were non-US contractors with one chronic condition Most patients received medical treatments in accordance with Department of Defense Practice Management Guidelines For Category A patients, mechanical ventilation use declined from a mean average of 10 67 days to 2 83 days following the introduction of high-flow nasal cannula Average hospital length of stay was 6 days (range 2-23) One death occurred in a patient greater than 60 years old with three known prior medical conditions Most patients were discharged to a non-medical isolation facility Aeromedically evacuated patients were mostly US military and US contractors CONCLUSION: We faced several challenges including retrofitting a Role 3 facility designed for trauma care for management of a highly contagious respiratory viral illness Logistics constraints impacted timely delivery of medical therapies and equipment and decreased efficiency of aeromedical evacuation Despite these challenges and the simultaneous trauma mission, most patients received medical care in accordance with treatment guidelines with a low mortality rate","output":"Treatment of Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 in a US Military Role 3 Facility in Afghanistan: A Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: DLBCL is highly heterogeneous in underlying biology and clinical behavior. Several high-risk disease features and poor prognostic factors are associated with a higher propensity for refractory disease or relapse after standard R-CHOP therapy;these subset patients require novel strategies to improve upon outcomes. Single-agent TAK-659, a novel oral SYK inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy in heavily pre-treated DLBCL (Gordon et al., Clin Cancer Res, 2020). We report results of a phase I single institution, single arm dose escalation study that assessed safety of 1 st line treatment with R-CHOP and adjunctive TAK-659 for treatment na?ve high-risk DLBCL. Methods: Patients aged 18 years, ECOG 0-2 with untreated stage I-IV DLBCL with high-risk features defined as, ABC/non-GCB subtype, high-intermediate or high-risk NCCN-IPI (score 4), MYC gene rearranged by FISH including double hit lymphoma (DHL), double expressing DLBCL (DEL;overexpression of MYC 40% AND BCL2 50% by IHC respectively), or previously treated transformed low-grade lymphoma without prior exposure to anthracycline, were eligible. Patients were treated with R-CHOP for 1 cycle on or off study followed by combined treatment with R-CHOP and TAK-659 for an additional 5 cycles on study. TAK-659 was dosed daily with dosing escalated from 60mg (dose level 1), to 80mg (dose level 2) to 100mg (dose level 3) based on a 3+3 design. The primary objective was to determine the safety and establish the maximum tolerated dose of TAK-659 when combined with R-CHOP in the front-line treatment of high-risk DLBCL. Secondary objectives were to assess preliminary efficacy of this combination as determined by overall response rate (ORR) by PET-CT (Lugano 2014 criteria), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and establish the pharmacokinetics of TAK-659 according to dose. Results: 12 pts were enrolled from Dec 2019 to Nov 2021. The median age was 64 yrs (range 25-75);8 (67%) had stage III/IV disease, 4 (33%) with high risk NCCN-IPI  4. Histology included 7 (58%) with de novo DLBCL (4 GCB, 3 non-GCB subtype DLBCL) including 7 (58%) with DEL, 3 (25%) with transformed FL, 1 (8%) with Richter's and 1 (8%) with DHL. Dose level 3 (100 mg) was established as the MTD. PKs were measured pre- and post-dose D1 and D15 of cycle 2;Cuzick's test signaled an increase in AUC by dose level on D1 (p = 0.01) but not on D15 (Fig 1). ORR was 100% (CR 92%;Fig 2). With a median follow-up of 14.2 months, 1 pt had primary refractory disease (ABC and DEL), 2 pts with CR subsequently progressed (1 non-GC DLBCL, 1 Richter's) and 1 died of cardiogenic shock unrelated to study drug. The 12-month PFS and OS rates were 82% and 90% respectively with estimated 18-month PFS and OS rates of 68% and 90% respectively. The most common treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) attributed to TAK-659 were lymphopenia (n=12, 100%), infection (6=, 50%), AST elevation (n = 12, 100%) and ALT elevation (n = 10, 83%) (Table). Incidence and severity of transaminitis was consistent with prior reports for this agent. Most common grade 3/4 toxicities were hematologic. Median number of cycles of TAK-659 delivered was 5 (range 3-5). TRAEs led to TAK-659 dose modifications in 8 (67%) pts, though none at dose level 1: 2 (17%) required permanent dose reductions (both for lung infections), while 5 (42%) required discontinuation (4 for infection, and 1 for febrile neutropenia). R-CHOP administration was delayed in 2 pts because of TAK-659 related TRAEs. Aside from dose modifications of vincristine for peripheral neuropathy, no additional dose modifications for R-CHOP were needed. Infections encountered included bacterial and opportunistic infections (1 each for PJP, CMV and aspergillosis) and 1 case of COVID. Growth factor prophylaxis and anti-fungal therapy were not mandated;PJP prophylaxis was advised for CD4 counts < 200 at initial diagnosis. Conclusion: TAK-659, a novel SYK inhibitor combined with R-CHOP in pts with newly diagnosed high-risk DLBCL including DLBCL transformed from follic lar lymphoma and DEL produces high CR rates;survival at 12 months appears promising. A dose of 60 mg was well tolerated, did not require dose modifications and maintained a similar AUC to the MTD of 100 mg with ongoing treatment. Opportunistic infections were noted with this treatment combination suggesting that patients should receive aggressive anti-microbial prophylaxis with future evaluation of this combination.

This required a rapid (< 2 weeks) acquisition of knowledge and flexibility in using technology, most commonly Zoom. Upon completion of the semester, and after debriefing with numerous faculty teaching required courses across the biomedical engineering department at ____ University, the most common comments were that the online engagement and the online environment were nothing close to the traditional classroom environment: students were less likely to show up; less likely to enable their cameras so you could see their faces; and less likely to ask or answer questions in class. To address these issues, in this paper we make easily implementable recommendations that will increase engagement and improve the inclusivity of online courses that can be applied to any biomedical engineering course offered in an online environment. Student engagement is especially important for promoting student learning as has been well documented in education research (Taylor and Parsons in Curr. Issues Educ, 2011. Retrieved from http://cie.asu.edu/; Armstrong in The Best Schools: how human development research should inform educational practice. Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD), Alexandria; 2006). The four recommendations for improving the engagement in the online classroom are: (1) make it a priority to stress the importance of having their cameras on during lecture and explain why its important; (2) have a Daily Question at the start of lecture where all students respond in chat followed by a brief discussion; (3) make use of the polling feature in Zoom to frequently assess student understanding and upon discovering student confusion on any given question, send them to breakout rooms to discuss, incorporating a quick active learning exercise that can help reduce the monotony of online lecture; and (4) create handouts that are circulated prior to class for students to take different pieces of a particular problem, solve them in their teams in individual breakout rooms, and then discuss the content and results back in class with all teams together. These techniques were shown to increase engagement and attendance and fostered a welcoming environment in the online classroom, contributing positively to student experience and in turn allowing students to achieve student learning outcomes despite the difficult circumstances.

DESIGN: Qualitative study using semistructured face-to-face interviews and focus groups. All interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed, by two researchers independently, based on the thematic analysis. SETTING: Alongside a randomised controlled trial to establish the (cost-)effectiveness of psychosomatic therapy in patients with PSS in primary care, we conducted a process evaluation with a qualitative study. Patients were recruited in general practice in three regions in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Interviews were conducted with twenty patients with PSS who received psychosomatic therapy and 25 psychosomatic therapists. In addition, two focus groups were conducted with six and seven psychosomatic therapists, respectively. INTERVENTION: Psychosomatic therapy, delivered by specialised exercise and physical therapists, is a multimodal and tailored treatment based on the biopsychosocial model. OUTCOME MEASURES: Experiences, opinions and views from patients and therapists perspective on psychosomatic therapy were identified. RESULTS: A total of 37 interviews with patients, 25 interviews and two focus groups with therapists were analysed. Three main themes emerged from the data of the patients: (1) continuous alternation of psychosocial conversations and body-oriented exercises; (2) awareness of bodyCmind connection and (3) good relationship with therapist. Four main themes emerged from the data of the therapists (1) building rapport; (2) continuously searching for common ground; (3) making patients aware of the interaction between body and mind; and (4) continuous alternation between exploration and treatment. CONCLUSION: According to patients as well as therapists, the continuous alternation of psychosocial conversations and body-oriented exercises to provide awareness of the interaction between body and mind are the perceived working mechanism of psychosomatic therapy. Therapeutic alliance and finding common ground between patient and therapist are prerequisites for the success of psychosomatic therapy.

The respiratory disease is the most consequential global public health crisis of the 21st century whose level of negative impact increasingly experienced globally has not been recorded since World War II. Up till now, there has been no specific globally authorized antiviral drug, vaccines, supplement or herbal remedy available for the treatment of this lethal disease except preventive measures, supportive care and non-specific treatment options adopted in different countries via divergent approaches to halt the pandemic.

Given the recent outbreaks of contagious infectious diseases worldwide, including Ebola virus and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, there is urgent need for further research to determine optimal PPE use in high-risk settings. This review intends to provide a general understanding of PPE and to provide guidelines for appropriate use based on current evidence. RECENT FINDINGS Although previous studies have focused on the efficacy of PPE in preventing transmission of pathogens, recent studies have examined the dangers to HCWs during removal of PPE when risk of contamination is highest. Access to adequate PPE supplies is crucial to preventing transmission of pathogens, especially in resource-limited settings. Adherence to appropriate PPE use is a challenge due to inadequate education on its usage, technical difficulties, and tolerability of PPE in the workplace. Future projects aim at ameliorating this situation, including redesigning PPE which is crucial to improving the safety of HCWs.

This has reduced opportunities to exercise while also shedding some light on the importance of physical health. Based on an online survey, this paper investigated physical activity behaviours of a Belgians sample (n = 427) during the lockdown period between the end of May 2020 and the beginning of June 2020 and found that, during this period, the gap between sufficiently and insufficiently active individuals widened even more. This paper analysed important moderators of physical activity behaviours, such as barriers and benefits to exercise, digital support used to exercise, and individuals' emotional well-being. Descriptive analysis and analyses of variance indicated that, generally, individuals significantly increased their engagement in exercise, especially light- and moderate-intensity activities, mostly accepted the listed benefits but refused the listed barriers, increased their engagement in digital support and did not score high on any affective measures. A comparison between sufficiently active and insufficiently active individuals during the lockdown showed that the former engaged even more in physical activity, whereas the latter exercised equally (i.e., not enough) or even less compared to before the lockdown. By means of a logistic regression, five key factors of belonging to the sufficiently active group were revealed and discussed.

Methods This was a prospective, multicenter, non-interventional longitudinal study across 15 specialist rheumatology centers. Consecutive AIRD patients on treatment with immunosuppressants were recruited and followed up longitudinally to assess parameters contributing to development of COVID-19 and its outcome. Results COVID-19 occurred in 314(3.45%) of 9212 AIRD patients during a median follow up of 177 (IQR 129,219) days. Long term HCQ use had no major impact on the occurrence or the outcome of COVID-19. Glucocorticoids in moderate dose (7.5-20mg/day) conferred higher risk (RR = 1.72) of infection. Among the IS, Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), Cyclophosphamide (CYC) and Rituximab (RTX) use was higher in patients with COVID 19. However, the conventional risk factors such as male sex (RR = 1.51), coexistent diabetes mellitus (RR = 1.64), pre-existing lung disease (RR = 2.01) and smoking (RR = 3.32) were the major contributing risk factors for COVID-19. Thirteen patients (4.14%) died, the strongest risk factor being pre-existing lung disease (RR = 6.36, p = 0.01). Incidence ((17.5 vs 5.3 per 1 lakh (Karnataka) and 25.3 vs 7.9 per 1 lakh(Kerala) ) and case fatality (4.1% vs 1.3 % (Karnataka) and 4.3% vs 0.4% (Kerala)) rate of COVID-19 was significantly higher (p < 0.001) compared to the general population of the corresponding geographic region. Conclusions Immunosuppressants have a differential impact on the risk of COVID-19 occurrence in AIRD patients. Older age, males, smokers, hypertensive, diabetic and underlying lung disease contributed to higher risk. The incidence rate and the case fatality rate in AIRD patients is much higher than that in the general population.","output":"A Prospective Longitudinal Study Evaluating The Influence of Immunosuppressives and Other Factors On COVID-19 in Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) is a commonly used self-reporting questionnaire used to measure adult attachment styles. The RQ has two parts. RQ1, a single item where individuals have to indicate their preferred relationship style, and RQ2, where individuals can rate their relationship style in more detail using four different scales. Agreement is expected between the highest levels selected and the style chosen in RQ1. An advantage of the RQ is its brevity, whereas a disadvantage is that it constitutes a single item. A validation of RQ has not been clearly demonstrated, even though it has convergent validity in relation to other measurements in this area. Methods: 168 patients completed the RQ, the short version of the Experience in Close Relationships (Revised) questionnaire (ECR-R), and scales of depression and interpersonal problems. Regression analysis was conducted to examine the congruity in regard to attachment theory. Results: ratings from 15.5% of the patients showed disagreement between RQ1 and RQ2. Each type of attachment measured by the RQ was predicted by the ECR-R scores, as hypothesized. In the predictive analysis of depression and interpersonal problems, both RQ dimensions and ECR-R scores were coherent.

Recent guidelines from the AUA/CUA/SUFU and advancements in the field reflect a paradigm shift for clinician and patients, steering away from empiric antibiotic therapy towards judicious antibiotic use. RECENT FINDINGS Antibiotic stewardship, including increasing awareness of the collateral damage of antibiotics and the risks of bacterial resistance are a major focus of the new guidelines. Accurate diagnosis of rUTIs is imperative. Urine cultures are necessary to document rUTI and should be obtained prior to any treatment. First line treatment options (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin) should be used whenever possible. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated in these patients with rUTI. Although antibiotic prophylaxis methods are effective, nonantibiotic regimens show promise. SUMMARY The management of rUTIs has evolved significantly with the goals of antibiotic stewardship. It is increasingly important to ensure the accuracy of diagnosis with a positive urine culture in the setting of cystitis symptoms, and standardize treatment with first-line therapies to minimize antibiotic side effects.","output":"New paradigms in the management of recurrent urinary tract infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Tensor decomposition- and principal component analysis-based unsupervised feature extraction were proposed almost 5 and 10 years ago, respectively; although these methods have been successfully applied to a wide range of genome analyses, including drug repositioning, biomarker identification, and disease-causing genes identification, some fundamental problems have been identified: the number of genes identified was too small to assume that there were no false negatives, and the histogram of P-values derived was not fully coincident with the null hypothesis that principal component and singular value vectors follow the Gaussian distribution. Results Optimizing the standard deviation such that the histogram of P-values is as much as possible coincident with the null hypothesis results in an increase in the number and biological reliability of the selected genes. Conclusions Tensor decomposition- and principal component analysis-based unsupervised feature extraction are perhaps better than state-of-art methods in regard to predicting differentially expressed genes because they achieve the desired property that the less expressed differentially expressed genes should be less likely selected or even associated with the same amount of logarithmic fold change, although they assume neither negative binomial distribution nor dispersion relation, which is usually assumed in state-of-art methods.","output":"Tensor decomposition- and principal component analysis-based unsupervised feature extraction to select more reasonable differentially expressed genes: Optimization of standard deviation versus state-of-art methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the Covid-19 pandemic has altered many aspects of life in South Korea over 2020, its impact on South Koreas religious landscape has been enormous as the countrys three major religions (Catholicism, Buddhism, and Protestant Christianity) have suffered considerable loses in both their income and membership Despite these challenges, however, Buddhisms public image has actually improved since the start of the epidemic due to the rapid and proactive responses of the nations largest Buddhist organization, the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism (K Daehan bulgyo jogyejong) This article critically examines the Jogye Orders response to the epidemic and its impact on the order thus far, along with discussions regarding the orders future In particular it will examine the results of three conferences held by the order in response to the epidemic and the resulting recommendations on how Korean Buddhism should adapt to effectively address the many challenges brought by the pandemic These recommendations include establishing an online Buddhist education system, further engaging the orders lay supporters through various social media platforms, upgrading the current lay education program with virtual learning options that directly address problems faced by the general public during the pandemic, and distributing virtual meditation classes world-wide for those who remain in quarantine or social isolation By adopting these changes, the Jogye Order will be able to play a crucial role in promoting mental stability and the cultivation of positive emotions among the many suffering from anxiety, social isolation and financial difficulties during the pandemic","output":"Covid-19 and Korean Buddhism: Assessing the Impact of South Koreas Coronavirus Epidemic on the Future of Its Buddhist Community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Over the last decades, there has been a proliferation of cash transfer programmes across the global South.

The reduction of hospital beds and the number of infectious diseases doctors in order to increase the average salary in healthcare has led to the inability of the Russian healthcare system to cope with the spread of coronavirus infection without involving residents, professors, teachers and students of medical organizations. At the present stage of development, the issues of combating the spread of coronavirus infection, mobilization and professional training of medical workers are of particular relevance. Nevertheless, despite the results of the health care reform, which led to a massive reduction of medical organizations in our country, the number of doctors per 10,000 people in 2018 was 47.9 employees, over the past 20 years, has not changed much in the direction of reduction. In our view, we should not talk about a global reduction in human resources in healthcare.

NSAIDs are an important analgesic, particularly in those with rheumatological disease, and are widely available to the general public without prescription. Evidence from community studies, administrative data, and small studies of hospitalised patients suggest NSAIDs are not associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes. We aimed to characterise the safety of NSAIDs and identify whether pre-existing NSAID use was associated with increased severity of COVID-19 disease. Methods: This prospective, multicentre cohort study included patients of any age admitted to hospital with a confirmed or highly suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to COVID-19 between Jan 17 and Aug 10, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were disease severity at presentation, admission to critical care, receipt of invasive ventilation, receipt of non-invasive ventilation, use of supplementary oxygen, and acute kidney injury. NSAID use was required to be within the 2 weeks before hospital admission. We used logistic regression to estimate the effects of NSAIDs and adjust for confounding variables. We used propensity score matching to further estimate effects of NSAIDS while accounting for covariate differences in populations. Results: Between Jan 17 and Aug 10, 2020, we enrolled 78a??674 patients across 255 health-care facilities in England, Scotland, and Wales. 72a??179 patients had death outcomes available for matching; 40a??406 (562%) of 71a??915 were men, 31a??509 (438%) were women. In this cohort, 4211 (58%) patients were recorded as taking systemic NSAIDs before admission to hospital. Following propensity score matching, balanced groups of NSAIDs users and NSAIDs non-users were obtained (4205 patients in each group). At hospital admission, we observed no significant differences in severity between exposure groups. After adjusting for explanatory variables, NSAID use was not associated with worse in-hospital mortality (matched OR 095, 95% CI 084-107; p=035), critical care admission (101, 087-117; p=089), requirement for invasive ventilation (096, 080-117; p=069), requirement for non-invasive ventilation (112, 096-132; p=014), requirement for oxygen (100, 089-112; p=097), or occurrence of acute kidney injury (108, 092-126; p=033). Interpretation: NSAID use is not associated with higher mortality or increased severity of COVID-19. Policy makers should consider reviewing issued advice around NSAID prescribing and COVID-19 severity.

This stems from the heterogeneous response of individuals to disease and is reflected in the inter-individual variability of gene expression responses that obscures differential gene expression analysis.

We define gene ensemble noise as a measure that represents a variance for a collection of genes encoding for either members of known biological pathways or subunits of annotated protein complexes and calculated within an individual. The gene ensemble noise allows for the holistic identification and interpretation of gene expression disbalance on the level of gene networks and systems. By comparing gene expression data from COVID-19, H1N1, and sepsis patients we identified common disturbances in a number of pathways and protein complexes relevant to the sepsis pathology. Among others, these include the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and peroxisomes. This suggests a Warburg effect and oxidative stress as common hallmarks of the immune hostCpathogen response. Finally, we showed that gene ensemble noise could successfully be applied for the prediction of clinical outcome namely, the mortality of patients. Thus, we conclude that gene ensemble noise represents a promising approach for the investigation of molecular mechanisms of pathology through a prism of alterations in the coherent expression of gene circuits.","output":"Estimates of gene ensemble noise highlight critical pathways and predict disease severity in H1N1, COVID-19 and mortality in sepsis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the wake of temporary stability in the increase of infection numbers of COVID-19 around June / July in 2020, a number of governments have partially or totally lifted the restrictions in haste, aiming to restart the economy as soon as possible.

Emerging risk factors for poor outcome in this disease include age, male gender, cardiovascular co-morbidities including hypertension, prior cardiovascular disease, diabetes and more recently obesity. To date there are no data relating to SARS-CoV-2 in PCOS women. The present Clinical Opinion represents a summary of the epidemiological evidence and possible pathophysiological mechanisms regarding PCOS and COVID-19. PCOS women could be more susceptible to infections compared to non-PCOS women. Insulin resistance and the associated hyperinsulinaemia are drivers for enhanced steroidogenesis in women with PCOS. Weight-gain and obesity, through their worsening effects on insulin resistance, thereby drive enhanced steroidogenesis and hyperandrogenism. All these features represent key points to provide an explanation for the possible association between PCOS and SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, androgens may drive clinical results in COVID-19, through the expression of TMPRSS2, a cellular co-receptor necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection and through androgen-mediated immune modulation. In women with PCOS the endocrine-immune axis leads to immune dysfunction with a state of chronic inflammation, and hyperandrogenism and IR with compensatory hyperglycaemia could play a determining role in the pathophysiogenesis of the infection. However, it is possible that only specific PCOS phenotypes may be more susceptible. In addition, vitamin D deficiency and gut dysbiosis are another important factor potentially involved in the increased risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 in PCOS women.

Early detection of outbreaks is improved by systems that are comprehensive and specific with respect to the pathogen but are rapid in reporting the data. It has proven difficult to implement these requirements on a large scale while maintaining patient privacy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the automated export, aggregation, and analysis of infectious disease diagnostic test results from clinical laboratories across the United States in a manner that protects patient confidentiality. We hypothesized that such a system could aid in monitoring the seasonal occurrence of respiratory pathogens and may have advantages with regard to scope and ease of reporting compared with existing surveillance systems. METHODS: We describe a system, BioFire Syndromic Trends, for rapid disease reporting that is syndrome-based but pathogen-specific. Deidentified patient test results from the BioFire FilmArray multiplex molecular diagnostic system are sent directly to a cloud database. Summaries of these data are displayed in near real time on the Syndromic Trends public website. We studied this dataset for the prevalence, seasonality, and coinfections of the 20 respiratory pathogens detected in over 362,000 patient samples acquired as a standard-of-care testing over the last 4 years from 20 clinical laboratories in the United States. RESULTS: The majority of pathogens show influenza-like seasonality, rhinovirus has fall and spring peaks, and adenovirus and the bacterial pathogens show constant detection over the year. The dataset can also be considered in an ecological framework; the viruses and bacteria detected by this test are parasites of a host (the human patient). Interestingly, the rate of pathogen codetections, on average 7.94% (28,741/362,101), matches predictions based on the relative abundance of organisms present. CONCLUSIONS: Syndromic Trends preserves patient privacy by removing or obfuscating patient identifiers while still collecting much useful information about the bacterial and viral pathogens that they harbor. Test results are uploaded to the database within a few hours of completion compared with delays of up to 10 days for other diagnostic-based reporting systems. This work shows that the barriers to establishing epidemiology systems are no longer scientific and technical but rather administrative, involving questions of patient privacy and data ownership. We have demonstrated here that these barriers can be overcome. This first look at the resulting data stream suggests that Syndromic Trends will be able to provide high-resolution analysis of circulating respiratory pathogens and may aid in the detection of new outbreaks.","output":"Automated Real-Time Collection of Pathogen-Specific Diagnostic Data: Syndromic Infectious Disease Epidemiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the production of novel devices intended to protect airway managers during the aerosol-generating procedure of tracheal intubation. Using an in-situ simulation model, we evaluated laryngoscopist exposure of airborne particles sized 0.3 - 5.0 microns using five aerosol containment devices (aerosol box; sealed box with and without suction; vertical drape; and horizontal drape) compared with no aerosol containment device. Nebulised saline was used as the aerosol-generating model for 300 s, at which point, the devices were removed to assess particle spread. Primary outcome was the quantity and size of airborne particles measured at the level of the laryngoscopist's head at 30, 60, 120 and 300 s, as well as 360 s (60 s after device removal). Airborne particles sizes of 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 microns were quantified using an electronic airborne particle counter. Compared with no device use, the sealed intubation box with suction resulted in a decrease in 0.3, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.5 micron, but not 5.0 micron, particle exposure over all time-periods (p = 0.003 for all time periods).

MethodsVaccine efficacies were estimated from the titre distributions of 50% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50), assuming that PRNT50 titres of primary vaccination decreased by 2-10 folds due to antibody waning and emergence of VOCs, and an additional dose of vaccine would increase PRNT50 titres by 3- or 9-fold. We then used an existing SARS-CoV-2 transmission model to assess the outcomes of vaccine allocation strategies with and without the use of antivirals for symptomatic patients in Japan, Hong Kong and Vietnam. FindingsIncreasing primary vaccination coverage was the most important contributing factor in reducing the total and peak number of COVID-19 hospitalizations, especially when population vaccine coverage or vaccine uptake among older adults was low. Providing antivirals to 50% of symptomatic infections only further reduced total and peak hospitalizations by 10-13%.

Together with depth of response (DpR), new alternative metrics have been provided, yielding promising outcome parameters. In this analysis, we aimed to further characterize ETS and DpR. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This analysis was based on FIRE-3, a randomized phase 3 trial comparing first-line FOLFIRI plus either cetuximab or bevacizumab in KRAS exon 2 wild-type mCRC.

The impact of baseline location and size of metastases on ETS and DpR were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Of 592 patients, 395 (66.7%) had data available for radiologic review. Median continuous ETS for lung, liver, and suspected lymph node metastases was 20%, 23%, and 30%, respectively.

The identification of multifaceted etiological changes at the protein level in RA remains an important need. We aimed to identify differential proteins (DPs) and gene profiles to uncover inflammatory indicators and their association to RA pathogenesis. Methods: 2-DE and SWATH-MS were used to identify DPs in RA and healthy control plasma. Fluorescence phenylboronate gel electrophoresis (Flu-PAGE) with mass spectrometry was used for protein glycation in RA plasma. Disease specificity of identified DPs was confirmed by ELISA and Western blot analysis. The gene expressions of selected DPs were evaluated by qRT-PCR in PBMCs of RA, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), spondyloarthritis (SpA), and osteoarthritis (OA). The functional implication of glycated protein was determined by in- silico and validated by in vitro analysis in fibroblast-like synoviocytes. Results: A total of 150 DPs (127 increased and 23 decreased) were identified by 2-DE and SWATH-MS analysis in RA plasma compared to healthy control (HC). Nine proteins were identified as glycated by Flu-PAGE LC-MS/MS. Transthyretin (TTR), serotransferrin, and apolipoprotein-A1 (Apo-A1) were found to be differential and glycated. ELISA and Western blot results revealed the disease-specific increased expression of TTR and RAGE in RA. The qRT-PCR results signify the aberrant gene expression of TTR and RAGE, found to be associated with RA when compared with SLE, SpA, and OA PBMCs. TTR-RAGE interactions were predicted by in-silico and validated by in- vitro analysis using RA-FLS. The increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1?, TNF-, and differently expressed TTR and RAGE were confirmed in fibroblast-like synoviocytes under inflammatory conditions. Conclusion: Our findings showed that the level of TTR was increased in RA plasma, along with an altered glycation rate. TTR and RAGE aberrant gene expression in PBMCs are the key events associated with RA, and TNF- activates the NF-KB pathways and promote TTR and RAGE differential expressions that may have pathogenic/inflammatory significance.","output":"Transthyretin and Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Product's Differential Levels Associated with the Pathogenesis of Rheumatoid Arthritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To analyze potential COVID-19 epidemic outcomes in New York City under different SARS-CoV-2 virus circulation scenarios and vaccine rollout policies from early Jan 2021 to end of June 2021. Key findings: In anticipation of the potential arrival and dominance of the more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant: 1) Mass-vaccination would be critical to mitigating epidemic severity (26-52% reduction in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, compared to no vaccination, provided the new UK variant supplants currently circulating variants). 2) Prioritizing key risk groups for earlier vaccination would lead to greater reductions in hospitalizations and deaths than infections. Thus, in general this would be a good strategy. 3) Current vaccination prioritization policy is suboptimal. To avert more hospitalizations and deaths, mass-vaccination of all individuals 65 years or older should be done as soon as possible. For groups listed in the same phase, 65+ year-olds should be given first priority ahead of others. 4) Available vaccine doses should be given to the next priority groups as soon as possible without awaiting hesitant up-stream groups. 5) While efficacy of vaccination off-protocol is unknown, provided immune response following a first vaccine dose persists, delaying the 2nd vaccine dose by ~1 month (i.e. administer the two doses 8 weeks apart) can substantially reduce infections, hospitalizations, and deaths compared to the 3-week apart regimen. Across all scenarios tested here, delaying the 2nd vaccine dose leads to the largest reduction in severe epidemic outcomes (e.g. hospitalizations and deaths). Therefore, to protect as many people as possible, this strategy should be considered if rapid increases in infections, hospitalization or deaths and/or shortages in vaccines were to occur.","output":"Simulating the impact of different vaccination policies on the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bleeding correlates with disease severity in viral hemorrhagic fevers. We found that the increase in type I interferon (IFN-I) in mice caused by infection with the Armstrong strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV; an arenavirus) reduced the megakaryocytic expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis (cyclooxygenase 1 and thromboxane A synthase 1) and a thrombopoietic transcription factor (Nf-e2). The decreased expression of these genes was associated with reduced numbers of circulating platelets and defects in the arachidonic acid synthetic pathway, thereby suppressing serotonin release from -granules in platelets. Bleeding resulted when severe thrombocytopenia and altered platelet function reduced the amount of platelet-derived serotonin below a critical threshold. Bleeding was facilitated by the absence of the activity of the kinase Lyn or the administration of aspirin, an inhibitor of arachidonic acid synthesis. Mouse platelets were not directly affected by IFN-I because they lack the receptor for the cytokine (IFNAR1), suggesting that transfusion of normal platelets into LCMV-infected mice could increase the amount of platelet-released serotonin and help to control hemorrhage.","output":"Arenaviral infection causes bleeding in mice due to reduced serotonin release from platelets."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage on, with multiple waves causing substantial harm to health and economies around the world. Motivated by the use of CT imaging at clinical institutes around the world as an effective complementary screening method to RT-PCR testing, we introduced COVID-Net CT, a neural network tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images as part of the open source COVID-Net initiative. However, one potential limiting factor is restricted quantity and diversity given the single nation patient cohort used. In this study, we introduce COVID-Net CT-2, enhanced deep neural networks for COVID-19 detection from chest CT images trained on the largest quantity and diversity of multinational patient cases in research literature. We introduce two new CT benchmark datasets, the largest comprising a multinational cohort of 4,501 patients from at least 15 countries. We leverage explainability to investigate the decision-making behaviour of COVID-Net CT-2, with the results for select cases reviewed and reported on by two board-certified radiologists with over 10 and 30 years of experience, respectively. The COVID-Net CT-2 neural networks achieved accuracy, COVID-19 sensitivity, PPV, specificity, and NPV of 98.1%/96.2%/96.7%/99%/98.8% and 97.9%/95.7%/96.4%/98.9%/98.7%, respectively. Explainability-driven performance validation shows that COVID-Net CT-2's decision-making behaviour is consistent with radiologist interpretation by leveraging correct, clinically relevant critical factors. The results are promising and suggest the strong potential of deep neural networks as an effective tool for computer-aided COVID-19 assessment.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Queen Elizabeth Hospital, 20 April 2020-13 May 2020. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and seven (n=107) patients of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, between 20 April 2020 and 13 May 2020 were included in the study using consecutive sampling. Data were collected using the Excel audit tool and included age, gender, weight, estimated eGFR, D-dimer values on admission, intensive care unit admission, presence of respiratory failure, imaging results for evaluation of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and anticoagulation received on admission. The data were entered in the SPSS (V.17) and were analysed. Data were summarised as meansSD, number or percentage as appropriate. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The frequency of VTE was found to be 11.2% in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia. The mean D-dimers were 3322.24 ng/mL9603 ng/mL with the values significantly higher for patients with VTE and those requiring intensive care unit admission.

The cycle threshold (Ct) value in real-time PCR (RT-PCR) is where a target-specific amplification signal becomes detectable and can infer viral load, risk of transmission and recovery. Use of Ct values in routine practice is uncommon.Gap Statement. There is a lack of routine use of Ct values when reporting RT-PCR results in routine practice.Aim. To automatically insert Ct values and interpretive comments when reporting SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR to improve patient management.Methodology. Routine Ct values across three different RT-PCR platforms were reviewed for concordance at presentation and clearance in patients with COVID-19. An indicative threshold (IT) linked to viral clearance kinetics was defined at Ct30 to categorize Ct values as low and high, reflecting high and low viral loads respectively.Results. The different gene targets of each platform showed high correlation and kappa score agreement (P<0.001). Average Ct values were automatically generated with values Ct30 reported as positive and >Ct30 as reactive; interpretive comments were added to all reports. The new reporting algorithm impacted on: physician interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 results; patient management and transfer; staff surveillance; length of stay in quarantine; and redefinition of patient recovery.Conclusion. Incorporation of Ct values into routine practice is possible across different RT-PCR platforms and adds useful information for patient management. The use of an IT with interpretive comments improves clinical interpretation and could be a model for reporting other respiratory infections. Withholding Ct values wastes useful clinical data and should be reviewed by the profession, accreditation bodies and regulators.","output":"Reporting of RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values during the first wave of COVID-19 in Qatar improved result interpretation in clinical and public health settings."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract We report the case of an older adult foreign national with severe respiratory failure who was brought via a commercial airline to the United States.

Objectives: The current review was conducted to gain insights into various animal models for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Material and Methods: A literature review (PUBMED, PUBMED Central, PMC, Google Scholar, Google search engine) following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines performed in early April 2020 revealed 9 articles of interest. Search terms included covid 19, covid-19, novel corona virus, SARS-CoV-2, animal models, experimental models, laboratory models &covid 19 animal models. Two independent reviewers extracted the data;the third reviewer was involved in case of discrepancy. Results: SARS-CoV-2 shares an identical receptor binding domain with the SARS-CoV virus and has a superior binding affinity to the host ACE2. Based on this, the role of rhesus macaques, golden Syrian hamsters, transgenic hACE2 mice and ferrets as animal models have been studied. All four animals are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 with variable clinical presentation but universal recovery. The respiratory tract is primarily involved in all four models. Involvement of intestines was also seen in at least one study in each animal. Transfer to na?ve animals in close contact has been documented in case of hamsters and ferrets. Seroconversion was documented in all although the role of convalescent sera was tested in hamsters only, with positive results though. Air-borne transmission was documented in ferrets and the possibility of feco-oral transmission was suggested for hamsters. The possibilities of recurrence and re-infection were ruled out by experiments upon the rhesus macaques. The fulfilment of Kochs postulates has been highlighted. Discussion: The various studies available on animal models have been able to establish models of infection and transmission that recapitulate different aspects of disease in humans. However, the response between different animals and the same animal in different experiments is not completely coherent. Some of them do not manifest the disease clinically while others behave differently at molecular and immunological levels. Moreover, the physiology of these animals is not identical to human beings and the findings may not be extrapolated to human beings in an as-ismanner. Conclusions: The review acknowledges the achievements made by these experiments in a short span of time and highlighted the urgent need for a deeper dive in search of a quintessential animal model which can be studied for efficacy and safety of newer drugs and vaccines before a make-shift from the petri-dish to the human body can be contemplated.","output":"Animal Models of SARS-CoV-2: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main purpose of this study was to analyze the pre-and post-COVID-19 condition, performance and future of the airline industry To get the desired objective of the study current research study used the accounting information of airline industry For the said purpose cross tabulation, frequencies, means techniques were used to draw the conclusion To predict the future and revival of the industry study calculated the means before and after COVID-19 performance and forecast the recovery period of the industry The accounting results showed that the condition and performance of the airline industry was good before the COVID-19 pandemic The average results showed that operating profit margin, net profit, return on invested capital and, revenues were at acceptable levels before COVID-19 However, in the aftermath of COVID-19, all the indicators dropped significantly and become negative Before COVID-19, the airline industry was contributing an average $118 billion in annual tax revenue to governments Before COVID-19, the region-wise accounting results showed that the condition and performance of the airline industry was good in all regions except in Africa After COVID-19, the airline industry in all regions encountered significant problems with negative operating profit, net profit and, return on invested capital, and a significant drop in revenue In short, such unexpected, painful and huge losses have never been recorded throughout the history of the airline industry The future of the airline industry is unpredictable and uncertain, but the average results showed that said industry will recover within four to five years if COVID-19 disappears in 2020","output":"Pre-and Post-COVID-19 condition, performance and future of the airline industry: Evidence from accounting data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytokines are a family of proteins which play a major role in the regulation of immune system, and enter the development of several diseases from rheumatoid arthritis to cancer and, more recently, COVID-19.

Up to 50% of idiopathic DCM cases have heritable familial diseases, and the clinical screening of family members is recommended. Identifying a genetic cause that can explain the DCM risk in the family can help with better screening planning and clinical decision-making. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has aided significantly in the detection of causative genes in many genetically heterogeneous diseases. In the present study, we applied WES to identify the causative genetic variant in a family with heritable DCM. METHODS: WES was applied to identify genetic variants on a 26-year-old man as the proband of a family with DCM. Subsequently, Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm the variant in the patient and all the available affected and unaffected family members. The pathogenicity of the variant was evaluated through co-segregation analysis in the family and employment of in silico predictive software. RESULTS: WES demonstrated the missense pathogenic heterozygous nucleotide variant, c.1907G > A, (p.Arg636His, rs267607004, NM_0011343), in exon 9 of the RBM20 gene in the proband.

Optimal donor and recipient sites remain a matter of debate. We describe the technique and outcomes of a laparoscopically harvested extended gastroepiploic VLN flap with two levels of inset. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between 2014 and 2015, four-patients with upper limb breast cancer-related lymphedema and three-patients with lower limb pelvic cancer-related lymphedema who underwent VLN transfers were included. After harvest, the gastroepiploic VLN flap was divided into two halves that were separately inset at the level of elbow and wrist (upper limb) or knee and ankle (lower limb). The mean patient age was 53.1 years (range, 42-65 years). RESULTS The average flap size after division was 6.3 cm in length (range, 5-7 cm) and 3.4 cm in width (range, 3-4 cm).

The initial outbreak of this novel virus in Wuhan in the Hubei province of China, first described in December 2019, has since moved on to being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The classic description of COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that manifests with fever, dry cough, and dyspnea on exertion. However, gastrointestinal (GI) complication of COVID-19 is emerging as well. This was observed with similar viral respiratory illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which emerged in 2003, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which emerged in 2012. In a recently published, single-center case series of 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, investigators reported that approximately 10% of patients initially presented with GI symptoms, prior to the subsequent development of respiratory symptoms. Common and often very subtle symptoms included diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain, with a less common symptom being nonspecific GI illness. New studies are expanding our understanding of the possible fecal transmission of COVID-19. Assessment by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has provided evidence of the virus in the stool and the oropharynx outside the nasopharynx and respiratory tract. Virus in the stool may be evident on presentation and last throughout the course of illness resolution for up to 12 days after the respiratory virus evidence is gone. In fact, in one of the most recent studies looking at 73 patients, approximately 24% remained positive in their stool for evidence of the virus, though not necessarily infection, after showing negative in respiratory samples. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that after two negative respiratory tests separated by  24 hours, patients can be dismissed from having transmissibility infection risk for COVID-19. The potential for fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 needs to be strongly considered. Considering these cases and the lessons from SARS, many authors recommend that real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from feces should be performed routinely in SARS-CoV-2 patients.","output":"Gastrointestinal Infection Could Be New Focus for Coronavirus Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This study assessed whether seizure severity and social anxiety were related to self-disclosure or concealment behaviors independent of felt stigma in Korean adults with epilepsy.

Of these subjects, 212 (67.3%) reported rarely or never talking to others about their epilepsy, whereas only 98 (31.1%) stated that they rarely or never kept their epilepsy secret from others. Linear regression analyses showed that concealment behaviors were positively correlated with degree of social anxiety (on separate models using the SIAS-6 and SPS-6) and felt stigma, and negatively associated with level of seizure severity. Both models accounted for about 14% of the variance in DMS scores. CONCLUSIONS The majority of Korean adults with epilepsy choose concealment and selective disclosure strategies. Social anxiety and seizure severity along with felt stigma play significant roles in deciding whether to disclose or conceal a diagnosis of epilepsy. The explanatory power of these models was weak.","output":"Concealment behaviors in Korean adults with epilepsy: Their relationships to social anxiety and seizure severity independent of felt stigma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The B\\\\cell response to COVID\\\\19 vaccines in convalescent individuals.

This article explores the factors associated with an increase in domestic violence incidents during COVID-19 by applying routine activity theory (RAT) framework. Data were drawn from the incidents of domestic violence reported in newspapers. Data was analyzed using content analysis and three major themes, i.e., three principle components of RAT-motivated offender, suitable target, and absence of capable guardian-were drawn. Findings reveal that sources of motivation in domestic violence perpetrators during the lockdown were alcohol and unemployment. The symbolic value that perpetrators associated with women, lower inertia, visibility, and accessibility to the perpetrators made women suitable targets of domestic violence. Lastly, shortage of police force and travel restrictions on formal and informal sources resulted in the absence of capable guardians. We conclude that changes in the routine activities of people during the COVID-19 lockdown provided more opportunities to the perpetrators of domestic violence.","output":"Understanding Domestic Violence in India During COVID-19: a Routine Activity Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The inflammasome, a cytosolic protein complex that mediates the processing and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, is one of the first responders during viral infection. The cytokines secreted following inflammasome activation, which include IL-1 and IL-18, regulate cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system, guiding the subsequent immune responses. In this study we used murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), infection of the central nervous system and liver to assess of the role of the inflammasome and its related cytokines on pathogenesis and host defense during viral infection. Mice lacking all inflammasome signaling due to the absence of caspase-1 and -11 were more vulnerable to infection, with poor survival and elevated viral replication compared to wild type mice. Mice lacking IL-1 signaling experienced elevated viral replication but similar survival compared to wild type controls. In the absence of IL-18, mice had elevated viral replication and poor survival, and this protective effect of IL-18 was found to be due to promotion of interferon gamma production in  T cells. These data suggest that inflammasome signaling is largely protective during murine coronavirus infection, in large part due to the pro-inflammatory effects of IL-18.","output":"Role of the inflammasome-related cytokines Il-1 and Il-18 during infection with murine coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the number of infections and deaths caused by the recent COVID-19 pandemic is increasing dramatically day-by-day, scientists are rushing towards developing possible countermeasures to fight the deadly virus, SARS-CoV-2. Although many efforts have already been put forward for developing potential vaccines, however, most of them are proved to possess negative consequences. Therefore, in this study, immunoinformatics methods were exploited to design a novel epitope-based subunit vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2, targeting four essential proteins of the virus i.e., spike glycoprotein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, membrane glycoprotein, and envelope protein. The highly antigenic, non-allergenic, non-toxic, non-human homolog, and 100% conserved (across other isolates from different regions of the world) epitopes were used for constructing the vaccine. In total, fourteen CTL epitopes and eighteen HTL epitopes were used to construct the vaccine. Thereafter, several in silico validations i.e., the molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation (including the RMSF and RMSD studies), and immune simulation studies were also performed which predicted that the designed vaccine should be quite safe, effective, and stable within the biological environment. Finally, in silico cloning and codon adaptation studies were also conducted to design an effective mass production strategy of the vaccine.

Researchers are working tirelessly on areas including studying the transmission of COVID-19, promoting its identification, designing new vaccines and therapies, and recognizing its socio-economic consequences. This extensive research leads to the exploration of thousands of scientific papers related to biology, chemistry, genetics, health, and economy. Therefore, it is essential to develop an intelligent text mining technique for segregating this rich source of data to perform easy access, information retrieval, and interpretation within minimum time and resources. We propose a multi-objective optimization-based document clustering approach for the CORD-19 (COVID-19 Open Research Dataset) dataset in this paper. Here, a new technique utilizing BioBERT has been proposed, which benefits from the and the document text, rather than only the brief , to perceive a concise understanding of the text to generate clusters with better definitions. The main contributions of the proposed work are two-fold: in the first step, we have used BioBERT to generate the sentence embedding which is further used for the document representation. In the next step, we have developed a multi-objective optimization (MOO) based clustering algorithm for grouping the generated document vector representations. In this MOO-based clustering, we have used Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II and Fuzzy c-means algorithm as the underlying MOO and clustering technique, respectively. This model is evaluated using the Silhouette Score (Silhouette score) and Calinski-Harabasz index (CH index), and the clustering solutions are visualized using word clouds.

We have used two assays, one an in vitro liposome binding assay and the other a tissue culture replication assay. The liposome binding assay shows that interaction of the receptor with spikes on virions at 37 degrees C causes a conformational change that makes the virions hydrophobic so that they bind to liposomes (B. D. Zelus, J. H. Schickli, D. M. Blau, S. R. Weiss, and K. V. Holmes, J. Virol. 77: 830-840, 2003). Recombinant viruses with spikes containing the RBD of either MHV-A59 or MHV-4 readily associated with liposomes at 37 degrees C in the presence of soluble mCEACAM1(a), except for S(4)R, which expresses the entire wild-type MHV-4 spike and associated only inefficiently with liposomes following incubation with soluble mCEACAM1(a). In contrast, soluble mCEACAM1(b) allowed viruses with the MHV-A59 RBD to associate with liposomes more efficiently than did viruses with the MHV-4 RBD. In the second assay, which requires virus entry and replication, all recombinant viruses replicated efficiently in BHK cells expressing mCEACAM1(a). In BHK cells expressing mCEACAM1(b), only viruses expressing chimeric spikes with the MHV-A59 RBD could replicate, while replication of viruses expressing chimeric spikes with the MHV-4 RBD was undetectable. Despite having the MHV-4 RBD, S(4)R replicated in BHK cells expressing mCEACAM1(b); this is most probably due to spread via CEACAM1 receptor-independent cell-to-cell fusion, an activity displayed only by S(4)R among the recombinant viruses studied here.

METHODS: We designed this observational study to emulate a target trial of COVID-19 vaccination by BNT162b2 versus mRNA-1273 among persons who underwent vaccination in the national U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system from 11/12/2020 to 25/03/2021 using combined VA and Medicare electronic health records. We identified the best matching mRNA-1273 recipient(s) for each BNT162b2 recipient, using exact/coarsened-exact matching (calendar week, VA integrated service network, age buckets and Charlson comorbidity index buckets) followed by propensity score matching. Vaccine recipients were followed from the date of first vaccine dose until 25/08/2021 for the development of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization or SARS-CoV-2-related death. FINDINGS: Each group included 902,235 well-matched vaccine recipients, followed for a mean of 192 days, during which 16,890 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 3591 SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations and 381 SARS-CoV-2-related deaths were documented. Compared to BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 recipients had significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.736, 95% CI 0.696C0.779) and SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization (aHR 0.633, 95% CI 0.562C0.713), which persisted across all age groups, comorbidity burden categories and black/white race. The differences between mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 in risk of infection or hospitalization were progressively greater when the follow-up period was longer, i.e. extending to March 31, June 30 or August 25, 2021. These differences were more pronounced when we analyzed separately the outcomes that occurred during the follow-up period from July 1 to August 25, 2021 when the Delta variant became predominant in the U.S. (aHR for infection 0.584, 95% CI 0.533C0.639 and aHR for hospitalization 0.387, 95% 0.311C0.482). SARS-CoV-2-related deaths were less common in mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 recipients (168 versus 213) but this difference was not statistically significant (aHR 0.808, 95% CI 0.592C1.103). INTERPRETATION: In conclusion, although absolute rates of infection, hospitalization and death in both vaccine groups were low regardless of the vaccine received, our data suggests that compared to BNT162b2, vaccination with mRNA-1273 resulted in significantly lower rates of SARS-CoV-2-infection and SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization.

However, many RNA virus transcripts have marked structural differences from cellular mRNAs that preclude canonical translation initiation, such as the absence of a 5 cap structure or the presence of highly structured 5UTRs containing replication and/or packaging signals. Furthermore, whilst the great majority of cellular mRNAs are apparently monocistronic, RNA viruses must often express multiple proteins from their mRNAs. In addition, RNA viruses have very compact genomes and are under intense selective pressure to optimize usage of the available sequence space. Together, these features have driven the evolution of a plethora of non-canonical translational mechanisms in RNA viruses that help them to meet these challenges.

A concept mapping design was used to identify mechanisms of classism and everyday racism. For the rating activity, 41 participants identified as racialized health care users. The data analysis was completed using concept systems software. Racialized health care users reported race/ethnic-based discrimination as moderate to high and socioeconomic position-/social class-based discrimination as moderate in importance for the challenges experienced when receiving health care; differences within stratifications were also identified. To improve access to services and quality of care, antiracist policies that focus on unequal power social relations and a broader systems thinking are needed to address institutional racism within the health care system.","output":"Classism and Everyday Racism as Experienced by Racialized Health Care Users: A Concept Mapping Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnostic flexible laryngoscopy (DFL) is a critical tool in the armamentarium of an otolaryngologist.

However, functional adaptation, including RV pressure generation and systolic free-wall longitudinal mechanics, remains equivocal. This meta-analysis compared RV pressure and function in athletes and controls. METHODS A systematic review of online databases was conducted up to June 4, 2020. Meta-analyses were performed on RV systolic pressures, at rest and during exercise, tricuspid annular plane systolic displacement, myocardial velocity (S'), and global and regional longitudinal strain. Bias was assessed using Egger regression for asymmetry. Data were analyzed using random-effects models with weighted mean difference and 95% CI. RESULTS Fifty-three studies were eligible for inclusion. RV systolic pressure was obtained from 21 studies at rest (n=1043:1651; controls:athletes) and 8 studies during exercise (n=240:495) and was significantly greater in athletes at rest (weighted mean difference, 2.9 mmHg [CI, 1.3-4.5 mmHg]; P=0.0005) and during exercise (11.0 [6.5-15.6 mm Hg]; P<0.0001) versus controls. Resting tricuspid annular plane systolic displacement (P<0.0001) and S' (P=0.001) were greater in athletes. In contrast, athletes had similar RV free-wall longitudinal strain (17 studies; n=450:605), compared with controls but showed greater longitudinal apical strain (16 studies; n=455:669; 0.9%, 0.1%-1.8%; P=0.03) and lower basal strain (-2.5% [-1.4 to -3.5%]; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Functional RV adaptation, characterized by increased tricuspid annular displacement and velocity and a greater base-to-apex strain gradient, is a normal feature of the athlete's heart, together with a slightly elevated RV systolic pressure. These findings contribute to our understanding of RV in athletes and highlight the importance of considering RV function in combination with structure in the clinical interpretation of the athlete's heart.","output":"Right Ventricular Function and Region-Specific Adaptation in Athletes Engaged in High-Dynamic Sports: A Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study analyses the agenda setting on social media in the COVID-19 pandemic by exploiting one of the disruptive technologies, big data analytics.

Methods Sentinel surveillance was established in 2003. Nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens and epidemiologic data are collected from persons of all ages presenting with ILI at sentinel sites. Respiratory specimens have been tested for influenza using various viral and molecular diagnostic methods. A subset of 470 specimens collected from children aged 0C5 years were tested for multiple respiratory viruses using RT\\\\PCR. Results From 2003 to 2010, 5074 NP specimens were collected from patients with ILI. Overall, 969/5074 (19%) of these specimens tested positive for influenza. Seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses predominated during 5 years and influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated during 3 years. Influenza B viruses cocirculated with influenza A viruses during each year from 2004 to 2010. Seasonal peaks in influenza circulation were observed during the months of May, June, and October, with the largest peak corresponding with the primary rainfall season. Of 470 specimens collected from children under aged 5 who were tested for multiple respiratory viruses, a viral respiratory pathogen was detected in 401/470 (85%) of specimens. Commonly detected viruses were RSV (113 of 470 specimens, 24%), rhinoviruses (85/470, 18%), influenza (77/470, 16%), and parainfluenza (75/470, 16%).

To prevent the exacerbation of health disparities, there is a need to understand the implementation of meal distribution among large urban school districts during emergencies and to what degree these strategies provide equitable meal access. Our case study of four large urban school districts during the COVID-19 pandemic aims to address these knowledge gaps. Guided by the Getting to Equity (GTE) framework, we conducted a mixed-methods study evaluating emergency meal distribution and strategy implementation in four large urban school districts (Chicago Public Schools, Houston Independent School District, Los Angeles Unified School District, and New York City Department of Education). We gathered data from school district websites on (1) meal service and delivery sites and (2) district documents, policies, communication, and resources. Using qualitative coding approaches, we identified unique and shared district strategies to address meal distribution and communications during the pandemic according to the four components of the GTE framework: increase healthy options, reduce deterrents, build on community capacity, and increase social and economic resources. We matched district census tract boundaries to demographic data from the 2018 American Community Survey and United States Department of Agriculture food desert data, and used geographic information systems (GIS) software to identify meal site locations relative to student population, areas of high poverty and high minority populations, and food deserts. We found that all districts developed strategies to optimize meal provision, which varied across case site. Strategies to increase healthy options included serving adults and other members of the general public, providing timely information on meal site locations, and promoting consumption of a balanced diet. The quantity and frequency of meals served varied, and the degree to which districts promoted high-quality nutrition was limited. Reducing deterrents related to using inclusive language and images and providing safety information on social distancing practices in multiple languages. Districts built community capacity through partnering with first responder, relief, and other community organizations. Increased social and economic resources were illustrated by providing technology assistance to families, childcare referrals for essential workers, and other wellness resources. Geospatial analysis suggests that service locations across cities varied to some degree by demographics and food environment, with potential gaps in reach. This study identifies strategies that have the potential to increase equitable access to nutrition assistance programs. Our findings can support (1) ongoing efforts to address child food insecurity during the pandemic and (2) future meal provision through programs like the Summer Food Service Program and Seamless Summer Option.

This is an attempt to verify if SD cases in patients admitted for SARS-Cov-2 infection can be correlated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective follow-up was carried out with Covid-19 patients, monitoring their blood viscosity (BV) at high shear rate (300 sec(-1)) and inquiring them periodically for eventual hearing loss. This measurement was extended to cases bearing of SD in 2019 and 2020 without infection and a control group of healthy normoacoustic subjects. RESULTS: The normality range was 4,16  0,62 cps. 330 cases admitted for Covid-19 were evaluated from February 24th, 2020 to March 24th, 2021, 85 of them attended in ICU. After anamnesis and Audiometric Tone Thresholds developed as soon as possible, 9 SD were detected, all belonging to ICU group. The mean BV was 4,38  0,43 cps in the ward group, 4,53  0,39 cps in the ICU patients without SD, and 4,85  0,52 cps in the cases with SD, with statistically significant differences. Highest BV elevations in the SD cases were detected between days 6 and 10 of hospital admission. In 2019 four cases consulted with SD, and another two did it in 2020 without a diagnosis of Covid-19, with normal BV values. CONCLUSIONS: During SARS-Cov-2 infection, patients may show high BV and SS, although an inpatients control group and a larger sample volume are necessary to confirm the predisposition to hyperviscosity.

Intrauterine viral infections induce an increase in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, which inhibit the proliferation of neuronal precursor cells and stimulate oligodendrocyte cell death, leading to abnormal neurodevelopment. Whether a maternal cytokine storm can affect neonatal brain development is unclear. The objective of the present study was to assess neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, the neurodevelopmental status of infants (N = 298) born to women with SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy was assessed at 10C12 months post-discharge using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, 3rd edition (ASQ-3). The ASQ-3 scores were classified into developmental delays (cutoff scores  2 standard deviations (SDs) below the population mean) and no delays (scores > 2 SDs above the population mean). RESULTS: The majority (90%) of the infants born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy had favorable outcomes and only 10% showed developmental delays. Two of the 298 infants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and both had normal ASQ-3 scores. The majority of the pregnant women had SARS-CoV-2 infections during their third trimester. The risk of developmental delays among infants was higher in those whose mothers had SARS-CoV-2 infections during the first (P = 0.039) and second trimesters (P = 0.001) than in those whose mothers had SARS-CoV-2 infections during the third trimester.

METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis involving 13,580 admitted patients in a national quarantine center between March 2020 and April 2021. All patients with orthopedic consultations were included in the study, and were assessed by orthopedic surgeons in person. Patients were further evaluated for age, sex, presence of trauma, cause for consultation, diagnosis and management.

METHODS We prospectively enrolled 21 healthcare providers (13 cisgender female, 8 cisgender male; M = 32.9 years; SD = 7.9 years) and assessed acoustics and perceptual measures with and without a face mask in place. Measurements included: 1) acoustic Vowel Articulation Index (VAI); 2) cepstral and spectral acoustic measures; 3) traditional vocal measures (e.g., fundamental frequency, intensity); 4) relative fundamental frequency (RFF); and 5) self-reported ratings of vocal effort and dyspnea. RESULTS During masked speech, there was a significant reduction in VAI, high-frequency information (>4 kHz), and RFF offset 10, as well as a significant increase in cepstral peak prominence and perceived vocal effort.

Most published studies regarding the intersection of these two public health crises have focused on community, state, or national trends using pre-existing data. There is a need for complementary qualitative research aimed at identifying how people with opioid use disorder (OUD) are understanding, experiencing, and navigating this unprecedented time. The current study examines understandings and experiences of people with OUD while they have navigated these crises. METHODS: The study was guided by a pragmatic lens. We conducted brief semi-structured qualitative interviews with 25 individuals in Chicago, the majority of which had received methadone treatment during the pandemic. Thematic inductive analysis was guided by primary interview questions. RESULTS: The sample represents a high-risk group, being composed mostly of older non-Hispanic African American males and having considerable socioeconomic barriers. Themes demonstrate how individuals are keeping safe despite limited knowledge of COVID-19, how the pandemic has increased treatment motivation for some, how adaptations impacted treatment and recovery supports, how the availability social support had been reduced, and difficulties individuals had keeping or obtaining financial support. CONCLUSIONS: The findings can be useful for informing future public health response to ensure appropriate treatment access and supports are available. In particular are the need for treatment providers to ensure people with OUD receive appropriate and understandable health crisis-related information and ensuring funds are appropriately allocated to address mental health impacts of social isolation. Finally, there is a need for appropriate financial and infrastructure supports to ensure health and treatment access disparities are not exacerbated for those in greatest need.","output":"Navigating intersecting public health crises: a qualitative study of people with opioid use disorders' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with GuillainCBarr syndrome (GBS) who require mechanical ventilation (MV) are regarded as candidates for early tracheostomy because of the high risk of prolonged MV; however, the association between early tracheostomy and favorable outcomes in patients with GBS remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the association between early tracheostomy and outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients with GBS. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included adult patients with GBS identified in the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination national inpatient database from July 1, 2010, to March 31, 2018, who initiated MV within the first week of admission and who received MV for more than 1 week. Early tracheostomy was defined as tracheostomy performed within 7 days of MV. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcomes were 28-day mortality, nosocomial pneumonia, length of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of MV, duration of sedation, duration of analgesia, duration of delirium, and total hospitalization costs. Propensity scores for early tracheostomy were calculated using a logistic regression model on the following variables: age; sex; body mass index; Japan Coma Scale status at admission; Charlson comorbidity index score; comorbidity of chronic pulmonary disease; complication of pneumonia at admission; complication of hyponatremia at admission; neurological presentation at admission; ambulance use; referral from other hospitals; treatment year; days from hospital admission to MV initiation; ICU admission until the day of MV initiation; and treatments until the day of MV initiation. Stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses was performed to compare the outcomes between patients with and without early tracheostomy. RESULTS: Among 919 eligible patients, 654 patients (71%) underwent tracheostomy, with 136 patients (15%) receiving early tracheostomy. Overall, the median time from initiation of MV to tracheostomy was 12 days (interquartile range 8C15 days). After stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting, early tracheostomy was not associated with lower in-hospital mortality (risk difference 0.4%; 95% confidence interval ? 5.6 to 6.7%) compared with patients without early tracheostomy. There were no significant differences in 28-day mortality (risk difference ? 1.3%; 95% confidence interval ? 3.5 to 0.9%) and incidence of nosocomial pneumonia (risk difference ? 2.6%; 95% confidence interval ? 9.1 to 4.2%) between the two groups. None of the other secondary outcomes differed significantly between the groups.

The limited frequency of measurements in group-level human nutrition trials cannot be used to infer individual responses to interventions, while in behavioral studies, retrospective data collection does not provide an accurate measure of how everyday behaviors affect individual health. This review introduces the concept of N-of-1 study designs, which involve the repeated measurement of a health outcome or behavior on an individual level. Observational designs can be used to monitor a participant's usual health or behavior in a naturalistic setting, with repeated measurements conducted in real time using an Ecological Momentary Assessment. Interventional designs can introduce a dietary or behavioral intervention with predictors and outcomes of interest measured repeatedly either during or after 1 or more intervention and control periods. Due to their flexibility, N-of-1 designs can be applied to both short-term physiological studies and longer-term studies of eating behaviors. As a growing number of disease markers can be measured outside of the clinic, with self-reported data delivered via electronic devices, it is now easier than ever to generate large amounts of data on an individual level. Statistical techniques can be utilized to analyze changes in an individual or to aggregate data from sets of N-of-1 trials, enabling hypotheses to be tested on a small number of heterogeneous individuals. Although their designs necessitate extra methodological and statistical considerations, N-of-1 studies could be used to investigate complex research questions and to study underrepresented groups. This may help to reveal novel associations between participant characteristics and health outcomes, with repeated measures providing power and precision to accurately determine an individual's health status.","output":"Perspective: Application of N-of-1 Methods in Personalized Nutrition Research."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper discusses how the technical foundations of the EUs fiscal rules constrain the fiscal space in EU countries in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Different neuroimaging methods for diagnosis of CVT, such as computer tomography CT/CT Venography (CTV), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)/MR Venography (MRV) will be presented. (2) Methods: A literature analysis using PubMed and the MEDLINE sub-engine was done using the terms: cerebral venous thrombosis, thrombophilia, and imaging. Different studies concerning risk factors, clinical picture, and imaging signs of patients with CVT were examined. (3) Results: At least one risk factor can be identified in 85% of CVT cases. Searching for a thrombophilic state should be realized for patients with CVT who present a high pretest probability of severe thrombophilia. Two pathophysiological mechanisms contribute to their highly variable clinical presentation: augmentation of venular and capillary pressure, and diminution of cerebrospinal fluid absorption. The clinical spectrum of CVT is frequently non-specific and presents a high level of clinical suspicion. Four major syndromes have been described: isolated intracranial hypertension, seizures, focal neurological abnormalities, and encephalopathy. Cavernous sinus thrombosis is the single CVT that presents a characteristic clinical syndrome. Non-enhanced CT (NECT) of the Head is the most frequently performed imaging study in the emergency department. Features of CVT on NECT can be divided into direct signs (demonstration of dense venous clot within a cerebral vein or a cerebral venous sinus), and more frequently indirect signs (such as cerebral edema, or cerebral venous infarct). CVT diagnosis is confirmed with CTV, directly detecting the venous clot as a filling defect, or MRI/MRV, which also realizes a better description of parenchymal abnormalities.

Understanding the evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. METHODS: We collected individual information from official public sources on laboratory-confirmed cases reported outside Hubei in mainland China for the period of Jan 19 to Feb 17, 2020. We used the date of the fourth revision of the case definition (Jan 27) to divide the epidemic into two time periods (Dec 24 to Jan 27, and Jan 28 to Feb 17) as the date of symptom onset. We estimated trends in the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (R(t)) at the provincial level. FINDINGS: We collected data on 8579 cases from 30 provinces. The median age of cases was 44 years (33C56), with an increasing proportion of cases in younger age groups and in elderly people (ie, aged >64 years) as the epidemic progressed. The mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 44 days (95% CI 00C140) for the period of Dec 24 to Jan 27, to 26 days (00C90) for the period of Jan 28 to Feb 17. The mean incubation period for the entire period was estimated at 52 days (18C124) and the mean serial interval at 51 days (13C116). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei were highly variable but consistently included a mixture of case importations and local transmission. We estimated that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than 3 weeks, with mean Rt reaching peaks between 108 (95% CI 074C154) in Shenzhen city of Guangdong province and 171 (132C217) in Shandong province. In all the locations for which we had sufficient data coverage of Rt, Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold (ie, <1) after Jan 30. INTERPRETATION: Our estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were similar, suggesting an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission before the onset of symptoms. Our results also indicate that, as the epidemic progressed, infectious individuals were isolated more quickly, thus shortening the window of transmission in the community. Overall, our findings indicate that strict containment measures, movement restrictions, and increased awareness of the population might have contributed to interrupt local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 outside Hubei province.

Result: Patient 1 was a 68-year-old woman with a history of hepatitis of unknown origin before being infected with the H1N1 virus. Autoimmune hepatitis with an exacerbation of liver injury was diagnosed during the infection. Patient 2 was a 48-year-old woman with pre-existing autoimmune hepatitis. Despite being on immunosuppressant therapy (using glucocorticoids), liver injury recurred with elevated total bilirubin and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels post H1N1 infection.

In the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta, PO is generated from its precursor proPO by prophenoloxidase activating proteases (PAPs) in the presence of two noncatalytic serine protease homologs (SPHs). cDNA cloning and genome analysis indicate that SPH1a (formerly known as SPH1), SPH1b, SPH4, SPH101, and SPH2 contain a clip domain, a linker, and a protease-like domain (PLD). The first 22 residues of the SPH1b, SPH4, and SPH101 PLDs are identical, and differ from SPH1a only at position 4, Thr154 substituted with Asn154 in SPH1a. While the sequence from Edman degradation was used to establish PAP cofactor as a high Mr complex of SPH1a and SPH2, this assignment needed further validation, especially because SPH1b mRNA levels are much higher than SPH1a's and better correlate with SPH2 transcription. Thus, here we determined expression profiles of these SPH genes in different tissues from various developmental stages using highly specific primers. High levels of SPH1b and SPH2 proteins, low SPH4, and no SPH1a or SPH101 were detected in hemolymph from larvae in the feeding, wandering and bar stages, pupae, and adults by targeted LC-MS/MS analysis, based on unique peptides from the trypsin-treated SPHs. We expressed the five proSPHs in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells for use as standards to identify and quantify their counterparts in plasma samples. Moreover, we tested their cleavage by PAP3 and efficacy of the SPH1a, 1b, 4, and 101 as SPH2 partners in PAP3-mediated proPO activation. PAP3 processed proSPH1b and 101 more readily than proSPH1a and 4; PAP3 activated proPO more efficiently in the presence of SPH2 with SPH101 or SPH1b than with SPH1a or SPH4. These results generally agree with their order of appearance or sequence similarity: SPH101 > SPH1b (98%) > SPH1a (90%) > SPH4 (83%). In other words, likely due to positive selection, products of the newly duplicated genes (SPH1b and SPH101) are more favorable substrates of PAP3 and better SPH2 partners in forming a high Mr cofactor than SPH1a or SPH4 is. Electrophoresis on native gel and immunoblot analysis further indicated that SPH101 or 1b form high Mr complexes more readily than SPH1a or 4 does. In comparison, SPH2 showed a small mobility decrease and then increase on native gel after PAP3 cleavage at the first site. Since the natural cofactor in bar-stage hemolymph is complexes of SPH1 and 2 with an average Mr of 790 kDa, PAP3-activated SPH2 may associate with the higher Mr SPH1b scaffolds to form super-complexes. Their structures and formation in relation to cleavage of SPH1b at different sites await further exploration.","output":"Cleavage activation and functional comparison of Manduca sexta serine protease homologs SPH1a, SPH1b, SPH4, and SPH101 in conjunction with SPH2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Le personnel soignant est considr parmi les populations les plus touches par la pandmie Covid-19.

Compared with bare -NPs, -PCNPs exhibited high tumor-targeting capability and induced apoptosis of C6 cells in vitro. Similarly, intravenous administration of drug through -PCNPs resulted in enhanced tumor-targeting and exhibited excellent rate of inhibition of glioma tumor growth in mice. Moreover, the blood circulation time of drug in mice in the -PCNP group was markedly prolonged and these mice exhibited better outcome than those in the -NP group.

With advanced age comes an increase in accumulation of senescent cells that release soluble and insoluble pro-inflammatory factors collectively termed the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). In the present report, we examined whether immune cells typical of those at the oral mucosa-microbe interface, are vulnerable to cellular senescence (CS) and the role of dysbiotic oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) from young (yDCs) and old (oDCs) mice were co-cultured in vitro with CS inducer doxorubicin or P.gingivalis (Pg), plus or minus senolytic agent rapamycin. CS profiling revealed elevated CS mediators SA--Gal, p16 (INK4A), p53, and p21(Waf1/Clip1) in oDCs, or yDCs in response to doxorubicin or P. gingivalis, reversible with rapamycin. Functional studies indicate impaired maturation function of oDCs, and yDC exposed to P. gingivalis; moreover, OVA-driven proliferation of CD4+ T cells from young OTII transgenic mice was impaired by oDCs or yDCs+Pg. The SASP of DCs, consisting of secreted exosomes and inflammasome-related cytokines was further analyzed. Exosomes of DCs cocultured with P. gingivalis (PgDCexo) were purified, quantitated and characterized. Though typical in terms of size, shape and phenotype, PgDCexo were 2-fold greater in number than control DCs, with several important distinctions. Namely, PgDCexo were enriched in age-related miRNAs, and miRNAs reported to disrupt immune homeostasis through negative regulation of apoptosis and autophagy functions. We further show that PgDCexo were enriched in P. gingivalis fimbrial adhesin protein mfa1 and in inflammasome related cytokines IL-1, TNF and IL-6. Functionally PgDCexo were readily endocytosed by recipient yDCs, amplifying functional impairment in maturation and ability to promote Ova-driven proliferation of OTII CD4+ T cells from young mice. In conclusion P. gingivalis induces premature (autocrine) senescence in DCs by direct cellular invasion and greatly amplifies senescence, in paracrine, of bystander DCs by secretion of inflammatory exosomes.

Limited information on the molecular mechanism of SFTSV infection and pathogenesis impedes the development of effective vaccines and drugs for SFTS prevention and treatment. In this study, an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic analysis of SFTSV-infected HEK 293 cells was performed to explore dynamic host cellular protein responses toward SFTSV infection. A total of 433 of 5,606 host proteins involved in different biological processes were differentially regulated by SFTSV infection. The proteomic results highlighted a potential role of endoplasmic reticular stress-triggered unfolded-protein response (UPR) in SFTSV infection. Further functional studies confirmed that all three major branches of the UPR, including the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), the activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), and the inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1)/X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) pathways, were activated by SFTSV. However, only the former two pathways play a crucial role in SFTSV infection. Furthermore, expression of SFTSV glycoprotein (GP) alone was sufficient to stimulate the UPR, whereas suppression of PERK and ATF6 notably decreased GP expression. Interestingly, two other newly discovered phleboviruses, Heartland virus and Guertu virus, also stimulated the UPR, suggesting a common mechanism shared by these genetically related phleboviruses. This study provides a global view to our knowledge on how host cells respond to SFTSV infection and highlights that host cell UPR plays an important role in phlebovirus infection. IMPORTANCE Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is an emerging tick-borne bunyavirus that causes severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome in humans, with a mortality rate reaching up to 30% in some outbreaks. There are currently no U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccines or specific antivirals available against SFTSV. To comprehensively understand the molecular interactions occurring between SFTSV and the host cell, we exploit quantitative proteomic approach to investigate the dynamic host cellular responses to SFTSV infection. The results highlight multiple biological processes being regulated by SFTSV infection. Among these, we focused on exploration of the mechanism of how SFTSV infection stimulates the host cells unfolded-protein response (UPR) and identified the UPR as a common feature shared by SFTSV-related new emerging phleboviruses. This study, for the first time to our knowledge, provides a global map for host cellular responses to SFTSV infection and highlighted potential host targets for further research.","output":"Quantitative Proteomic Analysis Reveals Unfolded-Protein Response Involved in Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Travel among US citizens is becoming increasingly common, and travel during pregnancy is also speculated to be increasingly common. During pregnancy, the obstetric provider may be the first or only clinician approached with questions regarding travel. Objective In this review, we discuss the reasons women travel during pregnancy, medical considerations for long-haul air travel, destination-specific medical complications, and precautions for pregnant women to take both before travel and while abroad. To improve the quality of pretravel counseling for patients before or during pregnancy, we have created 2 tools: a guide for assessing the pregnant patient's risk during travel and a pretravel checklist for the obstetric provider. Evidence Acquisition A PubMed search for English-language publications about travel during pregnancy was performed using the search terms \\"travel\\" and \\"pregnancy\\" and was limited to those published since the year 2000. Studies on subtopics were not limited by year of publication. Results Eight review articles were identified. Three additional studies that analyzed data from travel clinics were found, and 2 studies reported on the frequency of international travel during pregnancy. Additional publications addressed air travel during pregnancy (10 reviews, 16 studies), high-altitude travel during pregnancy (5 reviews, 5 studies), and destination-specific illnesses in pregnant travelers. Conclusions and Relevance Travel during pregnancy including international travel is common. Pregnant travelers have unique travel-related and destination-specific risks. We review those risks and provide tools for obstetric providers to use in counseling pregnant travelers.","output":"Travel During Pregnancy: Considerations for the Obstetric Provider."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has not only been catastrophic toward patient health but has also proven to be incredibly disruptive to several industries and sectors, including medical education.

However, the majority of studies evaluating the use of virtual care in oncology have focused on patients with solid tumor malignancies. Patients with hematologic malignancies represent a unique population related to their underlying malignancy and treatment, but the extent to which virtual care has been successfully integrated into clinical practice is unknown. As the demand for incorporating virtual care into routine clinical practice grows, understanding how to safely and effectively use virtual care in this specific patient population is essential. Methods: A scoping review was conducted to describe the use of virtual care in the management of patients with hematologic malignancies and to examine physician- and patient-reported outcomes based on its use. A comprehensive search strategy was used to identify articles on the use of virtual modalities (digital applications, phone visits, or video visits) to deliver routine clinical care to patients with hematologic malignancies published in English between January 2000 and April 2021 in the following databases: PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL and Scopus. No restrictions were applied to the phase of care (surveillance, active treatment, and or survivorship). A combination of search terms to encompass hematologic malignancies and virtual care was used. Screening and data ion were performed by two independent reviewers (AS, AV) and conflicts were adjudicated by two additional reviewers (DR, AP). Data were extracted to assess the study design, population, setting, patient characteristics, virtual care methodology and study results. Results: A total of 350 s were screened and 60 studies underwent full-text review. Of these, 15 studies met inclusion criteria (13 retrospective studies, 1 prospective pilot study, and 1 randomized controlled trial). The majority of papers were published from 2020 onward (Figure 1). Three studies found that app-based tools were effective in monitoring patient symptoms and triggering alerts which resulting in sooner follow-up if indicated. One app-based tool was also used in a resource limited country during the COVID-19 pandemic to allow for communication between hematologists and their patients. Four studies described the use of phone-based interventions for new consults and follow-up visits. Phone visits for used even in high-risk patients (for example, in 29 out of 50 patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic stem cell transplant). Five studies found that videoconferencing, with both physicians and oncology nurses, was highly rated by patients. Emerging themes included high levels of patient satisfaction across all domains of virtual care. Provider satisfaction scores were rated lower than patient scores, with concerns about technical issues leading to challenges with virtual care. Four studies found that virtual care allowed providers to promptly respond to patient concerns, specifically when patients were experiencing side-effects or had questions about their treatment. One study also suggested a decreased risk of death when telemedicine was used to monitor symptoms in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. There were no data addressing the impact of virtual care on costs or resource utilization. Conclusion: The use of virtual care in patients with hematologic malignancies appears to be feasible, even in high-risk populations. Patients were highly satisfied with virtual care, although providers had some challenges related to the specific technologies. More research is needed to evaluate the optimal method of integrating virtual care, informed by a wider range of patient-related outcomes, as well as the downstream consequences of this integration for patient, providers, and health systems.

This document offers guidance for practical evaluation/management of pediatric patients (age < 19 years) with syncope encountered in the acute or primary care setting. The writing committee used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Most syncope is vasovagal, which is benign and does not require extensive investigation. This Position Statement presents recommendations to encourage an efficient and cost-effective disposition for the many patients with a benign cause of syncope, and highlights atypical or concerning clinical findings associated with other causes of transient loss of consciousness. The prodrome and the circumstances around which the event occurred are the most important aspects of the history. Syncope occurring midexertion suggests a cardiac etiology. A family history, which includes sudden death in the young or from unknown causes or causes that might be suspected to be other than natural can be a red flag. The electrocardiogram is the most frequently ordered test, but the yield is low and the test is not cost-effective when applied broadly to a population of patients with syncope. We recommend an electrocardiogram when the history is not suggestive of vasovagal syncope and there are features suggestive of a cardiac cause like absence of a prodrome, midexertional event, family history of early-life sudden death or heart disease, abnormal physical examination, or new medication with potential cardiotoxicity. For most patients with syncope, medical testing is not required and lifestyle modifications without medications suffice to prevent recurrences.","output":"Canadian Cardiovascular Society and Canadian Pediatric Cardiology Association Position Statement on the Approach to Syncope in the Pediatric Patient."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may increase the risk of severe COVID-19; however, the level of potential modulation has not yet been established. The objective of the study was to determine the association between high risk of OSA, comorbidities, and increased risk for COVID-19, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional population-based web survey in adults in 14 countries/regions. The survey included sociodemographic variables and comorbidities. Participants were asked questions about COVID-19, hospitalization, and ICU treatment. Standardized questionnaire (STOP questionnaire for high risk of OSA) was included. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted adjusting for various factors. RESULTS: Out of 26,539 respondents, 20,598 (35.4% male) completed the survey. Mean age and BMI of participants were 41.5  16.0 years and 24.0  5.0 kg/m2, respectively. The prevalence of physician-diagnosed OSA was 4.1% and high risk of OSA was 9.5%. We found that high risk of OSA (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20, 2.47) and diabetes (aOR 2.07, 95% CI: 1.23, 3.48) were associated with reporting of a COVID-19 diagnosis.

Home health care may especially benefit older adults with diabetes through individualized education, advocacy, care coordination, and psychosocial support for patients and their caregivers. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between race/ethnicity and hospital discharge to home health care and subsequent utilization of home health care among a cohort of adults (age 50 and older) who experienced a diabetes-related hospitalization. The study was limited to patients who were continuously enrolled in Medicare for at least 12 months and in the United States. The cohort (n = 786,758) was followed for 14 days after their diabetes-related index hospitalization, using linked Medicare administrative, claims, and assessment data (2014C2016). Multivariate logistic regression models included patient demographics, comorbidities, hospital length of stay, geographic region, neighborhood deprivation, and rural/urban setting. In fully adjusted models, hospital discharge to home health care was significantly less likely among Hispanic (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.8C0.8) and American Indian (OR 0.8, CI 0.8C0.8) patients compared to White patients. Among those discharged to home health care, all non-white racial/ethnic minority patients were less likely to receive services within 14-days.

As part of the research project Health and primary-care sentinel surveillance in reception- and accommodation-centres for asylum-seekers in Germany (PriCare), a health-monitoring approach was developed for the secondary use of routine medical data from on-site outpatient clinics in reception centres. To this end, a software application (Refugee Care Manager, RefCare?) for the digitisation and harmonisation of medical records was designed and implemented in reception centres in three German federal states. The approach of distributed computing in a surveillance network allows for the decentralised, harmonised analysis of the routine medical data stored in RefCare? in a manner that fully complies with data protection regulations and circumvents the need for centralised data storage. RefCare? provides an integrated surveillance feature that enables analyses of 64 indicators on population, morbidity, healthcare processes and quality of care to be undertaken across multiple facilities.

Early diagnosis and therapeutic interventions are critical but limited. We previously reported in a rat model of HI two interventional approaches that improve cognitive and sensory function: administration of Inter-alpha Inhibitor Proteins (IAIPs) and early experience in an eight-arm radial water maze (RWM) task. Here, we expanded these studies to examine the combined effects of IAIPs and multiple weeks of RWM assessment beginning with juvenile or adolescent rats to evaluate optimal age windows for behavioral interventions. Subjects were divided into treatment groups; HI with vehicle, sham surgery with vehicle, and HI with IAIPs, and received either juvenile (P31 initiation) or adolescent (P52 initiation) RWM testing, followed by adult retesting. Error rates on the RWM decreased across weeks for all conditions. Whereas, HI injury impaired global performance as compared to shams. IAIP-treated HI subjects tested as juveniles made fewer errors as compared to their untreated HI counterparts. The juvenile group made significantly fewer errors on moderate demand trials and showed improved retention as compared to the adolescent group during the first week of adult retesting. Together, results support and extend our previous findings that combining behavioral and anti-inflammatory interventions in the presence of HI improves subsequent learning performance. Results further indicate sensitive periods for behavioral interventions to improve cognitive outcomes. Specifically, early life cognitive experience can improve long-term learning performance even in the presence of HI injury. Results from this study provide insight into typical brain development and the impact of developmentally targeted therapeutics and task-specific experience on subsequent cognitive processing.","output":"Effects of Juvenile or Adolescent Working Memory Experience and Inter-Alpha Inhibitor Protein Treatment after Neonatal Hypoxia-Ischemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organisations use non-standard employment as a means of flexibility and reduction of fixed costs. An increasingly growing group of employees are self-employed, have work contracts such as part-time and temporary contracts or are employed by a temporary agency, a development catalysed by the COVID pandemic. Whereas there is some evidence that temporary work might affect health via job insecurity (JI) there are hardly any studies focussing on the effects and mechanisms of temporary agency work (TAW). This study sheds light on TAWs potential health impact and the role of JI in this respect using a mediation analysis. Based on the BIBB/BAuA-Employment Survey 2018 (N = 20.021, representative of the German working population), we analysed the direct effect of TAW on cognitive and psychosomatic aspects of well-being. In particular, we considered JI as mediator for this association. In line with the potentially detrimental effects of temporary employment on well-being, we found that TAW was related to unfavourable outcomes in terms of job satisfaction, general health status and musculoskeletal complaints. JI partially mediated all three underlying associations. Organisations need to be flexible and adaptable. However, by using temporary agency employment as a means to achieve this flexibility, managers and leaders should be aware that it is related to unfavourable well-being and hence hidden costs. In using this type of employment, both the temporary work agency and the user company should consider these health risks by providing health care, options for increasing the temporary agency workers (TA), workers employability, and equal treatment between permanent and TA workers at the actual workplace.","output":"Temporary Agency Work and Well-BeingThe Mediating Role of Job Insecurity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 is a dangerous communicable virus which lets down the world economy.

We continued to provide outreach and recruitment opportunities through COVID education and food for families as we educated them about AD, and opportunities for study participation. METHOD: While our traditional outreach methods for recruiting AAs were interrupted, we continued to conduct AD outreach using virtual platforms, mobile phone calls, family conference calls and food distributions. We hosted nine webinars on COVID\\\\19 to maintain a presence in local and national AA communities and to remain connected to existing AD participants.

However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy in this cohort. In particular, the impact of B cell depletion on humoral and cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination remains poorly defined. No study has addressed vaccine responses to the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in immunocompromised individuals so far.Methods: In this prospective cohort study we investigated humoral and cellular responses in serial samples from 164 individuals after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination (82 patients with neuroimmunological disorders on anti-CD20 therapy and 82 healthy controls). Antibodies were quantified using the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay against the receptor-binding (RBD) domain. T cell responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and the delta variant were assessed by IFN-g enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays. Findings: Following vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 Cspecific antibodies were detected in 57/82 (70%) patients compared to 82/82 (100%) healthy controls (p<0001). Seroconversion rates and antibody levels were lower in B cell-depleted (<1 B cell/mcl) patients compared to non-depleted ( 1 B cell/mcl) patients (p<0001). B cell levels  1 cell/mcl were sufficient to induce anti-SARS-CoV-2-S antibody responses. In contrast to the antibody response, most B cell-depleted patients generated a T-cell response against the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and the delta variant that was more robust in frequency (p<005) and magnitude (p<001) compared to non-depleted patients and persisted for at least six weeks.Interpretation: Humoral immunity following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination can be achieved in patients on anti-CD20 therapy once B cells start to repopulate. In the absence of B cells, a robust and stable T cell response is generated which may provide a potent defense against severe COVID-19 in this high-risk patient population.

This study evaluates the transfer of VR endoscopy training to live porcine endoscopy performance and compares the relative effectiveness of a proficiency-based vs repetition-based VR training curriculum. METHODS: Novice endoscopists completed pretesting including the FES manual skills examination and Global Assessment of GI Endoscopic Skills (GAGES) assessment of porcine upper and lower endoscopy. Participants were randomly assigned one of two curricula: proficiency-based or repetition-based. Following curriculum completion, participants post-tested via repeat FES examination and GAGES porcine endoscopy assessments. The two cohorts pre-to-post-test differences were compared using ANCOVA. RESULTS: Twenty-two residents completed the curricula. There were no differences in demographics or clinical endoscopy experience between the groups. The repetition group spent significantly more time on the simulator (repetition: 242.2 min, SD 48.6) compared to the proficiency group (proficiency: 170.0 min, SD 66.3; p = 0.013). There was a significant improvement in porcine endoscopy (pre: 10.6, SD 2.8, post: 16.6, SD 3.4; p < 0.001) and colonoscopy (pre: 10.4, SD 2.7, post: 16.4, SD 4.2; p < 0.001) GAGES scores as well as FES manual skills performance (pre: 270.9, SD 105.5, post: 477.4, SD 68.9; p < 0.001) for the total cohort.

With a focus on T cells, we review current knowledge on the regulation of CD26/DPP4 expression and release, its implication in T-cell effector function and the suitability CD26/DPP4 as a diagnostic and/or prognostic factor in T-cell malignancies. ABSTRACT: CD26/Dipeptidylpeptidase 4 is a transmembrane serine protease that cleaves off N-terminal dipeptides. CD26/DPP4 is expressed on several immune cell types including T and NK cells, dendritic cells, and activated B cells. A catalytically active soluble form of CD26/DPP4 can be released from the plasma membrane. Given its wide array of substrates and interaction partners CD26/DPP4 has been implicated in numerous biological processes and effects can be dependent or independent of its enzymatic activity and are exerted by the transmembrane protein and/or the soluble form. CD26/DPP4 has been implicated in the modulation of T-cell activation and proliferation and CD26/DPP4-positive T cells are characterized by remarkable anti-tumor properties rendering them interesting candidates for T cell-based immunotherapies. Moreover, especially in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma CD26/DPP4 expression patterns emerged as an established marker for diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Surprisingly, besides a profound knowledge on substrates, interaction partners, and associated signal transduction pathways, the precise role of CD26/DPP4 for T cell-based immune responses is only partially understood.","output":"The Serine Protease CD26/DPP4 in Non-Transformed and Malignant T Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reports of SARS-CoV-2 reinfections are on the rise This study focused on reinfections in patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the Czech Republic Between 1 March 2020 and 9 November 2020, 362 084 cases with the onset of symptoms before 31 October 2020 were reported Overall, 28 cases of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 reinfections were identified, 11 in males and 17 in females, age range 25-80 years, median age 46 years The interval between the first and second episodes of the disease ranged from 101 to 231 days, and the median interval was 201 5 days During both symptomatic episodes, all patients have been tested by RT-PCR Altogether 26 patients (92 9%) have been tested negative after recovery from the first episode of COVID-19 Symptomatic reinfections occurred in nearly 0 2% of all patients at risk Most patients with reinfection had mild symptoms in both episodes, and only three episodes were moderate to severe Thus, reinfections may have been underdiagnosed In summary, COVID-19 reinfections are possible and not exceptional","output":"COVID-19 reinfections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No abstract available.","output":"COVID-19 C Inequities, the third wave and vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The novel coronavirus outbreak has caused substantial changes in societal norms as well as adjustments in health systems worldwide. To date the impact of these pandemic-related variations has yet to be fully understood also in the field of maternal health for which continuity of care is a proven life-saving preventive measure. DESIGN: Following the PRISMA guidelines for reviews, a literature search was carried out to assess different approaches that combine quality of maternal care with the imposed social-distancing rules. Nine studies were included in the scoping review. FINDINGS: Reduction of in-person visits is the preferred overall solution. Yet, fewer consultations can still guarantee essential services and appropriate care through integration with telemedicine. Referral to epidemic-free community centres is an alternative option and new paths need to include the interdisciplinary contribution of medical consultants and IT experts, among others. In this context, delaying access for symptomatic expectant mothers is still debated since it carries the potential risk of untimely detection of pregnancy complications. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary experiences provide an overview of the different attempts put in place to reshape health services to contain the pandemic hazards.

In our simple model, we exploit the remarkable similarity in the structure of external costs causing market failure between the socially optimal choices of the COVID-19 pandemic case and the socially optimal urban traffic congestion level. By identifying this similarity, the results obtained from our simple model allow for future pandemic researchers to use the well-established research methodologies for designing socially optimal traffic levels and associated policy tools to find the socially optimal lockdown and travel restrictions. The key results obtained from our COVID-19 model are: (1) individuals do not internalize the external cost of infection risks they impose on others and health care system when making their own travel (social-activity) decisions; In order to induce individual travel decision makers to internalize this external cost, the government actions are necessary; The travel restrictions via lockdown or monetary penalty is one form of such actions; (2) the existence of external cost implies that the socially optimal length of lockdown is always longer than the privately optimal length of the lockdown period; (3) the strictness of the travel restriction and the amount of violation penalty should be higher in the areas with high population density and in larger cities because the external cost of spreading virus by a traveler would be higher. The monetary penalty in this model resembles the classical Pigouvian tax, which should increase with the city's population, people density, and economic prosperity; (4) when a government subsidizes or fully covers medical expenses of COVID-19 patients, stricter travel restrictions with heavier penalties are required.

Primary care physicians (PCP) decision-making to initiate and select appropriate anticoagulant medication is pivotal in reducing complications among patients with AF. This study explored the factors influencing PCPs decision-making in anticoagulant initiation and anticoagulant switch for patients with non-valvular AF. METHOD: The study design is qualitative research based on the theoretical framework of the Generalist Wheel of Knowledge, Understanding and Inquiry. In-depth interviews or focus group discussions were conducted with 27 PCPs in general practice in urban Singapore. The audio-recordings were transcribed and coded to identify themes, which are framed according to the clinician, patient, medical condition and treatment and healthcare system and policy domains. RESULTS: Personal training and experience with anticoagulant therapy; understanding patient risk-stratification; AF detection during clinical practice; medication cost; clinical support services for anticoagulation monitoring and constraints in existing care model influenced PCPs in their anticoagulant prescription. PCPs preferred to seek guidance from cardiologists in managing patients with newly diagnosed AF and attempted to engage their patients in decision-making regarding anticoagulant therapy. Some PCPs perceived sub-specialized primary care clinics focusing on AF co-management with cardiologists as an ideal setting for initiation and maintenance of anticoagulant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: PCPs are influenced by multiple interrelated factors while making decisions on anticoagulant initiation and anticoagulant switch for patients with AF. Their proposed care model to address the barriers awaits feasibility and acceptance assessment in future research.

Italy, and especially its Northern regions around the Po Valley, has been facing severe effects in terms of infected individuals and casualties (more than 31.000 deaths and 255.000 infected people by mid-May 2020). While the spread and effective impact of the virus is primarily related to the life styles and social habits of the different human communities, environmental and meteorological factors also play a role. Among these, pollution from PM2.5/PM10 particles, which may directly impact on the human respiratory system or act as virus carrier, thus behaving as potential amplifying factors in the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2. Enhanced levels of PM2.5/PM10 particles in Northern Italy were observed over the two month period preceding the virus pandemic spread. Threshold levels for PM10 (<50 g/m3) were exceeded on 20-35 days over the period January-February 2020 in many areas in the Po Valley, where major effects in terms of infections and casualties occurred, with levels in excess of 80 g/m3 occasionally observed in the 1-3 weeks preceding the contagious activation around February 25 th . Threshold values for PM2.5 indicted in WHO air quality guidelines (<25 g/m3) were exceeded on more than 40 days over the period January-February 2020 in large portions of the Po Valley, with levels up to 70 g/m3 observed in the weeks preceding the contagious activation. The evolution of particle matter concentration levels throughout the month of February 2020 was carefully monitored and results are reported in the paper.In this paper PM10 particle measurements are compared with epidemiologic parameters data. Specifically, a statistical analysis is carried out to correlate the infection rate, or incidence of the pathology, the mortality rate and the case fatality rate with PM concentration levels. The study considers epidemiologic data for all 110 Italian Provinces, as reported by the Italian Statistics Institute (ISTAT, 2020), over the period 20 February-31 March 2020. Corresponding PM10 concentration levels were collected from the network of air quality monitoring stations run by different Regional and Provincial Environment Agencies, covering the period 15-26 February 2020. The case fatality rate is found to be highly correlated to the average PM10 concentration, with a correlation coefficient of 0.89 and a slope of the regression line of (6.70.3)10 -3 m3/g, which implies a doubling (from 3 to 6 %) of the mortality rate of infected patients for an average PM10 concentration increase from 22 to 27 g/m3. Infection and mortality rates are also found to be correlated with PM10 concentration levels, with correlation coefficients being 0.82 and 0.80, respectively, and the slopes of the regression lines indicating a doubling (from 1 to 2 ) of the infection rate and a tripling (from 0.1 to 0.3 ) of the mortality rate for an average PM10 concentration increase from 25 to 29 g/m3. Epidemiologic parameters data were also compared with population density data, but no clear evidence of a mutual correlation between these quantities was found. Considerations on the exhaled particles' sizes and concentrations, their residence times, transported viral dose and minimum infective dose, in combination with PM2.5/PM10 pollution measurements and an analytical microphysical model, allowed assessing the potential role of airborne transmission through virus-transmitting PM particles, in addition to droplet transmission, in conveying SARS-CoV-2 in the human respiratory system.","output":"?Assessment of the potential role of PM2.5/PM10 particles in intensifying the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in Northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A series of acyclic 2-(D-gulo-) and 2-(D-gluco-)benzimidazole C-nucloside analogs have been prepared by condensation of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride derivatives with d-gulonic acid--lactone and d-gluconic acid--lactone, separately.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess real-time public awareness and behavioral responses to the COVID-19 epidemic across 12 selected countries. METHODS: Internet surveillance was used to collect real-time data from the general public to assess public awareness and rumors (China: Baidu; worldwide: Google Trends) and behavior responses (China: Ali Index; worldwide: Google Shopping). These indices measured the daily number of searches or purchases and were compared with the numbers of daily COVID-19 cases. The trend comparisons across selected countries were observed from December 1, 2019 (prepandemic baseline) to April 11, 2020 (at least one month after the governments of selected countries took actions for the pandemic). RESULTS: We identified missed windows of opportunity for early epidemic control in 12 countries, when public awareness was very low despite the emerging epidemic. China's epidemic and the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern did not prompt a worldwide public reaction to adopt health-protective measures; instead, most countries and regions only responded to the epidemic after their own case counts increased. Rumors and misinformation led to a surge of sales in herbal remedies in China and antimalarial drugs worldwide, and timely clarification of rumors mitigated the rush to purchase unproven remedies.

Chemical compounds which can be found in bark extracts have important biological properties and therefore a high potential for using in the production of special formulations. In the present study, extraction of Picea abies bark with organosolv solvents was investigated to achieve a high yield of desirable compounds. For the extraction four different solvent ratios of ethanol and water were applied. The temperature range of extraction was set between 40 and 100 C and stirring velocity of 400 rpm. Extractions were performed with a solid/liquid ratio of 1:20. Yields of phenolics, flavonoids and tannins were determined using gallic acid for total phenolic content (TPC), quercetin for total flavonoid content (TFC) and tannic acid for total tannins content (TTC) as calibration compounds. Qualitative analysis of phenolic constituents was performed after their derivatization, by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry identification. The total yield of bark extract of 14.75 wt.% was achieved by using an ethanol/water ratio of 50% (v/v) and a temperature of 100 C. Gas chromatography results show 9 aromatic carboxylic acids as phenolic acids and quercetin and (+)-catechin as flavonoid compounds. Highest concentrations of TPC = 3.21 mg gallic acid equivalent/g, TCF = 0.62 mg quercetin equivalent/g and TTC = 0.84 tannic acid equivalent/g were determined at the same process conditions by photometric method. This study determined the conditions for organosolv extraction of useful compounds and suggests that some of extractives, e.g., taxifolin and rhamnetin presented in the spruce bark extracts, have antiviral (SARS-CoV-2) effects. Therefore, this warrants further evaluation of the antiviral properties of spruce bark constituents.","output":"Investigation of Selective Extraction of Phenolic Compounds and of Saccharides From Picea Abies Bark Using Organosolv Solvents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2, and compare it with RT polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). METHODS: We designed primers specific to the orf1ab and S genes of SARS-CoV-2. Total viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. We optimized the RT-LAMP assay. And, this assay was evaluated for its sensitivity and specificity of detection using real-time turbidity monitoring and visual observation. RESULTS: The primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123 amplified the genes in the shortest times, the mean (SD) time was 18  1.32 min and 20  1.80 min, respectively, and 63C was the optimum reaction temperature. The sensitivity was 210(1) copies and 210(2) copies per reaction with primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123, respectively. This assay showed no cross-reactivity with other 60 respiratory pathogens. To describe the availability of this method in clinical diagnosis, we collected 130 specimens from patients with clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among them, 58 were confirmed to be positive and 72 were negative by RT-LAMP. The sensiticity was 100% (95% CI 92.3% - 100%), specificity 100% (95% CI 93.7% - 100%). This assay detected SARS-CoV-2 in the mean (SD) time of 26.28  4.48 min and the results can be identified with visual observation. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that we developed a rapid, simple, specific, and sensitive RT-LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection among clinical samples.

Most of the currently available inhibitors are weak in terms of potency, drug-likeness, and furin specificity thereby necessitating the development of newer compounds especially mechanism-based inhibitors. Here, the roles of active site Cys198 (C198), His194 (H194), and Ser386 (S386) were investigated using computational-site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Data were obtained from six (6) biosystems: wildtype (C198/S386), furin-C198G (S386), furin-S386G (C198), and their peptide (nascent hydrolyzed peptide H2N-RTRR-CO2) bound complexes. The results strongly supported that in wildtype furin but not S386G and C198G mutants, following S386/scissile carbon attack (4.0 ?), the peptide retracted from the active site, representing peptide release post hydrolysis. Furthermore, in S386G mutant, C194 side chain thiolate ion may act as the nucleophile replacement but competing electron-rich centers (H194, H364) and energetically unattainable geometric strain on the peptide may constitute the limiting factors. In biosystems not complexed with peptide (representative of pre-attack state), C198 preferentially engaged H194 imidazole moiety via sulfur- bond system causing a dihedral and positional restraints on the imidazole ring for ultimate alignment of its NE2 hydrogen atom with the side chain enolate oxygen of S364 required for optimal proton transfer.

Furthermore, in terms of Child-Pugh classification, five patients were in category A, two in category B, and one in category C. The patients were eligible for SLH if they had solitary tumors measuring 3 cm or smaller on the caudal surface of the liver. The lesion was approached through a 20-mm supraumbilical incision using a single-port access device. RESULTS No patient experienced intraoperative complications that required additional port access and conversion to laparotomy. The operative time was 148 min (range, 141-235 min). The postoperative course of the patients was uneventful, and they were discharged an average of 6.2 days (range, 3-11 days) after the operation.

There is no easily available, approved vaccine. Methods: Here we have used a murine model of pneumonic plague to examine the factors that maximise immunogenicity and contribute to survival following vaccination. We varied vaccine type, as either a genetic fusion of the F1 and V protein antigens or a mixture of these two recombinant antigens, as well as antigen dose-level and formulation in order to correlate immune response to survival. Results: Whilst there was interaction between each of the variables of vaccine type, dose level and formulation and these all contributed to survival, vaccine formulation in protein-coated microcrystals (PCMCs) was the key contributor in inducing antibody titres. From these data, we propose a cut-off in total serum antibody titre to the F1 and V proteins of 100 g/mL and 200 g/mL, respectively. At these thresholds, survival is predicted in this murine pneumonic model to be >90%. Within the total titre of antibody to the V antigen, the neutralising antibody component correlated with dose level and was enhanced when the V antigen in free form was formulated in PCMCs. Antibody titre to F1 was limited by fusion to V, but this was compensated for by PCMC formulation. Conclusions: These data will enable clinical assessment of this and other candidate plague vaccines that utilise the same vaccine antigens by identifying a target antibody titre from murine models, which will guide the evaluation of clinical titres as serological surrogate markers of efficacy.","output":"Predictors of Survival after Vaccination in a Pneumonic Plague Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID19) pandemic spreads and the number of Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi)-treated COVID19 affected patients grows, we must consider the pros and cons of BTKi discontinuation for our patients. In favor of BTKi continuation, BTK plays an active role in macrophage polarization. By modulating key transcription factors, BTK may regulate macrophage polarization downstream of classic M1 and M2 polarizing stimuli and mitigate the hyperinflammatory state associated with COVID19. In favor of BTKi discontinuation, we note a potentially increased risk of secondary infections or impaired humoral immunity. We hypothesize that the potential benefit of blunting a hyper-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 through attenuation of M1 polarization outweighs the potential risk of impaired humoral immunity, not to mention the risk of rapid progression of B-cell malignancy following BTKi interruption.

Many warned that this risked damaging public confidence during a critical period of pandemic response. This study investigated whether the pause in the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine had an impact on subsequent vaccine uptake in European countries. METHODS: We used a difference-in-differences approach capitalizing on the fact that some countries halted their rollouts whilst others did not. A longitudinal panel was constructed for European Economic Area countries spanning 15 weeks in early 2021. Media reports were used to identify countries that paused the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the timing of this. Data on vaccine uptake were available through the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker. Difference-in-differences linear regression models controlled for key confounders that could influence vaccine uptake, and country and week fixed effects. Further models and robustness checks were performed. RESULTS: The panel included 28 countries, with 19 in the intervention group and 9 in the control group. Pausing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was associated with a 0.52% decrease in uptake for the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and a 1.49% decrease in the uptake for both doses, comparing countries that paused to those that did not. These estimates are not statistically significant (p = 0.86 and 0.39 respectively). For the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine only, the pause was associated with a 0.56% increase in uptake for the first dose and a 0.07% decrease in uptake for both doses. These estimates are also not statistically significant (p = 0.56 and 0.51 respectively). All our findings are robust to sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: As new COVID-19 vaccines emerge, regulators should be cautious to deviate from usual protocols if further investigation on clinical or epidemiological grounds is warranted.","output":"The impact of pausing the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine on uptake in Europe: a difference-in-differences analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Parents of children with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) report higher levels of distress compared to those of typically developing children. Distress levels may be heightened by the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unclear whether distress levels of parents varied by the diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorder in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to investigate whether parental distress was influenced by the type of NDD. Participants were from Australia (N = 196) and Italy (N = 200); the parents of children aged 3C18 were invited to complete an online self-reported survey which included the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) to determine parental distress. The results show that intellectual or learning disorder (ILD) is a major contributor to parental distress compared to other NDDs in both Australia and Italy. Moreover, the worsening of symptomatic changes in children with NDDs was significantly associated with parental distress. The differences between the two countries in terms of the pandemic impact, however, were not statistically significant. The results suggest that intervention strategies need to be tailored for individual clinical information and factor in the societys stringency level of anti-contagion policies to improve parental wellbeing.","output":"Distress Levels of Parents of Children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comparison between Italy and Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Rates of methamphetamine use and methamphetamine-related deaths have increased steadily in the United States in recent years. Methamphetamine is increasingly present in opioid-related deaths. An initial study of de-identified urine specimens (n = 102) collected at a drug treatment program between 2017 and 2018 indicated that 61% of specimens contained methamphetamine; of the specimens containing methamphetamine, people were, on average, five years younger than those who tested negative for methamphetamine; and non-fentanyl opioids were more than three times as common in methamphetamine positive specimens. The National Drug Early Warning System (NDEWS) Coordinating Center initiated a HotSpot Study to assess whether there was an emerging dynamic in the area, or if enhanced data collection could give insights into the co-use of methamphetamine and opioids. METHODS A qualitative study, grounded in principles of rapid ethnographic assessment and a social science/anthropological framework was conducted and used methodological complementarity to contextualize results from the initial urinalysis study. Targeted sampling was conducted at two treatment sites. Program staff and patients were recruited to participate in focus groups and semi-structured interviews to assess structural, community, and individual-level factors impacting methamphetamine and opioid co-use. RESULTS Within our broader framework of structural, community, and individual-level factors intersecting co-use, our data yielded three sub-themes: 1) the circulation of stigma regarding methamphetamine use was consistently described by both patients and staff and this intersected structural changes in treatment policy and suggested compounded stigma; 2) community-level factors and temporality were important for understanding patterns of methamphetamine use and for further interpreting the initial urinalysis; 3) patient rationales regarding the co-use of methamphetamine and opioids included strategies to mitigate the harms of heroin, as well as to detox or titrate the effects of heroin. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS Using an ethnographically-oriented and social science/anthropological approach and methodological complementarity to contextualize the prior urinalysis study demonstrates how behavioral variables cannot be abstracted from larger socio-structural and community contexts which impact people's decision-making process regarding co-use of methamphetamine and opioids. Further, by grounding our analysis in the meaning-centered and experiential narratives of people who use drugs, our research demonstrates the importance of considering the expertise of people who co-use opioids and methamphetamine as central for informing future sustainable program planning to address co-use that also accounts for the interrelationship between structural, community, and individual-level factors.","output":"Co-use of methamphetamine and opioids among people in treatment in Oregon: A qualitative examination of interrelated structural, community, and individual-level factors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Le scanner thoracique a une place importante dans le diagnostic positif et lvaluation de ltendue des lsions pulmonaires chez les patients ayant une infection respiratoire au SARS-COV2.

We explain this as the result of an increase in the diagnostic rate and in the effectiveness of patient isolation after March 26th. Our best estimates are consistent with SARS eventually being contained in Toronto, although the time of containment is sensitive to the parameters in our model. It is shown that despite the empirically modeled heterogeneity in transmission, SARS' average reproductive number is 1.2, a value quite similar to that computed for some strains of influenza \\\\cite{CC2}.

PED, caused by the PED virus (PEDV), leads to severe diarrhea, vomiting, and subsequent dehydration in suckling piglets. Lactogenic immunity derived from colostrum and milk is very important because immunoglobulins (Ig) cannot cross the placenta in pregnant sows. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunological correlation of the sample-to-positive (S/P) ratios of IgA and IgG against PEDV between colostrum, sow serum, and their piglet serum. Materials and Methods A total of 43 sows were divided into three groups according to the experience of PEDV infection: Negative sow group (n=7) and treatment group (n=36, sows previously infected with PEDV). The treatment group was subdivided into two groups: Sows immunized with live-attenuated PEDV vaccine (n=15) and sows immunized with feedback (n=21) at 3 weeks before farrowing. The 7-day-old piglets (n=425) were obtained from negative sows (n=89), vaccinated sows (n=150), and feedback sows (n=275). Colostrum, sow serum, and their piglet serum were collected and analyzed for S/P ratios of their IgA and IgG levels against PEDV using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results The piglets from sows immunized with live-attenuated PEDV vaccine had a higher S/P ratio of IgG against PEDV (p<0.001), whereas the piglets from the feedback group had a higher S/P ratio of IgA against PEDV (p<0.001) compared with piglets from the negative sows. In addition, the S/P ratios of PEDV-specific IgA and IgG between sow serum and colostrum showed a positive correlation (Pearson's coefficient r=0.61 and 0.75, respectively). Both S/P ratios of PEDV-specific IgA and IgG in sow serum and colostrum had a positive correlation to those in piglet serum. Conclusion Overall, this study suggested that pregnant sows immunized with the live-attenuated vaccine against PEDV and feedback may provide maternal immunity against PEDV to their offspring.","output":"Correlation between antibody response against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in sows and their offspring under field conditions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most people adapt to bereavement over time. For a minority, the grief persists and may lead to a prolonged grief disorder (PGD). Identifying grievers at risk of PGD may enable specific prevention measures. The present study examined the extent to which the subjective unexpectedness of the death predicted grief outcomes above and beyond known sociodemographic and objective loss-related variables in a sample drawn from a population-representative investigation. In our sample (n = 2,531), 811 participants (M(age) 55.1  17.8 years, 59.2% women) had experienced the loss of a significant person six or more months ago. Participants provided demographic and loss-related information, perceptions of the unexpectedness of the death and completed the Prolonged Grief Disorder-13 + 9 (PG-13 + 9). The PG-13 + 9 was used to determine PGD caseness. A binary logistic regression investigated predictors of PGD caseness, and a linear regression predictors of grief severity. ANCOVAs compared PGD symptoms between the groups who had experienced an expected vs. unexpected loss, while controlling for the relationship to the deceased and time since loss. The loss of a child (OR = 23.66; 95%CI, 6.03C68.28), or a partner (OR = 5.32; 95%CI, 1.79C15.83), the time since loss (OR = 0.99; 95%CI, 0.99C1.00) and the unexpectedness of the death (OR = 3.58; 95%CI, 1.70C7.69) were significant predictors of PGD caseness (Nagelkerkes R(2) = 0.25) and grief severity. Participants who had experienced the loss as unexpected (vs. expected) reported higher scores on all PGD symptoms. Unexpectedness of the death emerged as significant risk factor for PGD, even after controlling for demographic and other loss-related variables. While our findings replicate previous research on the importance of the relationship to the deceased as a risk factor for PGD, they also highlight the importance of assessing the subjective unexpectedness of a death and may help to identify risk groups who can profit from preventive interventions.","output":"Predictors of Prolonged Grief Disorder in a German Representative Population Sample: Unexpectedness of Bereavement Contributes to Grief Severity and Prolonged Grief Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical studies have reported associations between MMP-8 genotypes and clinical outcomes without exploring underlying mechanisms.

Rs1940475 was genotyped in 44 healthy Caucasian males, who were challenged with an intravenous bolus of 2 ng/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 were measured at baseline and 2, 4, 6, and 24 h after LPS infusion with high-sensitivity enzyme immunoassays. Peak TNF levels at 2 h after LPS infusion were significantly higher in subjects with AA genotype compared to subjects with AG or GG genotypes (185 pg/mL [IQR, 154C234] vs. 94 pg/mL [IQR, 65C125] vs. 107 pg/mL [IQR, 80C241], respectively; p = 0.03 between groups).

For all heel raise trials, anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) were quantified from center of pressure (COP) recordings and electromyographic (EMG) activity from the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL). Results indicated that participants exhibited larger APAs, as reflected by the greater backward COP displacement (p=0.038) and velocity (p=0.022) as well as a larger TA EMG amplitude (p=0.045), during the high threat condition. During the execution phase of the heel raise, an earlier (p=0.014) and larger (p=0.041) SOL EMG activation were observed during the high threat condition.

Design/methodology/approach: A dynamic macroeconomic model of job creation and destruction of the search and matching type in a dual labour market. Findings: The model shows that the availability of STW schemes does not necessarily prevent a large increase in unemployment and job destruction. The quantitative effects depend on the degree of subsidization of payroll taxes and on the design of the policy. A scenario with a moderate degree of subsidization and where the subsidy is independent of the reduction in hours worked is the least harmful for both welfare and fiscal deficit. The cost of such a strategy is a higher unemployment rate. Concerning heterogeneous effects, the unemployed are the ones who experience the strongest distributional changes. Originality/value: The effectiveness of STW schemes in dual labour markets using a search and matching model in the context of the COVID-19 crisis has not been analysed elsewhere. The literature has emphasized the importance of dynamics, labour market institutions and workers heterogeneity to understand workforce adjustment decisions in the face of temporary shocks to de- mand especially when firms human capital is relevant.

In this context, how to accurately predict the turning point, duration and final scale of the epidemic in different countries, regions or cities is key to enabling decision makers and public health departments to formulate intervention measures and deploy resources. METHODS: Based on COVID-19 surveillance data and human mobility data, this study predicts the epidemic trends of national and state regional administrative units in the United States from July 27, 2020, to January 22, 2021, by constructing a SIRD model considering the factors of lockdown and riot. RESULTS: (1) The spread of the epidemic in the USA has the characteristics of geographical proximity. (2) During the lockdown period, there was a strong correlation between the number of COVID-19 infected cases and residents activities in recreational areas such as parks. (3) The turning point (the point of time in which active infected cases peak) of the early epidemic in the USA was predicted to occur in September. (4) Among the 10 states experiencing the most severe epidemic, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Texas, Illinois, Pennsylvania and California are all predicted to meet the turning point in a concentrated period from July to September, while the turning point in Georgia is forecast to occur in December. No turning points in Florida and Arizona were foreseen for the forecast period, with the number of infected cases still set to be growing rapidly. CONCLUSIONS: The model was found accurately to predict the future trend of the epidemic and can be applied to other countries. It is worth noting that in the early stage there is no vaccine or approved pharmaceutical intervention for this disease, making the fight against the pandemic reliant on non-pharmaceutical interventions.

This study sought to determine the safety and tolerability of onalespib plus erlotinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the combination in epidermal growth factor receptor exon 20 insertion (EGFRex20ins) NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Standard 3+3 dose escalation was followed by a phase II expansion in EGFRex20ins. The phase II component targeted a response rate of 25% versus a background rate of 5%. Prospective next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 70 cancer-related genes, including EGFR, via plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was performed. Toxicity was graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4, and response was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1. RESULTS: Eleven patients were treated (nine dose escalation, two dose expansion). Two dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in dose level (DL) 0 and zero in DL -1 (minus). In 10 EGFRex20ins patients, no responses were observed, median progression-free survival was 5.4 months (95% confidence interval, 0.9-5.7), and the disease control rate (DCR) was 40% (median, 3.5 months). EGFRex20ins was detected in nine of 10 ctDNA samples at baseline; on-treatment ctDNA clearance was not observed. Grade 3 diarrhea was the predominant toxicity in 45% of patients.

Aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) are crucial to the practice of dentistry; it is imperative to understand the inherent risks of viral dispersion associated with AGPs and the efficacy of available mitigation strategies. In a dental surgery setting, crown preparation and root canal access procedures were performed with an air turbine or high-speed contra-angle handpiece (HSCAH), with mitigation via rubber dam or high-volume aspiration and a no-mitigation control. A phantom head was used with a 1.5-mL min(?1) flow of artificial saliva infected with 6-bacteriophage (a surrogate virus for SARS-CoV-2) at ~10(8) plaque-forming units mL(?1), reflecting the upper limits of reported salivary SARS-CoV-2 levels. Bioaerosol dispersal was measured using agar settle plates lawned with the 6-bacteriophage host, Pseudomonas syringae. Viral air concentrations were assessed using MicroBio MB2 air sampling and particle quantities using Kanomax 3889 GEO counters. Compared to an air turbine, the HSCAH reduced settled bioaerosols by 99.72%, 100.00%, and 100.00% for no mitigation, aspiration, and rubber dam, respectively.

Use of the HSCAH with high-volume aspiration resulted in no detectable bacteriophage, both on nonsplatter settle plates and in air samples taken 6 to 10 min postprocedure. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report the aerosolization in a dental clinic of active virus as a marker for risk determination. While this model represents a worst-case scenario for possible SARS-CoV-2 dispersal, these data showed that the use of HSCAHs can vastly reduce the risk of viral aerosolization and therefore remove the need for clinic fallow time. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the use of particle analysis alone cannot provide sufficient insight to understand bioaerosol infection risk.","output":"Dental Mitigation Strategies to Reduce Aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2020, the B.1.1.7 genetic variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was first reported after emergence and rapid circulation in the United Kingdom (1).

We aimed to study the cytokine profile during the convalescent phase and its association with liver functions. We performed a retrospective study to investigate the longitudinal dynamic serum cytokine, liver function, and metabolomic profiles, as well as their potential correlations, from the viral replication phase to early convalescence. Our results demonstrated that liver injury was common. Liver injury was significantly associated with higher levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 (p < 0.05). However, alanine aminotransferase levels decreased during the first week after hospital discharge (p < 0.01). In parallel, T-cell and B-cell immune response-stimulating cytokine IL-4, but not IL-2, was significantly elevated (p < 0.05). Furthermore, interferon- (IFN-) and tumor necrosis factor- (TFN-) levels increased, in contrast to the decrease in IL-6 and IL-10 levels; liver function returned to normal. The metabolomic analysis supported active recovery during early convalescence of COVID-19 patients that had distinct metabolic profiles associated with the hepatic tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acid metabolism, and lipid metabolism. In addition, we identified a metabolomic association of IL-4 with liver repair. Our findings suggest that discharged patients continue to recover from the physiological effects of COVID-19, and the association of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 levels with metabolic changes and liver function repair may have important implications for clinical manifestations and treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Elevation of Serum Cytokine Profiles and Liver Metabolomic Normalization in Early Convalescence of COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Salt stress affects the metabolic homeostasis of medicinal plants. However, medicinal plants are sessile organisms that cannot escape from salt stress. They acclimatize themselves to the stress by reprogramming their metabolic pathways.

Nevertheless, the variation of integrated metabolites in LJF under different salt stresses remains unclear. In this study, High Performance Liquid Chromatography tandem triple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC- triple TOF-MS/MS) coupled with multivariate statistical analysis was applied to comparatively investigate the metabolites changes in LJF under different salt stress (0, 100, 200, 300 mM NaCl). Total 47 differential metabolites were screened from 79 metabolites identified in LJF under different salt stress. Low salt-treated group (100 mM NaCl) appeared to be the best group in terms of relative contents (peak areas) of the wide variety in bioactive components. Additionally, the phenylpropanoid pathway, monoterpenoid biosynthesis, glycolysis, TCA cycle, and alkaloid biosynthesis were disturbed in all salt-stress LJF. The results showed that LJF metabolisms were dramatically induced under salt stress and the quality of LJF was better under low salt stress.

We previously demonstrated that the addition of a viral filter to the nebulizer exhalation limb substantially reduced expelled particles during MCT. Our aim was to evaluate whether this modification affects the delivered dose of methacholine. METHODS A mechanical ventilator was connected to a lung simulator with breathing frequency 15 breaths/min, tidal volume 500 mL, inspiratory-expiratory ratio 1:1, with a sinusoidal waveform. We compared methacholine dose delivery using the Hudson Micro Mist or AeroEclipse II BAN nebulizers powered by either a dry gas source or a compressor system. A filter placed in line between the nebulizer and test lung was weighed before and after 1 min of nebulized methacholine delivery. Mean inhaled mass was measured with and without a viral filter on the exhalation limb. Dose delivery was calculated by multiplying the mean inhaled mass by the respirable fraction (particles < 5 m) and inhalation time. Unpaired t test was used to compare methacholine dose delivery with and without viral filter placement. RESULTS The addition of a viral filter did not significantly affect methacholine dose delivery across all devices tested. Using a 50-psi dry gas source, dose delivered with or without a viral filter did not differ with the Hudson (422.3 g vs 282.0 g, P = .11) or the AeroEclipse nebulizer (563.0 g vs 657.6 g, P = .59). Using the compressor, dose delivered with and without a viral filter did not differ with the Hudson (974.0 g vs 868.0 g, P = .03) or the AeroEclipse nebulizer (818.0 g vs 628.5 g, P = .42). CONCLUSIONS The addition of a viral filter to the nebulizer exhalation limb did not affect methacholine dose during bronchoprovocation testing.

Clinical prediction rules to differentiate streptococcal pharyngitis from viral infection are not recommended in children. Rapid point-of-care (POC) antigen tests have limited sensitivity and so are not often used in Canadian paediatric emergency departments (EDs). Standard paediatric practice is to rely on laboratory-based testing, which often results in a delay before the results can be communicated to the patient; this may impede appropriate prescribing, decrease caregiver satisfaction and delay recovery. The objective of this study is to determine whether a novel rapid molecular POC assay for streptococcal pharyngitis leads to more appropriate antibiotic use in children seeking care in a paediatric ED than standard laboratory-based testing. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A randomised, superiority, open-label, trial with two parallel groups. Children presenting to a tertiary paediatric ED at least 3 years of age who have a throat swab ordered for diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis will be eligible; those who have taken antibiotics within 72 hours prior to presentation and those with additional active infections will be excluded. The primary study outcome will be appropriate antibiotic treatment at 3C5 days postenrolment. Secondary outcomes include time to symptom resolution, caregiver satisfaction, caregiver/child absenteeism, number of subsequent healthcare visits, clinician satisfaction and incremental cost-effectiveness of POC testing. A total of 352 participants will be needed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All study documentation has been approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics board and informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Data from this trial will be presented at major conferences and published in peer-reviewed publications to facilitate collaborations with networks of clinicians experienced in the dissemination of clinical guidelines.

We aimed to describe the impact of a technological chatbot on improving the communications between healthcare providers and patients and caregivers for dietary monitoring. Methods: We developed a chatbot that provides patients a tool to register their meals through a simple and carefully designed conversational interface. Patients recorded dietary intake three times a week, and they received a nutrition recommendation biweekly. Of these, we monitored body mass index (BMI), caloric intake, need for artificial supplementation and/or thickeners, and ALSFRS-R. Results: A total of 26 patients were enrolled and monitored for six months, for a total of 554 fillings (mean of 21/patient). From the recorded data, it appears that patients, on average, ate ? of recommended portion, and 66% maintained the caloric intake during the six-month follow-up. The mean BMI at chatbot onset was 24.00 (SD: 3.82) which remained stable over time (BMI 23.67 (SD: 2.87)). During chatbot monitoring, 45% of patients required artificial supplementation, 11.5% had a gastrostomy tube placed. Conclusions: A positive evaluation was obtained both on patient well-being and physicians' perspective.

The use of an airborne infection isolation (AIIR) room is preferred. Viral RNA analysis using swabs from throat, both lungs and other organs provides information on cross-organ viral dynamics. To correctly determine the full extent of pathological organ changes an adequate processing procedure is of the utmost importance. Systematic dissection and processing of the lungs revealed pulmonary infarction caused by thrombosis and thromboembolism and subsequent bacterial bronchopneumonia as the most frequent cause of death. Fungal pneumonia (aspergillus) was found in one case. The quality of the tissue was sufficient for histopathological and immunohistochemistry analyses in all cases. Viral RNA from throat or lung swabs was detectable post mortem in 89% of the cases and could also be detected from paraffin-embedded tissue by real-time PCR.

OBJECTIVE: Lianhua Qingwen capsule (LHQW) was selected as an example to discuss the feasibility of a bioassay for quality control. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Network pharmacology was used to screen potential targets in LHQW with respect to its anti-inflammatory effects. An in vitro cell model was used to validate the prediction. An anti-inflammatory bioassay was established for the quality evaluation of LHQW in 40 batches of marketed products and three batches of destructed samples. RESULTS: The tumor necrosis factor/interleukin-6 (TNF/IL-6) pathway via macrophage was selected as the potential target of LHQW. The IC(50) value of LHQW on RAW 264.7 was 799.8 g/mL. LHQW had significant inhibitory effects on the expression of IL-6 in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). The anti-inflammatory biopotency of LHQW was calculated based on the inhibitory bioactivity on IL-6. The biopotency of 40 marketed samples ranged from 404 U/g to 2171 U/g, with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 37.91%. By contrast, the contents of forsythin indicated lower CV (28.05%) than the value of biopotency. Moreover, the biopotencies of destructed samples declined approximate 50%, while the contents of forsythin did not change. This newly established bioassay revealed a better ability to discriminate the quality variations of LHQW as compared to the routine chemical determination.
