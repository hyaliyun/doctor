This paper considers some of the difficult causal questions that would arise in answering this question, including the relation of actions taken by the company to remain solvent while suffering the effects of COVID-19 and governmental lockdown orders, and concludes that, in some instances, a company will have suffered an MAE even if the MAE clause contains exceptions for pandemics, changes in law, or both.","output":"Material Adverse Effect Clauses and the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Understanding pulmonary embolism (PE) rate and contributing comorbid, clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics may aid in management of pro-thombotic events in COVID-19 (COVID+) patients. PURPOSE: To evaluate PE prevalence on computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) in COVID+ patients and factors associated with PE severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective, single-center study evaluated 62 COVID+ patients who underwent CTPA between March 13 and April 5, 2020. A 62-patient cohort who underwent CTPA prior to the first reported local COVID-19 case was retrogradely selected. The relative rate of CTPA-positivity was recorded. For the COVID+ cohort, comorbidities, laboratory values, clinical outcome, and venous thrombosis were recorded. Two thoracic radiologists assessed embolic severity using the Mastora system and evaluated right heart strain. Statistical analysis evaluated factors associated with PE and arterial obstruction severity. A P-value<.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: 37.1% of COVID+ patients had PE, higher than 14.5% of pre-COVID patients (P=.007). D-dimer levels closest to CTPA date correlated with Mastora obstruction score. ROC analysis identified optimal sensitivity (95%) and specificity (71%) for PE diagnosis at 1394 ng/mL DDU. The mean D-dimer was 1774 ng/mL and 6432 ng/mL DDU in CTPA-negative and CTPA-positive subgroups, respectively (P<.001). One additional CTPA-negative patient had DVT, for a total 38.7% with PE/DVT, despite 40% receiving prophylactic anticoagulation. Other factors did not demonstrate significant PE association. CONCLUSION: 37.1% of COVID+ CTPA exams diagnosed PE. PE can be a cause of decompensation in COVID+, and D-dimer can be used to stratify patients regarding PE risk and severity.","output":"Pulmonary Embolism on CTPA in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research shows that worker subjective well-being influences physiological functioningan early signal of poor health outcomes.

However, state-of-the-art solutions in related tasks such as identity or expression recognition employ large Convolutional Neural Networks, whose use in mobile devices is infeasible due to hardware limitations and size restrictions of downloadable applications. To counteract this, we adapt two existing lightweight CNNs proposed in the context of the ImageNet Challenge, and two additional architectures proposed for mobile face recognition. Since datasets for soft-biometrics prediction using selfie images are limited, we counteract over-fitting by using networks pre-trained on ImageNet. Furthermore, some networks are further pre-trained for face recognition, for which very large training databases are available. Since both tasks employ similar input data, we hypothesize that such strategy can be beneficial for soft-biometrics estimation. A comprehensive study of the effects of different pre-training over the employed architectures is carried out, showing that, in most cases, a better accuracy is obtained after the networks have been fine-tuned for face recognition.","output":"Facial Masks and Soft-Biometrics: Leveraging Face Recognition CNNs for Age and Gender Prediction on Mobile Ocular Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction. During the COVID-19 pandemic variety of digital tools and technologies were demonstrated owing to the global digitalization of education and the total transition to online learning. The purpose of present research is to determine factors of digitalization of education and their effect on transformation of social values among high school students in conditions of the COVID-19. The results of research on social values of students were considered using comparative analysis. It was revealed that the paradigm of values among young people changed from an individual-personal one at the beginning of the XXI century to the social oriented paradigm - tolerance, openness, public recognition through social networks, self-development and contribution to the community. Materials and Methods. The analysis of pedagogical experience in the field of digitalization of education allowed to formulate the main factors of global digitalization of education and to highlight positive and negative aspects of online learning. According to M. Rokich's method, an empirical study of instrumental values transformations was carried out among 137 students of Ural Federal University in the conditions of full-time online learning. A questionnaire method was implemented to determine students' attitude to online learning during COVID-19 pandemic and possibility for further development of this form of learning. Results. It was revealed that only 13.7% of respondents did not notice any decrease in the quality of learning and did not experience discomfort in obtaining knowledge in online form. According to the students' opinion the values that are subjected to transformation are the following: efficiency, self-control, responsibility, honesty. It can be concluded that the era of network personality and new scientific knowledge in pedagogy has begun. Online learning is a fait accompli which requires scientific substantiation of a new didactics and social values system development among students in a digital education environment. Discussion and Conclusion. Achieved results contribute to ecological system of new digital services that change life and educational activities of a human, as well as transform his personality and values system. Thus, for the purpose of health and emotional intelligence preservation in students the continuation of interdisciplinary study of various aspects of education digitalization is required. ? Rezer T.

This fruitful research, however, has not been well tied to fruit flies natural history. To address this knowledge gap, I conducted a field study. My goal was to inform future research conducted in artificial surroundings, and to inspire new investigations that can rely more heavily on fruit flies actual natural behavior. My two main novel findings were first, that flies in the field showed significant sociability, as they formed social groups rather than dispersed randomly among fruits of similar quality. Second, males showed fair levels of aggression towards each other as indicated by a lunging rate of 17 per hour, and lower rates of wing threat and boxing. Courtship was the most prominent activity on fruits, with females rejecting almost all males advances. This resulted in an estimated mating rate of 0.6 per female per day. Flies showed a striking peak of activity early in the mornings, even at cold temperatures, followed by inactivity for much of the day and night. Flies, however, handled well high temperatures approaching 40 C by hiding away from fruit and concentrating activity in the cooler, early mornings. My field work highlights a few promising lines of future research informed by fruit flies natural history. Most importantly, we do not understand the intriguing dynamics that generate significant sociability despite frequent aggressive interactions on fruits. Males responses to female rejection signals varied widely, perhaps because the signals differed in information content perceived by flies but not humans. Finally, flies tolerated cold early mornings perhaps owing to fitness benefits associated with increased mating and feeding opportunities at this time. Flies were adept at handling very high temperatures under the natural daily temperature fluctuations and availability of shelters, and this can inform more realistic research on the effects of global warming on animals in their natural settings.","output":"Natural history of social and sexual behavior in fruit flies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the classic debates in public opinion, now more prevalent due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been the dilemma between freedom and security. Following a theoretical review, this article sets out to establish the sociodemographic profiles and those variables that can correlate and/or explain the inclination towards one or the other, that is, the dependent variable freedom-security, such as victimization or the assessment of surveillance. The analysis is based on the results of a survey prepared by the Center for Sociological Research (CIS, in Spanish) and administered to a sample of 5,920 Spaniards. The conclusions indicate that the majority inclination is for security, especially among older men, with elementary education attainment level and right-wing ideology. Furthermore, although victimization correlated with the dependent variable, the perception of being a possible victim led to a preference for safety rather than the actual experience of having been a victim. Finally, the positive assessment of surveillance through technologies such as video cameras explains or is strongly associated with security, making it a promising line of research for future work and a means to improve the understanding of the analyzed dilemma.","output":"The Security Versus Freedom Dilemma.

Currently, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the most common analytical tool for RNA quantification. However, in cases of rare transcripts or inhibiting contaminants in the sample, an extensive amplification could bias the copy number estimation, leading to quantification errors and false diagnosis. Single-molecule techniques may bypass amplification but commonly rely on fluorescence detection and probe hybridization, which introduces noise and limits multiplexing. Here, we introduce reverse transcription quantitative nanopore sensing (RT-qNP), an RNA quantification method that involves synthesis and single-molecule detection of gene-specific cDNAs without the need for purification or amplification. RT-qNP allows us to accurately quantify the relative expression of metastasis-associated genes MACC1 and S100A4 in nonmetastasizing and metastasizing human cell lines, even at levels for which RT-qPCR quantification produces uncertain results. We further demonstrate the versatility of the method by adapting it to quantify severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA against a human reference gene. This internal reference circumvents the need for producing a calibration curve for each measurement, an imminent requirement in RT-qPCR experiments. In summary, we describe a general method to process complicated biological samples with minimal losses, adequate for direct nanopore sensing. Thus, harnessing the sensitivity of label-free single-molecule counting, RT-qNP can potentially detect minute expression levels of RNA biomarkers or viral infection in the early stages of disease and provide accurate amplification-free quantification.","output":"Quantification of mRNA Expression Using Single-Molecule Nanopore Sensing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Although heavyweight (HW) or lightweight (LW) polypropylene (PP) meshes are widely used for hernia repair, other alternatives have recently appeared.

This study compares the long-term (3 and 6 months) behavior of meshes of different pore size (HW compared with LW) and composition (PP compared with PTFE). METHODS Partial defects were created in the lateral wall of the abdomen in New Zealand White rabbits and then repaired by the use of a HW or LW PP mesh or a new monofilament, large-pore PTFE mesh (Infinit). At 90 and 180 days after implantation, tissue incorporation, gene and protein expression of neocollagens (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction/immunofluorescence), macrophage response (immunohistochemistry), and biomechanical strength were determined. Shrinkage was measured at 90 days. RESULTS All three meshes induced good host tissue ingrowth, yet the macrophage response was significantly greater in the PTFE implants (P < .05). Collagen 1/3 mRNA levels failed to vary at 90 days yet in the longer term, the LW meshes showed the reduced genetic expression of both collagens (P < .05) accompanied by increased neocollagen deposition, indicating more efficient mRNA translation. After 90-180 days of implant, tensile strengths and elastic modulus values were similar for all 3 implants (P > .05). CONCLUSION Host collagen deposition is mesh pore size dependent whereas the macrophage response induced is composition dependent with a greater response shown by PTFE.

However, most of the previous findings mainly focused on its indirect effect in inhibiting the advanced glycation end products. Here, besides glycemic control, we also demonstrated a stimulatory role of liraglutide in promoting autophagy and relieving oxidative stress in Zucker diabetic fatty(ZDF) rats. The renoprotective effect of liraglutide has been demonstrated by significantly decreasing urinary albumin (P<0.01) and ameliorating renal pathological changes (P<0.001) in vivo. Besides that, proliferation of Hkc8 and HEK293 cells have been increased after treating with exendin-4, a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Moreover, the GLP-1 could positively improve the progression of autophagy in vivo and in vitro through regulating the autophagy-related protein LC3 and P62 via AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. Simultaneously, it could reverse Nrf2 translocation into the nuclei, then suppress oxidative stress.

To assess whether workers in occupations with high COVID-19-related mortality were also most likely to file Cal/OSHA complaints, we compared industry-specific per-capita COVID-19 confirmed deaths from the California Department of Public Health with COVID-19-related complaints. Although 7,820 COVID-19-related complaints were deemed valid by Cal/OSHA, only 627 onsite inspections occurred and 32 citations were issued.

The more eastern the island the worse the measure is. Papua and Maluku suffer more from such conditions compared to the other big islands. As the government has applied any containment measures the surge in COVID-19 cases may potentially worsen both the existing households under severe food insecurity and even create new households under such conditions.","output":"The household food insecurity amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an essential treatment for severe mental illnesses such as depression with suicidality and catatonia.

A centre-based format is a known barrier, suggesting that home-based programmes might improve accessibility. The aim of SCOT: Rehabilitation EnAblement in CHronic Heart Failure (REACH-HF) is to assess the implementation of the REACH-HF home-based CR intervention in the context of the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland. This paper presents the design and protocol for this observational implementation study. Specific objectives of SCOT:REACH-HF are to: (1) assess service-level facilitators and barriers to the implementation of REACH-HF; (2) compare real-world patient and caregiver outcomes to those seen in a prior clinical trial; and (3) estimate the economic (health and social) impact of implementing REACH-HF in Scotland. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The REACH-HF intervention will be delivered in partnership with four Beacon sites across six NHS Scotland Health Boards, covering rural and urban areas. Health professionals from each site will be trained to facilitate delivery of the 12-week programme to 140 people with heart failure and their caregivers. Patient and caregiver outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 4-month follow-up. Assessments include the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), five-dimension EuroQol 5L, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Caregiver Burden Questionnaire. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with up to 20 health professionals involved in programme delivery (eg, cardiac nurses, physiotherapists). 65 facilitator-patient consultations will be audio recorded and assessed for fidelity. Integrative analysis will address key research questions on fidelity, context and CR participant-related outcomes. The SCOT:REACH-HF findings will inform the future potential roll-out of REACH-HF in Scotland. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been given ethical approval by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Service (reference 20/WS/0038, approved 25 March 2020). Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The study is listed on the ISRCTN registry with study ID ISRCTN53784122. The research team will ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with both General Data Protection Regulations and the University of Glasgows Research Governance Framework. Findings will be reported to the funder and shared with Beacon Sites, to facilitate service evaluation, planning and good practice. To broaden interest in, and understanding of REACH-HF, we will seek to publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals and present at stakeholder events, national and international conferences.","output":"Protocol for an implementation study of an evidence-based home cardiac rehabilitation programme for people with heart failure and their caregivers in Scotland (SCOT:REACH-HF)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study Objective To evaluate the effect of using patient specific 3D printed anatomical models in pre-surgical planning for patients with uterine fibroids. Design Repeated measures questionnaire study. Setting Tertiary academic hospital. Patients or Participants Minimally invasive gynecologic surgeons. Interventions Surgeons completed a questionnaire documenting their surgical plan, perceived surgical difficulty, and confidence in surgical approach before and after receiving a patient specific 3D printed model derived from standard of care pelvic MRI. 3D models had uterine fibroids printed in opaque magenta, endometrium in cyan, and non-neoplastic anatomy (myometrium and cervix) was printed as clear resin to maximize visualisation of underlying lesions. A post-operative questionnaire rated the surgeons experience using the 3D models. Measurements and Main Results Five surgeries (4 open myomectomy; 1 laparoscopic hysterectomy) were completed. One staff surgeon and one/two surgical fellow(s) participated in each case (N=11). After viewing the models, perceived surgical difficulty increased in 5, decreased in 1, and did not change in 5 surgeon responses. The average allotted surgical time changed by 50mins and anticipated blood loss by 120cc. Anticipated intra-operative complications changed in 7/11 plans corresponding with a change in planned hemostatic techniques to be used in 6/11 plans. Increased confidence in planned approach was reported in 7/11 surgeon responses. Intra-operative reference changed the operative course in 3/5 surgeries. On average, surgeons rated their experience 8.3/10 for pre-surgical planning, 8.0/10 for intra-operative reference (10=greatest experience), and 7/11 surgeon responses indicated that the models were perceived to have a positive impact on surgical outcomes. Conclusion The use of patient specific 3D printed models altered the surgeons perception of surgical difficulty, planned hemostatic techniques, and perceived risk for surgical complications when creating their pre-operative plan. By increasing their understanding of complex anatomy, surgeons reported greater confidence in their pre-operative plan when using 3D models, thus optimizing surgical decision making and improve patient outcomes.","output":"Pre-Surgical Planning Using Patient-Specific 3D Printed Anatomical Models for Women with Uterine Fibroids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is expected to last for an extended time, making strict safety precautions for office procedures unavoidable.

However, these vaccines are designed against SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Wuhan, China, and thereby may not be effective against other SARS-CoV-2 variants such as the United Kingdom variant (VUI-202012/01). The UK SARS-CoV-2 variant possesses D614G mutation in the Spike protein, which impart it a high rate of infection. Therefore, newer strategies are warranted to design novel vaccines and drug candidates specifically designed against the mutated forms of SARS-CoV-2. One such strategy is to target ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme2)-Spike protein RBD (receptor binding domain) interaction. Here, we generated a homology model of Spike protein RBD of SARS-CoV-2 UK strain and screened a marine seaweed database employing different computational approaches. On the basis of high-throughput virtual screening, standard precision, and extra precision molecular docking, we identified BE011 (Dieckol) as the most potent compounds against RBD. However, Dieckol did not display drug-like properties, and thus different derivatives of it were generated in silico and evaluated for binding potential and drug-like properties. One Dieckol derivative (DK07) displayed good binding affinity for RBD along with acceptable physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, drug-likeness, and ADMET properties. Analysis of the RBD-DK07 interaction suggested the formation of hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions with key residues mediating the ACE2-RBD interaction. Molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the stability of the RBD-DK07 complex. Free energy calculations suggested the primary role of electrostatic and Van der Waals' interaction in stabilizing the RBD-DK07 complex. Thus, DK07 may be developed as a potential inhibitor of the RBD-ACE2 interaction.

The management of panic health and on-time evacuation prevents COVID-19 infection incidences in educational institutions and public places. Therefore, a system is required to predict the infection and suggests a safe evacuation path to people that control panic scenarios with mortality. In this paper, a fog-assisted cyber physical system is introduced to control panic attacks and COVID-19 infection risk in public places. The proposed model uses the concept of physical and cyber space. The physical space helps in real time data collection and transmission of the alert generation to the stakeholders. Cyberspace consists of two spaces, fog space, and cloud-space. The fog-space facilitates panic health and COVID-19 symptoms determination with alert generation for risk-affected areas. Cloud space monitors and predicts the persons panic health and symptoms using the SARIMA model. Furthermore, it also identifies risk-prone regions in the affected place using Geographical Population Analysis. The performance evaluation acknowledges the efficiency related to panic health determination and prediction based on the SARIMA with risks mapping accuracy.

A surface spike (S) protein guides MERS-CoV entry into host cells by binding to cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), followed by fusion between virus and host cell membranes. MERS-CoV S protein represents a key target for developing therapeutics to block viral entry and inhibit membrane fusion. Areas covered: This review illustrates MERS-CoV S protein's structure and function, particularly S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and S2 heptad repeat 1 (HR1) as therapeutic targets, and summarizes current advancement on developing anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics, focusing on neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antiviral peptides. Expert opinion: No anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic is approved for human use. Several S-targeting neutralizing mAbs and peptides have demonstrated efficacy against MERS-CoV infection, providing feasibility for development. Generally, human neutralizing mAbs targeting RBD are more potent than those targeting other regions of S protein. However, emergence of escape mutant viruses and mAb's limitations make it necessary for combining neutralizing mAbs recognizing different neutralizing epitopes and engineering them with improved efficacy and reduced cost. Optimization of the peptide sequences is expected to produce next-generation anti-MERS-CoV peptides with improved potency.","output":"MERS-CoV spike protein: a key target for antivirals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Data on biochemical markers and their association with mortality rates observed in patients with severe COVID-19 disease admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in sub-Saharan Africa are scanty.

Viral pneumonia, telehealth, and the rising incidence of heart failure (HF) have driven the need for objective measures for wellness and congestion. Misclassification of congestion and delay in diuretics have been a concern by cardiologists across a variety of health care settings. We report the likelihood of a bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) measurement, specifically the Heart Failure Index (HF-Dex), to match patient perceived change since previous clinic visit. Background : BIS provides an objective measure of fluid levels. A recent publication reported the median HF-Dex value for patients with HF was 48.8%, in comparison to a healthy population whose median HF-Dex was 44.8%. Further research showed that HF patients with a value >51% had an odds ratio (OR) of 4.25 for readmission within 45 days. Methods : Fifty-six (56) HF patients were enrolled, during the Covid-19 pandemic, at their routine HF clinic appointment. Perceived change in status since last visit was reported as either no change, improved, or worsening symptoms. We assessed medication changes at time of clinic visit. HF-Dex values were obtained but were not made available to the treating physician. Based on a healthy control value of 44.8%, we applied a 45% threshold below which patients were considered stable from an HF perspective. A cut-point of 51% was used to determine the likelihood of medication changes and diuretic up dosing in the current study. Results : Seven (7) of 56 patients had an HF-Dex of 45% or below; none of these patients had an intensification of diuretic dosing or reported worsening symptoms. Twenty-one (21) patients had a measure of 51% or more, of whom 6 reported worsening symptoms prior to their exam for an odds ratio (OR) of 6.6 (95%CI: 1.2-36, p=0.03). The OR for any medication change in the 51% group of HF patients was 4.5 (95%CI: 1.1-18, p=0.03). Looking strictly at diuretic change, there was an OR of 3.6 (95%CI: 1.1-12.0, p=0.03). Conclusions : BIS measures provide a unique objective data point to aid in pretest probability for congestion. Patients with a HF-Dex of 51% required higher rates of medication and diuretic changes. Subjectively, HF patients at 51% also felt worse which may help limit misclassification of congestion when SOB is the chief complaint. Conversely, patients at <45% had fewer diuretic dose changes and felt better overall. The ability to quantify congestion may assist in triage of patients presenting with SOB, as has increasingly been the case during the Covid-19 pandemic in clinic and acute care settings.","output":"Bioimpedance Spectroscopy Offers An Objective Measure Of Heart Failure Stability During A Viral Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: Background: The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus has been sustained in China since December 2019, and could become a pandemic if we do not contain it. The mental health of frontline medical staff is a concern. In this study, we aimed to identify the influencing factors on medical worker anxiety in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of anxiety among medical staff from 10th February 2020 to 20th February 2020 in China using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, using the criteria of normal ([a?]49), mild (50-59), moderate (60-70) and severe anxiety ([a?]70). We used multivariable linear regression to determine the factors (e.g., having direct contact treating infected patients, being a medical staff worker from Hubei province, being a suspect case) for anxiety. We also used adjusted models to confirm independent factors for anxiety after adjusting for gender, age, education and marital status. Results: Of 512 medical staff from China, 164 healthcare workers (32.03%) had had direct contact by treating infected patients. The prevalence of anxiety was 12.5%, with 53 workers suffering from mild (10.35%), seven workers from moderate (1.36%) and four workers from severe anxiety (0.78%). After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, education and marital status), medical staff who had had direct contact treating infected patients saw higher anxiety scores than those who had not had direct contact ({beta}value=2.33, CI: 0.65 -4.00; p=0.0068).

The current phase of the plan has a focus on energy generation from coal and a slowing down of renewables or Renewable energy curtailment of approximately 400 T Wh renewables including 300 T Wh of non-hydro power, principally from Guangdong, and Jiangsu for transfer of hydropower and Zhejiang, Tianjin, Henan for non-hydro power transfer with Beijing and Shanghai playing important roles in renewables energy curtailment and realignment using an integrated approach to optimize each provinces energy portfolio. The realignment of the renewable energy portfolio indicates that the newly installed capacity in Sichuan, Yunnan, Inner Mongolia, and Zhejiang will account for less than 20 % of the current renewable energy portfolio but with the NO(x) SO(x) and PM(2.5) savings already accrued. The catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide to methanol (70 / 110 million metric tons from all sources in 2019 for China/world) is one technological approach to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions and suggests that catalytic methanol synthesis by CO(2) hydrogenation may be a plausible approach, even if it is more expensive economically than methanol synthesis by the syngas approach. This is because the CO(2) emissions of the synthesis are lower than other synthesis methodologies. The Chinese government has placed a premium on cleaner air and water and may view such an approach as solving the dual issues of fuel substitution and reduction of CO(2). Thus, the coupling of hydrogen generation from sustainable energies sources (Solar 175 / 509 GW) or wind (211/591.5 GW in 2019) may be an attractive approach, as this requires slightly less water than coal gasification. Due to the thermodynamic requirement of lower operating pressure and higher operating pressure, currently, there is no single operational approach, although some practice approaches (220 C at 48 atm using copper) and zinc oxide/alumina are suggested for optimal performance.","output":"Electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel cells to demonstrate China's renewable energy renewable portfolio standards within the framework of the 13th five-year plan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel SARS\\\\CoV2 has disrupted health systems and the economy, and public health interventions to slow its spread have been costly.

CTH workers estimated that the likelihood of their already being infected with COVID-19 to be 21.5  24.7% as compared to the 15.3  19.5% estimate of NCTH workers (p = 0.0001). 50% (545/1099) of the CTH workers and 51% (168/330) of the NCTH workers responded that the most important cause of their stress was a fear of infecting their families (p = 0.7). CONCLUSIONS: By multivariable analysis the creation of a NCTH during the COVID-19 pandemic was not found to be associated with a decrease in the number of hospital workers with clinical anxiety.

Despite landmark medical advancements, mortality due to cardiovascular disease is still 20 times higher in CKD patients than in the general population, which is mainly due to the high prevalence of risk factors in this group. Indeed, in addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, CKD patients are exposed to nontraditional ones, which include metabolic, hormonal, and inflammatory alterations. The global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has brought novel challenges for both cardiologists and nephrologists alike. Emerging evidence indicates that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases the risk of cardiovascular events and that several aspects of the disease may synergize with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors in CKD patients. A better understanding of these mechanisms is pivotal for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular events in this context, and we believe that additional clinical and experimental studies are needed to improve cardiovascular outcomes in CKD patients with COVID-19. In this review, we provide a summary of traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors in CKD patients, discussing their interaction with SARS-CoV-2 infection and focusing on CO-VID-19-related cardiovascular complications that may severely affect short- and long-term outcomes in this high-risk population.","output":"COVID-19 in Chronic Kidney Disease: The Impact of Old and Novel Cardiovascular Risk Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oxide nano-springs have attracted many research interests because of their anti-corrosion, high-temperature tolerance, oxidation resistance, and enhanced-mechanic-response from unique helix structures, enabling various nano-manipulators, nano-motors, nano-switches, sensors, and energy harvesters. However, preparing oxide nano-springs is a challenge for their intrinsic lack of elasticity. Here, we developed an approach for preparing self-assembled, epitaxial, ferroelectric nano-springs with built-in strain due to the lattice mismatch in freestanding La0.7 Sr0.3 MnO3 /BaTiO3 (LSMO/BTO) bilayer heterostructures. We find that these LSMO/BTO nano-springs can be extensively pulled or pushed up to their geometry limits back and forth without breaking, exhibiting super-scalability with full recovery capability. The phase-field simulations reveal that the excellent scalability originates from the continuous ferroelastic domain structures, resulting from twisting under co-existing axial and shear strains. In addition, the oxide hetero-structural springs exhibit strong resilience due to the limited plastic deformation nature and the built-in strain between the bilayers. This discovery provides an alternative way for preparing and operating functional oxide nano-springs that can be applied to various technologies. This article is protected by copyright.

One method to enable the inclusion of this study population in emergency research is through recruitment without prior consent, often known as deferred consent. However, empirical studies have shown a large disparity in stakeholders opinions regarding this enrolment method. This systematic review aimed to understand different stakeholder groups attitudes to deferred consent, particularly in relation to the context in which deferred consent might occur. METHODS: Databases including MEDLINE, EMCare, PsychINFO, Scopus, and HMIC were searched from 1996 to January 2021. Eligible studies focussed on deferred consent processes for adults only, in the English language, and reported empirical primary research. Studies of all designs were included. Relevant data were extracted and thematically coded using a narrative approach to tell a story of the findings. RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were included in the narrative synthesis. The majority examined patient views (n = 19). Data from the members of the public (n = 5) and health care professionals (n =5) were also reported. Four overarching themes were identified: level of acceptability of deferred consent, research-related factors influencing acceptability, personal characteristics influencing views on deferred consent, and data use after refusal of consent or participant death. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that the use of deferred consent would be most acceptable to stakeholders during low-risk emergency research with a narrow therapeutic window and where there is potential for patients to benefit from their inclusion. While the use of narrative synthesis allowed assessment of the included studies, heterogeneous outcome measures meant that variations in study results could not be reliably attributed to the different trial characteristics. Future research should aim to develop guidance for research ethics committees when reviewing trials using deferred consent in emergency research and investigate more fully the views of healthcare professionals which to date have been explored less than patients and members of the public.

Considering the current pandemic, it's important to understand how COVID-19 impacts individuals with SCD, a medically vulnerable population. We sought to identify factors associated with more severe COVID-19 illness and hospitalization in the SCD population. We established the international SECURE-SCD Registry to collect COVID-19 data in SCD patients. Providers were instructed to report confirmed COVID-19 cases after the disease course was known. Providers reported demographics, prior SCD complications and COVID-19 related hospitalization, severity/management strategies and death. Data were without protected health information. We used multivariable models to estimate the independent effects of age, sex, genotype, SCD-related and non-related comorbidities grouped by organ systems on the outcomes of severe COVID-19 and hospitalization. We defined the pain variable as 0, 1-2 or >2 prior acute care visits (i.e., emergency department visits, hospitalizations) for pain in the last 3 years. As of October 12th, 2020, 366 COVID-19 cases in SCD patients were reported, 41.5% were children and 52.7% were female. Acute pain was the most common presenting symptom of COVID-19 in SCD patients (54.6%), followed by pneumonia (27.0%). Children who had more than 2 acute care visits for pain had a more severe course of COVID-19 (OR=3.964, 95% CI (1.420, 11.065), p=0.03) and required hospitalization (OR=4.641, 95% CI (1.976, 10.900), p=0.006). Children who had 1-2 acute care visits for pain showed no significant association with COVID-19 severity (p=0.73) or hospitalization (p=0.82). In adults, there was no association between with history of frequent SCD pain and COVID outcomes. Pain is the most common presenting symptom of COVID-19 in SCD patients.

Social isolation and the use of personal protective equipment - the latter being especially important for health care workers - emerged as two of the main methods of preventing the spread of the disease. The eye can represent a source of transmission through contaminated tears, as well as a source of infection for respiratory droplets or aerosol particles, which may come into contact with the ocular surface and migrate to the lungs and other parts of the body. Objectives: To investigate the risk of ocular transmission through a literature review and identify ways of preventing it. Methods: A search of the scientific literature was conducted in the PubMed and Cochrane databases, using a combination of the following keywords: COVID-19, eye, personal protective equipment, SARS-CoV-2, protective goggles, face shields, and workers' health. Results: The mechanisms of ocular transmission have not been fully elucidated, but studies have demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in the conjunctival sac and aerosolized secretions of contaminated patients;these droplets may come into contact with the eyes of uninfected bystanders, entering the respiratory system through the nose and gaining access to the lungs. Conclusions: Studies show that the virus can be effectively transmitted through the eyes, underscoring the importance of protective goggles for health care workers or potential transmitters of the virus, in addition to the need for additional education measures to encourage hand hygiene and discourage touching of the eyes. ? 2021 Associacao Nacional de Medicina do Trabalho.

A novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been affecting almost all nations around the world. Most infected patients who have been admitted to intensive care units show SARS signs. In this study, we aimed to achieve a better understanding of pathological alterations that take place during the novel coronavirus infection in most presumed affected organs. Methods. We performed postmortem core needle biopsies from lung, heart, and liver on 7 deceased patients who had died of coronavirus disease 2019. Prepared tissue sections were observed by 2 expert pathologists. Results. Diffuse alveolar damage was the main pathologic finding in the lung tissue samples. Patients with hospitalization durations of more than 10 days showed evidence of organization. Multinucleated cells in alveolar spaces and alveolar walls, atypical enlarged cells, accumulation of macrophages in alveolar spaces, and congestion of vascular channels were the other histopathologic alteration of the lung. None of our heart biopsy samples met the criteria for myocarditis. Liver biopsies showed congestion, micro- and macro-vesicular changes, and minimal to mild portal inflammation, in the majority of cases. Conclusions. Similar to the previous coronavirus infection in 2003, the main pathologic finding in the lung was diffuse alveolar damage with a pattern of organization in prolonged cases. The SARS-CoV-2 infection does not cause myocarditis, and the ischemia of myocardium is the most probable justification of the observed pathologic changes in the heart.

Among the comorbidities, obesity may increase the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection as it is related to immune system dysfunction. Since the epidemiological picture of COVID-19 is changing very rapidly. Therefore, it is very important to discuss the pattern of clinical manifestation and association with comorbidities. Hence, we have conducted this observational study in one of the tertiary care centers in North India. Methods and Materials: We conducted a hospital-based prospective observational study in dedicated COVID-19 wards and ICU of a tertiary care center in North India with a sample size of 400 positive patients (males: 260, females: 140). We divided the patients in this study into three different age groups (less than 40 years, 40-60 years, and more than 60 years). The patients with age  18 years and BMI 18.5 kg/m2 were excluded from the study. Results: Out of these 400 patients, 55 (13.8%) developed severe COVID-19. There was a fewer number of patients who developed severe COVID-19 in the normal and over-weight group. Moreover, obese patients progressed to more severe cases (34.5%). This also shows that after adjusting for age, compared to the normal-weight group, those who were overweight had a 1.48-fold chance of developing severe COVID-19 (OR 1.48, P 0.0455), while those who were obese had a 1.73-fold chance of developing the disease (ORs 1.73, P 5 0.0652). Regarding gender distribution, the association appeared to be stronger in men than in women. After similar adjustment, the ORs for overweight and obese patients compared to normal-weight patients were 1.39 (p 0.5870) and 3.55 (p 0.0113) in females and 1.36 (0.5115) and 6.19 (0.0001) in males, respectively. Conclusion: Our study shows that obese patients with a BMI of greater than or equal to 27.5 are at higher risk of developing COVID-19 severity, especially in the male population. Moreover, severity may be related to other comorbid conditions. However, in our study, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and GI/liver diseases were less obese, and severity was relatively low.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred convalescent plasma units were characterized for functionally active SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 neutralizing antibodies, as well as for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 binding antibodies, with the intention to establish a correlation between the functionally more relevant neutralization assay and the more accessible ELISA. Donor demographics such as COVID\\\\19 disease severity, age and sex were correlated with antibody titers. RESULTS: A mean neutralization titer 50% of 1:230 (range < 1:8 C 1:1765) was seen for the 100 convalescent plasma units, with highly significant (p < 0.0001), yet quantitatively limited (R(2) = 0.2830) correlation with results of the ELISA. Exclusion of units with particularly high titers (>1:500) from analysis improved correlation (R(2) = 0.5386). A tendency of higher titer plasma units from donors with increased disease severity, advanced age and of male sex was seen, yet the functional relevance of this difference is questionable. CONCLUSION: The ELISA\\\\based correlation to neutralization titer enabled a threshold proposal that could be used to eliminate lower titer units from the clinical supply for COVID\\\\19 treatment.

In this study, our objectives were to determine if infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) upregulates expression of the B cell differentiation factors A proliferation inducing ligand (APRIL) and B cell activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF), if this is a common feature of viral airway infection, and how this is regulated in human airway epithelial cells. METHODS We measured BAFF and APRIL protein expression in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from infants with severe RSV disease, and healthy control children, and in nasopharyngeal aspirates from preschool children with other single respiratory viral infections. We also measured mRNA expression in bronchial brushings from RSV-infected infants, and in RSV-infected paediatric primary airway epithelial cell cultures (pAEC). Beas-2B cell cultures were used to examine mechanisms regulating BAFF expression. RESULTS BAFF protein and mRNA were elevated (in marked contrast with APRIL) in BAL and bronchial brushings, respectively, from RSV-infected infants. BAFF protein was also found in upper airway secretions from children with human metapneumovirus, H1N1, bocavirus, rhinovirus, RSV and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. BAFF mRNA and protein were expressed following in vitro RSV infection of both pAEC and Beas-2B cultures, with mRNA expression peaking 12-h postinfection. BAFF induction was blocked by addition of a neutralising anti-interferon- antibody or palivizumab. CONCLUSIONS BAFF, produced through an interferon--dependent process, is a consistent feature of airway infection, and suggests a role for the airway epithelia in supporting protective antibody and B cell responses in the lung.","output":"Respiratory syncytial virus infection of airway epithelial cells, in vivo and in vitro, supports pulmonary antibody responses by inducing expression of the B cell differentiation factor BAFF."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether common otolaryngology procedures generate viable aerosolized virus through a murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV) model for infection. STUDY DESIGN: mCMV model of infection. SETTING: University of Utah laboratory. METHODS: Three-day-old BALB/c mice were inoculated with mCMV or saline. Five days later, each mouse underwent drilling, microdebrider, coblation, and electrocautery procedures. Particle size distribution and PM2.5 (particulate matter <2.5 m) concentration were determined with a scanning mobility particle sizer and an aerosol particle sizer in the range of 15 nm to 32 m. Aerosolized samples from these procedures were collected with an Aerosol Devices BioSpot sampler for viral titer based on polymerase chain reaction and for viable virus through viral culture. RESULTS: As compared with the background aerosol concentrations, coblation and electrocautery showed statistically significant increases in airborne aerosols (Tukey-adjusted P value <.040), while microdebrider and drilling at 30,000 rpm did not (.870 < Tukey-adjusted P value < .930). We identified viral DNA in samples from coblation and drilling procedures, although we did not identify viable viruses in aerosol samples from any of the 4 procedures. CONCLUSION: Coblation and electrocautery procedures generate >100-fold increases in aerosol concentrations over background; only coblation and drilling produce aerosolized viral DNA. The high concentration of aerosols from coblation and electrocautery suggests the need for appropriate safeguards against particle exposure to health care workers. The presence of viral DNA from drilling and coblation procedures warrants the need for appropriate protection against droplet and aerosol exposure.","output":"Airborne Aerosolized Mouse Cytomegalovirus From Common Otolaryngology Procedures: Implications for COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the outset and during the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, as valuable resources are channeled to combat the pandemic, challenges in timely delivery of non-COVID-19-related health care services such as endovascular service arise.

In the present study, we conducted a literature review about the potential infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in different biological tissues and the influence of various tissue processing and sterilization procedures on viral inactivation. The search revealed that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor to penetrate human cells. These receptors are present in skin cells, musculoskeletal tissue, amniotic membranes, cardiovascular tissue and ocular tissues, including the cornea. In general, we found that coronaviruses are stable at low temperatures, and inactivated upon exposure to extreme heat and pH. Notably, gamma irradiation, which has already been employed to inactivate SARS and MERS, could be useful for sterilizing skin, amnion and musculoskeletal tissues against SARS-CoV-2.

Participants All patients with a positive covid-19 test from 1st October 2020 to 3rd May 2021 who attended A&E from three days before to ten days after the date of the test. All patients who were admitted or died on the same or following day to the first A&E attendance within the time window were excluded. Interventions Participants enrolled onto CO@h were matched using demographic and clinical criteria to participants who were not enrolled. Main outcome measures Five outcome measures were examined within 28 days of first A&E attendance: i) death from any cause; ii) any subsequent A&E attendance; iii) any emergency hospital admission; iv) critical care admission; and v) length of stay. Results 15,621 participants were included in the primary analysis, of whom 639 were enrolled onto CO@h and 14,982 were controls.

METHODS: Two milliliters of air were injected supero-laterally at extra- and intra-articular positions of a cadaveric knee joint, using needles of size 18, 21 and 24 gauge (G). Ultrasonography was used to confirm the positions of needle tip. A piezoelectric accelerometer was mounted medially on the knee joint to collect the vibration signals which were analyzed to characterize the frequency components of the signals during injections. RESULTS: The vibration frequency band power in the range of 500C1500 Hz was visually observed to potentially localize the needle tip placement during air injection whether they were at the knee extra-articular or intra-articular positions, as demonstrated by the higher band power (over ? 40 dB or dB) for all the needle sizes. The differences of frequency band power between extra- and intra-articular positions were 18.1 dB, 26.4 dB and 39.2 dB for the needle size 18G, 21G and 24G respectively.

We defined being up to date for CRC screening as having completed a fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) within the previous 2 years, or having a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy in the previous 5 years before the survey. We analyzed data using multivariable logistic regression models.

No study has correlated MPD size and malignancy considering the anatomic site of the gland (head versus body-tail). Our aim was to analyze the significance of MPD in pancreatic head/body-tail as a predictor of malignancy in main-duct/mixed IPMNs. METHODS Retrospective analysis of resected patients between 2009-2018. Malignancy was defined as high-grade dysplasia and invasive carcinoma. MPD diameter was measured with magnetic resonance imaging. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was utilized to identify optimal MPD cut-off for malignancy. Independent predictors of malignancy were searched. RESULTS Malignancy was detected in 74% of 312 identified patients. 213 patients (68.3%) had IPMNs of the pancreatic head and 99 (31.7%) of the body-tail. ROC analysis identified 9 and 7 mm as the optimal MPD cut-offs for malignancy in IPMNs of head and body-tail of the pancreas, respectively. Multivariate analysis confirmed that MPD 9 mm (pancreatic head), and 7 mm (body-tail) were independent predictors of malignancy along with macroscopic solid components, positive cytology and elevated CA 19-9. The risk of malignancy was low for IPMNs with MPD 8 mm (pancreatic head) or 6 mm (pancreatic body-tail) unless high-risk stigmata or multiple worrisome features were present. CONCLUSIONS Different thresholds of MPD dilation are associated with malignancy in IPMNs of the head and body-tail of the pancreas. The risk of malignancy for IPMNs with MPD 8 mm (pancreatic head) or 6 mm (pancreatic body-tail) lacking high-risk stigmata or multiple worrisome features is low.","output":"Main Duct Thresholds For Malignancy Are Different In Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms Of The Pancreatic Head And Body-Tail."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on trajectories in cardiometabolic health, physical activity and functioning among U.S. older adults, overall and according to selected baseline socio-demographic characteristics. METHODS: We performed secondary analyses using longitudinal data on 1,372 participants from the 2006-2020 Health and Retirement Study. Pre-post COVID-19 pandemic onset was examined in relation to body mass index (BMI), number of cardiometabolic risk factors and/or chronic conditions, physical activity, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) using mixed-effects regression models and group-based trajectory models. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with significantly increased BMI (=1.39, 95% CI: 0.74, 2.03). Furthermore, the odds of having at least one cardiometabolic risk factor and/or chronic disease increased pre-post COVID-19 onset (OR 1.16, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.36), whereas physical functioning worsened pre-post COVID-19 onset (ADL: =1.11, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.28; IADL: =0.59, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.73).

With the advent of data-sharing, computational approaches have gained a key role in evaluating future scenarios. To design optimal social, hospitalization and economical strategies that guarantee control over the pandemic progression, we developed a data-driven modelling framework with the aim to provide reliable near future predictions under constantly evolving social and pandemic conditions. The framework is flexible enough to be used at a single hospital, regional or national level. We used a variety of data such as social, serological, testing and clinical data to compute the infection dynamics and the hospital workload for France. We developed inference methods to calibrate model parameters from observed hospitalization statistics over adjustable time periods. We applied our model to study the age stratified pandemic evolution inside and outside hospitals until February 2021, and the competition between vaccinations and the novel delta variant. We obtained several predictions about hidden pandemic properties such as fractions of infected, infection hospitality and infection fatality ratios. We show that reproduction numbers and herd immunity levels are not universal but strongly depend on the underlying social dynamics.

However in the USA, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been politically polarized. The objective of this study is to investigate the association between political partisanship and COVID-19 deaths rates in the USA. METHODS: This study used longitudinal county-level panel data, segmented into 10 30-day time periods, consisting of all counties in the USA, from 22 January 2020 to 5 December 2020. The outcome measure is the total number of COVID-19 deaths per 30-day period. The key explanatory variable is county political partisanship, dichotomized as Democratic or Republican. The analysis used a ZINB regression. RESULTS: When compared with Republican counties, COVID-19 death rates in Democratic counties were significantly higher (IRRs ranged from 2.0 to 18.3, P < 0.001) in Time 1-Time 5, but in Time 9-Time10, were significantly lower (IRRs ranged from 0.43 to 0.69, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The reversed trend in COVID-19 death rates between Democratic and Republican counties was influenced by the political polarized response to the pandemic.

We investigated an initially unnoticed SARS-CoV-2 outbreak linked to schools in northern France, beginning as early as mid-January 2020. AIMS: This retrospective observational study documents the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, linked to an affected high school (n = 664 participants) and primary schools (n = 1,340 study participants), in the context of unsuspected SARS-CoV-2 circulation and limited control measures. METHODS: Between 30 March and 30 April 2020, all school staff, as well as pupils and their parents and relatives were invited for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and to complete a questionnaire covering symptom history since 13 January 2020. RESULTS: In the high school, infection attack rates were 38.1% (91/239), 43.4% (23/53), and 59.3% (16/27), in pupils, teachers, and non-teaching staff respectively vs 10.1% (23/228) and 12.0% (14/117) in the pupils parents and relatives (p < 0.001). Among the six primary schools, three children attending separate schools at the outbreak start, while symptomatic, might have introduced SARS-CoV-2 there, but symptomatic secondary cases related to them could not be definitely identified. In the primary schools overall, antibody prevalence in pupils sharing classes with symptomatic cases was higher than in pupils from other classes: 15/65 (23.1%) vs 30/445 (6.7%) (p < 0.001). Among 46 SARS-CoV-2 seropositive pupils < 12 years old, 20 were asymptomatic.

It could be hypothesized that immunodeficient patients, due to immunosuppressive drugs or their disease, have a more severe disease course due to their immunocompromised state. However, it could also be hypothesized that some of the immunosuppressive drugs protect against a hyperinflammatory state. Methods: We collected data on the incidence of COVID-19, disease course and SARS-CoV-2 antibody formation in COVID-19 positive patients in a cohort of patients (n= 4497) known at the Clinical Immunology outpatient clinic in a tertiary care hospital in the Netherlands. Results: In the first six months of the pandemic, 16 patients were identified with COVID-19, 14 by nasal swab PCR, and 2 patients by SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Eight patients were admitted to the hospital. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured in 8 patients and were detectable in all, including one patient on B-cell ablative therapy and one patient with Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorder. Conclusion: This study indicates that the disease course differs among immunocompromised patients, independently of (dis)continuation of immunosuppressive drugs.

Judo, a close-contact sport, demands careful prevention with great consideration to the risk of infection. The All Japan Judo Federation Medical Science Committee (AJJF) designed COVID-19 prevention protocols from a medical perspective and developed policies for safe regular practices and tournaments. Objective and Methods We aim to examine the efficacy of health surveys and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests prior to judo tournaments, as mandated by the tournament policy. Infection prevention managers were installed prior to tournaments. Two weeks prior to each tournament, these managers drafted health inventory forms for athletes and related parties to check for COVID-19-associated symptoms. Although PCR testing prior to tournaments was not required by policy, the AJJF conducted them (directly and by mail) prior to six tournaments from October 2020 to September 2021 for athletes whose health inventory forms listed no symptoms. Results One of the athletes was not tested and was unable to participate in a tournament due to the symptoms indicated in their health inventory form. Testing began in October 2020 and was conducted until September 2021 for 2,073 athletes over the duration of six tournaments. The SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in 11 (0.29%) athletes. In tournaments held until April 2021, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in only one of the 1,173 (0.08%) athletes tested. However, prior to tournaments held from July 2021 onward, when variants became prevalent, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 10 (1.1%) of the 900 athletes tested (p < 0.05). No clusters were reported in association with any tournament. Conclusion We believe that drafting health inventory forms two weeks prior to judo tournaments was essential and kept the participants alert. However, as variants emerged, some participants who were positive could not be detected through their inventory forms; this demonstrates the need for caution when relying on health inventory forms alone.","output":"The Efficacy of Health Surveys and Polymerase Chain Reaction Tests Prior to Judo Tournaments During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to compare the efficacy after switching from either bisphosphonates (BPs) or non-BPs (NBPs) to combination therapies of denosumab (DMAb) or zoledronic acid (Zol) with eldecalcitol (ELD) in bone mineral density (BMD) and bone metabolism and investigate the prognostic and risk factors of side effects of this therapy.

The present study aims to investigate the assimilation of digital health by family physicians, going beyond the simple adoption of these technologies to further understand the breadth and depth of their use in clinical practice for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease, and for the monitoring of chronically-ill patients. Methods: : The study was designed as an online survey. After conducting a pre-test of the questionnaire instrument, an invitation to participate in the study was sent to 7,664 members of the Quebec Federation of General Practitioners. The online questionnaire was developed on the Qualtrics survey platform. Data was collected from 768 family physicians, representing a 10% response rate. Results: : Findings show that a large majority of the sampled physicians have yet to assimilate digital health within their medical practice. This is true in terms of both the physicians not incorporating digital health technologies into their routine work patterns and their not using these technologies to their full potential. The minority of respondents who showed a somewhat higher level of assimilation were motivated by patients greater requests related to digital health (e.g. for online consultations) and a greater chronic care caseload, and are characterized by their greater need for digital health training and their younger age, and use an EMR system that includes more functionalities (e.g. pharmaceutical advisers/prescribers). Conclusions: : This study has policy implications in terms of the need for greater motivation and training of family physicians in order for them to make more extensive and innovative use of digital health technologies in their medical practice, for greater interoperability and integration of the digital health tools made available to them, and for greater awareness of their patients emerging attitudes and behaviors with regards to digital health.

While virus-host interactions are promising targets for antivirals, there is only limited knowledge regarding the interactions of EBOV with cellular host factors. Recently, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen that identified the nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1) as an important host factor for the EBOV life cycle. NXF1 is a major component of the nuclear mRNA export pathway that is usurped by many viruses whose life cycles include nuclear stages. However, the role of NXF1 in the life cycle of EBOV, a virus replicating in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, remains unknown. In order to better understand the role of NXF1 in the EBOV life cycle, we performed a combination of co-immunoprecipitation and double immunofluorescence assays to characterize the interactions of NXF1 with viral proteins and RNAs. Additionally, using siRNA-mediated knockdown of NXF1 together with functional assays, we analyzed the role of NXF1 in individual aspects of the virus life cycle. With this approach we identified the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) as a viral interaction partner of NXF1. Further studies revealed that NP interacts with the RNA-binding domain of NXF1 and competes with RNA for this interaction. Co-localization studies showed that RNA binding-deficient, but not wildtype NXF1, accumulates in NP-derived inclusion bodies, and knockdown experiments demonstrated that NXF1 is necessary for viral protein expression, but not for viral RNA synthesis. Finally, our results showed that NXF1 interacts with viral mRNAs, but not with viral genomic RNAs. Based on these results we suggest a model whereby NXF1 is recruited into inclusion bodies to promote the export of viral mRNA:NXF1 complexes from these sites. This would represent a novel function for NXF1 in the life cycle of cytoplasmically replicating viruses, and may provide a basis for new therapeutic approaches against EBOV, and possibly other emerging viruses.","output":"The Ebola Virus Nucleoprotein Recruits the Nuclear RNA Export Factor NXF1 into Inclusion Bodies to Facilitate Viral Protein Expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) is a common clinical dilemma. We sought to assess the diagnostic value of four ictal signs commonly used in differentiating PNES from epileptic seizures (ES). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive adult video-electroencephalogram (VEM) studies conducted at a single tertiary epilepsy center between May 2009 and August 2016. Each event was assessed by a blinded rater for the presence of four signs: fluctuating course, head shaking, hip thrusting, and back arching. The final diagnosis of PNES or ES was established for each event based on clinical and VEM characteristics. All ES were pooled regardless of focal or generalized onset. We analyzed the odds ratio of each sign in PNES in comparison to ES with adjustment for repeated measures using logistic regression. Additionally, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios of each sign to diagnose PNES. RESULTS: A total of 742 events from 140 VEM studies were assessed. Fluctuating course (odds ratio (OR) 37.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 13.56C102.96, P < 0.0001), head shaking (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.26C6.79, P = 0.012), and hip thrusting (OR 4.28, 95% CI 1.21C15.18, P = 0.02) were each significantly predictive of PNES. Fluctuating course had the highest sensitivity (76.16%). Back arching (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.35C3.20, P = 0.92) was not significantly associated with PNES. CONCLUSION: Fluctuating course, head shaking, and hip thrusting are semiological features significantly more common in PNES than ES. Fluctuating course is the most reliable sign. Back arching does not appear to differentiate PNES from ES.","output":"Predictive semiology of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures in an epilepsy monitoring unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the face of psychiatry over a very short time period. Given the detrimental impact of the pandemic on mental health and the economy, more difficult days are ahead for psychiatry. The rising public health burden of mental illnesses will inevitably exceed the capacity of psychiatric services in the United States and worldwide. The pandemic has also profoundly affected psychiatric research due to safety concerns and containment efforts. Intermediate and long-term ramifications may even be more serious. In addition to the effects of the economic downturn on available research funding, existing research tools and protocols may not meet the emerging needs in the post-COVID-19 era. This paper discusses potential trends and challenges that psychiatric practice and research may encounter in this period from the viewpoint of workers in the field.

Short-term treatment of healthy mice with a dose of RIS that achieves plasma concentrations within the low clinical range resulted in disrupted response to an inflammatory (LPS) challenge compared to vehicle controls. Furthermore, RIS also prevented treated animals from mounting an antibody response following vaccination with Pneumovax23?.

Kidneys grafts were obtained from the local organ procurement organization after declined by all transplant centers. Kidneys were benched and wrapped in cold sponges. A periumbilical midline incision was performed. A kidney-shaped ballon was inserted through the incision to create the extraperitoneal space. SP robot was docked followed by dissection of iliac vessels bilaterally. The robot was undocked and the first graft was inserted through the wound retractor. The robot was re-docked and the renal vein anastomosis to external iliac vein was performed followed by renal artery anastomosis to external iliac artery using 5-0 monofilament sutures. Ureteroneocystostomy was performed using the Lich-Gregoir technique over a trasplant stent. Same steps were replicated for the left kidney transplant. Once procedures were done, kidneys were then harvested with the iliac vessels to examine the quality of the anastomosis. RESULTS The surgical procedure was completed successfully without the need of additional port or conversion to standard approach. Total bench kidney time was 30 minutes with overall transplantation time of 130 and 115 minutes of the right and left kidney, respectively.

The literature about the etiology and clinical characteristics is scarce and the evidence on systemic diseases associated with this esophageal disorder is limited. Therefore, we aimed to determine the etiology of absent contractility in our population using the clinical algorithm recently described in the literature. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study at a single tertiary hospital of all patients diagnosed of absent contractility between May 2018 and February 2020. Data on demographic characteristics, medication, comorbidities, and laboratory and paraclinical tests were recorded from clinical records. RESULTS: A total of 72 patients with absent contractility were included for analysis. There was a predominance of female sex (n=43, 59.7%), with a mean age of 55.4 (15.0) years. We identified a systemic disorder associated with absent contractility in 64 (88.9%) patients. From these, 31 (43.1%) patients were diagnosed with a systemic autoimmune disease, 26 (36.1%) patients were considered to have absent contractility secondary to pathological exposure to acid-reflux and 15 (20.8%) patients were diagnosed with other non-autoimmune systemic disorders. In the remaining eight (11.1%) patients, there were no underlying systemic disorders that could justify the diagnosis of absent contractility.

The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies in wastewater evidenced the validity of water-based epidemiology to anticipate COVID-19 outbreaks, to evaluate the impact of control measures and even to estimate the burden of shedders, including presymptomatic, asymptomatic, symptomatic and undiagnosed cases. For this latter objective, a model was applied for the estimation of the total number of shedders, evidencing a high proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals. In this way, an infection prevalence of 2.0-6.5% was figured. On the other hand, a proportion of around 0.12% and 0.09% of the total population was determined to be required for positive detection in the two WWTPs.At the end of the lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 RNA apparently disappeared in the WWTPs but could still be detected in grab samples from four urban sewers.

Results For this purpose, we investigated the expression of various cell surface markers and of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. These analyses showed that the scirrhous gastric cancer cell lines HSC-58 and HSC-44PE heterogeneously expressed CD13, while CD44, CDCP1, EpCAM and ABCG2 were expressed uniformly. Moreover, 10% of the total HSC-58 cell population expressed ALDH enzyme activity. A subpopulation of cells strongly positive for ALDH also expressed high levels of CD13, both of which are known as cancer stem cell markers.

Completion of a community health assessment was associated with partnership in MCH (AOR = 7.26; 95% CI, 2.90-18.18), and chronic disease prevention (AOR = 5.10; 95% CI, 2.28-11.39). CONCLUSION About 1 in 5 LHDs did not have any partnerships in chronic disease control. LHD partnerships should be promoted to improve care coordination and utilization of limited health care resources. Factors that might promote LHDs' partnerships include having a public health physician on staff, higher per capita expenditure, and completion of a community health assessment. Community context likely influences types and levels of partnerships. A better understanding of these contextual factors may lead to more complete and effective LHD partnerships.","output":"Factors Driving Local Health Departments' Partnerships With Other Organizations in Maternal and Child Health, Communicable Disease Prevention, and Chronic Disease Control."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the salutary consequences of the 2020-2021 pandemic has been a renewed appreciation for the advantages students find in nondegree credentials, either as stand-alone qualifications or as complements to degrees.

Also, most are closely focused on employable skills. And if students pursue such credentials through systems that enable rational and coherent educational trajectories, they may find it possible to combine them in an aggregate qualification or to stack them toward requirements for an associate or baccalaureate degree.

BACKGROUND P-EPDs have theoretical advantages that may make them superior to F-EPDs for stroke prevention during CAS. METHODS We examined 10,246 consecutive elective CAS procedures performed with embolic protection in the NCDR CARE registry between January 2009 and March 2013. We analyzed crude and propensity-matched rates of in-hospital combined death/stroke in patients treated with P-EPDs versus F-EPDs. Secondary analyses included 30-day adverse event rates and stroke rates by the involved cerebrovascular territory. RESULTS P-EPDs were used in 590 of 10,246 cases (5.8%). Patients treated with P-EPDs had higher rates of symptomatic lesion status (46.8% vs. 39.7%, p<0.001), atrial fibrillation/flutter (16.1% vs. 13.0%, p=0.03), and history of a neurological event (51.2% vs. 46.6%, p=0.03). In unadjusted and propensity-matched analyses, differences in in-hospital stroke/death between P-EPD and F-EPD cohorts were nonsignificant (1.5% vs. 2.4%, p=0.16 and 1.6% vs. 2.0%, p=0.56, respectively). For patients with available data (n=7,693, 75.1%), 30-day adverse events rates were similar for P-EPDs and F-EPDs before (2.5% vs. 4.2%, p=0.07) and after (2.7% vs. 4.0%, p=0.22) propensity matching. CONCLUSIONS Use of a P-EPD during CAS was associated with low rates of in-hospital stroke/death similar to those with an F-EPD in the first comparative effectiveness study of the devices.

This study was done to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among 4C14 years age group children in urban slums as well as to find out the socio-demographic factors associated with it. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with cluster sampling technique was conducted in urban slums of Thiruvananthapuram Corporation among 1029 participants. For the estimation of prevalence, CPMS was used and the socio-demographic factors were obtained using pretested interviewer-administered semi-structured questionnaire. Data were analysed using proportion with 95% CI, Chi-square, odds ratio and logistic regression. RESULTS: Prevalence of childhood psychiatric disorders was 11.5% [95%CI (9.51-13.49)] and it was significantly associated with age (P =0.000), birth order (P =0.008), birth weight (P =.033), siblings number (P =.004) school performance (P =.000), peer status (P =.012), peer relation (P =.000), disease status (P =.000), maternal education (P =.006), paternal education (P =.000), maternal occupation (P =.000) and paternal occupation (P =.005), parental separation (P =.000), the person looking after the child (P =.000), marital disharmony (P =.000), history of alcohol intake (P =.000) and frequency of drinking (P =.000).

However, it is unclear whether these cues indeed bridge the potential gap between the writer's intentions and the reader's interpretations. A pilot study and two experiments investigated the effect of using repeated punctuation on behavioral intention to assist an email writer in a work-related situation. Findings demonstrate that while the intentions behind using repeated punctuation relate to signaling situational importance or affective state, behavioral intentions are driven by dispositional rather than situational attributions. Specifically, the use of repeated punctuation reduces perceived competence of the message writer and consequently decreases positive behavioral intentions. Overall, the study challenges the simplified view of paralinguistic cues as communication facilitators, highlighting their potential harmful effects on impression formation and behavioral intentions in the digital age.","output":"Do You Get What I Mean?!?

METHODS We performed 45 r-TARRD repairs for symptomatic rectus diastasis with concomitant associated ventral/incisional umbilical and/or epigastric hernias between January 2019 and January 2020. Data on patient demographics, type of hernia, operative time, complications, recurrence rate, and hospital stay were retrospectively analyzed. Follow-up was scheduled at 1, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery. RESULTS 45 patients (13 M, 32 F) underwent r-TARRD repair. Mean age was 54.8 years (range 31-68) and mean BMI was 26.74 kg/m2 (range 21.1-31). Mean ASA was 2.2 (range 1-3). In all patients we used a polypropylene mesh 25  15 cm, properly shaped. Mean operative time was 192 min (range 115-260). Mean hospital stay 4.2 days (range 2-7). No conversion to laparoscopy or open surgery and no major complications occurred. At 1-month follow-up one mesh infection (2.22%) was observed and it was treated conservatively. Four recurrences (8.88%) were reported at 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Robot-assisted TARRD repair is conceived as a novel alternative minimally invasive procedure for RD with concurrent midline defects ensuring a primary fascial defect closure and mesh implantation in a sublay position with a wide overlap.

The purpose of the study was to compare the clinical outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and HIV versus those without HIV. METHODS: This was a retrospective, cohort study of adult patients admitted with confirmed COVID-19 from March 1(st) to May 30(th) 2020 at an urban hospital in New York City. Data collected included demographics, past medical history, HIV status, baseline laboratory values, treatment and outcomes such as length of stay, mechanical ventilation, patient disposition at discharge, and in-hospital mortality. Fishers exact test was used to compare categorical values and a t-test was used to compare continuous values. RESULTS: Out of 983 patients, 6.9% were PLWH and 93.1% were HIV-negative. The average age in both groups was 61 vs. 62 years, respectively. There were more male patients in the PLWH than the non-HIV group (76.8% vs. 58.6%). Majority of PLWH were Black (49.3%). Forty-seven percent of PLWH were mechanically ventilated versus 33.3% of the non-HIV group. The most common comorbidity in both groups was hypertension (82.4% vs. 72.6%).

Due to economic hardships in Zimbabwe, women have also been noted to migrate to neighbouring countries in search of opportunities to look after their left-behind families. However, the COVID-19 restrictions and other state regulations have become facilitators of illicit migration as irregular migrants (including women) devise more complex means to traverse borders and gain access. This paper assesses the vulnerabilities and the lived realities of female irregular migrants between Zimbabwe and Botswana during the clandestine migration journeys. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive survey that targeted nineteen (19) participants was conducted using semi-structured and unstructured interviews. The participants included fifteen (15) Female irregular migrants and four (4) Key Informants who worked at Plumtree Border Post. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded and thematically analysed. RESULTS: Four vulnerabilities were reported/experienced by the participants: violence and robbery, Rape and sexual harassment, Psycho-emotional harassment, and health vulnerabilities in detention. The participants reported that these vulnerabilities are experienced at different levels of the migration process and deportation. CONCLUSIONS: Female migrants are generally at risk as they are bound to be taken advantage of at different levels during migration and deportation.

This study addresses the need for comparing clinical performance of IgG immunoassays with respect to this alternate reference standard. METHODS: We compared the performance of three immunoassays, an in-house RBD assay, and two commercial assays, the Diasorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S1 IgG CLIA which detects antibodies against S1/S2 domains of the Spike protein and the Zydus Kavach assay based on inactivated virus using a well-characterized panel of sera. 379 sera and plasma samples from RTPCR positive individuals >20 days of illness in symptomatic or RT-PCR positivity in asymptomatic individuals and 184 samples collected prior to 2019 were used for assay evaluation. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the assays were 84.7 (95%CI 80.6 - 88.1), 82.6 (95%CI 78.3 - 86.2) and 75.7 (95%CI 71.0 - 79.9) respectively for RBD, LIAISON and Kavach.

Patients with TNBC have poor overall survival because of limited molecular therapeutic targets. Recently, exosomes have been recognized as key mediators in cancer progression, but the molecular components and function of TNBC-derived exosomes remain unknown. The main goal of this study was to reveal the proteomic landscape of serum exosomes derived from ten patients with TNBC and 17 healthy donors to identify potential therapeutic targets. Using a tandem mass tagCbased quantitative proteomics approach, we characterized the proteomes of individual patient-derived serum exosomes, identified exosomal protein signatures specific to patients with TNBC, and filtered out differentially expressed proteins. Most importantly, we found that the tetraspanin CD151 expression levels in TNBC-derived serum exosomes were significantly higher than those exosomes from healthy subjects, and we validated our findings with samples from 16 additional donors. Furthermore, utilizing quantitative proteomics approach to reveal the proteomes of CD151-deleted exosomes and cells, we found that exosomal CD151 facilitated secretion of ribosomal proteins via exosomes while inhibiting exosome secretion of complement proteins.

In comparison with the current available medical modalities, the contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging is the simplest and fastest means for probing the tissue perfusion. Specifically, the perfusion parameters estimated from the ultrasound time-intensity curve (TIC) and statistics-based time-Nakagami parameter curve (TNC) approaches were found able to quantify the perfusion. However, due to insufficient tolerance on tissue clutters and subresolvable effects, these approaches remain short of reproducibility and robustness. Consequently, the window-modulated compounding (WMC) Nakagami parameter ratio imaging was proposed to alleviate these effects, by taking the ratio of WMC Nakagami parameters corresponding to the incidence of two different acoustic pressures from an employed transducer. The time-Nakagami parameter ratio curve (TNRC) approach was also developed to estimate perfusion parameters. Measurements for the assessment of muscle perfusion were performed from the flow phantom and animal subjects administrated with a bolus of ultrasound contrast agents. The TNRC approach demonstrated better sensitivity and tolerance of tissue clutters than those of TIC and TNC. The fusion image with the WMC Nakagami parameter ratio and B-mode images indicated that both the tissue structures and perfusion properties of ultrasound contrast agents may be better discerned.","output":"Window-Modulated Compounding Nakagami Parameter Ratio Approach for Assessing Muscle Perfusion with Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Imaging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On the last day of 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was briefed about a wave of unknown caused pneumonia detected in Wuhan City, China. The virus responsible for the epidemic was determined to be a novel coronavirus. On March 11, the coronavirus outbreak has been accepted as a pandemic by the WHO.The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest global crisis of this century. Its depth and scale are enormous. Aside from the many deaths that have tragically ensued, the pandemic caused a large-scale economic and social shake. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, governments, economies, markets and individuals had to face a global crisis situation. The post-pandemic period can be an opportunity to think about the difference between \\"how we did\\" and \\"how we should do\\" and to focus on cooperation and also to react internationally to subsequent challenges. This review manuscript raises 9 predictive points of discussion for policymakers as the pandemic subsides, intending to generate debates around the greater post-COVID19 value creation for the public. The Covid-19 pandemic could cause a seismic shock that will permanently change the international systems and balance of power as we go through it.Reviewed works of experts scrutinized to find the mostly predicted topics. It was seen that 9 different topics came to the fore. Table.2 shows the headings in which the opinions of experts or institutions are concentrated in general. 14 of 27 experts' prediction focused on \\"Impact on Economy\\". This was followed by \\"End of Globalization Era\\" and \\"Emerging Nationalism\\" respectively 9 and 8 predictions. Other predictions were \\"Daily Life Changes\\", \\"Criticism on EU\\", \\"Prediction on Urban Life Change\\", \\"Leadership Problem\\", \\"Healthcare measures\\" and \\"Sino-American Relations\\". COVID-19 eroded our traditional systems, but its also allowed us to develop new and innovative solutions out of necessity. The \\"new normal\\" will depend on the governments and their policies to recovering the coronavirus outbreak effects. However, it is worth highlighting that there is no global governance. Moreover, the effect of the pandemic is not the same for all countries. Therefore, the challenge is to predict a new normal of life for a global manner. The new life models for each country will surely be different from 2019, as some behaviours and routines will be changed indefinitely, especially regarding healthcare systems, work-life, trade, and traveling.","output":"Prediction for Future: How Coronavirus Pandemic will Change the World?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current challenge worldwide is the administration of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines. Even if rarely, severe vascular adverse reactions temporally related to vaccine administration have induced diffidence in the population at large. In particular, researchers worldwide are focusing on the so-called thrombosis and thrombocytopenia after COVID-19 vaccination. This study aims to establish a practical workflow to define the relationship between adverse events following immunization (AEFI) and COVID-19 vaccination, following the basic framework of the World Health Organization (WHO). Post-mortem investigation plays a pivotal role to support this causality relationship when death occurs. To demonstrate the usefulness and feasibility of the proposed workflow, we applied it to two exemplificative cases of suspected AEFI following COVID-19 vaccination. Based on the proposed model, we took into consideration any possible causality relationship between COVID-19 vaccine administration and AEFI. This led us to conclude that vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 may cause the rare development of immune thrombocytopenia mediated by platelet-activating antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4), which clinically mimics heparin-induced autoimmune thrombocytopenia. We suggest the adoption of the proposed methodology in order to confirm or rule out a causal relationship between vaccination and the occurrence of AEFI.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccine and Death: Causality Algorithm According to the WHO Eligibility Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Faecal calprotectin (FCP) has been widely used as a non-invasive marker of intestinal inflammation in children. Measurement of faecal haemoglobin (f-Hb) using faecal immunochemical test (FIT) is well established in adults for detection of colorectal cancer. In adults, f-Hb has been recommended as a reliable tool to aid identification of those at low risk of significant bowel disease and has also been used in inflammatory bowel disease to assess mucosal healing. AIMS We aimed to evaluate the performance of f-Hb in the paediatric population and compare it with FCP. METHODS Children being assessed in the paediatric gastroenterology clinic for bowel symptoms had a sample sent for both FCP and f-Hb. Samples were collected over a 10-month period from November 2018 to September 2019. f-Hb was measured using an OC-Sensor. FCP was measured using Liason?Calprotectin. RESULTS 143 samples were returned for f-Hb and in 107 a paired FCP was also available. f-Hb correlated with FCP, Spearmanas rank coefficient 0.656 (p<0.0001). There were 35 patients with f-Hb >20 ?g/g and in 32 of these patients FCP was >200 ?g/g. 74 patients with f-Hb and 38 patients with FCP underwent colonoscopy.

METHODS Ninety-eight patients with 126 HCCs designated to undergo thermal ablation treatment were enrolled in this prospective study. CEUS-CT/MR image fusion was performed intraoperatively to evaluate whether 5-mm AM was covered by the ablative area. If possible, supplementary ablation was applied at the site of inadequate AM. The CEUS image quality, the time used for CEUS-CT/MR image fusion and the success rate of image fusion were recorded. Local tumor progression (LTP) was observed during follow-up. Clinical factors including AM were examined to identify risk factors for LTP. RESULTS The success rate of image fusion was 96.2% (126/131), and the duration required for image fusion was 4.9  2.0 (3-13) min. The CEUS image quality was good in 36.1% (53/147) and medium in 63.9% (94/147) of the cases. By supplementary ablation, 21.8% (12/55) of lesions with inadequate AMs became adequate AMs. During follow-up, there were 5 LTPs in lesions with inadequate AMs and 1 LTP in lesions with adequate AMs. Multivariate analysis showed that AM was the only independent risk factor for LTP (hazard ratio, 9.167; 95% confidence interval, 1.070-78.571; p = 0.043).

As such, the enzyme is of fundamental importance to cellular energy metabolism, and defects in its function may be related to human disease states. Here we describe in vitro analysis of the h-mtRNAP kinetic mechanism for single, correct nucleotide incorporation. This was made possible by the development of efficient methods for expression and purification of h-mtRNAP using a bacterial system and by utilization of assays that rely on simple, synthetic RNA/DNA scaffolds without the need for mitochondrial transcription accessory proteins. We find that h-mtRNAP accomplishes single-nucleotide incorporation by using the same core steps, including conformational change steps before and after chemistry, that are prototypical for most types of nucleic acid polymerases. The polymerase binds to scaffolds via a two-step mechanism consisting of a fast initial-encounter step followed by a much slower isomerization that leads to catalytic competence. A substantial solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effect was observed for the forward reaction, but none was detectable for the reverse reaction, suggesting that chemistry is at least partially rate-limiting in the forward direction but not in the reverse. h-mtRNAP appears to exercise much more stringent surveillance over base than over sugar in determining the correctness of a nucleotide. The utility of developing the robust in vitro assays described here and of establishing a baseline of kinetic performance for the wild-type enzyme is that biological questions concerning h-mtRNAP may now begin to be addressed.","output":"Human mitochondrial RNA polymerase: evaluation of the single-nucleotide-addition cycle on synthetic RNA/DNA scaffolds."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a major medical problem worldwide, but it also leads to educational problems The aim of this work is to contribute with information about the feelings generated in university students and to know the main characteristics of Higher Education in Ecuador in times of pandemic Specifically, the question What are the feelings of university students in times of the COVID-19? was answered For this purpose, a quantitative, transversal and non-experimental research was carried out Fifty-five unstructured anonymous interviews were conducted It was applied to students from 16 Higher Education Institutions Feelings were analyzed using techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and through the computer programs MATLAB and NVIVO applied to the 500 phrases, obtained from 55 interviews with an average of 47 words per phrase When carrying out the sentiment analysis, it was obtained that approximately 64% was negative, 11% neutral and 25% positive LDA found that the 55 interviews were explained by 2 unobserved groups represented by the word clouds of topics 7 and 14 The unobserved groups show feelings such as stress, tiredness, problems and effort that may be related to the words people, evaluation, type, education and strength This research can be complemented with a study that allows to deepen the type of negative, neutral and positive feelings and to determine their possible causes ? 2020 ACM","output":"Ecuadorian Higher Education in COVID-19: A Sentiment Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The topic of patients recording healthcare consultations has been previously debated in the literature, but little consideration has been given to the risks and benefits of such recordings in the context of mental health assessments and treatment.

Using aggregate app-based GPS positioning data from smartphone users, this study traces the changes in amenity visits in Somerville, MA from January 2019 to December 2020, describing how visits to particular types of amenities have changed as a result of business closures during the public health emergency. Has the pandemic fundamentally shifted amenity-oriented travel behavior or is consumer behavior returning to pre-pandemic trends? To address this question, we calibrate discrete choice models that are suited to Census block-group level analysis for each of the 24 months in a two-year period, and use them to analyze how visitors behavioral responses to various attributes of amenity clusters have shifted during different phases of the pandemic. Our findings suggest that in the first few months of the pandemic, amenity-visiting preferences significantly diverged from expected patterns. Even though overall trip volumes remained far below normal levels throughout the remainder of the year, preferences towards specific cluster attributes mostly returned to expected levels by September 2020. We also construct two scenarios to explore the implications of another shutdown and a full reopening, based on November 2020 consumer behavior. While government restrictions have played an important role in reducing visits to amenity clusters, our results imply that cautionary consumer behavior has played an important role as well, suggesting a likely long and slow path to economic recovery. By drawing on mobile phone location data and behavioral modeling, this paper offers timely insights to help decision-makers understand how this unprecedented health emergency is affecting amenity-related trips and where the greatest needs for intervention and support may exist.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on trips to urban amenities: Examining travel behavior changes in Somerville, MA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the social disparities in COVID-19 infection, little is known about factors influencing social disparities in preventive behaviors during the pandemic. This study examined how educational disparities in mask-wearing, handwashing, and limiting public outings might be contingent upon three factors: contextual cue of danger, perceived risk of local outbreak, and interventional context with different levels of intensity (i.e, Wuhan vs. other areas). Data were obtained from a telephone survey of 3327 adults, who were recruited through a random-digit-dial method to be representative of all cell phone users in China.

Stratified multiple regression models showed that educational disparities in all three behaviors were only consistently observed among people exposed to context cues of danger, with an enhanced sense of risk of a local outbreak, or in areas other than Wuhan. College education seems to make a difference in handwashing regardless of contextual cues of danger or perception of risk. The findings suggested that, in the process of an epidemic, emerging threats in one's immediate environment or raised awareness of risks are important conditions triggering educational disparities in prevention.

Finding appropriate measures that effectively contain the spread of the epidemic without putting a too severe pressure on social and economic life is major challenge for modern predictive approaches. To assess the impact of confinement (March 17th till May 11th) and deconfinement, we develop a novel rate model to monitor and predict the spread of the epidemic and its impact on the health care system. The model accounts for age-dependent interactions between population groups and predicts consequences for various infection categories such as number of infected, hospitalized, load of intensive care units (ICU), number of death, recovered and more. We use online health care data for the five most infected regions of France to calibrate the model. At day of deconfinement (May 11th), we find that 13% (around 4.8M) of the population is infected in the five most affected regions of France (extrapolating to 5.8M for France). The model predicts that if the reproduction rate R0 is reduced by at least a factor of 2.5-3 for all age groups, which could be achieved by wearing masks and social distancing, a significant second peak could be prevented. However, if the reduction in R0 for the age group 0-25 would be less and below 2 (school openings), a second peak is unavoidable in which case the ICU will be saturated.

We present a case of autointoxication with 20 g hydroxychloroquine in a 35-year-old woman. Cardiac monitoring showed ventricular arrhythmias for which high-dose midazolam and propofol were initiated, resulting in a brief normalization of the cardiac rhythm. Because of the reoccurrence of these arrhythmias, intravenous lipid emulsion was administered with fast cardiac stabilization. Treatment with continuous norepinephrine, potassium chloride/phosphate, and sodium bicarbonate was initiated. On day 6, she was extubated and after 11 days, she was discharged from the hospital without complications. Conclusion. Since high-quality scientific evidence is lacking, treatment options are based on experience in chloroquine toxicity. Activated charcoal is advised if the patient presents early. Sedation with diazepam, early ventilation, and continuous epinephrine infusion are considered effective in treating severe intoxication. Caution is advised when substituting potassium. Despite the lack of formal evidence, sodium bicarbonate appears to be useful and safe in case of QRS widening. Intravenous lipid emulsion, with or without hemodialysis, remains controversial but appears to be safe.

Due to a lack of epidemiological data and clinical experience, it was feared that children with respiratory diseases were a risk group for particularly severe courses of COVID-19, as has been reported for adults. Objective: The currently available (epidemiological) data on this patient group are presented as well as a description of our own experiences based on three selected cases. Material and methods: A review of the literature was carried out and three selected case reports and a discussion of current recommendations are presented. Results: The incidence of COVID-19 is significantly lower in children than in adults. Furthermore, the known risk factors in adults cannot be simply transferred to pediatric patients. In the majority of cases, children and adolescents with chronic lung diseases show a milder course of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Conclusion: Although the hitherto available data show that children and adolescents have a lower risk for COVID-19 courses than adults, it should not be ignored that fatal outcomes have also been reported in pediatric patients. Moreover, late effects, such as the pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) can sometimes lead to a fatal outcome.

The SOCRATES trial (Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes) was the first trial with ticagrelor in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in which the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor were compared with those of aspirin. The main safety objective was assessment of PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes)-defined major bleeds on treatment, with special focus on intracranial hemorrhage (ICrH). METHODS An independent adjudication committee blinded to study treatment classified bleeds according to the PLATO, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction), and GUSTO (Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries) definitions. The definitions of ICrH and major bleeding excluded cerebral microbleeds and asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of cerebral infarctions so that the definitions better discriminated important events in the acute stroke population. RESULTS A total of 13 130 of 13 199 randomized patients received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included in the safety analysis set. PLATO major bleeds occurred in 31 patients (0.5%) on ticagrelor and 38 patients (0.6%) on aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-1.34). The most common locations of major bleeds were intracranial and gastrointestinal. ICrH was reported in 12 patients (0.2%) on ticagrelor and 18 patients (0.3%) on aspirin. Thirteen of all 30 ICrHs (4 on ticagrelor and 9 on aspirin) were hemorrhagic strokes, and 4 (2 in each group) were symptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of brain infarctions. The ICrHs were spontaneous in 6 and 13, traumatic in 3 and 3, and procedural in 3 and 2 patients on ticagrelor and aspirin, respectively. In total, 9 fatal bleeds occurred on ticagrelor and 4 on aspirin. The composite of ICrH or fatal bleeding included 15 patients on ticagrelor and 18 on aspirin. Independently of bleeding classification, PLATO, TIMI, or GUSTO, the relative difference between treatments for major/severe bleeds was similar. Nonmajor bleeds were more common on ticagrelor. CONCLUSIONS Antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack showed a bleeding profile similar to that of aspirin for major bleeds. There were few ICrHs. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

K18-hACE2 mice develop disease resembling severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in a virus dose-dependent manner. The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the intestinal or respiratory microbiome is not fully understood. In this context, we characterized the cecal and lung microbiome of SARS-CoV-2 challenged K18-hACE2 transgenic mice in the presence or absence of treatment with the Mpro inhibitor GC376. Cecum microbiome showed decreased Shannon and Inv Simpson diversity index correlating with SARS-CoV-2 infection dosage and a difference of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distances among control and infected mice. Bacterial phyla such as Firmicutes, particularly Lachnospiraceae and Oscillospiraceae, were significantly less abundant while Verrucomicrobiota, particularly the family Akkermansiaceae, were increasingly more prevalent during peak infection in mice challenged with a high virus dose. In contrast to the cecal microbiome, the lung microbiome showed similar microbial diversity among the control, low and high challenge virus groups, independent of antiviral treatment. Bacterial phyla in the lungs such as Bacteroidota decreased while Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were significantly enriched in mice challenged with a high dose of SARS-CoV-2. In summary, we identified changes in the cecal and lung microbiome of K18-hACE2 mice with severe clinical signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of deaths. The hosts respiratory and intestinal microbiome can affect directly or indirectly the immune system during viral infections. We characterized the cecal and lung microbiome in a relevant mouse model challenged with a low and high dose of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence or absence of an antiviral Mpro inhibitor, GC376. Decreased microbial diversity and taxonomic abundances of the phyla Firmicutes, particularly Lachnospiraceae, correlating with infection dosage was observed in the cecum. In addition, microbes within the family Akkermansiaceae were increasingly more prevalent during peak infection, which is observed in other viral infections. The lung microbiome showed similar microbial diversity to the control, independent of antiviral treatment. Decreased Bacteroidota and increased Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were observed in the lungs in a virus dose-dependent manner.

We evaluated the risk of COVID-19 among migrants from different areas of the world within the context of universal free access to medical care. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a population-based cohort analysis of the cumulative incidence of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 among adult residents of Alcorcon (Spain) in the first wave of the disease up to April 25, 2020. RESULTS The crude cumulative incidence among migrants (n = 20419) was higher than among Spaniards (n = 131599): 8.81 and 6.51 and per 1000 inhabitants, respectively (p < .001), but differed by region of origin. As per a negative binomial regression adjusted for age and sex, relative risk (RR) for COVID-19 for individuals from Europe, Asia, or North Africa was not significantly different from Spaniards. In contrast, a markedly increased risk was found in people from Sub-Saharan Africa (RR 3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-9.41, p = .007), the Caribbean (RR 6.35, 95% CI 3.83-10.55, p < .001), and Latin America (RR 6.92, 95% CI 4.49-10.67, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS Migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America exhibited increased risk for COVID-19 as compared to Spaniards or migrants from Europe, North Africa, or Asia. Our data suggest ethnic background may play a role in risk for COVID-19.

Dental professionals in resource poor countries, as opposed to those in developed countries, face additional challenges due to the lack of personal protective equipment, and chronic infrastructural impediments extant in such jurisdictions, such as regular and chronic interruptions to electricity and water supplies. OBJECTIVES: To address this new 'normal' which dictates that dentistry has to 'adapt and adopt' in order to deliver care to the needy, particularly in resource poor nations, whilst care deliverers take appropriate precautionary measures to obviate cross infection. METHODS: A review was preformed of the challenges to delivery of infection control measures in dentistry in resource meagre settings, and practical interventional measures proposed to mitigate these challenges, taking South Africa as a case study. RESULTS: In reality, optimal infection control measures cannot be implemented in delivering dental care in resource poor settings, a challenge that has been ill addressed by the relevant authoritative bodies. A re-adaptation of infection control guidelines that could be simply implemented in such settings has been formulated. CONCLUSION: We present practical infection control guidelines to lessen the burden of dental professionals in resource poor countries who dispense treatment under trying circumstance. The strategic infection control measures, including engineering and administrative controls outlined could be applicable in jurisdictions with a diminished capacity to respond to local, regional or national infection control guide-lines, due to financial, regulatory, or other infrastructural resource deficiencies.","output":"Strategic implementation of dental infection control in resource-poor jurisdictions during COVID-19 pandemic: a perspective from South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, the rise of the interconnected computer networks and the increase of processed data have led to producing distributed systems.

PK-15 cells were transfected with pIC-PCV2 and an indirect immune fluorescence assay (IFA) was performed 7 days post-transfection. The PCV2 Cap gene was expressed in approximately 20 % of the cultured cells, and only the recombination product, and not pIC-PCV2, was subsequently detected by PCR and Southern blot. This result indicated that infection by pIC-PCV2 delivered genomic PCV2 DNA specifically into susceptible cells and led to the expression of a functional virus genome. Eighteen 30- to 40-day-old conventional pigs were distributed into three groups. Group 1 pigs (n=6) were inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with a Spanish isolate of PCV2 propagated in cell culture; pigs from group 2 (n=6) were inoculated with pIC-PCV2 intramuscularly (i.m.), and the last group of pigs (n=6) was inoculated with pIC-PCV2 intraperitoneally (i.p.).

Pilot studies suggest that vegetable gardening interventions ameliorate functional decline through improved diet and physical activity. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper is to describe the rationale, recruitment challenges, and enrollment of the Harvest for Health randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will test the impact of a home-based, vegetable gardening intervention on vegetable & fruit (V&F) consumption, physical activity, and physical functioning among older cancer survivors. Modifications made to the intervention and assessments to assure safety and continuity of the RCT throughout the COVID-19 pandemic also are reported. DESIGN: Harvest for Health is a 2-year, 2-arm, single-blinded, wait-list controlled RCT with cross-over. PARTICIPANTS: /setting: Medicare-eligible survivors of cancers with >60% 5-year survival were recruited across Alabama from October 1, 2016 to February 8, 2021. INTERVENTION: Participants are randomly-assigned to a wait-list control or a 1-year home-based gardening intervention and individually-mentored by Extension-certified Master Gardeners to cultivate spring, summer, and fall vegetable gardens. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: While the RCT's primary endpoint is a composite measure of V&F consumption, physical activity, and physical functioning, this paper focuses on recruitment and modifications made to the intervention and assessments during COVID-19. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Chi-square and t-tests (<0.05) were used to compare enrolled vs. unenrolled populations. RESULTS: Older cancer survivors (n=9,708) were contacted by letter and telephone; 1,460 indicated interest (15% response rate), 473 were screened eligible and consented, and 381 completed baseline assessments and were randomized. Enrollees did not differ from non-respondents/refusals by race and ethnicity, or rural-urban status, but were comprised of significantly higher numbers of comparatively younger survivors, those who were female, and survivors of breast cancer (p-values<0.001).

However, these studies mostly compared observed to expected rates of smoking without direct comparison with individual controls. Objective To examine the association of nicotine-replacement therapy, as a surrogate of smoking, with hospitalization and all-cause mortality during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France. Methods We conducted a nationwide matched exposed/unexposed cohort study using information from the French national health data system which covers the entire French population. We conducted two separate analyses, the first in individuals exposed to nicotine-replacement therapy without major smoking-related diseases (cancer, cardiovascular and/or respiratory diseases) and the second in those presenting these conditions. We included all individuals, aged between 18 and 75 years, who had been reimbursed at least one nicotine-replacement therapy between November 15, 2019, and February 15, 2020. For each exposed individual, we randomly selected, from the entire Metropolitan French population, up to two non-exposed individuals (1:2) matched for the following variables: age (same year of birth), sex, department of residence (n=96 in Metropolitan France), and complementary universal health insurance (CMU-C). The three end points were a hospitalization with Covid-19, a death or an intubation in hospitalized patients with Covid-19, and all-cause mortality. We compared outcomes in individuals who were exposed to nicotine-replacement therapy with those in individuals who were not, using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. Results In the first analysis, 297,070 individuals without major smoking-related diseases exposed to nicotine-replacement therapy were matched with 558,228 unexposed individuals without major smoking-related diseases. Individuals were aged on average 45.6 years (standard deviation: 12.7) and 48.8% were male. From February 15, 2020 to June 7, 2020, hospitalization with Covid-19 occurred in 647 patients (151 patients in the nicotine-replacement therapy group and 496 patients in the unexposed group). In the main multivariable analysis, nicotine-replacement therapy was associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization with Covid-19 compared with unexposed individuals (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.61). Nicotine-replacement therapy exposure was also associated with a decreased risk of intubation or death in hospitalized individuals with Covid-19 (13 vs. 73 patients, hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.57) but with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (251 vs. 231 deaths, hazard ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.80). In the second analysis, 128,768 individuals with major smoking-related diseases exposed to nicotine-replacement therapy were matched with 243,793 unexposed individuals. Individuals were aged on average 55.3 years (standard deviation: 11.4) and 53.3% were male. In the main multivariable analysis, nicotine-replacement therapy exposure was neither associated with risk of hospitalization with Covid-19 (240 patients in the nicotine-replacement therapy group and 398 patients in the unexposed group, hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.38) nor with risk of death or an intubation in hospitalized individuals with Covid-19 (48 vs. 61 patients, hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.54). All-cause mortality was higher in the nicotine-replacement therapy group (1040 vs. 366 deaths, hazard ratio, 3.83; 95% CI, 3.41 to 4.31). Conclusions This large-scale observational study suggests that smoking, measured by exposure to nicotine-replacement therapy, was associated with an increased risk of overall mortality during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France, although it was associated with a lower risk of severe Covid-19 in individuals without major related-smoking diseases. Experimental and clinical studies are needed to disentangle the potential mechanisms of nicotine and/or smoking in Covid-19 risk. Whatever the nature of these associations, the global impact of smoking is harmful for health even over a short epidemic period.","output":"Nicotine-replacement therapy, as a surrogate of smoking, and the risk of hospitalization with Covid-19 and all-cause mortality: a nationwide, observational cohort study in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between work\\\\family enrichment and two contextual factors (job support and family support), together with two personal factors (family boundary flexibility and prosocial motivation) among Chinese nurses assisting Wuhan in its fight against the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic.

Deletion variants arise in diverse genetic and geographic backgrounds, transmit efficiently, and are present in novel lineages, including those of current global concern. They frequently occupy recurrent deletion regions (RDRs), which map to defined antibody epitopes. Deletions in RDRs confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies. By altering stretches of amino acids, deletions appear to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 antigenic evolution and may, more generally, drive adaptive evolution.","output":"Recurrent deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein drive antibody escape"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the summer of 2020, many Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) programs around the country were forced to cancel their on-site programs due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In the midst of this crisis, the OOI Ocean Data Labs project at Rutgers University was asked to develop an alternative 'virtual REU, ' relying on our existing network of faculty and virtual community professional development experience. In the end, 15 faculty members were recruited to support 16 undergraduate students, as part of a combined program with Rutgers Research Internship in Ocean Sciences (RIOS). With only a month of planning, the Data Labs-RIOS team put together an 8-week research experience for students, including a 2-week professional development, and a 6-week research project, where students worked virtually with a faculty mentor, in keeping with typical REU summer programs. In this paper, we review the elements of the virtual program enacted in 2020, and how the various components were scaffolded to provide a coherent and positive research experience for students. The program produced a number of positive components worthy of consideration for future virtual REU or other internship programs.

Various synthetic surgical meshes have recently been used for the surgical repair of incisional hernias. In this study, we analysed the burst strength forces of heavyweight mesh and lightweight mesh in an incisional animal model. METHODS Following experimental formation of incisional hernias in 32 Wistar albino rats, they were divided into four groups. Polypropylene suture was used for closure of the abdominal incision in Group 1. In Groups 2, 3 and 4, polyester, polypropylene + polyglactin and polypropylene meshes, respectively, were fixed on the surface of the fascia after closing the defects in the rats. Polypropylene and polyester meshes are classified as heavy mesh. Light mesh is composed of a non-absorbable part (polypropylene) and an absorbable part (polyglactin), which will disappear 80 days after implantation. The rats were sacrificed at the end of the experiment. The pullout force of the fascia and meshes were recorded by use of a digital tension meter. RESULTS The mean pullout forces for Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 were found to be 123.4 +/- 13.3, 292.33 +/- 17.4, 281.66 +/- 16.3 and 310.60 +/- 26.1 N, respectively.

The hypothalamic neuropeptide, oxytocin (OT), mediates a wide range of physiologic actions, which include reproductive behavior, formation of prosocial behaviors and control of body weight. We and others have shown that OT circumvents leptin resistance and elicits weight loss in diet-induced obese rodents and non-human primates by reducing both food intake and increasing energy expenditure (EE).

This allowed to continue work activities and services and contributed to contain the risk of infection in different sectors, particularly in the public administration. OBJECTIVES: This follow up study focussed on a panel of 187 workers from the Italian Workers Compensation Authority taking part to a pilot project Smart Working in INAIL from January 2019 to December 2019. The aim was to investigate the effects of work organization on work attitudes, work-life balance and health outcomes before and after the introduction of the smart working. METHODS: The data were collected at two time points through a web-based questionnaire. The first wave aimed to collect information up to one month before the implementation of the smart working. The second wave aimed to collect information about potential changes occurred after one year of smart working. RESULTS: This study showed that high demands, low control and low social support might lead to reduced well-being and less satisfaction with work, and have an effect on work engagement and work-life balance. Particularly, improving social support can moderate the negative impact of high strain on well-being, preventing work-life imbalance and risk of isolation.

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled adult patients with acute exacerbation of IPF and non-IPF ILDs who were admitted to the hospital during the last 3 years, and examined the respiratory samples obtained from nasopharyngeal, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients were identified, consisting of 27 patients with acute exacerbation of IPF and 51 patients with non-IPF ILDs (IIP: n = 27, CTD-associated IP: n = 24).

METHODS This is an observational study during thoracoscopic EA repair with 5 mmHg CO2 insufflation pressure. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (paCO2), pH, and rScO2 were monitored in 15 neonates at seven time points: baseline (T0), after anesthesia induction (T1), after CO2-insufflation (T2), before CO2-exsufflation (T3), and postoperatively at 6 (T4), 12 (T5), and 24 h (T6). RESULTS MABP remained stable. SaO2 decreased from T0 to T2 [97  3-90  6 % (p < 0.01)]. PaCO2 increased from T0 to T2 [41  6-54  15 mmHg (p < 0.01)]. pH decreased from T0 to T2 [7.33  0.04-7.25  0.11 (p < 0.05)]. All parameters recovered during the surgical course.

Previous studies indicate that individuals residing in these facilities have a high prevalence of end-of-life symptoms and a significant need for palliative care. The aim of this study was to develop an end-of-life care program for nursing homes in Spain based on previous models yet adapted to the specific context and the needs of staff in nursing homes in the country. METHODS: A descriptive study of a complex intervention procedure was developed. The study consisted of three phases. The first phase was a prospective study assessing self-efficacy in palliative care (using the SEPC scale) and attitudes towards end-of-life care (using the FATCOD-B scale) among nursing home staff before and after the completion of a basic palliative care training program. In the second phase, objectives were selected using the Delphi consensus technique, where nursing home and primary care professionals assessed the relevance, feasibility, and level of attainment of 42 quality standards. In phase 3, interventions were selected for these objectives through two focus group sessions involving nursing home, primary care, and palliative care professionals. RESULTS: As a result of the training, an improvement in self-efficacy and attitudes towards end-of-life care was observed. In phase 2, 14 standards were selected and grouped into 5 objectives: to conduct a comprehensive assessment and develop a personalized care plan adapted to the palliative needs detected; to provide information in a clear and accessible way; to request and record advance care directives; to provide early care with respect to loss and grief; to refer patients to a specialized palliative care unit if appropriate, depending on the complexity of the palliative care required. Based on these objectives, the participants in the focus group sessions designed the 22 interventions that make up the program. CONCLUSIONS: The objectives and interventions of the NUHELP program constitute an end-of-life care program which can be implemented in nursing homes to improve the quality of end-of-life care in these facilities by modifying their clinical practice, organization, and relationship with the health system as well as serving as an example of an effective health intervention program.

Following resumption of elective cases, a significant proportion of patients continued to delay surgery, with many yet to reschedule, potentially prolonging their pain and impairment of function and causing detrimental long-term effects. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine differences between patients who have and have not rescheduled their spine surgery procedures originally cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to evaluate the reasons for continued deferment of spine surgeries even after the lifting of the mandated suspension of elective surgeries. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective case series at a single institution PATIENT SAMPLE: Included were 133 patients seen at a single institution where spine surgery was canceled due to a state-mandated suspension of elective surgeries from March to June, 2020. OUTCOME MEASURES: The measures assessed included preoperative diagnoses and neurological dysfunction, surgical characteristics, reasons for surgery deferment, and PROMIS scores of pain intensity, pain interference, and physical function. METHODS: Patient electronic medical records were reviewed. Patients who had not rescheduled their canceled surgery as of January 31, 2021, and did not have a reason noted in their charts were called to determine the reason for continued surgery deferment. Patients were divided into three groups: early rescheduled (ER), late rescheduled (LR), and not rescheduled (NR). ER patients had a date of surgery (DOS) prior to the city's Phase 4 reopening on July 20, 2020; LR patients had a DOS on or after that date. Statistical analysis of the group findings included analysis of variance with Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) post-hoc test, independent samples T-test, and chi-square analysis with significance set at p0.05. RESULTS: Out of 133 patients, 47.4% (63) were in the ER, 15.8% (21) in the LR, and 36.8% (49) in the NR groups. Demographics and baseline PROMIS scores were similar between groups. LR had more levels fused (3.6) than ER (1.6), p= 0.018 on Tukey HSD. NR (2.1) did not have different mean levels fused than LR or ER, both p= >0.05 on Tukey HSD. LR had more three column osteotomies (14.3%) than ER and (1.6%) and NR (2.0%) p=0.022, and fewer lumbar microdiscectomies (0%) compared to ER (20.6%) and NR (10.2%), p=0.039. Other surgical characteristics were similar between groups. LR had a longer length of stay than ER (4.2 vs 2.4, p=.036). No patients in ER or LR had a nosocomial COVID-19 infection. Of NR, 2.0% have a future surgery date scheduled and 8.2% (4) are acquiring updated exams before rescheduling. 40.8% (20; 15.0% total cohort) continue to defer surgery over concern for COVID-19 exposure and 16.3% (8) for medical comorbidities. 6.1% (3) permanently canceled for symptom improvement. 8.2% (4) had follow-up recommendations for non-surgical management. 4.1% (2) are since deceased. CONCLUSION: Over 1/3 of elective spine surgeries canceled due to COVID-19 have not been performed in the 8 months from when elective surgeries resumed in our institution to the end of the study. ER patients had less complex surgeries planned than LR. NR patients continue to defer surgery primarily over concern for COVID-19 exposure. The toll on the health of these patients as a result of the delay in treatment and on their lives due to their inability to return to normal function remains to be seen.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic and Elective Spinal Surgery Cancelations C What Happens to the Patients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent urban and regional studies have focused on identifying positive spillover effects from intensifying flows of people in city region networks. However, potential negative spillover effects have lacked attention. The article addresses this research gap focusing on the negative spillover effects represented by Covid-19 contagion in the Wuhan regional travel flow network, China. Drawing on central place theory and central flow theory, Covid-19 spatial spread simulation scenarios are explored using a combined micro-level epidemic compartment model and urban network approach. It is found that not only centrally positioned primate but secondary cities are highly risk exposed to contagion. In addition, these cities have enhanced transmission capacity in a balanced, well-connected travel flow network, whereas a centralised or locally clustered network would be more spread resilient. Both hierarchical position and horizontal flows are found relevant for explaining Covid-19 uneven spread and for informing mobility interventions for a potential future outbreak.","output":"Looking into mobility in the Covid-19 eye of the storm: Simulating virus spread and urban resilience in the Wuhan city region travel flow network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The growing epidemic of obesity and diabetes represents a growing health emergency, exemplified by a marked increase in cardiovascular and renal disease. As such, healthcare systems are increasingly focussing on therapeutic approaches to address these challenges.

However, their impact in obese people without T2D is unknown. The SELECT study is the first pharmacotherapy study in obesity powered for cardiovascular superiority and investigates the impact of semaglutide on cardiovascular disease outcomes in overweight and obese people without T2D. The results of this study will potentially redefine obesity management, especially as secondary outcomes of the study will include evaluation of health-related quality of life and incident diabetes rates. In another potentially evolutionary therapeutic step for the incretin class of therapeutic agents, the FLOW study is the first dedicated study to investigate the effects of GLP-1 receptor analogues on renal and cardiovascular outcomes in people with renal impairment and T2D. Post-hoc analyses of GLP-1 analogue CVOTs have demonstrated reduced adverse renal outcomes associated with their use. In this review we discuss the known impact of GLP-1 analogues on cardiovascular, weight and renal outcomes in previous CVOTs.

The revised International Health Regulations provide a global framework to address these needs through a collective approach to the prevention, detection, and timely response to any public health emergency of international concern. A standardized approach for readiness and response to major epidemic-prone diseases should be developed. An early-warning and rapid-alert system is one of the possibilities to improve readiness at the local, regional, national, and international level to limit the spread of disease and to reduce health, economic, and social damage.

The aim of this study was to estimate the rate of thrombotic and bleeding events in hospitalized patients diagnosed with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This was a multicenter study of 636 patients admitted between 20 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 with confirmed COVID-19 in four hospitals. RESULTS: Over a median length of stay in the non-ICU group of 7 days and of 19 days in the ICU group, twelve patients were diagnosed with Venous thromboembolism (VTE) (1.8 %) (95 % CI, 1.1C3). The rate in the non-ICU group was 0.19 % (95 % CI, 0.04C0.84), and that in the ICU group was 10.3 % (95 % CI, 6.4C16.2). The overall rate of arterial event is 2.2 % (95 % CI, 1.4C3.3). The rates in the non-ICU and ICU groups were 0.94 % (95 % CI, 0.46C0.1.9) and 8.4 % (95 % CI, 5.0C14.0). The overall composite event rate was 2.9 % (95 % CI, 2.0C4.3). The composite event rates in the non-ICU and ICU groups were 0.94 % (95 % CI, 0.46C0.1.9) and 13.2 % (95 % CI, 8.7C19.5). The overall rate of bleeding is 1.7 % (95 % CI, 1.0C2.8). The bleeding rate in the non-ICU group was 0.19 % (95 % CI, 0.04C0.84), and that in the ICU group was 9.4 % (95 % CI, 5.7C15.1). The baseline D-dimer level was a significant risk factor for developing VTE (OR 1.31, 95 % CI, 1.08C1.57, p = 0.005) and composite events (OR 1.32, 95 % CI, 1.12C1.55, p = 0.0007). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that the VTE rates in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 might not be higher than expected. In contrast to the risk of VTE, we found a high rate of arterial and bleeding complications in patients admitted to the ICU. An elevated D-dimer level at baseline could predict thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients and may assist in the identification of these patients. Given the high rate of bleeding, the current study suggests that the intensification of anticoagulation therapy in COVID-19 patients beyond the standard of care be pursued with caution and would best be evaluated in a randomized controlled study.","output":"High rate of bleeding and arterial thrombosis in COVID-19: Saudi multicenter study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Germline HAVCR2 mutations, recently identified in a large subset of patients with subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL), are associated with an increased risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).

In this study we discovered that BST-2/tetherin restricts orthobunyavirus replication in a host-specific manner. We show that viruses with human tropism (Oropouche virus and La Crosse virus) are restricted by sheep BST-2 but not by the human orthologue, while viruses with ruminant tropism (Schmallenberg virus and others) are restricted by human BST-2 but not by the sheep orthologue. We also show that BST-2 blocks orthobunyaviruses replication by reducing the amount of envelope glycoprotein into viral particles egressing from infected cells. This is the first study identifying a restriction factor that correlates with species susceptibility to orthobunyavirus infection.

INNOVATION Oregon Health & Science University's primary care team envisioned and implemented the COVID-19 Connected Care Center, a statewide telephone \\"hotline\\" service. RESULTS The hotline has taken more than 5825 calls from patients in 33 of Oregon's 36 counties in less than 3 months. In preliminary survey data, 86% of patients said their questions were answered during the call, 90% would recommend this service, and 70% reported a reduction in stress levels about coronavirus. In qualitative interviews, patients reported their questions answered, short wait times, nurses spent time as needed, and appropriate follow-up was arranged. CONCLUSION Academic health centers may have the capacity to leverage their extensive resources to rapidly launch a multiphased pandemic response that meets peoples' need for information and access to primary care, while minimizing risk of infection and emergency department use and rapidly supporting primary care teams to make the necessary operational changes to do the same in their communities.

For the discovery of a novel efficient way to modify oligonucleotides, a series of single isonucleotide-incorporated antisense oligodeoxynucleotides have been synthesized, in which an isonucleotide was introduced at different positions of the sequences. The binding behaviors of modified oligodeoxynucleotides to the complementary sequence were studied by UV, CD, and molecular dynamics simulation. The results showed that although the incorporated isonucleotides at certain positions of the sequence interfere with the binding ability to a different extent, B-form duplexes were maintained and the binding abilities of the 3'-end-modified duplexes were better than the corresponding mismatched duplexes. The digestion of modified oligodeoxynucleotides by snake venom phosphodiesterase showed that an isonucleotide strongly antagonizes hydrolysis. The DNA/RNA hybrid formed by a modified oligodeoxynucleotide and its target RNA could activate RNase H. The 3'-end-modified antisense oligodeoxynucelotides inhibited S-glycoprotein expression of SARS-CoV at the mRNA levels in insect Sf9 cells.

Signal attributes and anthropomorphic parameters were explored to develop prediction models to determine the percentage contribution of periodic-like, intermediate, and normal breathing patterns in the analyzed signals. The proposed methodology was validated employing k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and UMAP (uniform manifold approximation and projection). The presented approach applied to respiratory pattern evaluation shows that median accuracies in a considerable number of cases exceeded 0.75. Overall, parameters related to signal analysis are indicated as more important than anthropomorphic features. It was also found that obesity characterized by a high WHR (waist-to-hip ratio) and male sex were predisposing factors for the occurrence of periodic-like or intermediate patterns of respiration.

Here we collected 781 longitudinal blood samples from 306 hospitalized COVID-19+ patients, 78 COVID-19? acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, and 8 healthy controls, and performed bulk RNA-sequencing of enriched neutrophils, plasma proteomics, cfDNA measurements and high throughput antibody profiling assays to investigate the relationship between neutrophil states and disease severity or death. We identified dynamic switches between six distinct neutrophil subtypes using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering. At days 3 and 7 post-hospitalization, patients with severe disease had an enrichment of a granulocytic myeloid derived suppressor cell-like state gene expression signature, while non-severe patients with resolved disease were enriched for a progenitor-like immature neutrophil state signature. Severe disease was associated with gene sets related to neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) signatures, distinct metabolic signatures, and enhanced neutrophil activation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We found that the majority of patients had a transient interferon-stimulated gene signature upon presentation to the emergency department (ED) defined here as Day 0, regardless of disease severity, which persisted only in patients who subsequently died. Humoral responses were identified as potential drivers of neutrophil effector functions, as enhanced antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis and reduced NETosis was associated with elevated SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG1-to-IgA1 ratios in plasma of severe patients who survived. In vitro experiments confirmed that while patient-derived IgG antibodies mostly drove neutrophil phagocytosis and ROS production in healthy donor neutrophils, patient-derived IgA antibodies induced a predominant NETosis response.

All patients received CT reexaminations within 24 h after symptomatic remission. We divided patients into two groups according to the matching degree between clinical and imaging outcomes. Results: 21 patients displayed imaging progression while symptoms relieved.

Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) and high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) are considered \\"aerosol-generating procedures\\" (AGPs) in the treatment of COVID-19. We aimed to measure air and surface environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 virus when CPAP and HFNO were used, compared with supplemental oxygen, to investigate the potential risks of viral transmission to healthcare workers and patients. Methods. 30 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen, with a fraction of inspired oxygen []0.4 to maintain oxygen saturations []94%, were prospectively enrolled into an observational environmental sampling study. Participants received either supplemental oxygen, CPAP or HFNO (n=10 in each group). A nasopharyngeal swab, three air and three surface samples were collected from each participant and the clinical environment. RT qPCR analyses were performed for viral and human RNA, and positive/suspected-positive samples were cultured for the presence of biologically viable virus. Results. Overall 21/30 (70%) of participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharynx. In contrast, only 4/90 (4%) and 6/90 (7%) of all air and surface samples tested positive (positive for E and ORF1a) for viral RNA respectively, although there were an additional 10 suspected-positive samples in both air and surfaces samples (positive for E or ORF1a). CPAP/HFNO use or coughing was not associated with significantly more environmental contamination. Only one nasopharyngeal sample was culture positive. Conclusions. The use of CPAP and HFNO to treat moderate/severe COVID-19 was not associated with significantly higher levels of air or surface viral contamination in the immediate care environment.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 environmental contamination from hospitalised COVID-19 patients receiving aerosol generating procedures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, clinicians were challenged to maintain continuity of care.

Hence, in this paper, we propose the RPP algorithm to extract rare itemsets. The advantage of the RPP algorithm is that it avoids time for generating useless candidate itemsets by omitting conditional trees as RP-growth does. Furthermore, our RPP algorithm uses a novel data structure, RN-list, for creating rare itemsets.

However, there remain no very effective treatment for OAB. Pharmacotherapy is one of the best treatments, but it is not always efficient and may incur adverse events. Although behavioral therapy is another effective treatment, there are very few structured treatment manuals on how to prescribe behavioral therapy to treat OAB for whom. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a psychotherapy consisting of structured sessions to solve problems with the collaborative empiricism between therapists and patients. OAB symptoms are supposed to worsen with cognitive distortion, and CBT is expected to be effective in treating OAB by modifying such cognitive processes. In this trial, we will evaluate the efficacy of CBT for OAB. METHODS: A randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter parallel-group superiority trial will be conducted. Participants with moderate to severe OAB symptoms with or without pharmacotherapy will be recruited and will be randomly allocated 1:1 to two different groups by minimization (age, baseline OAB severity, treatment status, types of intervention, and treating institutions). The intervention group will be prescribed an individual CBT program covering six techniques in 4 sessions (30 min each), with or without pharmacotherapy. The primary outcome is the change scores in an OAB-questionnaire (OAB-q) from baseline to the end of the trial (week 13). Secondary outcomes will include other patient reported outcome measures and the frequency volume chart. All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat principle. DISCUSSION: This trial will determine the efficacy of CBT to treat OAB using a rigorous methodology. The effectiveness of CBT with a structured manual may not only lead to a new treatment option for patients suffering from OAB symptoms, but may also reduce the social burden by OAB.

Overall, respiratory tract infections remain one of the top ten leading causes of death in the US for every age group. Specific to the pediatric population, lower respiratory tract infections are the leading cause for hospitalization. This review highlights the current evidence behind e-cigarette exposure and its association with impaired innate immune function and the risk of lower respiratory tract infections. To date, various preclinical models have evaluated the direct effects of e-cigarette exposure on the innate immune system. More specifically, e-cigarette exposure impairs certain cell types of the innate immune system including the airway epithelium, lung macrophage and neutrophils. Identified effects of e-cigarette exposure common to the lungs innate immunity include abnormal mucus composition, reduced epithelial barrier function, impaired phagocytosis and elevated systemic markers of inflammation. These identified impairments in the lungs innate immunity have been shown to increase adhesion of certain bacteria and fungi as well as to increase virulence of common respiratory pathogens such as influenza virus, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Sedative and analgesic drugs are commonly used to improve the patient experience of colonoscopy, with predominant regimens being deep sedation, typically achieved with propofol, and moderate sedation, typically achieved with an opioid and a benzodiazepine. However, non-pharmacological interventions exist that may be used to improve patient experience. Furthermore, by identifying non-pharmacological interventions to increase the quality of patient experience under moderate sedation, jurisdictions facing rising use of deep sedation for colonoscopy and its significant associated costs may be better able to encourage patients and clinicians to adopt moderate sedation. Advancing either of these aims requires synthesising the evidence and raising awareness around these non-pharmacological interventions to improve the patient experience of colonoscopy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic review will be conducted that searches multiple electronic databases from inception until 2020 to identify randomised controlled trials evaluating what, if any, non-pharmacological interventions are effective compared with placebo or usual care for improving the patient experience of routine colonoscopy under moderate or no sedation. Two reviewers will independently perform a three-stage screening process and extract all study data using piloted forms. Study quality will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool V.2.0. Where multiple studies evaluate a single intervention, evidence will be quantitatively synthesised using pairwise meta-analysis, otherwise narrative syntheses will be undertaken. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This is a review of existing literature not requiring ethics approval. The review findings will be included in future efforts to develop an implementation strategy to reduce the use of deep sedation for routine colonoscopy.

This paper attempts to examine the possible effects of COVID-19 on Australia's demography over the next two decades, focusing in particular on population ageing. Several population projections were prepared for the period 2019-41. We formulated three scenarios in which the pandemic has a short-lived impact of 2-3 years, a moderate impact lasting about 5 years, or a severe impact lasting up to a decade. We also created two hypothetical scenarios, one of which illustrates Australia's demographic future in the absence of a pandemic for comparative purposes, and another which demonstrates the demographic consequences if Australia had experienced excess mortality equivalent to that recorded in the first half of 2020 in England & Wales. Our projections show that the pandemic will probably have little impact on numerical population ageing but a moderate effect on structural ageing. Had Australia experienced the high mortality observed in England & Wales there would have been 19,400 excess deaths. We caution that considerable uncertainty surrounds the future trajectory of COVID-19 and therefore the demographic responses to it.

The aim of this study is to increase understanding of the factors that influence stroke caregivers access and use of formal health and social services, from the perspective of stroke caregivers and healthcare providers. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted with stroke caregivers and health providers in Ontario, Canada using interpretive description. In-depth interviews were conducted with caregivers of survivors who experienced a stroke between six months to five years previous and healthcare providers who support caregivers and stroke survivors. All participants provided written informed consent. Interview data were analyzed using constant comparison to identify codes and develop key thematic constructs. RESULTS: A total of 40 interviews were conducted with 22 stroke caregivers at an average 30-months post-stroke and 18 health providers. Factors that influenced stroke caregivers access and use of services included: finances and transportation; challenges caregivers faced in caring for their health; trust that they could leave their family member and trust in health providers; limited information pertaining to services and a lack of suitable services; and the response of their social networks to their caregiving situation. CONCLUSION: Stroke caregivers experience significant challenges in accessing and using formal health and social services. These challenges could be addressed by increasing availability of subsidized community-based supports such as respite and counselling tailored to meet the ongoing needs of caregivers.

However, high-risk populations with a genetic predisposition for colorectal cancer could benefit greatly from novel and efficacious immunopreventive strategies that afford long-lasting protection. The achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 2 (Ascl2) has been identified as a promising target for immunoprevention of colorectal cancer, based on its induction during the formation and progression of colorectal tumors and its minimal expression observed in healthy tissue. The goal of the present study was to determine the efficacy of a protein-based vaccine targeting Ascl2 in combination with an anti-PD-1 treatment in a spontaneous colorectal cancer mouse model. This novel vaccine strategy promotes potent tumor-specific immunity, and prevents the formation of colon adenomas in mice. The results demonstrate that Ascl2 is a promising target for immunoprevention for individuals at elevated risk of developing colorectal cancer. ABSTRACT: Novel immunopreventive strategies are emerging that show great promise for conferring long-term protection to individuals at high risk of developing colorectal cancer. The KISIMA vaccine platform utilizes a chimeric protein comprising: (1) a selected tumor antigen; (2) a cell-penetrating peptide to improve antigen delivery and epitope presentation, and (3) a TLR2/4 agonist to serve as a self-adjuvant. This study examines the ability of a KISIMA vaccine against achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 2 (Ascl2), an early colon cancer antigen, to reduce colon tumor formation by stimulating an anti-tumor immune response. Vaccine administrations were well-tolerated and led to circulating antibodies and antigen-specific T cells in a mouse model of colorectal cancer. To assess preventive efficacy, the vaccine was administered to mice either alone or in combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-1. When delivered to animals prior to colon tumor formation, the combination strategy significantly reduced the development of colon microadenomas and adenomas, as compared to vehicle-treated controls. This response was accompanied by an increase in the intraepithelial density of CD3+ T lymphocytes. Together, these data indicate that the KISIMA-Ascl2 vaccine shows great potential to be a safe and potent immunopreventive intervention for individuals at high risk of developing colorectal cancer.","output":"Novel Protein-Based Vaccine against Self-Antigen Reduces the Formation of Sporadic Colon Adenomas in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper are presented mathematical predictions on the evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy of the COVID-19 pandemic based on official data and on the use of a function of the type of a Gauss error function, with four parameters, as a cumulative distribution function.

The evolution in time of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of COVID-19 in China very well approximates a distribution of the type of the error function, that is, the integral of a normal, Gaussian distribution. We have then used such a function to study the potential evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy by performing a number of fits of the official data so far available.

Resilience is considered an important protective factor in reducing the risk of psychopathology in the face of various adverse events, such as the ongoing health crisis. The aims of the current study were to: (1) evaluate the predictive utility of resilience in accounting for positive and negative moods, substance use, depression and anxiety;and (2) compare negative and positive moods experienced before the pandemic to emotions reported during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bulgaria, when the country still had low prevalence of infections and fatalities. Methods: 179 Bulgarian participants completed the international online Minnesota Global Survey on Stress and Resilience in the Face of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), which included measures of resilience, depression and anxiety, substance use, positive and negative moods experienced both before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Results: Resilience predicted higher levels of positive affect and lower anxiety, depression, and negative mood during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Bulgaria. A significant increase was found in negative mood and a corresponding decrease in positive mood in the time since COVID-19 began spreading compared to before the pandemic. Conclusions: Results suggest that the initial wave of the COVID-19 crisis impacted individuals well-being, even in countries with relatively low prevalence of COVID-19 and associated fatalities.

Aside from the continued surge in cases and the imperatives of public health concern and saving lives, economic devastation is also mounting with a global depression now seeming inevitable. There is limited attention directed towards people who have recovered from the virus and whether this metric can be useful in guiding when the economy can be re-opened. In this paper, a simpler model is presented in order to guide various countries on the (possible) re-opening of the economy (or re-opening in stages/phases) alongside risk categories and ratios. Factors that need to be considered when applying the model include the healthcare capacity in terms of the number of hospitals, beds and healthcare workers that are available to capacitate this virus. In addition, population size, physical distancing measures, socio-economic disparities, lockdown regulations in each country, and more importantly - the amount and accuracy of testing conducted, is also imperative to consider. Decisions adopted by leaders around the world have the most difficult decision to make (yet), and have to weigh up on what really matters; health or wealth. It is suggested that this model be applied in a number of states/counties and countries in order to gauge the risk of their location being re-opened, by observing their total number of recoveries in proximity to total number of cases.","output":"A mathematical model to guide the re-opening of economies during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new emerged infectious disease that is known the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is a high contagious viral infection that started in December 2019 in China city Wuhan and spread very fast to the rest of the world This infection caused million of infected cases globally and still pose an alarming situation for human lives Pakistan in Asian countries is considered the third country with higher number of cases of coronavirus with more than 200,000 Recently, many mathematical models have been considered to better understand the coronavirus infection Most of these models are based on classical integer-order derivative which can not capture the fading memory and crossover behavior found in many biological phenomena Therefore, we study the coronavirus disease in this paper by exploring the dynamics of COVID-19 infection using the non-integer Caputo derivative In the absence of vaccine or therapy, the role of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is examined on the dynamics of theCOVID-19 outbreak in Pakistan First, we construct the model in integer sense and then apply the fractional operator to have a generalized model The generalized model is then used to present the detailed theoretical results We investigate the stability of the model for the case of fractional model using a nonlinear fractional Lyapunov function of Goh-Voltera type Furthermore, we estimate the values of parameters with the help of least square curve fitting tool for the COVID-19 data recorded in Pakistan since March 1 till June 30, 2020 and show that our considered model give an accurate prediction to the real COVID-19 statistical cases Finally, numerical simulations are presented using estimated parameters for various values of the fractional order of the Caputo derivative From the simulation results it is found that the fractional order provides more insights about the disease dynamics","output":"Modeling and analysis of the dynamics of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) with Caputo fractional derivative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE In-person cadaveric anatomy laboratories allow for students to learn the intricacies of the human body but also develop skills related to communication, clinical reasoning, and interprofessional collaboration. However, the Covid-19 pandemic caused a shift from in-person course delivery to an online medium. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop and evaluate the implementation and use of an online anatomy laboratory as a replacement for an in-person laboratory component. It is hypothesized that presenting cadaveric images of gross specimens and utilizing break out rooms can mimic aspects of in-person instruction and facilitate teaching anatomy using an online modality. MATERIALS AND METHODS An anatomy course for allied heath students (Pharmacy and respiratory therapy (RT)) that included an in-person cadaveric laboratory was modified for online delivery. The laboratory component utilized cadaveric images presented by the instructor and breakout rooms for small group discussion to simulate in-person anatomy laboratory experiences. Academic performance of the online cohort was compared to previous in-person cohorts to evaluate students' learning of human anatomy in an online laboratory. Upon completion of the online course, students (n=35) completed a questionnaire containing Likert scale and open-ended questions regarding online anatomy learning. Questions related to cadaveric images presented, breakout room use and online instruction were used to evaluate the student experience of an online anatomy laboratory. RESULTS Online anatomical studies had no academic advantage or disadvantage compared to in-person instruction. From the survey results, students indicated that the online laboratories were enjoyable and helpful for learning anatomy (3.30.15 and 3.80.16 respectively). Students rated the guided cadaveric image portion very highly (4.370.13) and the use of cadaveric pictures as an appropriate learning tool in the online setting (4.070.13). Students also responded positively to the helpfulness of breakout room sessions in learning anatomy (3.140.17). Open-ended comments revealed that students appreciated the presentation of cadaveric images and the ability to ask questions in real time to the instructor. Furthermore, students noted the advantage of discussing anatomical concepts and clinical correlations with their peers in a small group breakout room format. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE Moving from an in-person to an online anatomy laboratory experience for pharmacy and RT students had no adverse effect on learning human anatomy. Health professional students found the use of cadaveric images and the use of breakout rooms for small group learning an acceptable and appropriate substitute to traditional in-person cadaveric anatomy laboratories. Based on the results of this study, online delivery of an anatomy laboratory, that was developed to simulate important aspects of in-person learning, can act as a viable alternative-learning platform for anatomical laboratory education.","output":"Online anatomy laboratory: a new way to educate allied health students."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Donald Trump's erratic and unpredictable behavior as president was, metaphorically at least, a Random Walk Combined with an inexperienced White House staff and a near total absence of any meaningful decision-making processes, the result was, routinely, unforced errors that both impeded the presidents ability to see his policy goals implemented effectively, led to poor congressional relations and, in several key cases, failures of leadership that played a role in his defeat in the 2020 election The worst policy outcome was his catastrophic response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which laid bare the pathologies of poor decision-making processes As president, Trumps record exposed institutional weaknesses that a more skilled populist or authoritarian successor may be able to exploit ? 2021 Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress","output":"The Random Walk Presidency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Les populations de sans domicile fixe ont un taux de mortalit suprieur  celui de la population gnrale.

However, considerable geographical disparities in the distribution of COVID-19 incidence existed among different cities. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of sociodemographic factors on COVID-19 incidence of 342 cities in China from a geographic perspective. METHODS: Official surveillance data about the COVID-19 and sociodemographic information in China's 342 cities were collected. Local geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) model and traditional generalized linear models (GLM) Poisson regression model were compared for optimal analysis. RESULTS: Compared to that of the GLM Poisson regression model, a significantly lower corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AICc) was reported in the GWPR model (61953.0 in GLM vs. 43218.9 in GWPR). Spatial auto-correlation of residuals was not found in the GWPR model (global Moran's I = - 0.005, p = 0.468), inferring the capture of the spatial auto-correlation by the GWPR model. Cities with a higher gross domestic product (GDP), limited health resources, and shorter distance to Wuhan, were at a higher risk for COVID-19. Furthermore, with the exception of some southeastern cities, as population density increased, the incidence of COVID-19 decreased. CONCLUSIONS: There are potential effects of the sociodemographic factors on the COVID-19 incidence. Moreover, our findings and methodology could guide other countries by helping them understand the local transmission of COVID-19 and developing a tailored country-specific intervention strategy.","output":"The effect of sociodemographic factors on COVID-19 incidence of 342 cities in China: a geographically weighted regression model analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effects of COVID-19 have gone undocumented in nomadic pastoralist communities across Africa, which are largely invisible to health surveillance systems despite the fact that they are of key significance in the setting of emerging infectious disease.

Older age, and underlying health conditions, are associated with higher risk of death from COVID-19. This study aimed to describe the population at risk of severe COVID-19 due to underlying health conditions across the United Kingdom. METHODS: We used anonymised electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD to estimate the point prevalence on 5 March 2019 of the at-risk population following national guidance. Prevalence for any risk condition and for each individual condition is given overall and stratified by age and region with binomial exact confidence intervals. We repeated the analysis on 5 March 2014 for full regional representation and to describe prevalence of underlying health conditions in pregnancy. We additionally described the population of cancer survivors, and assessed the value of linked secondary care records for ascertaining COVID-19 at-risk status. RESULTS: On 5 March 2019, 24.4% of the UK population were at risk due to a record of at least one underlying health condition, including 8.3% of school-aged children, 19.6% of working-aged adults, and 66.2% of individuals aged 70 years or more. 7.1% of the population had multimorbidity. The size of the at-risk population was stable over time comparing 2014 to 2019, despite increases in chronic liver disease and diabetes and decreases in chronic kidney disease and current asthma. Separately, 1.6% of the population had a new diagnosis of cancer in the past 5 y. CONCLUSIONS: The population at risk of severe COVID-19 (defined as either aged 70 years, or younger with an underlying health condition) comprises 18.5 million individuals in the UK, including a considerable proportion of school-aged and working-aged individuals. Our national estimates broadly support the use of Global Burden of Disease modelled estimates in other countries. We provide age- and region- stratified prevalence for each condition to support effective modelling of public health interventions and planning of vaccine resource allocation. The high prevalence of health conditions among older age groups suggests that age-targeted vaccination strategies may efficiently target individuals at higher risk of severe COVID-19.

PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of PE in COVID-19 and its associations with clinical and laboratory parameters. METHODS: Electronic medical records were searched retrospectively for demographic, clinical and laboratory data and outcomes in patients admitted with COVID-19 at 4 hospitals March-June 2020. PE on CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and perfusion scintigraphy was correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters. D-dimer was used to predict PE and the obtained threshold underwent an external validation on 85 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at a 5(th) hospital. We also assessed the association between right heart strain and embolic burden in patients with PE undergoing echocardiography. RESULTS: Four-hundred-thirteen patients with COVID-19 (230 men, aged 20-98 years, mean + SD = 60+16 years) were evaluated. PE was diagnosed in 25% (102/413, 95%CI: 21%-29%) of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, undergoing CTPA or perfusion scintigraphy. PE was observed in 29% (21/73, 95%CI:19% -41%) of ICU vs. 24% (81/340, 95%CI:20% -29%) of non-ICU patients (p=0.37). PE was associated with male sex(Odds Ratio=OR[95% CI]: 1.7[1.1C2.8], p=0.02), smoking (OR[95% CI]:1.8[1.01C3.4], p=0.04) and increased d-dimer (p<0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (p<0.001), ferritin (p=0.001) and IL-6 (p=0.02). Mortality in hospitalized patients was similar between those with PE and without PE (14%[13/102, 95%CI: 8% - 22%]vs 13%[40/311, 95%CI: 9% - 17%], p=0.98), suggesting that diagnosis and treatment of PE was not associated with excess mortality. D-dimer>1600 ng/mL predicts PE with 100% sensitivity and 62% specificity in an external validation cohort. Embolic burden was higher in patients with right heart strain among the patients with PE undergoing echocardiogram (p=0.03). CONCLUSION: Pulmonary embolism incidence was 25% in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 suspected of PE. D-dimer>1600ng/mL was sensitive for identifying which patients need CTPA.

Increasing BMI was associated with higher odds of persistence of fatigue (OR: 1.08, 1.03 to 1.13), myalgia (OR: 1.08, 1.01 to 1.14), and arthralgia (OR: 1.07, 1.02 to 1.14, p = 0.012) at 1-month. Nearly three-quarters reported one or more symptoms, with more than half of patients reported any musculoskeletal symptom at 1 month. The most common musculoskeletal symptom was fatigue, followed by back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, low back pain, and neck pain. The persistence of fatigue, myalgia, and arthralgia was related to BMI. The study results increase our understanding of the spectrum of COVID-19, which, in turn, may lead to more efficient and better care for COVID-19 survivors.","output":"Postdischarge rheumatic and musculoskeletal symptoms following hospitalization for COVID-19: prospective follow-up by phone interviews"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of the COVID\\\\19 Crisis on museums and galleries has been paramount, with the sector taking on long\\\\term recovery plans.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature to evaluate the prevalence of \\"loss of smell\\" in COVID-19 as well as its utility for prognosticating the disease severity. METHODS: An exhaustive search of the PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, LitCovid NIH, and WHO COVID-19 database was conducted through August 6th, 2020. All studies reporting the prevalence of \\"loss of smell\\" (anosmia and/or hyposmia/microsmia) in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Pooled prevalence for cases (positive COVID-19 through reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) and/or serology IgG/IgM) and controls (negative RT-PCR and/or serology) was compared, and the odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and the p-value were calculated. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 51 studies with 11074 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Of these, 21 studies used a control group with 3425 patients. The symptom of \\"loss of smell\\" (OR: 14.7, CI: 8.9-24.3) was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group when compared to the control group. Seven studies comparing severe COVID-19 patients with- and without \\"loss of smell\\" demonstrated favorable prognosis for patients with \\"loss of smell\\" (OR: 0.36, CI 0.27-0.48).

We compared the patient characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients admitted during the first and second waves of COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis of medical records of critically ill patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) at the peak period of both waves. The data on demographics, symptoms, treatment received, and outcomes of patients were recorded. RESULTS: Compared to first wave, significantly more females, younger age group, and those without underlying comorbidities required ICU admission during the second wave. The treatments received during both periods were similar except for preferential use of methylprednisolone over dexamethasone and proclivity of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation over high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). There was no significant difference in the duration of ICU stay and mortality of patients. During the first wave, the factors associated with nonsurvival of patients were advanced age, comorbidities, severe disease, and a lesser number of days on HFNC. All these factors along with higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were observed to be linked with patient nonsurvival during the second wave. CONCLUSION: In India, the second wave of COVID-19 significantly influenced ICU demographics with a predominance of females and young adults requiring critical care. During both time periods, patients received similar treatment except for the propensity to use methylprednisolone and BiPAP as opposed to dexamethasone and HFNC in second wave.

In the present study, we have examined the influence of ascorbic acid on lipid peroxidation in a model system that mimics the cell membrane, namely micelles of linoleic acid (LA), induced by chelate complexes of iron and copper ions with quinone-chelator 2-phenyl-4-(butylamino)-naphtholquinoline-7,12-dione (Q1). This quinone effectively generates reactive oxygen species and semiquinone radicals inside cancer cells via a cycling redox reaction. Here it was demonstrated that in the absence of quinone-chelator ascorbic acid significantly accelerates the lipid peroxidation induced by both Fe(II) and Cu(II) ions. It has been shown also that Q1 chelate complexes with Fe(II) and Cu(II) ions are redox active in the LA micelles oxidation. No effect of ascorbate was detected on the reactivity of chelate complex with Fe(II) ions. On the other hand, ascorbate performs pro-oxidant activity in Q1-Cu(II) complex induced reaction. We can conclude that ascorbate-driven redox cycling of Q1 may promote its anti-tumor activity.","output":"The Interplay of Ascorbic Acid with Quinones-ChelatorsInfluence on Lipid Peroxidation: Insight into Anticancer Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Primates along with many other animal taxa are forced to cope with large shifts in basic ecological conditions because of rapid anthropogenically induced changes of their habitats. One of the coping strategies for primates is to adjust their diet to these changes, and several studies have demonstrated the importance of fallback resources for this. Bonobos, like chimpanzees, might be particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation because of their high dependence on fruit availability. Little is known, however, about bonobo feeding ecology in fragmented habitats and their use of fallback resources. In this study, we investigate diet seasonal variation and the exploitation of preferred and fallback foods in a bonobo population living in forest\\\\savannah mosaics. Results show that bonobos have adapted to this fragmented habitat by feeding on only a few fruit species, including an important number of non\\\\tree species (liana, herb and savannah shrub), in comparison to populations living in dense forests. These non\\\\tree plants have been defined as fallback and non\\\\preferred foods, which are most probably consumed to maintain high frugivory. Interestingly, we identified that preferred foods are all typical of mature forests while fallback resources are mainly found in forest edges or disturbed areas. This finding indicates that bonobos prefer to use mature forests when feeding, as they do for nesting, but extend their range use to forest areas in close proximity to humans when the availability of preferred fruits is low. Finally, we show that bonobo diet relies heavily on two abundant fallback fruits: Musanga cecropioides and Marantochloa leucantha. Other studies have demonstrated that the selection of abundant fallback resources enables primates to subsist at high densities and to maintain cohesive groups, as observed at this study site. Our findings suggest that bonobos living in forest\\\\savannah mosaics can be considered as staple fallback food consumers. Am. J.

The seropositive cats were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: cats from households in which FIP had recently been diagnosed; cats from households in which FIP had not been diagnosed, but from which kittens had been relocated and subsequently died of FIP; and cats from households in which FIP had not been diagnosed. Cats in the first group were not at greater risk of developing FIP than were cats in the other 2 groups. Consequently, any household in which seropositive cats live must be considered a potential source of FCoV that can cause FIP. There was no evidence that the enhanced disease, which has been described after experimentally induced infection of seropositive cats, exists in nature. Thus, analysis of the survival of the seropositive cats over periods of up to 36 months indicated that their risk of developing FIP decreased with time, suggesting the development of immunity rather than increased susceptibility to disease.

While several observational studies have shown that the trained immunity induced by influenza vaccines can protect against some COVID-19-related endpoints, it is not yet understood whether co-administration or combination vaccines can exert additive effects on relevant outcomes. In randomized controlled trials, co-administration has proved safe, with a reactogenicity profile similar to that of either vaccine administered alone. From the immunogenicity standpoint, the immune response towards four influenza strains and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in co-administration groups is generally non-inferior to that seen in groups receiving either vaccine alone.

Unlike other IFN, the type III IFN signal through distinct receptors is limited to a few cell types, primarily mucosal epithelial cells. As a consequence of their greater and more durable production in nasal and respiratory tissues, they can determine the outcome of respiratory infections. This review is focused on the role of IFN-&#955; in the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections, with influenza as a prime example. The influenza virus is a major public health problem, causing up to half a million lethal infections annually. Moreover, the virus has been the cause of four pandemics over the last century. Although IFN-&#955; are increasingly being tested in antiviral therapy, they can have a negative influence on epithelial tissue recovery and increase the risk of secondary bacterial infections.

The raw data was processed with GeneSpring? and then used to generate figures with and without Sidak's multiple comparison correction. RESULTS: Ten genes were found to be significantly associated with adenocarcinoma. Seven of these associations remained statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Notably, AGTR2, which encodes the AT(2) angiotensin II receptor subtype, was significantly underexpressed in adenocarcinoma tissue (p < 0.01). AGTR1, ACE, ENPEP, MME, and PRCP, which encode the AT(1) angiotensin II receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme, aminopeptidase N, neprilysin, and prolylcarboxypeptidase, respectively, were also underexpressed. AGT, which encodes angiotensinogen, the angiotensin peptide precursor, was overexpressed in adenocarcinoma tissue.

METHODS: After critical appraisal of the literature, studies were selected with particular attention being paid to meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and large prospective cohort studies. For each item of the perioperative treatment pathway, available English literature was examined and reviewed. RESULTS: Patients should be permitted to drink clear fluids up to 2 h before anaesthesia and surgery. Oral carbohydrate loading should be used routinely. All patients may have an individualized plan for fluid and haemodynamic management that matches the monitoring needs with patient and surgical risk. Minimizing the side effects of anaesthetics and analgesics using short-acting drugs with careful perioperative monitoring should be encouraged. Protective ventilation with alveolar recruitment maneuvers is required. Preventive use of a combination with 2-3 antiemetics in addition to propofol-based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) is most likely to reduce PONV.

The GIMEMA CML working party recently suggested that the possibility of achieving TFR cannot be denied to any patient, and proposed specific treatment policies according to the patients age and risk. However, other international recommendations (including 2020 ELN recommendations) are more focused on survival and provide less detailed suggestions on how to choose first and subsequent lines of treatment. Consequently, some grey areas remain. After literature review, a panel of Italian experts discussed the following controversial issues: (1) early prediction of DMR and TFR: female sex, non-high disease risk score, e14a2 transcript and early MR achievement have been associated with stable DMR, but the lack of these criteria is not sufficient to exclude any patient from TFR; (2) criteria for first and subsequent line therapy choice: a number of patient and drug characteristics have been proposed to make a personalized decision; (3) monitoring of residual disease after discontinuation: after the first 6 months, the frequency of molecular tests can be reduced based on MR4.5 persistence and short turnaround time; (4) prognosis of TFR: therapy and DMR duration are important to predict TFR; although immunological control of CML plays a role, no immunological predictive phenotype is currently available.

However, what may not be widely known, is that this duty is not always absolute. In the United Kingdom, both the General Medical Council governing the practice of all doctors, as well as many other professional codes of practice recognise that, under certain circumstances, it may be appropriate to break confidentiality. This arises when there is a wider duty to protect the health of others, and when the risk of non-disclosure outweighs the potential harm from breaking confidentiality. We discuss this situation specifically in relation to genomic medicine where relatives in a family may have differing views on the sharing of familial genetic information. Overruling a patients wishes is predicated on balancing the duty of care towards the patient versus protecting their relative from serious harm. We discuss the practice implications of a pivotal legal case that concluded recently in the High Court of Justice in England and Wales, ABC v St Georges Healthcare NHS Trust & Ors. Professional guidance is already clear that genetic healthcare professionals must undertake a balancing exercise to weigh up contradictory duties of care. However, the judge has provided a new legal weighting to these professional duties: The scope of the duty extends not only to conducting the necessary balancing exercise but also to acting in accordance with its outcome [1: 189].

To address this problem, we concentrate on the basic reproduction number $R_0$, which is not sensitive to testing coverage and represents transmissibility in an absence of social distancing and in a completely susceptible population. While many variables may potentially influence $R_0$, a high correlation between these variables may obscure the result interpretation. Consequently, we combine Principal Component Analysis with feature selection methods from several regression-based approaches to identify the main demographic and meteorological drivers behind $R_0$. We robustly obtain that country's wealth/development (GDP per capita or Human Development Index) is the most important $R_0$ predictor at the global level, probably being a good proxy for the overall contact frequency in a population. This main effect is modulated by built-up area per capita (crowdedness in indoor space), onset of infection (likely related to increased awareness of infection risks), net migration, unhealthy living lifestyle/conditions including pollution, seasonality, and possibly BCG vaccination prevalence. Also, we argue that several variables that significantly correlate with transmissibility do not directly influence $R_0$ or affect it differently than suggested by naive analysis.","output":"Inferring the main drivers of SARS-CoV-2 global transmissibility by feature selection methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus 2019 pandemic and the hypothetical risk of virus transmission through aerosolized CO(2) or surgical smoke produced during minimally invasive surgery (MIS) procedures have prompted societies to issue recommendations on measures to reduce this risk. The aim of this systematic review is to identify, summarize and critically appraise recommendations from surgical societies on intraoperative measures to reduce the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission to the operative room (OR) staff during MIS. METHODS: Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar databases were searched using a search strategy or free terms. The search was supplemented with searches of additional relevant records on coronavirus 2019 resource websites from Surgical Associations and Societies. Recommendations published by surgical societies that reported on the intraoperative methods to reduce the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission to the OR staff during MIS were also reviewed for inclusion. Expert opinion articles were excluded. A preliminary synthesis was performed of the extracted data to categorize and itemize the different types of recommendations. The results were then summarized in a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Thirty-three recommendation were included in the study. Most recommendations were targeted to general surgery (13) and gynecology (8). Areas covered by the documents were recommendations on performance of laparoscopic/robotic surgery versus open approach (28 documents), selection of surgical staff (13), management of pneumoperitoneum (33), use of energy devices (20), and management of surgical smoke and pneumoperitoneum desufflation (33) with varying degree of consensus on the specific recommendations among the documents. CONCLUSIONS: While some of the early recommendations advised against the use of MIS, they were not strictly based on the available scientific evidence. After further consideration of the literature and of the well-known benefits of laparoscopy to the patient, later recommendations shifted to encouraging the use of MIS as long as adequate precautions could be taken to protect the safety of the OR staff.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate CMD in patients hospitalized with COVID\\\\19, and to understand whether there is a relationship between biomarkers of myocardial injury, myocardial strain and inflammation and CMD. METHODS: 39 patients that were hospitalized with COVID\\\\19 and 40 control subjects were included to the present study. Biomarkers for myocardial injury, myocardial strain, inflammation, and fibrin turnover were obtained at admission. A comprehensive echocardiographic examination, including measurement of coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR), was done after the patient was stabilized. RESULTS: Patients with COVID\\\\19 infection had a significantly lower hyperemic coronary flow velocity, resulting in a significantly lower CFVR (2.0  0.3 vs. 2.4  0.5, p < .001). Patients with severe COVID\\\\19 had a lower CFVR compared to those with moderate COVID\\\\19 (1.8  0.2 vs. 2.2  0.2, p < .001) driven by a trend toward higher basal flow velocity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 11 to April 20, 2020, 57 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were retrospectively compared: group T (n = 30) receiving tocilizumab and group non-T (n = 27) undergoing only antivirals/antimalarials. Chest-CT and laboratory findings were analyzed before and after treatment. CT evaluation included both semiquantitative scoring and texture analysis of all parenchymal lesions. Survival and recovery analyses were also provided with KaplanCMeier method. RESULTS: In group T, no significant differences were found for CT score after treatment, while several texture features significantly changed, including mean attenuation (p < 0.0001), skewness (p < 0.0001), entropy (p = 0.0146) and higher-order parameters, suggesting considerable fading of parenchymal lesions. PaO(2)/FiO(2) mean value significantly increased after treatment, from 240  93 to 363  107 (p = 0.0003), with parallel decrease in inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, D-dimer and LDH). In group non-T, CT scoring, texture and laboratory parameters showed significant worsening at follow-up. Findings were clinically associated with opposite trends between two groups, with reduction of severe cases in group T (from 21/30 to 5/30; p < 0.0001) as compared to a significant worsening in group non-T (severe cases increasing from 6/27 to 14/27; p = 0.0473).

Beyond slowing viral transmission, strict lockdowns have severe economic consequences. This work investigated response stringency, quantified by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Trackers Stringency Index, and examined how restrictive interventions affected infection rates and gross domestic product (GDP) in China and OECD countries. Accounting for response timing, China imposed the most stringent restrictions, while Sweden and Japan were the least stringent. Expected GDP declines range from ?8% (Japan) to ?15.4% (UK). While greater restrictions generally slowed viral transmission, they failed to reach statistical significance and reduced GDP (p = 0.006). Timing was fundamental: governments who responded to the pandemic faster saw greater reductions in viral transmission (p = 0.013), but worse decreases in GDP (p = 0.044). Thus, response stringency has a greater effect on GDP than infection rates, which are instead affected by the timing of COVID-19 interventions. Attempts to mitigate economic impacts by delaying restrictions or decreasing stringency may buoy GDP in the short term but increase infection rates, the longer-term economic consequences of which are not yet fully understood. As highly restrictive interventions were successful in some but not all countries, decision-makers must consider whether their strategies are appropriate for the country on health and economic grounds.","output":"Trading Health for Wealth: The Effect of COVID-19 Response Stringency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As people's demand for personal privacy and data security becomes a priority, encrypted traffic has become mainstream in the cyber world. However, traffic encryption is also shielding malicious and illegal traffic introduced by adversaries, from being detected. This is especially so in the post-COVID-19 environment where malicious traffic encryption is growing rapidly. Common security solutions that rely on plain payload content analysis such as deep packet inspection are rendered useless. Thus, machine learning based approaches have become an important direction for encrypted malicious traffic detection. In this paper, we formulate a universal framework of machine learning based encrypted malicious traffic detection techniques and provided a systematic review. Furthermore, current research adopts different datasets to train their models due to the lack of well-recognized datasets and feature sets. As a result, their model performance cannot be compared and analyzed reliably. Therefore, in this paper, we analyse, process and combine datasets from 5 different sources to generate a comprehensive and fair dataset to aid future research in this field. On this basis, we also implement and compare 10 encrypted malicious traffic detection algorithms. We then discuss challenges and propose future directions of research.","output":"Machine Learning for Encrypted Malicious Traffic Detection: Approaches, Datasets and Comparative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter describes methods for growing, purifying, counting, and characterizing viruses. It also provides general principles of diagnostic virology. As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses require cell in which to replicate. The cells must express appropriate receptors and other proteins required by the virus. Cultured cells are often used to study basic steps in virus replication. Viruses can be purified away from cellular proteins and organelles using centrifugation techniques. Most viruses cannot be seen using standard light microscopes, but are often imaged using electron microscopy. Methods that combine image collection and computationally demanding image processing can provide incredible details about virus architecture. Another common way to visualize viruses is to use fluorescent tags or dyes. Although these techniques do not show detailed virus structures, they can be used to follow the progress of a virus through a cell and can provide a direct window into proteinCprotein interactions required for virus replication. A more indirect method to detect viruses is to look for virally induced changes to cell morphology. A variety of basic biochemical techniques are useful for analyzing viral proteins and nucleic acids. As the viral genomes are relatively simple, they can be manipulated/mutated to study the function of virtually any viral protein. Powerful genetic techniques can also be used to generate designer cells or organisms. There are a variety of methods for quantitating viruses. Infectivity assays measure the ability of a virus to productively infect a cell. Techniques that identify specific viral proteins or genomes provide ways to rapidly identify viruses. Some of these assays can be used at the bedside, or in the field. Powerful and inexpensive DNA sequencing technologies are being used to identify new viruses, many of which could not be found by other methods. The challenge is to understand how or if these viruses impact their hosts.","output":"Methods to Study Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first report of the unusual manifestation of pneumonia-like symptoms in Wuhan City, China was made on 31 December 2019 Within one week, the Chinese authorities reported that they had identified the causative agent as a new member of the Coronavirus family, the same family of that was responsible for MERS and SARS not so many years ago The new virus was called Novel Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) Three weeks later, the World Health Organization declared that 2019-nCoV was capable of direct human-to-human transmission, the virus had spread across several countries in three continents, and had infected close to two thousand people, of whom at least 1 in 5 quite severely The number of fatalities was fast rising Yet, the World Health Organization officially announced that there is still at present no recommended anti-nCoV vaccine for subject at-risk, nor treatment for patients with suspected or confirmed nCoV, let alone 2019-nCov It is therefore timely and critical to propose new possible and practical approaches for preventive interventions for subjects at-risk, and for treatment of patients afflicted with 2019-nCov-induced disease (Corona Virus Disease 2019;COVID-19) before the present situation explodes into a worldwide pandemic One such potential clinical protocol is proposed as a hypothesis","output":"2019-nCoV - Towards a 4th generation vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) promotes challenging immune and inflammatory phenomena. Though various therapeutic possibilities have been tested against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the most adequate treatment has not yet been established. Propolis is a natural product with considerable evidence of immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory activities, and experimental data point to potential against viral targets. We hypothesized that propolis can reduce the negative effects of COVID-19. METHODS: In a randomized, controlled, open-label, single center trial, hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients were treated with a standardized green propolis extract (EPP-AF??) as an adjunct therapy. Patients were allocated to receive standard care plus an oral dose of 400 mg or 800 mg/day of green propolis for seven days, or standard care alone. Standard care included all necessary interventions, as determined by the attending physician. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the length of hospital stay or oxygen therapy dependency duration. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury and need for intensive care or vasoactive drugs. Patients were followed for 28 days after admission. RESULTS: We enrolled 124 patients; 40 were assigned to EPP-AF?? 400 mg/day, 42 to EPP-AF?? 800 mg/day, and 42 to the control group. The length of hospital stay post-intervention was shorter in both propolis groups than in the control group; lower dose, median 7 days versus 12 days (95% confidence interval [CI] -6.23 to -0.07; p=0.049) and higher dose, median 6 days versus 12 days (95% CI -7.00 to -1.09; p=0.009). Propolis did not significantly affect the need for oxygen supplementation. In the high dose propolis group, there was a lower rate of acute kidney injury than in the controls (4.8 vs 23.8%), (odds ratio [OR] 0.18; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.84; p=0.048). No patient had propolis treatment discontinued due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of propolis to the standard care procedures resulted in clinical benefits for the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially evidenced by a reduction in the length of hospital stay.

Many changes, such as business closures, working from home, increased psychological distress, and delayed access to health care, could have unique adverse effects on patients diagnosed with chronic pain (CP). The present study sought to examine perceived changes in the CP experience brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Participants included 487 self-reported patients with musculoskeletal, neuropathic, or postsurgical pain recruited using CloudResearch. A 53-item survey was created to assess changes in perceived pain, mood, control over pain, physical activity, employment, and medical access since the onset of the pandemic. RESULTS: Results suggested a worsening of the pain experience, particularly for women, with greater pain, negative affect, sedentary functioning, perceived decline in treatment quality, and increased treatment delays. Of note, pandemic-related declines in control over pain, which represents an important clinical target, are associated with other pandemic-related declines and also mediates relevant associations.

The risks of three pathogens, influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus, in an aircraft cabin and in a hospital ward were assessed. Results showed that reducing the contact rate is relatively more effective than increasing the ventilation rate to lower the infection risk. Nonfabric surface materials were found to be much more favorable in the indirect contact transmission for RSV and rhinovirus than fabric surface materials. In the cases considered in this study, halving the ventilation rate and doubling the hand contact rate to surfaces and the hand contact rate to mucous membranes would increase the risk by 3.7C16.2%, 34.4C94.2%, and 24.1C117.7%, respectively.

Methods: An observational longitudinal study was conducted (1stMar to 15thApr 2020). All patients from the rheumatology outpatient clinic from a hospital in Madrid with a medical diagnosis of IRD were included. Main outcome: hospital admission related to COVID-19. Independent variable: ts/bDMARDs. Covariates: sociodemographic, comorbidities, type of IRD diagnosis, glucocorticoids, NSAIDs and conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs). Incidence rate (IR) of hospital admission related to COVID-19, was expressed per 1,000 patients-month. Cox multivariate regression analysis was run to examine the influence of ts/bDMARDs and other covariates on IR. Results: 3,591 IRD patients were included (5,896 patients-month).

Multiple sera were tested from 20 confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients with SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies detected by immunofluorescence (IFA) or neutralisation, and 71 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected individuals. We measured the sensitivity and specificity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies for each POCT in comparison to positive SARS-CoV-2-specific IFA and viral neutralisation, our current laboratory benchmark tests. All POCTs were found to have a low analytic sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, ranging from 27.3% to 58.2%, with a specificity between 88.3% and 100%, and a low clinical sensitivity from 45% to 65%, with a clinical specificity between 87.3% and 100%. All POCTs had an increased sensitivity when specimens were collected more than 14 days from onset of symptoms. The detection using point-of-care testing of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies after disease onset lagged behind IFA by a range of 2-0 days. POCTs promise the benefit of providing quick easy testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies.

Design/methodology/approach: A descriptive survey research design was used for this study. A total of 1,200 social media users, regardless of their professions, were randomly selected for the study betweenmid-June and July 2020. Stratified and purposive sampling techniques were used for this study. The questionnaire was designed using Google form and administered using WhatsApp and Telegram to social media users above 18 years old in Nigeria. The data generated was analyzed using descriptive (frequency count) and inferential (mean) statistics, and was presented in tables. Findings: It was found that people make use of social media during COVID-19 pandemic for diverse reasons such as listening to announcement to be informed, knowing the necessary measures to take by those infected and spreading up-to-date information on the pandemic. Social media tools were highly used during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially WhatsApp and Zoom. Findings reflected that misinformation was spread on social media. This study also showed that the infodemic associated with COVID-19 is managed by confirming the source of the information before sharing it and trusting information from reliable sources. Research limitations/implications: The result of this research will contribute to the body of knowledge on social media application, fake news and the spread of COVID-19 infodemic in Nigeria and beyond. Practical implications: Infodemic is a disaster in the health sector. The spread of infodemic is capable of misleading people, losing trust in government, health providers and health regulatory authorities. This study will help social media users to know how to properly manage social media infodemic during a pandemic or any health-related situations. Originality/value: This study is novel as it approaches fake news from a COVID-19 perspective. Very few articles emanate from the developing countries in this area. This was because most of the narrative around fake news previously centered around the Western occurrences such as the Iraqi invasion by the USA, the US presidential elections and BREXIT.

Although pulmonary health has been the primary focus of studies during the early days of COVID-19, development of a comprehensive understanding of this emergent disease requires knowledge of all possible disease manifestations in affected patients. This Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-compliant review focuses on cutaneous manifestations reported in COVID-19 patients. Approach: Literature review was conducted using the PubMed database to examine various cutaneous manifestations related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Published articles (n = 56) related to search criteria from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to June 30, 2020, were included. The primary literature articles included in this study were mainly from France, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Results: Unique to many other symptoms of COVID-19, its cutaneous manifestations have been found in people of all age groups, including children. The cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 are varied and include maculopapular, chilblain-like, urticarial, vesicular, livedoid, and petechial lesions. In addition, rashes are common in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, a new and serious health condition that shares symptoms with Kawasaki disease and is likely related to COVID-19. In addition, personal protective equipment-related skin wounds are of serious concern since broken cutaneous barriers can create an opening for potential COVID-19 infections.

To develop an antigen that is more specific, more sensitive, and easier to prepare for serological diagnosis, the antigenic sites in the MHV-nucleocapsid (N) protein were screened in this study. Sixteen antigenic linear sequences in the N protein were found using antisera obtained from mice infected naturally with MHV and a peptide array containing overlapping 10-mer peptides covering the entire N protein. From these antigenic sequences, two synthesized peptides, ILKKTTWADQTERGL and RFDSTLPGFETIMKVL, which were consistent with positions 24-38 and 357-372 of the N protein respectively, were used as antigens in ELISA. Evaluation of ELISA with these peptides revealed that both peptides were specific to anti-MHV antisera.

We hypothesised that COVID-19, a viral infection which more severely affects people with these conditions, would, in people with PWS, present atypically and result in severe outcomes. METHOD: A structured on-line questionnaire was piloted with parents and professionals at the International Prader-Willi Syndrome Organization (IPWSO) and promoted internationally through their global network. Family members/other carers were asked to complete if someone they cared for with PWS was strongly suspected or confirmed as having COVID-19. RESULTS: Over 1 year of the pandemic 72 responses were received, 47 adults, 25 children. The following underlying conditions were present: 16 people with PWS were overweight and 18 obese, five had diabetes mellitus and 18 sleep apnoea. Main presenting symptoms were raised temperature, fatigue/daytime sleepiness, dry cough, headache/pain, and feeling unwell, with illnesses generally lasting less than a week. Length of illness was not significantly related to age, BMI, sex, or genetic subtype. No one was ventilated or in an intensive care unit or died, one person was in hospital for four days needing oxygen. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our hypothesis, the PWS cohort had asymptomatic infection or mild illness. A possible explanation, supported by anecdotal evidence from parents and professional carers, is that people with PWS have a degree of innate immunity to viral infections. However, likely selection effects and a relatively low number of responses means that further evidence is needed to test this hypothesis.

We argue that the current crisis offers an opportunity for these programmes to focus on susceptible young people (aged 15-24 years), including those with mental health conditions. Young people living in poverty and with mental health problems are at particular risk of experiencing adverse health, wellbeing, and employment outcomes with long-term consequences. They are also at risk of developing mental health conditions during this pandemic. To support this population, cash transfer programmes should not only address urgent needs around food security and survival but expand their focus to address longer-term mental health impacts of pandemics and economic crises. Such an approach could help support young people's future life chances and break the vicious cycle between mental illness and poverty that spirals many young people into both socioeconomic and mental health disadvantage.","output":"Integrating youth mental health into cash transfer programmes in response to the COVID-19 crisis in low-income and middle-income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In face of COVID-19, it is very important to wear masks in public In this article, we use a kind of improved convolutional neural network algorithm DFS (detection with feature fusion and segmentation supervision) for face detection, and YCrCb elliptic skin color model is used for mask recognition We expect to better supervise the standardization of people wearing masks, through the application of this project in public places such as public transport With the applying of this project, the risk of human infection can be reduced, so as to better prevent and control the epidemic ? 2021 IEEE","output":"Recognition of the standardization of wearing masks during the epidemic of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies showed that the COVID\\\\19 pandemic caused collateral damage in health care in terms of reduced hospital submissions or postponed treatment of other acute or chronic ill patients.

This review aimed to synthesize the remission and recurrence rates following TSS for CD and identify predictors of these outcomes. METHODS: Medline (1946-) and Embase (1947-) were searched until 23rd January 2019 for original studies. A meta-analysis was performed of remission and recurrence rates. Studies were excluded if patients had prior radiosurgery/radiotherapy, mixed pathologies or interventions without separated data, follow-up not reported or population size < 20. For recurrence rate syntheses, studies with follow-up < 6 months were excluded. RESULTS: The search produced 2663 studies, of which n = 68 were included, involving 5664 patients. Remission rates after primary and revision TSS were 80% [77-82] and 58% [50-66] at last follow-up. After primary TSS, predictors of remission were micro- v macroadenomas (83% v 68%, p < 0.01), imaging-visible adenomas (81% v 69%, p < 0.01), adenomas confirmed on histopathology (87% v 45%, p < 0.01), absence of cavernous sinus invasion (80% v 30%, p < 0.01), postoperative serum cortisol (MSeC) nadir < 2 g/dL (< 55 nmol/L; 95% v 46%, p < 0.01) and lower preoperative 24-h urine free cortisol (1250 nmol v 1726 nmol, p < 0.01).

Our aim was to compare the change in the care delivered in a rheumatology nursing consultation before and during the pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Descriptive and observational study. Patient care was registered before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. The variables collected were age, sex, prevalent rheumatic disease, type of visit and reason for consultation. RESULTS: 254 consecutive patients were included before the COVID-19 pandemic for 20 days and 251 patients during COVID-19 for 10 working days. The mean age was 61 years before and 57 during the pandemic. Of both groups, 74% were women. The most frequently attended pathologies before and during COVID-19 were rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthropathies. Scheduled face-to-face visits decreased during COVID-19 (46.5% versus 1.6%), with an increased number of phone scheduled visits (2.8% versus 52.2%) and spontaneous consultations either by phone or e-mail (28.3% versus 45%). The type of scheduled visits during COVID-19 were for stable diseases (20% versus 37%) and monitoring (12% versus 38%). The reason for spontaneous consultation increased during COVID-19 and were mainly doubts regarding prevention measures and treatment optimization (13.8% versus 31.1%).

AIMS: To assess the magnitude of the psychological status and associated risk factors among nurses in the pandemic center in Wuhan, China. METHODS: In this study, we enrolled nurses from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. The questionnaire was designed to obtain basic information of the participants, and included four psychological assessment scales. We issued the questionnaires at two different points of time. We conducted the first survey on January 29 to February 2 (outbreak period) with 709 eligible responses, and the second survey on February 26 to February 28 (stable period) with 621 eligible responses. The nurses from Wuchang Fangcang shelter hospital were also enrolled in the second survey. RESULTS: During the pandemic, over one-third of nurses suffered from depression, anxiety, and insomnia. In the outbreak period, the nurses showed significantly higher risks for depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms than those in the stable period (P < 0.01). Notably, the nurses from the Fangcang shelter hospitals were more likely to present psychological problems than those from other frontline or non-frontline (all P < 0.001) units, especially for insomnia (38.3% with severe insomnia). The nurses from the frontline, with worse physical condition and uncertain concerns about this pandemic as compared to the others, were more likely to bear psychological problems. Thus, online psychological information and sufficient protection conditions were effective interventions to help mitigate psychological distress. The nurses from Fangcang shelter hospitals suffered a significantly higher risk of psychological problems than those from other units.

Patients with malignant hematological diseases are at particular risk for unfavorable outcomes, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for mechanical ventilation (MV) and death. There is paucity of data of the outcome of cancer patients with COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries. GELL is a collaborative network of hematological centers in 13 countries in Latin America. In this retrospective study, we aimed to look at the outcome of lymphoma patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Latin America. Methods: This is a retrospective study including patients with a diagnosis of lymphoma and COVID-19 infection. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma were excluded from the analysis. COVID-19 diagnosis was done by RT-PCR in all but 3 patients, in whom the diagnosis was done by serology. Active disease was defined as patients with detected disease in any setting (prior to therapy, relapse) or patients currently on treatment. Survival curves were plotted using Kaplan Meier method. Results: A total of 117 patients were available for analysis. Median age was 60 years old, and 44% of patients had at least one comorbidity, including 32% with hypertension, 17% with obesity, 11% with cardiovascular disease and 17% with diabetes. Most patients had aggressive lymphomas (67%), including 46% of patients with diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Follicular lymphomas was observed in 13% of patients and Hodgkin's lymphoma in 10% of patients. 84% of patients had active disease, and 70% of patients were currently on treatment. With a median follow up of 17 days from COVID-19 diagnosis, 78% were admitted to Hospital, 30% needed ICU support, and 27% needed MV. Importantly, 26% of patients died, most of them within 20 days from diagnosis (Fig. 1). There was no relation between active disease (p=0.23), current treatment (p=0.65) or use of monoclonal antibodies (p=0.24) with death. COVID-19 treatment data was available in 107 patients, and 72 of them received any treatment, being steroids, the most common treatment used (n=59). Conclusion: We confirm the dismal prognosis of patients with hematological malignancies and COVID-19 infection. In our cohort of Latin America patients with lymphoma and COVID-19, 26% of patients died with a median follow up of 17 days. No impact of current treatment or use of monoclonal antibodies were observed.

BACKGROUND: Nurses working in shifts are vulnerable to sleep disturbances. However, little is known about the influence of rotating day and night shift schedules and healthy lifestyle on nurses' daily sleep patterns. DESIGN: Descriptive correlational design. METHODS: Thirty-two hospital nurses working in shifts and 32 hospital nurses not working in shifts participated in data collection. Their sleep patterns were measured for six consecutive days using Fitbit Charge 3&#8482; , and information on alcohol consumption, exercise, and eating habits were assessed using a questionnaire. Data were analysed using repeated measures analysis of variance with post hoc Scheffe's test and hierarchical multiple regression analysis. The study was conducted in accordance with the STROBE guideline. RESULTS: Overall, nurses working on rotating day and night shifts had significantly shorter total sleep time, longer sleep onset latency, and lower sleep efficiency than those not working in shifts. In particular, nurses working for 3 or 4 consecutive night shifts had significantly shorter total sleep time, lower sleep efficiency and longer sleep onset latency than those working for 0-2 consecutive night shifts. Rotating day and night shifts and alcohol consumption significantly influenced sleep efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: A work schedule of &#8805;3 consecutive night shifts and the habit of alcohol consumption before bed time influence nurses' sleep efficiency.

However, construction activities tend to be limited due to the restrictions on travel, transport, and workforce availability which in turn affects the lack of materials and workforce for construction. On the other hand, the prefabricated construction method is known to provide a sustainable solution to reduce the labour and material demand. However, prefabricated construction methods are less preferred over traditional construction in Australia. This is due to the lack of knowledge on the benefits, limitation, design and construction of the prefabricated construction. Therefore, in this study, the authors have conducted a survey to identify the construction industry views on the prefabricated construction in terms of sustainability, technical, cultural, economic, practical and other aspects. A total of 310 construction professionals responded, and the data were analysed using both qualitative (thematic) and quantitative (Severity index) analyses. Results revealed that reduced construction time, high levels of quality control, and reduced on-site noise and disruption were the major benefits when using prefabricated construction compared to traditional construction. The restrictions and limitations of transport;reduced on-site design flexibility;and shortage of specialised workforce hindered the growth of prefabricated construction. These survey results also highlighted that production and manufacturing of prefabricated construction are not affected significantly by the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, significant amount of traditional, residential and commercial construction projects were replaced by prefabricated construction during Covid-19 pandemic, suggesting a future growth in prefabricated construction in Australia.","output":"The challenges confronting the growth of sustainable prefabricated building construction in Australia: Construction industry views"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is currently being examined for COVID-19 No previous meta-analysis evaluated its side effects versus placebo We conducted","output":"Hydroxychloroquine Safety: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 prevention and control policies have entailed lockdowns and confinement.

School lockdown for the Canadian sample may have played a role in these country differences. Further, girls might be at significantly more risk for mental health concerns during COVID-19, which should be considered in adolescent mental health initiatives during the pandemic. Although school disruption and separation of peers due to the pandemic likely have a role in adolescent perceived stressors and mental health, the differences between Canadian and Australian adolescents were less clear and future investigations comparing more objective pre-COVID-19 data to current data are needed.","output":"A Cross-Sectional Study Investigating Canadian and Australian Adolescents Perceived Experiences of COVID-19: Gender Differences and Mental Health Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The collection of data on SARS-CoV-2 tests is central to the assessment of the infection rate in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The aim of this study was to assess the Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) as a marker of coagulopathy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods This was a prospective, observational study where patients hospitalized due to a COVID-19 infection were eligible for inclusion. Conventional coagulation tests and ROTEM were taken after hospital admission, and patients were followed for 30 days. A prediction model, including variables ROTEM EXTEM-MCF (Maximum Clot Firmness) which in previous data has been suggested a suitable marker of hypercoagulation, age, and respiratory frequency, was developed using logistic regression to evaluate the probability of death. Results Out of the 141 patients included, 18 (13%) died within 30 days. In the final prediction model, the risk of death within 30 days for a patient hospitalized due to COVID-19 was increased with increased EXTEM-MCF, age, and respiratory frequency. Longitudinal ROTEM data in the severely ill subpopulation showed enhanced hypercoagulation. In an in vitro analysis, no heparin effect on EXTEMCcoagulation time (CT) was observed, supporting a severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) effect on prolonged initiation of coagulation. Conclusion Here, we show that hypercoagulation measured with ROTEM predicts 30-day mortality in COVID-19. Longitudinal ROTEM data strengthen the hypothesis of hypercoagulation as a driver of severe disease in COVID-19. Thus, ROTEM may be a useful tool to assess disease severity in COVID-19 and could potentially guide anticoagulation therapy.","output":"Hypercoagulation Detected by Rotational Thromboelastometry Predicts Mortality in COVID-19: A Risk Model Based on a Prospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The accrual of clinical studies poses important challenges to researchers and practitioners, especially in the field of endovascular therapy, where patient, lesion, technique, and device subtleties abound.

It is currently a global pandemic. A myriad of transmission routes have been documented, however established thus far, are respiratory droplet, contact and airborne transmissions. Susceptible persons at proximity, usually within 1-2 m, to infected persons are largely at risk of being infected. Unfortunately, health workers usually evaluate patients within this distance. Eye care professionals (ECPs) are faced with a higher risk scenario of being infected as they undertake routine clinical eye examination procedures at a close face-to-face proximity to patients, which place them at a high risk of respiratory droplets and aerosolised particles, particularly from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers. The slit lamp examination procedure is typically at a distance of between 0.25 m and 0.5 m. While undertaking certain procedures on the slit lamp, such as gonioscopy and slit lamp indirect ophthalmoscopy, the ECP holds the accessory lenses either directly on the patient's eye or at about 5-10 cm from the patient's face, respectively. The authors found it pertinent to articulate this narrative review article to guide slit lamp examination practice by ECPs during routine ophthalmic evaluation, with a view to reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to ECPs.

The use of full, standard preparation and draping with standard personal protective equipment (PPE) may not be necessary during this procedure. This is of particular interest in the current climate as we face unprecedented PPE shortages due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of 1,270 patients treated with CRPP of a supracondylar humeral fracture at 2 metropolitan pediatric centers by 10 fellowship-trained pediatric orthopaedic surgeons. One surgeon in the group did not wear a mask when performing CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures, and multiple surgeons in the group utilized a semisterile preparation technique (no sterile gown or drapes). Infectious outcomes were compared between 2 groups: full sterile preparation and semisterile preparation. We additionally analyzed a subgroup of patients who had semisterile preparation without surgeon mask use. Hospital cost data were used to estimate annual cost savings with the adoption of the semisterile technique. RESULTS: In this study, 1,270 patients who underwent CRPP of a supracondylar humeral fracture and met inclusion criteria were identified. There were 3 deep infections (0.24%). These infections all occurred in the group using full sterile preparation and surgical masks. No clinically relevant pin-track infections were noted. There were no known surgeon occupational exposures to bodily fluid. It is estimated that national adoption of this technique in the United States could save between 18,612 and 22,162 gowns and masks with costs savings of $3.7 million to $4.4 million annually. CONCLUSIONS: We currently face critical shortages of PPE due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from this large series suggest that a semisterile technique during CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures is a safe practice. We anticipate that this could preserve approximately 20,000 gowns and masks in the United States over the next year.

Methods: In this morphological and immunohistochemical study we included cutaneous biopsy samples from 12 symptomatic patients with severe and critical type SARS-CoV-2 infection (with the admission date between February and June 2020), treated in the Intensive Therapy Unit Care of Emergency County Hospital Targu-Mures, Romania. Results: The average age of our patients was 65.18  14.21 years (range 41 to 83), and 66.67% of the patients were male. The histological and immunohistochemical assessment of cutaneous biopsies: in 4 cases the histological examination revealed small fibrin thrombi in deep-seated venules and small veins of subcuticular adipose tissue, and also 4 cutaneous biopsies showed occlusive vascular thrombosis in association with massive perivascular inflammatory infiltrate destroying and compromising the integrity of the vessel wall. The immunohistochemical examination of the composition of perivascular inflammatory infiltrate showed a predominance of CD3 positive lymphocytes, admixed with CD68 positive Mo/ MF, some of them activated with FXIII expression. In the perivascular infiltrate, the presence of granulocytes and B lymphocytes was not characteristic. Conclusion: According to our observations, in severe COVID-19, the cutaneous tissue is involved even in the absence of clinically obvious changes. Due to the relatively easy accessibility of skin samples, these could be applied to determine the severity of the patient's clinical status, and to predict the necessity for anti-complement or anticoagulant treatments in the early stages of a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. ? 2021 Mircea-Catlin Co?arc et al., published by Sciendo.","output":"Vascular injury in macroscopically normal skin of patients with severe COVID-19 infection: Clinical-pathologic correlations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Borna disease virus (BDV) is a RNA-virus causing neurological disorders in a wide range of mammals.

In this review, the similar role of DAMPs is addressed, that is, of those molecules, which operate upstream of the inflammatory pathway by activating those cells, which ultimately release the cytokines. Given the still limited reports on their role in COVID-19, the emerging topic is extended to respiratory viral infections with focus on influenza. At first, a brief introduction is given on the function of various classes of activating DAMPs and counterbalancing suppressing DAMPs (SAMPs) in initiating controlled inflammation-promoting and inflammation-resolving defense responses upon infectious and sterile insults. It is stressed that the excessive emission of DAMPs upon severe injury uncovers their fateful property in triggering dysregulated life-threatening hyperinflammatory responses. Such a scenario may happen when the viral load is too high, for example, in the respiratory tract, forcing many virus-infected host cells to decide to commit suicidal regulated cell death (e.g., necroptosis, pyroptosis) associated with release of large amounts of DAMPs: an important topic of this review. Ironically, although the aim of this suicidal cell death is to save and restore organismal homeostasis, the intrinsic release of excessive amounts of DAMPs leads to those dysregulated hyperinflammatory responsesas typically involved in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in respiratory viral infections. Consequently, as briefly outlined in this review, these molecules can be considered valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to monitor and evaluate the course of the viral disorder, in particular, to grasp the eventual transition precociously from a controlled defense response as observed in mild/moderate cases to a dysregulated life-threatening hyperinflammatory response as seen, for example, in severe/fatal COVID-19. Moreover, the pathogenetic involvement of these molecules qualifies them as relevant future therapeutic targets to prevent severe/ fatal outcomes. Finally, a theory is presented proposing that the superimposition of coronavirus-induced DAMPs with non-virus-induced DAMPs from other origins such as air pollution or high age may contribute to severe and fatal courses of coronavirus pneumonia.","output":"Role of DAMPs in respiratory virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndromewith a preliminary reference to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A broncho-cutaneous fistula (BCF) is a communicating tract between the bronchus and the cutaneous surface of the thoracic wall and can be the primary presenting sign of several disease processes.

Based on the detailed review of available research and case studies reported in reputed international journals, it can be concluded that Endothelial Damage (Endotheliitis) both in small and large arteries may be an important factor of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Despite the pathological evidence of structural damage due to Endotheliitis in COVID-19 patients, the functional deterioration of the vasculature was not yet studied.Hyper activated in?ammation of the arteries may lead to sudden rise in arterial stiffness, the functional indicator of severity of cardiovascular impairment, which develops into Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) in COVID-19. Supervising and controlling the arterial Stiffness may be a way to mitigate the morbidities and mortalities caused due to COVID-19. Objective: Our primary objective was to study functional arterial damage in COVID-19 disease and establish the non-invasive measurement of Arterial Stiffness as an independent marker of disease severity.Methods: We recorded the Arterial Stiffness of 23 Mild, 21 Moderate and 20 Severe COVID-19 patients grouped on latest NIH severity criteria. Patients with pre-existing Diabetes and Hypertension were excluded. We observed Arterial Stiffness of COVID-19 patients with standard parameters like non-invasive Carotid-Femoral Pulse Wave velocity (cfPWV), Age-Normalized increase in cfPWV (ANI_cfPWV), Age-Normalized increase in Aortic Augmentation Pressure (ANI_AugP) and Heart rate-normalized Augmentation Index (HRN_ AIx).Results: Moderate and Severe COVID-19 patients have extremely significantly elevated arterial stiffness than Mild patients. In Mild patients, cfPWV (829.1  139.2 cm/s) was significantly lower than both Moderate (1067  152.5 cm/s, P < 0.0001)and Severe (1416  253.9 cm/s, P < 0.0001) patients. ANI_cfPWV in Moderate and Severe patients was significantly higher than Mild patients. (Mild: 101.2  126.1 cm/s;Moderate: 279  114.4 cm/s;Severe: 580.1  216.4 cm/s;intergroup P <0.0001).Similarly, ANI_AugP also showed a significant difference in all three groups. (Mild: -1.891 2.817 mmHg;Moderate: 3.212  3.124 mmHg;Severe: 7.246  4.908 mmHg;with P <0.0001, P =0.0031, P <0.0001 respectively). HRN_ AIx also showed a significant increase in Moderate and Severe groups in comparison with the Mild Group. (Mild: 13.34 14.18;Moderate: 5.6568.610;Severe: 24.80 7.745;intergroup P <0.0001).Conclusion: This is the first study establishing the functional deterioration of vasculature in terms of abnormal increase in arterial stiffness in proportion with severity of COVID-19 disease. Our findings strongly suggest that arterial stiffness can be an independent and accurate marker for objective risk stratification and therapeutic alleviation of the acute cardiovascular complications like MODS in COVID-19.Trial Registration: The study design was registered with the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI No. CTRI/2020/10/028489).Funding Statement: No external funding.Declaration of Interests: Authors declare no conflict of interest.Ethics Approval Statement: The study protocol, informed consents and other trial-related documents received the written approval of Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC No. AIIMS/Pat/IEC/2020/595).","output":"The COSEVAST Study Outcome: Evidence of COVID-19 Disease Severity Proportionate To Surge in Arterial Stiffness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters human host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Several surgical treatment options for SIJ fusion were described. A promising treatment option with demonstrated clinical improvement is the minimally-invasive SIJ fusion. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this case study was to document the effectiveness and safety of the new SIJ system (Torpedo?) over a period of 6 months after the minimally invasive implantation. METHODS: Patients with failed conservative treatment of painful SIJ dysfunction were enrolled successively in two centers. The Diagnosis was made by positive response to SIJ-injection with local anesthetic and at least by two positive SIJ provocation tests. The Torpedo? Implant system was used for the implantation. This workpiece made of titanium alloy is characterized by a helical profile geometry (CST: chronical spinal turn) with a hydrophilic surface. The evaluated endpoints LBP and grade of disability were assessed using a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS), and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) preoperatively and at one, three and six months postoperatively. RESULTS: 15 patients (10 female, 5 male; mean age 59  13 years) were operated on one after the other. The pain intensity decreased in all 15 patients. After 6 months, a decrease in the median values of 70% (quartiles 1-3: 65-79%) was calculated. The median values of the Oswestry Disability Index after 6 months were 62% (quartiles 1-3: 53-67) lower than before the operation. Before surgery, 13 patients (87%) were taking opioids for pain management. Six months after the operation, opioids were only needed by 3 patients (20%). Implant malpositioning was not detected on plain radiograph. No surgical site infections or perioperative complications occurred.

Of the different modifications of MIF1 and MIF2 examined, Ac-MIF1 and Ac-MIF2-NH2 significantly enhanced cell proliferation and differentiation as compared with non-modified peptides. Mice pretreated with Ac-MIF1 or Ac-MIF2-NH2 prior to cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury showed more muscle regeneration than non-pretreated controls, which was attributed to the induction of myogenic genes and reduced MSTN expression.

Nevertheless, a proportionally lower infection rate was observed compared with the German population as a whole. CONCLUSION: The data reflect a unique long-term survey of ORLs during the pandemic. Differences in the source of infection were seen between the first and second wave, confirming the need for appropriate PPE for medical professionals working in high-risk environments. Further strategies to reduce the risk of infection include consistent testing for SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare professionals, patients, and the general public as well as vaccination of high-risk medical groups.","output":"Follow-up of a national web-based survey on the SARS-CoV-2 infectious state of otorhinolaryngologists in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Little is known about the evaluative and cognitive foundations for adopting preventive measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Recognizing the existence of a gap in the knowledge describing the intention and behavior of participating in health measures, this study investigated the drivers that contribute to the intention to take health protective measures among 305 rural youth from the Dashtestan Region, Bushehr Province, and southern Iran, reached through an online survey. Protection motivation theory (PMT) served as the theoretical framework for the study. It was able to forecast variation in intentions and behaviors with accuracies of 39 and 64%, respectively. Furthermore, the variables of response efficiency, perceived severity, and self-efficacy had a positive and significant effect on protective intentions. Additionally, perceived severity, self-efficacy, and intention produced a positive and significant impression on behaviors, with most of the behavioral variance being accounted for by intention, as was hypothesized. In conclusion, it is suggested that health development including training measures that take account of both the concrete issues of health resources and technologies and of more abstract ones, such as mindset readiness, are important for engagement in positive health care behaviors. Accordingly, training-based interventions for rural youth should be contemplated, with the object of changing their intentions.","output":"Some at Risk for COVID-19 Are Reluctant to Take Precautions, but Others Are Not: A Case From Rural in Southern Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To compare Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-IV-adjusted mortality and length of stay outcomes of adult ICU patients who tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 with patients admitted to ICU with other viral pneumonias including a subgroup with viral pneumonia and concurrent acute respiratory distress syndrome (viral pneumonia-acute respiratory distress syndrome). DESIGN: Retrospective review of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation data collected from routine clinical care. SETTING: Forty-three hospitals contributing coronavirus disease 2019 patient data between March 14, and June 17, 2020, and 132 hospitals in the United States contributing data on viral pneumonia patients to the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation database between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: One thousand four hundred ninety-one patients with diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 infection and 4,200 patients with a primary (n = 2,544) or secondary (n = 1,656) admitting diagnosis of noncoronavirus disease viral pneumonia receiving ICU care. A subset of 202 viral pneumonia patients with concurrent acute respiratory distress syndrome was examined separately. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN RESULTS: Mean age was 63.4 for coronavirus disease (p = 0.064) versus 64.1 for viral pneumonia. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-IV scores were similar at 56.7 and 55.0, respectively (p = 0.060), but gender and ethnic distributions differed, as did Pao2 to Fio2 ratio and WBC count at admission. The hospital standardized mortality ratio (95% CI) was 1.52 (1.35-1.68) for coronavirus disease patients and 0.82 (0.75-0.90) for viral pneumonia patients. In the coronavirus disease group, ICU and hospital length of stay were 3.1 and 3.0 days longer than in viral pneumonia patients. Standardized ICU and hospital length of stay ratios were 1.13 and 1.46 in the coronavirus disease group versus 0.95 and 0.94 in viral pneumonia patients. Forty-seven percent of coronavirus disease patients received invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support on their first ICU day versus 65% with viral pneumonia. Ventilator days in survivors were longer in coronavirus disease (10.4 d) than in viral pneumonia (4.3 d) patients, except in the viral pneumonia-acute respiratory distress syndrome subgroup (10.2 d). CONCLUSIONS: Severity-adjusted mortality and length of stay are higher for coronavirus disease 2019 patients than for viral pneumonia patients admitted to ICU. Coronavirus disease patients also have longer time on ventilator and ICU length of stay, comparable with the subset of viral pneumonia patients with concurrent acute respiratory distress syndrome. Mortality and length of stay increase with age and higher scores in both populations, but observed to predicted mortality and length of stay are higher than expected with coronavirus disease patients across all severity of illness levels. These findings have implications for benchmarking ICU outcomes during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","output":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 ICU Patients Have Higher-Than-Expected Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-Adjusted Mortality and Length of Stay Than Viral Pneumonia ICU Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to determine what a person with vision loss considers a 'comfortable' print size to read, and examine whether this reflects any of three currently used parameters for identifying print size required for sustained reading tasks: minimum size to achieve maximum reading speed (the critical print size (CPS)); minimum size for functional reading at 80 wpm and/or a size that is double the reading acuity (representing an acuity reserve of 2:1). METHODS Forty-seven participants entering low vision rehabilitation (mean age 77 years, 24 with macular degeneration) were assessed using MNREAD charts to determine reading acuity, maximum reading speed, CPS and the minimum size allowing functional (80 wpm) reading. Comfortable print size was assessed by asking participants to identify 'the smallest print size that you would find comfortable using' on the MNREAD chart. RESULTS There was little difference between comfortable print size and CPS (mean difference 0.05 logMAR (SD 0.18); p = 0.08, limits of agreement 0.35 logMAR), and no trend for the difference between values to differ across the functional range. Size for functional reading could only be assessed for 41 participants, and the difference between this and comfortable print size varied across the functional range. Comfortable print size was consistently smaller than twice the reading acuity size (mean difference 0.11 logMAR (SD 0.17); p < 0.001), with an average acuity reserve of 1.74:1. CONCLUSIONS Asking people with visual impairment to identify a print size that is comfortable to read provides a print size similar to the CPS. This can be used as a guide in selecting magnification for sustained reading without having to undertake further analyses. Identification of perceived comfortable print size may offer a time-efficient clinical method of estimating magnification requirements, and be relevant for undertaking effective remote consultations.","output":"Is patient identification of 'comfortable' print size a useful clinical parameter for low vision reading assessment?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has placed a significant amount of stress on local and state law enforcement departments.

However, the comparative performance of automated serological assays has not been determined in susceptible patients with significant co-morbidities. METHODS: In this study, we used a large number of COVID-19 negative patient samples (n = 2030) as well as COVID-19 positive patient samples (n = 112) to compare the performance of four serological assay platforms; Siemens Healthineers Atellica IM Analyzer, Siemens Healthineers Dimension EXL Systems, Abbott ARCHITECT, and Roche cobas. RESULTS: All four serology assay platforms exhibited comparable negative percent agreement with negative COVID-19 status ranging from 99.2-99.7%, and positive percent agreement from 84.8-87.5% with positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results. Of the 2142 total samples, only 38 samples (1.8%) yielded discordant results on one or more platforms. However, only 1.1% (23/2030) of COVID-19 negative cohort results was discordant whereas discordance was 10-fold higher for the COVID-19 positive cohort at 11.3% (15/112). Of the total 38 discordant results, 34 were discordant on only one platform. CONCLUSION: Serology assay performance was comparable across the four platforms assessed in a large population of COVID-19 negative patients with relevant comorbidities. The pattern of discordance shows that samples were discordant on a single assay platform, and discordance rate was 10-fold higher in the COVID-19 positive population.

The current standard of care leads to a sustained viral response of roughly 50% of treated patients at best. Furthermore, anti-viral therapy is expensive, prolonged, and associated with serious side-effects. Evidence suggests that a poor response to treatment may be the result of a suppressed anti-viral immunity due to the presence of increased numbers and activity of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg cells). We and others have recently identified fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) as a putative effector of Treg cells, which accounts for their suppressive function through binding to Fc gamma receptors (FcR). In an experimental model of fulminant viral hepatitis, our laboratory showed that increased plasma levels of FGL2 pre- and post-viral infection were predictive of susceptibility and severity of disease. Moreover, treatment with antibody to FGL2 fully protected susceptible animals from the lethality of the virus, and adoptive transfer of wild-type Treg cells into resistant fgl2-deficient animals accelerated their mortality post-infection. In patients with HCV infection, plasma levels of FGL2 and expression of FGL2 in the liver correlated with the course and severity of the disease. Collectively, these studies suggest that FGL2 may be used as a biomarker to predict disease progression in HCV patients and be a logical target for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of patients with HCV infection.","output":"The Role of FGL2 in the Pathogenesis and Treatment of Hepatitis C Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To-date, there has not been a clear signal suggesting that asthma or treatment with inhaled steroids are a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease We have therefore explored ACE2 receptor mRNA expression, and co-factors for Sars-CoV-2 infectivity (TMPRSS2 and furin) in bronchial brushes and biopsies from people with asthma and healthy controls, and looked for relationships between asthma severity, Th2- and IL-17 dependent gene signatures, and clinical demographics (age, sex) We have looked at a cohort of 356 research participants from previously described studies The only significant association was a positive correlation between ACE2 and IL-17-dependent gene expression, and an inverse correlation between ACE2 and Th2-cytokine-dependent gene expression These data suggest that differences in ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin epithelial and airway gene expression are unlikely to confer enhanced COVID-19 pneumonia risk in patients with asthma across all treatment intensities and severity","output":"Ace2, Tmprss2 and Furin Gene Expression in the Airways of People with Asthma - Implications for Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome due to coronavirus 2 has rapidly spread worldwide in an unprecedented pandemic.

METHODS: The indexes for these systems were based on the performance of two no-notice drills for public health emergencies in Guangdong Province. Twenty experts were invited to screen the indicators during two rounds of the Delphi method to determine the weight of first- and second-level indexes through the analytic hierarchy process, and the weight of the third-level index was calculated using the percentage method. RESULTS: After two rounds of expert consultation, we obtained four first-level indicators, twenty-six second-level indicators and eighty-six third-level indicators. According to the weight calculated by analytic hierarchy process, the weights of the first-level indicators are emergency preparation (0.2775), verification and consultation regarding an epidemic situation (0.165), field investigation and control (0.3925) and summary report (0.165).

Propensity score and linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the effect of steroids, IV immunoglobulin, and biologic agents on changes in C-reactive protein, platelet counts, and lymphocyte counts over the course of PICU stay. Treatment recommendations from U.K. clinical guidelines were analyzed. Over the 6-week study period, 59 of 78 children (76%) received IV immunoglobulin, 57 of 78 (73%) steroids, and 18 of 78 (24%) a biologic agent. We found no evidence of a difference in response in clinical markers of inflammation between patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children/pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 who were treated with IV immunoglobulin, steroids, or biologics, compared with those who were not.

DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving 432 parents of young children (ages 1C6) in six South Korean cities (320 and 112 from the high and low family cohesion groups, respectively). We collected data using self-report questionnaires on parents' health promotion behavior, stress, risk perception due to COVID-19, positive psychological capital, and family cohesion, and analyzed it using stepwise multiple regressions with the SPSS program. RESULTS: The factors influencing parents' health promotion behavior differed across the family cohesion groups. For the high group, family cohesion, positive psychological capital, gender, and stress significantly affected parents' health promotion behavior (adjusted R(2) = 0.22, p < 0.001). Meanwhile, for the low group, positive psychological capital, gender, stress and parents' health status significantly affected parents' health promotion behavior (adjusted R(2) = 0.19, p < 0.001). Thus, stress, positive psychological capital, and gender were common factors of parents' health promotion behavior overall, regardless of family cohesion. CONCLUSION: Our results are meaningful in finding that parents' health-related behaviors are not only affected by their individual factors, but also by family-related factors in the COVID-19 pandemic. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The study results may act as a base for improving family-centered intervention programs to promote healthy behaviors in both parents and young children based on personal and family cohesion factors.","output":"Factors affecting parent health-promotion behavior in early childhood according to family cohesion: Focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: There are increasing concerns about the intersection between NEET (not in education, employment, or training) status and youth mental ill-health and substance use. However, findings are inconsistent and differ across types of problems. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO-CRD42018087446) on the association between NEET status and youth mental health and substance use problems. METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, ERIC, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (1999C2020). Two reviewers extracted data and appraised study quality using a modified NewcastleCOttawa Scale. We ran robust variance estimation random-effects models for associations between NEET and aggregate groups of mental ill-health and substance use measures; conventional random-effects models for associations with individual mental/substance use problems; and subgroup analyses to explore heterogeneity. RESULTS: We identified 24 studies from 6,120 references. NEET status was associated with aggregate groups of mental ill-health (OR 1.28, CI 1.06C1.54), substance use problems (OR 1.43, CI 1.08C1.89), and combined mental ill-health and substance use measures (OR 1.38, CI 1.15C1.64). Each disaggregated measure was associated with NEET status [mood (OR 1.43, CI 1.21C1.70), anxiety (OR 1.55, CI 1.07C2.24), behaviour problems (OR 1.49, CI 1.21C1.85), alcohol use (OR 1.28, CI 1.24C1.46), cannabis use (OR 1.62, CI 1.07C2.46), drug use (OR 1.99, CI 1.19C3.31), suicidality (OR 2.84, CI 2.04C3.95); and psychological distress (OR 1.10, CI 1.01C1.21)]. Longitudinal data indicated that aggregate measures of mental health problems and of mental health and substance use problems (combined) predicted being NEET later, while evidence for the inverse relationship was equivocal and sparse. CONCLUSION: Our review provides evidence for meaningful, significant associations between youth mental health and substance use problems and being NEET. We, therefore, advocate for mental ill-health prevention and early intervention and integrating vocational supports in youth mental healthcare.

Methods: 25 COVID-19 studies were included. For each, information regarding the specific data elements being collected was recorded. Data elements collated were arbitrarily divided into categories for ease of visualisation. Elements which were most frequently and consistently recorded across studies are presented in relation to their relative commonality. Results: Across the 25 studies, 261 data elements were recorded in total. The most frequently recorded 100 data elements were identified across all studies and are presented with relative frequencies. Categories with the largest numbers of common elements included demographics, admission criteria, medical history and investigations. Mortality and need for specific respiratory support were the most common outcome measures, but with specific studies including a range of other outcome measures.

Current literature describes sustained patient satisfaction levels with virtual care throughout the pandemic era. However, provider opinions on the transforming landscape are largely unknown. Objectives: The aim of this study is to better understand provider intentions and limitations to telehealth adoption, along with preferences by various specialties and in various settings. Methods: A mixed-methods study design was used. An attitudinal survey was sent to 2,633 health care providers at a large, quaternary, integrated health system. The survey collected deidentified quantitative and qualitative data on factors influencing provider use, satisfaction, and concerns with telehealth during and after the initial pandemic-era restrictions. Results: Five hundred eighteen providers participated in the survey. Utilization of telehealth was largely motivated by (1) improving patient access (mean 29.3%; range 28-31.6%) and (2) patient interest (mean 23%; range 17.1-28.8%). Barriers included (1) technology limitations (mean 16.1%; range 12.4-23.8%) and (2) reimbursement uncertainties (mean 15.2%; range 4.8-18.8%). Preference for virtual care was reported to be highest in ambulatory settings, including direct-to-patient care and outpatient care. Discussion: Provider preference for telehealth, regardless of specialty or health care setting, revolves around a consumer-centric care delivery model, with increased access to care being a central theme. While provider values are patient oriented, this study found that concerns included connectivity, quality, and patient privacy. Amid changing care standards and regulations, provider preference is supportive of virtual care platforms, both now and postpandemic.","output":"Assessing Telehealth Through the Lens of the Provider: Considerations for the Post-COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Population-based data on the current Covid-19 pandemic is scarce. This study investigated incidence and risk to suffer Covid-19 by baseline underlying conditions in people &#8805;50 years in Tarragona region across march-april 2020. METHODS: Population-based retrospective cohort study involving 79,071 adults &#8805;50 years-old in Tarragona region (Southern Catalonia, Spain). Cohort characteristics (age, sex, residence, vaccinations history and comorbidities) were established at baseline, and Covid-19 cases occurring between 01/03/2020-30/04/2020 were registered. Cox regression analysis calculating Hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted by age, sex and comorbidities was used to estimate risk for Covid-19. RESULTS: Across study period, 1,547 cohort members were PCR tested (22.6% positive) and 367 were presumptive cases without PCR tested. Considering PCR-confirmed Covid-19, incidence (per 100,000 persons-period) was 441 overall (248, 141, 424, 1,303 and 3,135 in 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89 and &#8805;90 years-old, respectively; 380 in men and 497 in women; 259 in community-dwelling and 10,571 in nursing-home). By comorbidities, maximum incidence emerged among persons with neurological disease (2,723), atrial fibrillation (1,348), chronic renal failure (1,050), cardiac disease (856), respiratory disease (798) and diabetes (706). Lower incidence appeared in rheumatic diseases (230) and smokers (180). In multivariable analysis focused on community-dwelling individuals (N=77,671), only cardiac disease (HR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.01-2.15; p=0.045) and respiratory disease (HR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.00-3.02; p=0.051) were associated with an increased risk, whereas smoking (HR:0.43; 95% CI: 0.25-0.74; p=0.002) and influenza vaccinated (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.43-0.92; p=0.015) appeared associated with a decreased risk.

They are particularly important for crisis-affected populations that typically reside in settings characterised by overcrowding, inadequate access to healthcare and resource limitations. To describe the landscape of research and identify evidence gaps concerning the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of NPIs among crisis-affected populations and informal settings, we conducted a systematic scoping review of the published evidence. Methods We systematically reviewed peer-reviewed articles published between 1970 and 2020 to collate available evidence on the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of NPIs in crisis-affected populations and informal settlements. We performed quality assessments of each study using a standardised questionnaire. Results Our review included 158 studies published in 85 peer-reviewed articles. Most research used low quality study designs. The acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of NPIs was highly context dependent. In general, simple and cost-effective interventions such as community-level environmental cleaning and provision of water, sanitation and hygiene services, and distribution of items for personal protection such as insecticide-treated nets, were both highly feasible and acceptable. Logistical, financial, and human resource constraints affected both the implementation and sustainability of measures. Community engagement emerged as a strong factor contributing to the effectiveness of NPIs. Conversely, measures that involve potential restriction on personal liberty such as case isolation were found to be less acceptable to the community. Conclusion Overall, the evidence base was patchy, with substantial knowledge gaps between differing between settings and pathogens. Although implementation of NPIs presents unique practical challenges, it is critical that the lessons learned are shared with the wider community to build a robust evidence base.","output":"Feasibility, Acceptability, and Effectiveness of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control in Crisis-Affected Settings and Informal Settlements: A Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the deadly virus COVID-19 is said to infect 17.3Cr people around the globe since 2019.

These case studies targeted a variety of health-promoting behaviors: (1) children washing their hands to prevent viral epidemics; (2) parents vaccinating their children to stem the resurgence of infectious diseases; (3) adults completing the full course of an antibiotic prescription to reduce antibiotic resistance; and (4) children eating a variety of healthy foods to improve unhealthy diets. Simply telling people to engage in these behaviors has been largely ineffective-if anything, concern about these issues is mounting. But in each case, teaching participants coherent explanatory frameworks for understanding health recommendations has shown great promise, with such theory-based explanations outperforming state-of-the-art interventions from national health authorities. We contrast theory-based explanations both with simply listing facts, information, and advice and with providing a full-blown educational curriculum, and argue for providing the minimum amount of information required to understand the causal link between a target behavior and a health outcome.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to statistically compare the outcomes of the two strategies, represented by data from Thailand and Sweden, respectively. METHODS: Data for COVID-19 pandemic control from Thailand, representing social restriction, versus data from Sweden, representing the herd immunity plan, collected from January 13 to May 31, 2020, were analyzed by using the SIR (susceptible, infectious, recovered) model. RESULTS: The SIR model analysis demonstrated a beneficial effect of each model on the attenuation of the mortality rate, with lower mortality in social restriction and shorter overall pandemic duration in the herd immunity plan. However, the herd immunity plan demonstrated a higher mortality rate than social restriction (46.9% versus 1.9%) despite the later entry of the virus in Sweden. When the SIR model was used for predicting the COVID-19 status, Sweden was shown to likely end its COVID-19 epidemic earlier than Thailand (268 vs. 368 days). With the nonlinear estimation, at least one log difference between total confirmed cases versus active cases could be used as an indicator for relaxation of the lockdown policy in Thailand. CONCLUSIONS: Both the social restriction and herd immunity plans are beneficial for COVID-19 pandemic control in terms of the amelioration of pandemic mortality.

PCR detection of 14 respiratory viruses was performed in nasal washes, and results were quantified in copies per milliliter. A total of 141 cases and 157 controls were included.

Rhinovirus (RV) was frequently detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for quantitative rhinovirus detection showed that cutoff values for clinical relevance are feasible for RV. In contrast to rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was rarely detected in controls, suggesting that a positive RSV test result is almost always of clinical relevance, independent of viral quantity. In conclusion, our study shows that asymptomatic carriage of a respiratory virus occurs frequently in young children.

SARS-CoV-2, Ebola virus, and Nipah virus are examples of such viruses that have caused deadly epidemics and pandemics when spilled over from bats into human and animal populations2,3.

However, metagenomic surveys in bats often do not result in full-length viral sequences that can be used to regenerate such viruses for targeted characterization4. Here, we identify and characterize a novel morbillivirus from a vespertilionid bat species (Myotis riparius) in Brazil, which we term myotis bat morbillivirus (MBaMV). There are 7 species of morbilliviruses including measles virus (MeV), canine distemper virus (CDV) and rinderpest virus (RPV)5. All morbilliviruses cause severe disease in their natural hosts6C10, and pathogenicity is largely determined by species specific expression of canonical morbillivirus receptors, CD150/SLAMF111 and NECTIN412. MBaMV used Myotis spp CD150 much better than human and dog CD150 in fusion assays. We confirmed this using live MBaMV that was rescued by reverse genetics. Surprisingly, MBaMV replicated efficiently in primary human myeloid but not lymphoid cells. Furthermore, MBaMV replicated in human epithelial cells and used human NECTIN4 almost as well as MeV.

This study examined 1) the correlates of suicide risk in this population overall and by race and 2) the moderating role of race in these associations. METHODS: We investigated correlates of clinician-rated suicide risk at baseline in a statewide sample of 2,827 Black and 14,022 White adults with criminal-legal involvement who engaged in community-based behavioral health treatment. Regression-based approaches were used to model suicide risk and test for evidence of interaction effects. RESULTS: Findings showed the strongest correlates of suicide risk were greater behavioral health needs, evidence of self-harm, and a primary mental health diagnosis or co-occurring diagnosis. In race-specific analyses, correlates of suicide risk were mostly similar for both Black and White clients, with a couple exceptions. Interaction terms testing between-group effects on correlates of suicide risk were non-significant.

Our study evaluated the analgesic efficacy and safety of lower-dose diclofenac submicron particle capsules in patients with acute pain following elective surgery. METHODS A phase 3, multicenter, double-blind study enrolled 428 patients, aged 18 to 65 years, with moderate-to-severe pain following bunionectomy under regional anesthesia. Patients experiencing a pain intensity rating of  40 mm on a 100-mm Visual Analog Scale were randomized to receive lower-dose diclofenac submicron particle capsules (35 or 18 mg, 3 times daily [TID]), celecoxib (200 mg, twice daily [BID], 400-mg loading dose), or placebo. The primary efficacy parameter was the overall (summed) pain intensity difference measured over 0 to 48 hours (SPID-48). Secondary efficacy parameters included pain intensity difference (PID) at scheduled assessments. RESULTS Lower-dose diclofenac submicron particle capsules 35 mg TID (524.05; P < 0.001), 18 mg TID (393.25; P = 0.010), and celecoxib 200 mg BID (390.22; P = 0.011) demonstrated significant pain control compared with placebo (77.10) for the primary efficacy parameter, mean SPID-48.

The presence of COVID-19 symptoms (new onset continuous cough, fever, loss of taste and/or loss of smell) in tracheostomy staff and patient related data were analysed Result: Among the responders (72/122), compliance with personal prophylaxis equipment use was 100%. Eleven (15%,11/72) reported key COVID-19 symptoms and self-isolated. 10 had a COVID-19 swab test and three tested positive. One staff attended (1/72) hospital for symptomatic treatment, none required hospitalisation. 43/72 staff (60%) underwent a COVID-19 antibody test, 18.6% (8/43) were positive Among the tracheostomised patients, the mean age was 58 years(29- 78) and 65.5% were males. The median time from intubation to ST was 15 days (range 5-33, IQR=9). There were no tracheostomy related deaths and overall mortality was 11%(6/55) Conclusion: Safe delivery of tracheostomy during a pandemic like COVID-19 is possible with strict adherence to personnel protective equipment, surgical protocols and regulation of traffic flow in theatres to mitigate the potential transmission of COVID-19 among surgical staff Take-home Message: Compliance with PPE, adherence to tracheostomy protocol and local modifications can mitigate potential COVID-19 transmission among health care personnel .","output":"Safe delivery of surgical tracheostomies in COVID-19 patients during the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the 56th Global Annual Meeting of the Drug Information Association (DIA), attendees met virtually during the height of the global COVID-19 pandemic for \\"rapid cross-stakeholder, cross-border collaboration\\" to support health worldwide.

The aim of this work is to provide evidence that similar inflammatory mechanisms exist in synovial membrane (n = 24) obtained from three pathologies presenting altogether an inflammatory gradient: OA, chronic pyrophosphate arthropathy (CPPA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Synovial biopsies were first characterized by a histological score based on synovial hyperplasia and infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells, polymorphonuclear and macrophages. All biopsies were also analyzed by 2D-nano-UPLC-ESI-Q-Orbitrap for protein identification and quantification. Protein levels were correlated with the histological score. Histological score was in the range of 3 to 8 for OA, 5 to 13 for CPPA and 12 to 17 for RA. Of the 4,336 proteins identified by mass spectrometry, 51 proteins were selected for their strong correlation (p < 0.001) with the histological score of which 11 proteins (DNAJB11, CALR, ERP29, GANAB, HSP90B1, HSPA1A, HSPA5, HYOU1, LMAN1, PDIA4, and TXNDC5) were involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Protein levels of S100A8 and S100A9 were significantly higher in RA compared to OA (for both) or to CPPA (for S100A8 only) and also significantly correlated with the histological score. Eighteen complement component proteins were identified, but only C1QB and C1QBP were weakly correlated with the histological score. This study highlights the inflammatory gradient existing between OA, CPPA and RA synovitis either at the protein level or at the histological level.

Methods & Materials In Guyana, there are few clinicians trained in Critical-Care Medicine (CCM). The high incidence of ventilator dependence in seriously ill SARS-CoV2 patients, combined with a dearth of CCM practitioners competent in complex mechanical ventilation management left Guyana ill prepared to manage these patients. This knowledge deficit was further exacerbated in that many clinicians at our National Infectious Diseases Hospital were co-opted into CCM roles from other specialties with little to no CCM training. We have a very small core of Pediatric Surgical Critical Care Medicine staff that was formally trained in PCCM outside of Guyana. This core was instrumental in establishing a unique and formal Pediatric Critical-Care Medicine Micro-Modular Fellowship (PCCM-MMF) program that allowed the creation of Guyana's only Pediatric ICU. A significant number of that core are also involved in Guyanas National COVID Task Force. Given that all graduates of our PCCM-MMF program are extensively trained in Lung Protective Ventilation, it was very appropriate to utilize them to augment Adult critical care capacity. Thirty physicians with primarily adult practices and little to no previous knowledge of ventilator management were enrolled in a multi-modal triphasic mechanical ventilation short course facilitated by PCCM staff. Results We were able to rapidly enable two cohorts of 15 Adult clinicians to competently address critical knowledge deficits and staffing shortfalls. We improved morbidity and mortality amongst our mechanically ventilated adult COVID-19 patients, as well as relieved significant multifactorial caregiver strain. Conclusion Our successful utilization of PCCM staff as Mechanical Ventilation didactic and clinical educators for an Adult patient population carries implications for cross disciplinary Knowledge Translation and Implementation Science in a wide variety of practice milieus.

A sample of 1,929 participants answered an online survey, however 1,874 were included in the analysis. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating habits was assessed inquiring about participants' intake of fruits, vegetables, fried foods, and sweets during the pandemic. Physical activity was assessed by asking participants about their weekly frequency, intensity and number of minutes/hours engaging in structured physical activities per week. Participants were then stratified into categories based on moderate-to-vigorous intensity (0C30; 31C90; 91C150; 151C300; and >300 min/week) and into active (150 min) or inactive (<150 min). Increased sweets consumption was the most commonly reported change to eating habits (42.5%), followed by an increase in the consumption of vegetables (26.6%), fruits (25.9%), and fried foods (17.9%). Physical activity practice was related to lower consumption of fried foods (OR = 0.60; p < 0.001) and sweets (OR = 0.53; p < 0.001). A cluster analysis revealed subjects with higher the level of physical activity was more likely to follow a healthy diet (p < 0.001). Thus, physical activity was positively associated with healthier eating habits.

We sought to determine the efficacy of a standardized preparation of E purpurea in reducing symptom severity and duration of the common cold. METHODS A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design was used. Patients received either 100 mg of E purpurea (freeze-dried pressed juice from the aerial portion of the plant) or a lactose placebo 3 times daily until cold symptoms were relieved or until the end of 14 days, whichever came first. Symptoms (sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal congestion, headache, sore or scratchy throat, hoarseness, muscle aches, and cough) were scored subjectively by the patient and recorded daily in a diary. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the survival function of time to resolution in each group. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare time to resolution between the 2 groups. RESULTS One hundred twenty-eight patients were enrolled within 24 hours of cold symptom onset. Group demographic distribution was comparable for sex, age, time from symptom onset to enrollment in the study, average number of colds per year, and smoking history. No statistically significant difference was observed between treatment groups for either total symptom scores (P range,.29-.90) or mean individual symptom scores (P range,.09-.93). The time to resolution of symptoms was not statistically different (P =.73). CONCLUSIONS Some studies have concluded that Echinacea effectively reduces the symptoms and duration of the common cold.

In this paper, we present how to construct a multi-attribute decision support system for choosing between countermeasure strategies, such as lockdowns, designed to mitigate the effects of COVID-19. Such an analysis can evaluate both the short term and long term efficacy of various candidate countermeasures. The expected utility scores of a countermeasure strategy capture the expected impact of the policies on health outcomes and other measures of population well-being. The broad methodologies we use here have been established for some time. However, this application has many novel elements to it: the pervasive uncertainty of the science;the necessary dynamic shifts between regimes within each candidate suite of countermeasures;and the fast moving stochastic development of the underlying threat all present new challenges to this domain. Our methodology is illustrated by demonstrating in a simplified example how the efficacy of various strategies can be formally compared through balancing impacts of countermeasures, not only on the short term (e.g. COVID-19 deaths) but the medium to long term effects on the population (e.g increased poverty).","output":"Building A Bayesian Decision Support System for Evaluating COVID-19 Countermeasure Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with COVID-19 infection presents with a broad clinical spectrum of symptoms and complications. As a consequence nutritional requirements are not met, resulting in weight- and muscle loss, and malnutrition. The aim of the present study is to delineate nutritional complaints, the (course of the) nutritional status and risk of sarcopenia of COVID-19 patients, during hospitalisation and after discharge. METHODS: In this prospective observational study in 407 hospital admitted COVID-19 patients in four university and peripheral hospitals, data were collected during dietetic consultations. Presence of nutrition related complaints (decreased appetite, loss of smell, changed taste, loss of taste, chewing and swallowing problems, nausea, vomiting, feeling of being full, stool frequency and consistency, gastric retention, need for help with food intake due to weakness and shortness of breath and nutritional status (weight loss, BMI, risk of sarcopenia with SARC-F &#8805;4 points) before, during hospital stay and after discharge were, where possible, collected. RESULTS: Included patients were most men (69%), median age of 64.8  12.4 years, 60% were admitted to ICU at any time point during hospitalisation with a median LOS of 15 days and an in-hospital mortality rate of 21%. The most commonly reported complaints were: decreased appetite (58%), feeling of being full (49%) and shortness of breath (43%). One in three patients experienced changed taste, loss of taste and/or loss of smell. Prior to hospital admission, 67% of the patients was overweight (BMI >25 kg/m2), 35% of the patients was characterised as malnourished, mainly caused by considerable weight loss. Serious acute weight loss (>5 kg) was showed in 22% of the patents during the hospital stay; most of these patients (85%) were admitted to the ICU at any point in time. A high risk of sarcopenia (SARC-F &#8805; 4 points) was scored in 73% of the patients during hospital admission. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, one in five hospital admitted COVID-19 patients suffered from serious acute weight loss and 73% had a high risk of sarcopenia. Moreover, almost all patients had one or more nutritional complaints. Of these complaints, decreased appetite, feeling of being full, shortness of breath and changed taste and loss of taste were the most predominant nutrition related complaints. These symptoms have serious repercussions on nutritional status. Although nutritional complaints persisted a long time after discharge, only a small group of patients received dietetic treatment after hospital discharge in recovery phase. Clinicians should consider the risks of acute malnutrition and sarcopenia in COVID-19 patients and investigate multidisciplinary treatment including dietetics during hospital stay and after discharge.","output":"Poor nutritional status, risk of sarcopenia and nutrition related complaints are prevalent in COVID-19 patients during and after hospital admission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Transparent and robust real-world evidence sources are increasingly important for global health, including cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to identify global real-world data (RWD) sources for heart failure (HF), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and atrial fibrillation (AF).

Data were gathered regarding the presence of chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities; the distribution, morphology, density, location, and stage of abnormal shadows on chest CT; and observing the correlation between the severity of chest infection and lymphocyte ratio and blood oxygen saturation (SPO2) in patients. RESULTS: Chest CT revealed abnormal lung shadows in 110 patients. Regarding lesion distribution, multi-lobe lesions in both lungs were present in most patients (80 cases; 72.7%). Lesions most frequently involved both the peripheral zone and the central zone (62 cases; 56.4%). Regarding lesion morphology, 56 cases (50.1%) demonstrated patchy shadows that were partially fused into large areas. Thirty cases showed ground-glass opacity (27.3%), 30 cases showed the consolidation change (27.3%), and the remaining 50 cases showed both types of changes (45.4%).

Therefore, it is critical to unravel the molecular mechanisms that allow SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses to infect and overtake the host machinery of human cells. Coronavirus replication triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a key host cell pathway widely believed essential for viral replication. We examined the activation status and requirement of the master UPR sensor IRE1 kinase/RNase and its downstream transcription factor effector XBP1s, which is processed through an IRE1-mediated mRNA splicing event, in human lung-derived cells infected with betacoronaviruses. We found human respiratory coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the murine coronavirus (MHV) all induce ER stress and strongly trigger the kinase and RNase activities of IRE1 as well as XBP1 splicing. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 only partially activates IRE1 whereby it autophosphorylates, but its RNase fails to splice XBP1. Moreover, IRE1 was dispensable for optimal replication in human cells for all coronaviruses tested. Our findings demonstrate that IRE1 activation status differs upon infection with distinct betacoronaviruses and is not essential for efficient replication of any of them. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 actively inhibits the RNase of autophosphorylated IRE1 through an unknown mechanism, perhaps as a strategy to eliminate detection by the host immune system. Importance SARS-CoV-2 is the third lethal respiratory coronaviruses after MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV to emerge this century, causing millions of deaths world-wide. Other common coronaviruses such as OC43 cause less severe respiratory disease. Thus, it is imperative to understand the similarities and differences among these viruses in how each interacts with host cells. We focused here on the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) pathway, part of the host unfolded protein response to virus-induced stress. We found that while MERS-CoV and OC43 fully activate the IRE1 kinase and RNase activites, SARS-CoV-2 only partially activates IRE1, promoting its kinase activity but not RNase activity. We propose that SARS-CoV-2 prevents IRE1 RNase activation as a strategy to eliminate detection by the host immune system.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 diverges from other betacoronaviruses in only partially activating the IRE1/XBP1 ER stress pathway in human lung-derived cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this global health emergency, most information organizations have either closed their premises or operated with restrictions in their services, staff, and patrons, at the same time they are called to cope with significant and ongoing changes on services, spaces, and other professional aspects.

Due to the chronic nature of this disease, regular follow-up, lifestyle changes, and adherence to recommendations can reduce the complications and improve the quality of life among elderly individuals. Given the importance of using educational methods that are based on the patient's age and disease stage, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of using a peer group on self-care, adherence, and quality of life in elderly people. METHOD: This single-blind clinical trial was conducted on 30 old patients with coronary artery disease aged 60 years in Shiraz from March to June 2021. The patients were selected using simple random sampling and were then randomly assigned to the peer education and control groups (15 participants in each group) via permuted block randomization. The patients in the peer education group received the necessary education about medications, lifestyle, daily activities, self-care, and adherence through three educational clips by educated peer. The patients in the control group received routine education using two clips by the ward nurses. The levels of self-care, adherence, and quality of life were assessed in the intervention and control groups before and one month after the intervention. Data analysis was performed by SPSS 20 software using an independent t-test, paired sample t-test, and chi-square test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Findings. The results showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to the mean scores of self-care and quality of life before the intervention (P > 0.05). Following the educational intervention, however, a statistically significant difference was found between the two groups concerning the mean scores of self-care and adherence (P < 0.05). Moreover, the mean differences between the two groups regarding the three variables were statistically significant before and after the intervention (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Education based on multimedia clips by peer was effective in increasing the mean scores of self-care, adherence, and quality of life among the elderly people with coronary artery disease. Given the low cost, high effectiveness, and decrease in the nurses' workload, this method is recommended to be used alongside other methods in order to educate elderly individuals suffering from coronary artery disease.","output":"The Effect of Using Peer on Self-Care, Quality of Life, and Adherence in Elderly People with Coronary Artery Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been routinely cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblast feederlayers with a medium containing animal materials.

Extended postponement of high-stakes exams due to health risk hereby reduces productivity and progress in later years. Several countries decided to organize the exams online. Since many other countries with large education boards had an inadequate infrastructure and insufficient resources during the emergency, education policy experts considered a solution to simultaneously protect public health and fully resume high-stakes exams -by canceling offline exam and introducing a uniform assessment process to be followed across the states and education boards. This research proposes a novel system using an AI model to accomplish the complex task of evaluating all students across education boards with maximum level of fairness and analyzes the ability to fairly appraise exam grades in the context of high-stakes examinations during SARS-CoV-2 emergency. Basically, a logistic regression classifier on top of a deep neural network is used to output predictions that are as fair as possible for all learners. The predictions of the proposed grade-awarding system are explained by the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) framework. SHAP allowed to identify the features of the students' portfolios that contributed most to the predicted grades. In the setting of an empirical analysis in one of the largest education systems in the Global South, 81.85% of learners were assigned fair scores while 3.12% of the scores were significantly smaller than the actual grades, which would have had a detrimental effect if it had been applied for real.

Forty-nine (70%) patients required respiratory support: 14 (20.0%) noninvasive mechanical ventilation, 20 (28.6%) invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), 7 (10%) prone position, 2 (2.8%) inhaled nitric oxide, and 1 (1.4%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Nine (45%) of the 20 patients requiring IMV were extubated by day 14 with median IMV duration of 218 (IQR 79, 310.4) hours. Presence of ARDS was significantly associated with duration of PICU and hospital stay, and lower probability of PICU and hospital discharge at hospital day 14 (P < .05 for all).

Women experience unique health risks and outcomes influenced by their gender, and this narrative review aims to outline how these differences are exacerbated in the Covid-19 pandemic. OBSERVATIONS: It has been well described that men suffer from greater morbidity and mortality once infected with SARS-CoV-2. This review analyzed the health, economic, and social systems that result in gender-based differences in the areas healthcare workforce, reproductive health, drug development, gender-based violence, and mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic. The increased risk of certain negative health outcomes and reduced healthcare access experienced by many women are typically exacerbated during pandemics. We assess data from previous disease outbreaks coupled with literature from the Covid-19 pandemic to examine the impact of gender on womens SARS-CoV-2 exposure and disease risks and overall health status during the Covid-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Gender differences in health risks and implications are likely to be expanded during the Covid-19 pandemic. Efforts to foster equity in health, social, and economic systems during and in the aftermath of Covid-19 may mitigate the inequitable risks posed by pandemics and other times of healthcare stress.","output":"Health Risks and Outcomes that Disproportionately Affect Women during the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artificial intelligence and its primary subfield, machine learning, have started to gain widespread use in medicine, including the field of kidney transplantation.

This requires a deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HIVs entry into the CNS, latency establishment, persistence, and reversal. Therefore, representative CNS culture models that reflect the intercellular dynamics and pathophysiology of the human brain are urgently needed in order to study the CNS viral reservoir and HIV-induced neuropathogenesis. In this study, we characterized a human cerebral organoid model in which microglia grow intrinsically as a CNS culture model to study HIV infection in the CNS. We demonstrated that both cerebral organoids and isolated organoid-derived microglia (oMG), infected with replication-competent HIVbal reporter viruses, support productive HIV infection via the CCR5 co-receptor. Productive HIV infection was only observed in microglial cells. Fluorescence analysis revealed microglia as the only HIV target cell. Susceptibility to HIV infection was dependent on the co-expression of microglia-specific markers and the CD4 and CCR5 HIV receptors. Altogether, this model will be a valuable tool within the HIV research community to study HIVCCNS interactions, the underlying mechanisms of HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND), and the efficacy of new therapeutic and curative strategies on the CNS viral reservoir.","output":"Characterization of HIV-1 Infection in Microglia-Containing Human Cerebral Organoids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients needing oxygen and ventilation by 18% and 36%, respectively.

Here we report inducible expression of CB1R in the liver by high-fat and high sugar diet and CB2R in cortical neurons by methamphetamine. While there is less controversy about hepatocyte CB1R, the presence of functional neuronal CB2R is still debated to date. We found that neuron CB2R basal expression was higher than that of hepatocyte CB1R by measuring mRNA levels of specific isoform CB2A in neurons isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and CB1A in hepatocytes isolated by collagenase perfusion of liver. For in vivo studies, we generated hepatocyte, dopaminergic neuron, and microglia-specific conditional knockout mice (Abl-Cnr1(), Dat-Cnr2(), and Cx3cr1-Cnr2()) of CB1R and CB2R by crossing Cnr1(f/f) and Cnr2(f/f) strains to Abl-Cre, Dat-Cre, and Cx3cr1-Cre deleter mouse strains, respectively.

METHODS: Two hundred twenty-one AE patients and 229 age- and sex-matched controls were included in this study. We measured the levels of ATAbs (anti-thyroglobulin antibodies [TgAb], anti-thyroid peroxidase anti-bodies [TPOAb]) and thyroid hormones in all the individuals. In addition, the association of thyroid autoimmunity/dysfunctions with functional outcomes of AE was identified by using logistic regression and KaplanCMeier analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of TPOAb-positive and TgAb-positive was significantly higher in AE patients (16.3% and 16.7%, respectively) as compared with controls (9.6% and 7.4%, respectively; P = 0.034 and P = 0.002, respectively). In addition, the free triiodothyronine (fT3) level was significantly lower in AE patients as compared to the controls (P < 0.001). However, the frequency of AITDs (Hashimotos thyroiditis and Graves disease) did not significantly differ between AE patients and control subjects. Importantly, low fT3 was found to be associated with poor functional outcomes at the 3-month follow-up in AE. Adjustment of potential confounders did not change the association. However, the presence of ATAbs did not significantly alert the disease course of AE. CONCLUSIONS: ATAbs-positive and/or AITD patients with symptomatic encephalopathy should undergo proper surveillance for AE. Moreover, low fT3 could serve as a possible predictor of poor short-term outcome in AE, thereby suggesting that monitoring of thyroid function in AE may be necessary.

The majority of people with ulcerative colitis can be put into remission, leaving a group who do not respond to first- or second-line therapies. There is a significant proportion of people who experience adverse effects with current therapies. Consequently, new alternatives for the treatment of ulcerative colitis are constantly being sought. Probiotics are live microbial feed supplements that may beneficially affect the host by improving intestinal microbial balance, enhancing gut barrier function and improving local immune response. OBJECTIVES To assess the efficacy of probiotics compared with placebo or standard medical treatment (5-aminosalicylates, sulphasalazine or corticosteroids) for the induction of remission in people with active ulcerative colitis. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases on 31 October 2019. We contacted authors of relevant studies and manufacturers of probiotics regarding ongoing or unpublished trials that may be relevant to the review, and we searched ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched references of trials for any additional trials. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effectiveness of probiotics compared to standard treatments or placebo in the induction of remission of active ulcerative colitis. We considered both adults and children, with studies reporting outcomes of clinical, endoscopic, histologic or surgical remission as defined by study authors DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently conducted data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment of included studies. We analysed data using Review Manager 5. We expressed dichotomous and continuous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE methodology. MAIN RESULTS In this review, we included 14 studies (865 randomised participants) that met the inclusion criteria. Twelve of the studies looked at adult participants and two studies looked at paediatric participants with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, the average age was between 12.5 and 47.7 years. The studies compared probiotics to placebo, probiotics to 5-ASA and a combination of probiotics plus 5-ASA compared to 5-ASA alone. Seven studies used a single probiotic strain and seven used a mixture of strains. The studies ranged from two weeks to 52 weeks. The risk of bias was high for all except two studies due to allocation concealment, blinding of participants, incomplete reports of outcome data and selective reporting. This led to GRADE ratings of the evidence ranging from moderate to very low. Probiotics versus placebo Probiotics may induce clinical remission when compared to placebo (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.54; 9 studies, 594 participants; low-certainty evidence; downgraded due to imprecision and risk of bias, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 5). Probiotics may lead to an improvement in clinical disease scores (RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.63; 2 studies, 54 participants; downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). There may be little or no difference in minor adverse events, but the evidence is of very low certainty (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.59; 7 studies, 520 participants). Reported adverse events included abdominal bloating and discomfort. Probiotics did not lead to any serious adverse events in any of the seven studies that reported on it, however five adverse events were reported in the placebo arm of one study (RR 0.09, CI 0.01 to 1.66; 1 study, 526 participants; very low-certainty evidence; downgraded due to high risk of bias and imprecision). Probiotics may make little or no difference to withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.72; 4 studies, 401 participants; low-certainty evidence). Probiotics versus 5-ASA There may be little or no difference in the induction of remission with probiotics when compared to 5-ASA (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.16; 1 study, 116 participants; low-certainty evidence; downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). There may be little or no difference in minor adverse events, but the evidence is of very low certainty (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.53 to 3.33; 1 study, 116 participants). Reported adverse events included abdominal pain, nausea, headache and mouth ulcers. There were no serious adverse events with probiotics, however perforated sigmoid diverticulum and respiratory failure in a patient with severe emphysema were reported in the 5-ASA arm (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.22; 1 study, 116 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Probiotics combined with 5-ASA versus 5-ASA alone Low-certainty evidence from a single study shows that when combined with 5-ASA, probiotics may slightly improve the induction of remission (based on the Sunderland disease activity index) compared to 5-ASA alone (RR 1.22 CI 1.01 to 1.47; 1 study, 84 participants; low-certainty evidence; downgraded due to unclear risk of bias and imprecision). No information about adverse events was reported. Time to remission, histological and biochemical outcomes were sparsely reported in the studies. None of the other secondary outcomes (progression to surgery, need for additional therapy, quality of life scores, or steroid withdrawal) were reported in any of the studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Low-certainty evidence suggests that probiotics may induce clinical remission in active ulcerative colitis when compared to placebo. There may be little or no difference in clinical remission with probiotics alone compared to 5-ASA. There is limited evidence from a single study which failed to provide a definition of remission, that probiotics may slightly improve the induction of remission when used in combination with 5-ASA. There was no evidence to assess whether probiotics are effective in people with severe and more extensive disease, or if specific preparations are superior to others. Further targeted and appropriately designed RCTs are needed to address the gaps in the evidence base. In particular, appropriate powering of studies and the use of standardised participant groups and outcome measures in line with the wider field are needed, as well as reporting to minimise risk of bias.","output":"Probiotics for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted an observational study of a multi-center healthcare system to determine the effectiveness of our infection control/PPE program during the care of COVID-19 patients.

This study was conducted across hemodialysis centers by testing all patients and staff for COVID-19 PCR and later for IgG antibody, irrespective of their symptoms. METHODS: All 705 hemodialysis patients and 103 dialysis staff across nine centres, were tested for COVID-19 over a period of 54 days of the pandemic, and for COVID IgG antibody of available enrolled staff and patients, after 8 weeks of study termination. RESULTS: The period prevalence of infection in patients and staff was 7.1% and 14.6% respectively. Mortality in patients was 18%, and all staff recovered.

Many individuals who become infected may have pre-existing conditions that may interact with COVID-19 to increase symptom severity and mortality risk. COVID-19 patient comorbidities are likely to be informative regarding the individual risk of severe illness and mortality. Determining the degree to which comorbidities are associated with severe symptoms and mortality would thus greatly assist in COVID-19 care planning and provision. To assess this we performed a meta-analysis of published global literature, and machine learning predictive analysis using an aggregated COVID-19 global dataset. Our meta-analysis suggested that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cerebrovascular disease (CEVD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, malignancy, and hypertension as most significantly associated with COVID-19 severity in the current published literature. Machine learning classification using novel aggregated cohort data similarly found COPD, CVD, CKD, type 2 diabetes, malignancy, and hypertension, as well as asthma, as the most significant features for classifying those deceased versus those who survived COVID-19. While age and gender were the most significant predictors of mortality, in terms of symptomCcomorbidity combinations, it was observed that PneumoniaCHypertension, PneumoniaCDiabetes, and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)CHypertension showed the most significant associations with COVID-19 mortality.

Studies show that AMS is associated with death and prolonged hospital stay. In addition to respiratory insufficiency, COVID-19 causes multi-organ failure and multiple metabolic derangements, which can cause AMS, and the multi-system involvement could account for the prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality. In this study, we built on our previous publication (Chachkhiani et al., 2020) using a new, larger cohort to investigate whether we could reproduce our previous findings while addressing some of the prior studys limitations. Most notably, we sought to determine whether AMS still predicted prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality after controlling for systemic complications such as sepsis, liver failure, kidney failure, and electrolyte abnormalities. OBJECTIVES: The primary purpose was to document the frequency of AMS in patients with COVID-19 at the time of presentation to the emergency room. Secondary aims were to determine: 1) if AMS at presentation was associated with worse outcomes as measured by prolonged hospitalization and death; and 2) if AMS remained a predictor of worse outcome after adjusting for concomitant organ failure and metabolic derangements. RESULTS: Out of 367 patients, 95 (26%) had AMS as a main or one of the presenting symptoms. Our sample has a higher representation of African Americans (53%) than the US average and a high frequency of comorbidities, such as obesity (average BMI 29.1), hypertension (53%), and diabetes (30%). Similar to our previous report, AMS was the most frequent neurological chief complaint. At their admission, out of 95 patients with AMS, 83 (88%) had organ failure or one of the systemic problems that could have caused AMS. However, a similar proportion (86%) of patients without AMS had one or more of these same problems. Age, race, and ethnicity were the main demographic predictors. African Americans had shorter hospital stay [HR1.3(1.0,1.7),p = 0.02] than Caucasians. Hispanics also had shorter hospital stay than non-Hispanics [HR1.6(1.2,2.1), p = 0.001]. Hypoxia, liver failure, hypernatremia, and kidney failure were also predictors of prolonged hospital stay. In the multivariate model, hypoxia, liver failure, and acute kidney injury were the remaining predictors of longer hospital stay, as well as people with AMS at baseline [HR0.7(0.6,0.9), p < 0.02] after adjusting for the demographic characteristics and clinical predictors. AMS at baseline predicted death, but not after adjusting for demographics and clinical variables in the multivariate model. Hypoxia and hyperglycemia at baseline were the strongest predictors of death. CONCLUSION: Altered mental status is an independent predictor of prolonged hospital stay, but not death. Further studies are needed to evaluate the causes of AMS in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Altered mental status predicts length of stay but not death in a community-based cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Teaching cybercivility requires thoughtful attention to curriculum development and content delivery. Theories, models, and conceptual and theoretical frameworks (hereafter \\"tools\\") provide useful foundations for integrating new knowledge and skills into existing professional practice and education. We conducted this scoping review to identify tools used for teaching cybercivility in health professions education. METHODS Using Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review framework, we searched six biomedical and educational databases and three grey literature databases for articles available in English published between January 1, 2000 and March 31, 2020. Following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews), we screened and extracted relevant data, and reported the results of the search. RESULTS The search resulted in 2272 articles, with 8 articles included in this review after inclusion criteria were applied. Four articles (50%) were peer-reviewed journal papers while the other 4 (50%) were dissertations. Eleven unique tools were identified by this review: (1) Transpersonal Caring Theory, (2) Theory of Workplace Incivility, (3) Conceptualization of Incivility, (4) Media Ecology Theory, (5) Principlism, (6) Salmon's Five Stage Model of Online Learning, (7) Learner-Centered Educational Theory, (8) Gallant and Drinan's 4-Stage Model of Institutionalization of Academic Integrity, (9) Theory of Planned Behavior, (10) Communication Privacy Management Theory, and (11) Moral Development Theory. Based on the tools analyzed in our scoping review, we determined three features of cybercivility pedagogy to which the tools provided a guide: (1) behavioral manifestations, (2) academic integrity, and (3) digital professionalism. CONCLUSIONS The reviewed tools provide a pedagogical foundation and guidance for teaching various properties of cybercivility.

Due to its high cost, it is recommended for high-risk infants only. We aimed to determine the proportion of infants eligible for palivizumab treatment in England who receive at least one dose. Methods: We used the Hospital Treatment Insights database containing hospital admission records linked to hospital pharmacy dispensing data for 43/153 hospitals in England. Infants born between 2010 and 2016 were considered eligible for palivizumab if their medical records indicated chronic lung disease (CLD), congenital heart disease (CHD), or severe immunodeficiency (SCID), and they met additional criteria based on gestational age at birth and age at start of the RSV season (beginning of October). We calculated the proportion of infants who received at least one dose of palivizumab in their first RSV season, and modelled the odds of treatment according to multiple child characteristics using logistic regression models. Results: We identified 3,712 eligible children, of whom 2,479 (67%) had complete information on all risk factors. Palivizumab was prescribed to 832 of eligible children (34%). Being born at <30 weeks' gestation, aged <6 months at the start of RSV season, and having two or more of CLD, CHD or SCID were associated with higher odds of treatment. Conclusion: In England, palivizumab is not prescribed to the majority of children who are eligible to receive it.

The development of a diagnostic methodology for identifying COVID-19 infection through simple testing was a reality only a few weeks after the novel virus was officially announced. Thus, we were interested in exploring the ability of regular testing of non-symptomatic people to reduce cases and thereby offer a non-pharmaceutical tool for controlling the spread of a pandemic. METHODS: We developed a data-driven individual-based epidemiological network model in order to investigate epidemic countermeasures. This models is based on high-resolution demographic data for each municipality in Norway, and each person in the model is subject to Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) dynamics. The model was calibrated against hospitalization data in Oslo, Norway, a city with a population of 700k which we have used as the simulations focus. RESULTS: Finding that large households function as hubs for the propagation of COVID-19, we assess the intervention efficiency of targeted pooled household testing (TPHT) repeatedly. For an outbreak with reproductive number R=1.4, we find that weekly TPHT of the 25% largest households brings R below unity. For the case of R=1.2, our results suggest that TPHT with the largest 25% of households every three days in an urban area is as effective as a lockdown in curbing the outbreak. Our investigations of different disease parameters suggest that these results are markedly improved for disease variants that more easily infect young people, and when compliance with self-isolation rules is less than perfect among suspected symptomatic cases. These results are quite robust to changes in the testing frequency, city size, and the household-size distribution. Our results are robust even with only 50% of households willing to participate in TPHT, provided the total number of tests stay unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled and targeted household testing appears to be a powerful non-pharmaceutical alternative to more invasive social-distancing and lock-down measures as a localized early response to contain epidemic outbreaks.

One of the ways is by doing a cardiac rehabilitation program. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: Cardiac rehabilitation program is divided into three phases. The cardiac rehabilitation programs implementation, especially the second phase, center-based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR), has many barriers not to participate optimally. Therefore, the third phase, known as home-based cardiac rehabilitation (HBCR), can become a substitute or addition to CBCR. On the other hand, this phase is also an essential part of the patients functional capacity. During the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic, HBCR has become the leading solution in the cardiac rehabilitation programs sustainability. Innovation is needed in its implementation, such as telerehabilitation. So, the cardiac rehabilitation program can be implemented by patients and monitored by health care providers continuously.

The relative risk (RR) of these diagnoses was calculated comparing a prepandemic sample to a pandemic sample, accounting for total volume of ED visits. RESULTS: A total of 2816 patient encounters met the inclusion criteria. The study period in 2020 had 31.5% lower overall ED volume seen during the same time period in the previous 3 years (27,874 vs average 40,716 ED encounters). The risk of presenting with anxiety during the study period in 2020 compared to prior 3 years was 1.40 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21C1.63), for depression was 1.47 (95% CI 1.28C1.69), and for suicidal ideation was 1.05 (95% CI 0.90C1.23).

Methods SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular responses were assessed in convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients at one-year post-infection. Results A total of 78 convalescent COVID-19 patients (26 moderate, 43 severe, and 9 critical) were recruited after one year of recovery. The positive rates of both anti-RBD and anti-N antibodies were 100%, whereas we did not observe a statistical difference in antibody levels among different severity groups. Accordingly, the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) reached 93.59% in convalescent patients. Although nAb titres displayed an increasing trend in convalescent patients with increased severity, the difference failed to achieve statistical significance. Notably, there was a significant correlation between nAb titres and anti-RBD levels. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells could be robustly maintained in convalescent patients, and the number of them was positively correlated with both nAb titres and anti-RBD levels. Amplified SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells mainly produced a single cytokine, accompanying with increased expression of exhaustion markers including PD-1, Tim-3, TIGIT, CTLA-4 and CD39, while the proportion of multifunctional cells was low.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of placental SARS-CoV-2 despite mild COVID-19 disease (no symptoms of COVID-19 aside from myalgias); patient had no fever, cough, or shortness of breath, but only myalgias and sick contacts. Despite her mild COVID-19 disease in pregnancy, we demonstrate placental vasculopathy and presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus across the placenta. Evidence of placental COVID-19 raises concern for placental vasculopathy (potentially leading to fetal growth restriction and other pregnancy complications) and possible vertical transmission-especially for pregnant women who may be exposed to COVID-19 in early pregnancy. This raises important questions of whether future pregnancy guidance should include stricter pandemic precautions, such as screening for a wider array of COVID-19 symptoms, increased antenatal surveillance, and possibly routine COVID-19 testing throughout pregnancy.","output":"Placental SARS-CoV-2 in a pregnant woman with mild COVID-19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Predicting mortality from COVID-19 using information available when patients present to the emergency department can inform goals-of-care decisions and assist with ethical allocation of critical care resources. The study objective was to develop and validate a clinical score to predict emergency department and in-hospital mortality among consecutive nonpalliative patients with COVID-19;in this study, we define palliative patients as those who do not want resuscitative measures, such as intubation, intensive care unit care or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHODS: This derivation and validation study used observational cohort data recruited from 46 hospitals in 8 Canadian provinces participating in the Canadian COVID-19 Emergency Department Rapid Response Network (CCEDRRN). We included adult (age >= 18 yr) nonpalliative patients with confirmed COVID-19 who presented to the emergency department of a participating site between Mar. 1, 2020, and Jan. 31, 2021. We randomly assigned hospitals to derivation or validation, and prespecified clinical variables as candidate predictors. We used logistic regression to develop the score in a derivation cohort and examined its performance in predicting emergency department and in-hospital mortality in a validation cohort. RESULTS: Of 8761 eligible patients, 618 (7.0%) died. The CCEDRRN COVID-19 Mortality Score included age, sex, type of residence, arrival mode, chest pain, severe liver disease, respiratory rate and level of respiratory support. The area under the curve was 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90-0.93) in derivation and 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.93) in validation. The score had excellent calibration. These results suggest that scores of 6 or less would categorize patients as being at low risk for in-hospital death, with a negative predictive value of 99.9%. Patients in the low-risk group had an in-hospital mortality rate of 0.1%. Patients with a score of 15 or higher had an observed mortality rate of 81.0%. INTERPRETATION: The CCEDRRN COVID-19 Mortality Score is a simple score that can be used for level-of-care discussions with patients and in situations of critical care resource constraints to accurately predict death using variables available on emergency department arrival. The score was derived and validated mostly in unvaccinated patients, and before variants of concern were circulating widely and newer treatment regimens implemented in Canada.

However, the panoramic view and detailed dissection of BM-MSCs in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML-MSCs) remain obscure. METHODS: For the purpose, we isolated and identified AML-MSCs together with healthy donor-derived HD-MSCs from the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) by using the standard density gradient centrifugation based on clinical diagnosis and cellular phenotypic analysis. Subsequently, we systematically compared the potential similarities and discrepancy both at the cellular and molecular levels via flow cytometry, multilineage differentiation, chromosome karyotyping, cytokine quantification, and transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis including single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), gene ontology (GO), HeatMap, principal component analysis (PCA), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). RESULTS: On the one hand, AML-MSCs exhibited undistinguishable signatures in cytomorphology, surface biomarker expression pattern, stemness, chromosome karyotype, and chondrogenesis as HD-MSCs, whereas with impaired adipogenesis, enhanced osteogenesis, and variations in cytokine expression pattern. On the other hand, with the aid of genomic and bioinformatic analyses, we verified that AML-MSCs displayed multidimensional discrepancy with HD-MSCs both in genome-wide gene expression profiling and genetic variation spectrum. Simultaneously, the deficiency of cellular vitality including proliferation and apoptosis in AML-MSCs was largely rescued by JAK-STAT signaling inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings elucidated that AML-MSCs manifested multifaceted alterations in biological signatures and molecular genetics, and in particular, the deficiency of cellular vitality ascribed to over-activation of JAK-STAT signal, which collectively provided systematic and overwhelming new evidence for decoding the pathogenesis of AML and exploring therapeutic strategies in future.

Demonstrating the ability to mount an appropriate antibody response in the presence of hyperglycaemia is relevant for the comprehension of mechanisms related to the observed worse clinical outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia in patients with diabetes and for the development of any future vaccination campaign to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Using a highly specific and sensitive measurement of antibodies by fluid-phase luciferase immunoprecipitation assays, we characterised the IgG, IgM and IgA response against multiple antigens of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 509 patients with documented diagnosis of COVID-19, prospectively followed at our institution. We analysed clinical outcomes and antibody titres according to the presence of hyperglycaemia, i.e., either diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes, at the time of, or during, hospitalisation. RESULTS: Among patients with confirmed COVID-19, 139 (27.3%) had diabetes: 90 (17.7%) had diabetes diagnosed prior to the hospital admission (comorbid diabetes) while 49 (9.6%) had diabetes diagnosed at the time of admission (newly diagnosed). Diabetes was associated with increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers and hypercoagulopathy, as well as leucocytosis and neutrophilia. Diabetes was independently associated with risk of death (HR 2.32 [95% CI 1.44, 3.75], p = 0.001), even after adjustment for age, sex and other relevant comorbidities. Moreover, a strong association between higher glucose levels and risk of death was documented irrespective of diabetes diagnosis (HR 1.14  1.1 mmol/l [95% CI 1.08, 1.21], p < 0.001). The humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with diabetes was present and superimposable, as for timing and antibody titres, to that of non-diabetic patients, with marginal differences, and was not influenced by glucose levels. Of the measured antibody responses, positivity for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) was predictive of survival rate, both in the presence or absence of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The observed increased severity and mortality risk of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with hyperglycaemia was not the result of an impaired humoral response against SARS-CoV-2. RBD IgG positivity was associated with a remarkable protective effect, allowing for a cautious optimism about the efficacy of future vaccines against SARs-COV-2 in people with diabetes.

Methods: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 845 food handlers working in 423 selected food establishments of East and West Gojjam Zones from 22 September to 2 November 2020. The food handlers were categorized as a cooker and a waiter based on their responsibility. A data collection tool was adapted from the literature and validated by conducting a pre-test prior to the study. Binary logistic regression was done to identify the factors associated with food hygiene practice among food handlers. Results: The prevalence of poor food hygiene practices among food handlers working in food establishments was 51.2% (95% confidence interval = 47.8, 54.6%).

Vulnerable populations, specifically those suffering from serious mental illness and homelessness, are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 infection resulting in medical complications and psychiatric destabilization. In addition, mental health has become increasingly relevant throughout the country given the psychological distress people have been facing due to the spread of COVID-19 and the toll of a more restricted way of living. Although the healthcare industry has quickly integrated novel ways of treating patients with mental illness with technological advances, these technologies are not applicable to different populations equally. There is a clear disparity that is represented within the public county health systems, which leads to a widening gap between those who receive adequate treatment for mental illness and those who do not. Aims: The aims of this paper were to provide a commentary on the benefits of technology-based psychiatric and psychological interventions based off experience in a public health system and based off a relevant, thorough literature review. In addition, we aim to highlight the importance of accessibility of these interventions for vulnerable populations and provide recommendations for integrating these services expeditiously. Methods: Literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, PubMed and Google Scholar. Conclusions: Based off data collected from experience in a public health system and literature review, we conclude that although the COVID-19 pandemic has initiated significant innovation to integrate technology for psychiatric care, this innovation is not equally accessible for vulnerable populations suffering from mental health disorders. Within a public county health system, there are barriers with providing mental healthcare to vulnerable populations. These barriers, which are applicable throughout the United States, serve as a rationale for the need of innovative solutions for the integration of these services in not only emergency situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but also in daily non-emergent operations to sufficiently address the needs for those needing mental healthcare.","output":"Challenges faced by mental health providers and patients during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic due to technological barriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented a global health threat, and it poses challenges to how physiotherapists deliver health care.

This study tested the hypothesis that bacterial co-infection during ARI adds to airway inflammation and illness severity. METHODS: Two groups of 97 specimens each were randomly selected from multiplex-PCR identified virus-positive and virus-negative nasal specimens obtained from adults with new onset ARI, and 40 control specimens were collected from healthy adults. All specimens were analyzed for Haemophilus influenza(HI), Moraxella catarrhalis(MC) and Streptococcus pneumonia(SP) by quantitative-PCR. General linear models tested for relationships between respiratory pathogens, biomarkers (nasal wash neutrophils and CXCL8), and ARI-severity. RESULTS: Nasal specimens from adults with ARIs were more likely to contain bacteria (37% overall; HI=28%, MC=14%, SP=7%) compared to specimens from healthy adults (5% overall; HI=0%, MC=2.5%, SP=2.5%;p<0.001). Among ARI specimens, bacteria were more likely to be detected among virus-negative specimens compared to virus-positive specimens (46% vs. 27%;p=0.0046). The presence of bacteria was significantly associated with increased CXCL8 and neutrophils, but not increased symptoms. CONCLUSION: Pathogenic bacteria were more often detected in virus-negative ARI, and also associated with increased inflammatory biomarkers. These findings suggest the possibility that bacteria may augment virus-induced ARI and contribute to airway inflammation.

Consequently, the objective of this research is to analyze whether the frequency of social media use, among Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and YouTube, is linked with perceptual discrepancies regarding entrepreneurial subjective norms, attitudes toward entrepreneurship and the intention to undertake, differentiating this relationship by gender and age group. A total of 246 business and engineering students from Chile were evaluated through online surveys, and MannCWhitney and Spearman's correlation tests were performed. The findings highlight that higher exposure on these social media platforms is related to better entrepreneurial attitudes and perceptions, and this association differs according to students' gender and age group; in particular, Facebook shows more positive correlations in younger and male students, and WhatsApp and YouTube show more positive correlations in older and female students. This research extends the understanding of the relation between exposure to social media and variables with a considerable influence on undertaking entrepreneurship.

During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic indirectly impacted this fishery as well as a number of other fisheries reliant on international export markets. The TRL fishery is managed using an empirical (data-based) Harvest Control Rule (eHCR) to rapidly provide a Recommended Biological Catch (RBC), based on catch, fishery-independent survey indices and Catch-Per-Unit-Effort (CPUE). Here, we summarise the impacts of COVID-19 on each of these critical data inputs and discuss whether the eHCR was considered adequately resilient to this unprecedented disruption to the system. Next, we use a quantitative supply chain index to analyse the impact of disruptions to the supply chain, and inform on potential adaptation strategies. The catch and CPUE data were impacted to varying degrees by external constraints influencing fishing effort, but the fishery-independent survey wasnt affected and hence there remains an unbroken survey time-series for the fishery extending back to 1989. The eHCR was shown to be reasonably robust because it incorporates longer-term trends over a five-year period, and accords substantially more weighting (80%) to the fishery-independent survey rather than CPUE data which can be affected by trade and other disruptions. Despite the eHCR not having been tested for scenarios such as a global pandemic, this robustness is a positive given the types of disruptions we will likely face in future climate. The weak links identified in the supply chain were the same as those previously highlighted as sensitive to climate change disruptions. Our supply chain analysis quantifies the impact on system resilience of alternative paths connecting producers to consumers and reinforces that supply chains may be particularly vulnerable to external disruptions if they are not sufficiently diverse.","output":"Indirect Impacts of COVID-19 on a Tropical Lobster Fisherys Harvest Strategy and Supply Chain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in the management of oligometastatic recurrent prostate cancer (PCa) by means of a systematic review. Six databases were searched (CENTRAL, Embase, LILACS, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science). Additionally, hand-searching and grey literature search were performed. The main outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity rates. Androgen deprivation therapy-free survival (ADT-FS), local control, pattern of recurrence, cancer-specific survival and overall survival were also assessed. Risk of bias and quality of evidence were judged with the aid of specific tools. Fourteen studies were included, involving 661 patients and 899 lesions (561 nodal, 336 bone, 2 liver). Median PFS and ADT-FS were around 1 to 3 years. Local control rates varied from 82 to 100% among researches with low risk of bias. Acute and late grade 2 toxicity was observed in 2.4% and 1.1% of the patients, respectively. One case of acute and two cases of late grade 3 toxicity were registered. Only one randomized study addresses this topic. Although it does not meet all the eligibility criteria, it is useful for the discussion. A quantitative analysis was not possible, nor were subgroup analyses, due to the significant heterogeneity of the interventions and outcomes reported. Longer follow-up period is required. SBRT seems to be a safe approach to metastatic lesions that might provide disease control and defer androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

DESIGN: Guided by the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, virtual focus groups were conducted in five urban and rural Alabama communities using secure Zoom meetings. Community residents and stakeholders (N = 36 total) participated; meetings were audio- and video-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed according to Thematic Analysis. Themes were organized by the PRECEDE portion of the model in Predisposing, Reinforcing, and Enabling barriers and facilitators in three focus areas: prevention, coping, and testing. RESULTS: Prevention barriers included apathy, difficulty with social distancing, lack of information, mixed messages from authority figures, and lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). Prevention facilitators included concerns about contracting COVID-19, clear and consistent messages from trusted sources, contact tracing, and the provision of PPE. Coping barriers included food insecurity, mental health issues, isolation, economic hardships, lack of health care access, and issues with virtual schooling and church services, which were exacerbated by the inability to connect to the internet. Facilitators to coping included religious faith, increased physical activity, and a sense of hope. Testing barriers included misunderstanding, fear, mistrust, testing restrictions, and location of testing sites. Facilitators to testing included incentives, clear information from trusted sources, convenient testing locations, and free tests. CONCLUSION: Gaining community members' perspectives can identify barriers and facilitators to prevention, coping, and testing and potentially improve outcomes. While addressing the social determinants of health (e.g. income, education, medical trust) would be an effective path by which to diminish health disparities related to COVID-19, there is an urgent need to mitigate the spread and severity of COVID-19 in vulnerable populations.

Consistent anatomical definitions are crucial to ensure consensus on the position and shape of brain structures, but segmentations are prone to variation in their interpretation and execution. White\\\\matter (WM) pathways are global structures of the brain defined by local landmarks, which leads to anatomical definitions being difficult to convey, learn, or teach. Moreover, the complex shape of WM pathways and their representation using tractography (streamlines) make the design and evaluation of dissection protocols difficult and time\\\\consuming. The first iteration of Tractostorm quantified the variability of a pyramidal tract dissection protocol and compared results between experts in neuroanatomy and nonexperts. Despite virtual dissection being used for decades, in\\\\depth investigations of how learning or practicing such protocols impact dissection results are nonexistent. To begin to fill the gap, we evaluate an online educational tractography course and investigate the impact learning and practicing a dissection protocol has on interrater (groupwise) reproducibility. To generate the required data to quantify reproducibility across raters and time, 20 independent raters performed dissections of three bundles of interest on five Human Connectome Project subjects, each with four timepoints. Our investigation shows that the dissection protocol in conjunction with an online course achieves a high level of reproducibility (between 0.85 and 0.90 for the voxel\\\\based Dice score) for the three bundles of interest and remains stable over time (repetition of the protocol). Suggesting that once raters are familiar with the software and tasks at hand, their interpretation and execution at the group level do not drastically vary. When compared to previous work that used a different method of communication for the protocol, our results show that incorporating a virtual educational session increased reproducibility.

Therefore, we undertook a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of causative agents of non-malarial fevers on the African continent. METHODOLOGY: We searched for literature in African Journals Online, EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases to identify aetiologic agents that had been reported and to determine summary estimates of the proportional morbidity rates (PMr) associated with these pathogens among fever patients. FINDINGS: A total of 133 studies comprising 391,835 patients from 25 of the 54 African countries were eligible. A wide array of aetiologic agents were described with considerable regional differences among the leading agents. Overall, bacterial pathogens tested from blood samples accounted for the largest proportion. The summary estimates from the meta-analysis were low for most of the agents. This may have resulted from a true low prevalence of the agents, the failure to test for many agents or the low sensitivity of the diagnostic methods applied. Our meta-regression analysis of study and population variables showed that diagnostic methods determined the PMr estimates of typhoidal Salmonella and Dengue virus. An increase in the PMr of Klebsiella spp. infections was observed over time. Furthermore, the status of patients as either inpatient or outpatient predicted the PMr of Haemophilus spp. infections. CONCLUSION: The small number of epidemiological studies and the variety of NMFI agents on the African continent emphasizes the need for harmonized studies with larger sample sizes. In particular, diagnostic procedures for NMFIs should be standardized to facilitate comparability of study results and to improve future meta-analyses. Reliable NMFI burden estimates will inform regional public health strategies.","output":"A systematic review and meta-analysis of the aetiological agents of non-malarial febrile illnesses in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 is different from the ARDS caused by other infections.

PATIENT CONCERNS: Herein, we present a 76-year-old male patient with ARDS secondary to COVID-19. We describe our experience with mechanical ventilation strategy and the changes in respiratory mechanics in the patient during treatment. DIAGNOSIS: The patient had tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) in nucleic acid test. Chest CT showed multiple ground glass shadows in both lungs. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume and low PEEP. OUTCOMES: After treatment, the patients condition, as well as oxygenation status was improved, and he tested negative for the coronavirus several times. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrated that the low tidal volume with low levels of PEEP ventilation strategy may be more suitable for ARDS from COVID-19.","output":"Successful treatment of a critically ill patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome from COVID-19 using mechanical ventilation strategy with low levels of positive end-expiratory pressure: A CARE-compliant case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of digital media as a source of information for health-related behavior is impressively demonstrated.

Published histological profiling revealed ACE2 to be highly expressed on human lung alveolar epithelial cells and on enterocytes of the small intestine, as well as on arterial and venous endothelial cells. Given the widespread abundance of ACE2 across tissues, there has been much speculation regarding whether ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and/or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB) might alter tissue ACE2 expression and thereby change the risk of transmission or development of severe complications. Therefore, the aim of this ongoing study is to measure the impact of ACEi and ARB singly and in combination versus placebo control on tissue distribution of ACE2 in male and female mice. A factorial design was employed with the following exposures: ACEi (lisinopril, 10 mg/kg/day), ARB (losartan, 10 mg/kg/day), both drugs, or water control. Drugs were delivered via drinking water. C57BL/6J Mice were 8 weeks of age at the start of the experiment. After 21 days of treatment, four mice (two males and two females) from each treatment group were euthanized, followed by perfusion and tissue collection. 12 more untreated mice were combined with the placebo group to increase the sample size of this reference group to 16 (8 males, 8 females). ACE2 protein abundance in brain, kidney, liver, lung, and small intestine was measured by ELISA (Abcam) and normalized to BCA\\\\measured total protein. Two\\\\way ANOVA was performed to test for differences in ACE2 levels by organ or sex among untreated mice; Mann\\\\Whitney tests were performed to compare each drug treatment group to the control group. Among untreated mice, ACE2 levels differed by organ (p < 0.01), but there were no differences between males and females for a given organ (p = 0.20). Males and females were combined for subsequent analyses. After 21 days of treatment, ACEi, ARB, and the combination therapy lowered ACE2 tissue abundance compared to untreated mice in the brain (ACEi p = 0.04; ARB p = 0.04; ACEi+ARB p = 0.01), kidney (ACEi p = 0.03; ARB p = 0.02; ACEi+ARB p = 0.02), and lung (ACEi p = 0.01; ARB p = 0.01; ACEi+ARB p = 0.01). ACEi, but not ARB or combination therapy, lowered ACE2 tissue abundance in the liver (p = 0.02). None of the treatments changed ACE2 tissue abundance in the small intestine. These results indicate that ACEi, ARB, or combination therapy reduces levels of ACE2, the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 receptor, in key tissues affected by the virus, including lung, kidney, and brain. An ongoing validation study will evaluate ACE2 protein and gene expression at earlier time points, as well as after discontinuation of treatment. These results will provide valuable insight into the risk or potential benefit of starting or stopping ACEi, ARB, or combination therapy during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.","output":"The Impact of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition and/or Angiotensin Receptor Blockade on Tissue Expression of the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 Receptor ACE2 in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurodegenerative disorders affect fifteen percent of the worlds population and pose a significant financial burden to all nations. Cognitive impairment is the seventh leading cause of death throughout the globe. Given the enormous challenges to treat cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimers disease, and the inability to markedly limit disease progression, circadian clock gene pathways offer an exciting strategy to address cognitive loss. Alterations in circadian clock genes can result in age-related motor deficits, affect treatment regimens with neurodegenerative disorders, and lead to the onset and progression of dementia. Interestingly, circadian pathways hold an intricate relationship with autophagy, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), the silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (SIRT1), mammalian forkhead transcription factors (FoxOs), and the trophic factor erythropoietin. Autophagy induction is necessary to maintain circadian rhythm homeostasis and limit cortical neurodegenerative disease, but requires a fine balance in biological activity to foster proper circadian clock gene regulation that is intimately dependent upon mTOR, SIRT1, FoxOs, and growth factor expression.

Size variation in the surface (SU) glycoprotein, characterized by duplication and insertion, has been observed during in vivo infection with several lentiviruses, including bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1. These duplication/insertion events are thought to occur through a mechanism of template switching/strand transfer during reverse transcription. Studies of RNA recombination in a number of virus systems indicate that cis-acting sequences can modulate the frequency of template switching/strand transfer. The size variable region of EIAV and BIV SU glycoproteins was examined and an AU-rich region and regions of nucleotide sequence identity that may facilitate template switching/strand transfer were identified. An in vitro strand transfer assay using donor and acceptor templates derived from the size variable region in BIV env detected both precise and imprecise strand transfer products, in addition to full-length products. Sequence analysis of clones obtained from imprecise strand transfer products showed that 87.5% had crossover sites within 10 nt of the crossover site observed in vivo. Mutations in the donor template which altered either the AU-rich region or nucleotide sequence identity dramatically decreased the frequency of imprecise strand transfer.

Demographic information, MS disease-related factors, flu vaccination history, COVID-19 vaccination history, cause of vaccination refusal, past history of COVID-19 infection, and their compliance with public health guidelines after vaccination were recorded. RESULTS: 1479 patients participated in this study. 6.9% of participants have not received the vaccination. Sinopharm was the most commonly used vaccine (92.9%). Vaccine hesitancy was associated with young age, lower education, unemployment, negative flu vaccination history, no previous episode of COVID-19 infection, less concern about COVID-19, and the expectation of not getting infected with the virus after vaccination. Participants mentioned concerns about the side effects of the vaccines as the most prevalent cause of avoiding vaccination (58.0%). Patients concern of SARS-CoV-2 significantly decreased after vaccination (p-value < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings in this study elucidate that a minor group of patients with MS has vaccine hesitancy, which may expose them to more severe COVID 19.

Thus, the importance of logistics and supply chain functions has been amplified in almost every business that ships physical goods. In Vietnam, the logistics service sector has seen rapid expansion. Since more and more businesses are seeking third-party logistics (3PL) providers to outsource the logistics functions, this article aims to offer decision-makers an integrated and consistent model for evaluating and selecting the most efficient 3PLs. To this end, the authors exploit a hybrid multi-criteria method which is fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy vlsekriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno resenje (FVIKOR) while examining the most influential and conflicting criteria regarding economic, service level, environmental, social, and risk aspects. Fuzzy information in the natural decision-making process is considered, linguistic variables are used to mitigate the uncertain levels in the criteria weights. First, FAHP (the weighting method) is adopted to evaluate and calculate each criterions relative significant fuzzy weight. FVIKOR (the compromised ranking method) is then used to rank the alternatives. The combination of FAHP and FVIKOR methods provides more accurate ranking results. As a result, reliability and delivery time, voice of customer, logistics cost, network management, and quality of service are the most impactful factors to the logistics outsourcing problem. Eventually, the optimized 3PLs were determined that fully meet the criteria of sustainable development. The developed integrated model offers the complete and robust 3PLs evaluation and selection process and can also be a powerful decision support tool for other industries. ? 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, we take the reader through simulations that are used to demonstrate the following concepts: 1) disease prevalence curves of unmitigated outbreaks have a single peak and result in epidemics that \`burn' through the population to become extinguished when the proportion of the susceptible population drops below a critical level; 2) if immunity in recovered individuals wanes sufficiently fast then the disease persists indefinitely as an endemic state with possible dampening oscillations following the initial outbreak phase; 3) the steepness and initial peak of the prevalence curve are influenced by the basic reproductive value R-zero, which must exceed 1 for an epidemic to occur; 4) the probability that a single infectious individual in a closed population (i.e. no migration) gives rise to an epidemic increases with the value of R-zero>1; 5) behavior that adaptively decreases the contact rate among individuals with increasing prevalence has major effects on the prevalence curve including dramatic flattening of the prevalence curve along with the generation of multiple prevalence peaks; 6) the impacts of treatment are complicated to model because they effect multiple processes including transmission, and both recovery and mortality rates; 7) similarly, the impacts of vaccination are equally complicated and, in addition, when a fixed number of vaccination regimens are available, the rate and timing of delivery are crucially important to maximizing there ability to reducing mortality.

Innate immune cells produce hormonal calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, 1,25D) locally from circulating calcifediol in response to pathogen threat and an immune-specific cytokine network. Calcitriol regulates gene expression through its binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-regulated transcription factor. The hormone-bound VDR induces the transcription of genes integral to innate immunity including pattern recognition receptors, cytokines, and most importantly antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Transcription of the human AMP genes -defensin 2/defensin-4 (HBD2/DEFB4) and cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) is stimulated by the VDR bound to promoter-proximal vitamin D response elements. HDB2/DEFB4 and the active form of CAMP, the peptide LL-37, which form amphipathic secondary structures, were initially characterized for their antibacterial actively. Notably, calcitriol signaling induces secretion of antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo, and low circulating levels of calcifediol are associated with diverse indications characterized by impaired antibacterial immunity such as dental caries and urinary tract infections. However, recent work has also provided evidence that the same AMPs are components of 1,25D-induced antiviral responses, including those against the etiological agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus. This review surveys the evidence for 1,25D-induced antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo in humans and presents our current understanding of the potential mechanisms by which CAMP and HBD2/DEFB4 contribute to antiviral immunity.","output":"Emerging Roles of Vitamin D-Induced Antimicrobial Peptides in Antiviral Innate Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three-dimensional grafts/scaffolds with hierarchically biomimetic features from nano to macro scale and high porosity are required for bone tissue engineering.

Surprisingly, PD catheter dysfunction rates and longevity have not been studied in the growing obese ESRD population. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of patient weight on PD catheter survival in the three insertion technique categories of advanced laparoscopy (AL), basic laparoscopy (BL), and open. METHODS We examine retrospectively collected data on 231 consecutive PD catheter insertions at the NorthShore University HealthSystem between 2004 and 2014. Three cohorts were created based on the catheter insertion technique: open, BL using selective adhesiolysis, and AL using rectus sheath tunnel, selective omentopexy, and adhesiolysis. Primary outcomes included catheter dysfunction and catheter dysfunction-free survival for each cohort by BMI: normal weight (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9), obese (30). Nominal variables were compared using Chi-square test, continuous variables using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests, and catheter survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test. Statistical significance was established at 0.05. RESULTS For the three BMI categories, there were no statistically significant differences in patient demographics. There were no statistically significant differences in catheter dysfunction or peri-operative complications by BMI category among all patients. This was also true in the AL cohort. Among all patients, similar 2-year dysfunction-free catheter survival was noted for normal weight, overweight, and obese patients (log-rank p = 0.79). This was also true across all insertion techniques: open (log-rank p = 0.87), BL (log-rank p = 0.41), AL (log-rank p = 0.43). In the obese cohort, the 2-year dysfunction-free catheter survival was 91.1% in AL, 83.5% in BL, and 65.7% in open (log-rank p = 0.58). CONCLUSION Obesity does not increase complications or shorten dysfunction-free PD catheter survival regardless of the operative technique used.

To our knowledge, patient perspectives related to their ED visit have not been characterized and may influence their access to and interest in OUD treatment. OBJECTIVE: To assess the experiences and perspectives regarding ED-initiated health care and OUD treatment among US patients with untreated OUD seen in the ED. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study, conducted as part of 2 studies (Project ED Health and ED-CONNECT), included individuals with untreated OUD who were recruited during an ED visit in EDs at 4 urban academic centers, 1 public safety net hospital, and 1 rural critical access hospital in 5 disparate US regions. Focus groups were conducted between June 2018 and January 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Data collection and thematic analysis were grounded in the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) implementation science framework with evidence (perspectives on ED care), context (ED), and facilitation (what is needed to promote change) elements. RESULTS: A total of 31 individuals (mean [SD] age, 43.4 [11.0] years) participated in 6 focus groups. Twenty participants (64.5%) identified as male and most 13 (41.9%) as White; 17 (54.8%) reported being unemployed. Themes related to evidence included patients experience of stigma and perceived minimization of their pain and medical problems by ED staff. Themes about context included the ED not being seen as a source of OUD treatment initiation and patient readiness to initiate treatment being multifaceted, time sensitive, and related to internal and external patient factors. Themes related to facilitation of improved care of patients with OUD seen in the ED included a need for on-demand treatment and ED staff training. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this qualitative study, patients with OUD reported feeling stigmatized and minimized when accessing care in the ED and identified several opportunities to improve care. The findings suggest that strategies to address stigma, acknowledge and treat pain, and provide ED staff training should be implemented to improve ED care for patients with OUD and enhance access to life-saving treatment.","output":"Perspectives About Emergency Department Care Encounters Among Adults With Opioid Use Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prevention and control about the situation of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are grim at present.

This increase is partly explained by changes in food processing and consumption patterns that lead to the worldwide availability of high-risk food. As a result, vast outbreaks may occur due to contamination of food by a single foodhandler or at a single source. Although there are numerous fecal-orally transmitted viruses, most reports of foodborne transmission describe infections with Norwalk-like caliciviruses (NLV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV), suggesting that these viruses are associated with the greatest risk of foodborne transmission. NLV and HAV can be transmitted from person to person, or indirectly via food, water, or fomites contaminated with virus-containing feces or vomit. People can be infected without showing symptoms. The high frequency of secondary cases of NLV illness and - to a lesser extent - of hepatitis A following a foodborne outbreak results in amplification of the problem. The burden of illness is highest in the elderly, and therefore is likely to increase due to the aging population. For HAV, the burden of illness may increase following hygienic control measures, due to a decreasing population of naturally immune individuals and a concurrent increase in the population at risk. Recent advances in the research of NLV and HAV have led to the development of molecular methods which can be used for molecular tracing of virus strains. These methods can be and have been used for the detection of common source outbreaks. While traditionally certain foods have been implicated in virus outbreaks, it is clear that almost any food item can be involved, provided it has been handled by an infected person. There are no established methods for detection of viruses in foods other than shellfish. Little information is available on disinfection and preventive measures specifically for these viruses. Studies addressing this issue are hampered by the lack of culture systems. As currently available routine monitoring systems exclusively focus on bacterial pathogens, efforts should be made to combine epidemiological and virological information for a combined laboratory-based rapid detection system for foodborne viruses.

With this simulation mannequin trial, we assessed the impact of CBRNe PPE on cardiopulmonary resuscitation and combat casualty care procedures. METHODS We compared procedures performed by emergency medicine and anesthesiology senior residents, randomized in 2 groups (CBRNe PPE vs. no PPE). Chest compression (CC) depth was defined as the primary outcome. Time to completion was calculated for the following: tourniquet application; tension pneumothorax needle decompression; peripheral venous access (PVA) and intraosseous access positioning; and drug preparation and administration. A questionnaire was delivered to evaluate participants' perception. RESULTS Thirty-six residents participated.

We demonstrate that FXR antagonists, including the over-the-counter compound z-guggulsterone (ZGG) and the off-patent drug ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), downregulate ACE2 levels, and reduce susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung, cholangiocyte and gut organoids. We then show that therapeutic levels of UDCA downregulate ACE2 in human organs perfused ex situ and reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection ex vivo. Finally, we perform a retrospective study using registry data and identify a correlation between UDCA treatment and positive clinical outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection, including hospitalisation, ICU admission and death. In conclusion, we identify a novel function of FXR in controlling ACE2 expression and provide evidence that this approach could be beneficial for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby paving the road for future clinical trials.","output":"FXR inhibition reduces ACE2 expression, SARS-CoV-2 infection and may improve COVID-19 outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has reached pandemic levels in March 2020 and impacted public health with unpredictable consequences.1, 2 The conduct of clinical research in areas unrelated to COVID-19 has been disrupted and will be further affected.

It has the potential to revolutionise digital markets through the use of duty-free trading. This study investigates the factors which influence the behavioural intention to use cryptocurrency based on the Technology Acceptance Model 3 (TAM 3) during the COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) pandemic. Data were collected through a cross-sectional questionnaire from 357 Pakistani business-educated adults, including investors who had a rudimentary understanding of the technology and financial instruments. Partial least square (PLS)-based structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the developed theoretical framework based on the Technology acceptance model 3. The PLS model has explained 72.1% of what constitutes the behavioural intention to use cryptocurrency. Surprisingly, risk was not a major consideration. This might be due to the fact that the majority of respondents thought working with cryptocurrency was hazardous. Willingness to handle cryptocurrency risk, on the other hand, might be a stumbling block to acceptance. The most essential aspect of a cryptocurrency's success was the perceived usefulness. Moreover, the moderating role of experience was not substantiated in this study. However, perceived usefulness was identified as a partial mediator of subjective norm and the perceived ease to use. This study contributed to the literature through the application of TAM 3 (an extension of the technology acceptance models) to investigate the fundamental qualities a cryptocurrency should have in order to influence investor's behavioural intention to use it. These findings provide revolutionary insights for the present and future market players for investment planning and for improved cryptocurrencies development.","output":"Factors Influencing the Behavioural Intention to Use Cryptocurrency in Emerging Economies During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Based on Technology Acceptance Model 3, Perceived Risk, and Financial Literacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With great apprehension, the world is now watching the birth of a novel pandemic already causing tremendous suffering, death, and disruption of normal life.

METHOD During the SARS outbreak in 2003, we used the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) to assess SARS survivors treated in 2 major hospitals (non-health care workers, n = 49; health care workers, n = 30). We invited SARS survivors from the same hospitals (non-health care workers, n = 63; health care workers, n = 33) to complete the PSS-10 again in 2004. At that time, they were also asked to complete the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and measures of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic symptoms. PSS-10 scores were also obtained from matched community control subjects during the outbreak (n = 145) and again in 2004 (n = 112). RESULTS SARS survivors had higher stress levels during the outbreak, compared with control subjects (PSS-10 scores = 19.8 and 17.9, respectively; P < 0.01), and this persisted 1 year later (PSS-10 scores = 19.9 and 17.3, respectively; P < 0.01) without signs of decrease. In 2004, SARS survivors also showed worrying levels of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic symptoms. An alarming proportion (64%) scored above the GHQ-12 cut-off that suggests psychiatric morbidity. During the outbreak, health care worker SARS survivors had stress levels similar to those of non-health care workers, but health care workers showed significantly higher stress levels in 2004 (PSS-10 score = 22.8, compared with PSS-10 score = 18.4; P < 0.05) and had higher depression, anxiety, posttraumatic symptoms, and GHQ-12 scores. CONCLUSIONS One year after the outbreak, SARS survivors still had elevated stress levels and worrying levels of psychological distress. The situation of health care worker SARS survivors is particularly worrying. The long-term psychological implications of infectious diseases should not be ignored.

PROCEDURE A case-control study was conducted, using herds as the unit of investigation. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify risk factors for contracting disease. RESULTS 4 factors appeared to increase a herd's risk for WD: increase in herd prevalence of adult cows that had a fourfold or more increase in BCV serum IgG antibody titer; increase in herd prevalence of adult cows that had a fourfold or more increase in bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) titer; housing cattle in tiestall or stanchion barns rather than free-stall facilities; and use of equipment to handle manure and subsequently handle feed.

Preoperative CT showed a 1.2 cm  0.9 cm mass located in segment VIII. His alpha-fetal protein level was 444 ng/mL. Child-Pugh was Grade (A, 6), whereas an ICG-15 test yielded 2.7%. HCC was diagnosed preoperatively. The indications for TH were difficult tumor location, HCC, and a young patient with good resilience.The modified TH included 2 steps: (1) the patient was placed in a supine position. IUSO was used to locate the tumor in segment VIII and determine that intrahepatic metastasis had not occurred. The hepatoduodenal ligament was hanged over using a Pringle maneuver; (2) patient was then placed in the left-lateral position with single-lung ventilation. Three trocars were placed into the right thoracic cavity. The intra-thoracic space was observed using a regular 10-mm rigid scope. The diaphragm was transected and retracted. IUSO was used again to confirm the tumor location. Under the Pringle maneuver (once every 10 min), the superficial portion of the liver was transected by ultrasonic shears, whereas the deeper tissue was transected by LigaSure. Bipolar was used for hemostasis. The specimen was put into a retrieval bag and removed from the abdominal trocar. The diaphragm was repaired by running suturing. The operation time was 260 minutes and estimated blood loss was 30 mL. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 5 with normal liver function.

The document requires all 194 World Health Organization (WHO) Member States to detect, assess, notify and report any potential public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under specific timelines. Annex 2 of the IHR outlines decision-making criteria for State-appointed National Focal Points (NFP) to report potential PHEICs to the WHO, and is a critical component to the effective functioning of the IHRs. METHODS: The aim of the study was to review and evaluate the functioning of Annex 2 across WHO-reporting States Parties. Specific objectives were to ascertain NFP awareness and knowledge of Annex 2, practical use of the tool, activities taken to implement it, its perceived usefulness and user-friendliness. Qualitative telephone interviews, followed by a quantitative online survey, were administered to NFPs between October, 2009 and February, 2010. RESULTS: A total of 29 and 133 NFPs participated in the qualitative and quantitative studies, respectively. Qualitative interviews found most NFPs had a strong working knowledge of Annex 2; perceived the tool to be relevant and useful for guiding decisions; and had institutionalized management, legislation and communication systems to support it. NFPs also perceived Annex 2 as human and disease-centric, and emphasized its reduced applicability to potential PHEICs involving bioterrorist attacks, infectious diseases among animals, radio-nuclear and chemical spills, and water- or food-borne contamination. Among quantitative survey respondents, 88% reported having excellent/good knowledge of Annex 2; 77% reported always/usually using Annex 2 for assessing potential PHEICs; 76% indicated their country had some legal, regulatory or administrative provisions for using Annex 2; 95% indicated Annex 2 was always/usually useful for facilitating decisions regarding notifiability of potential PHEICs. CONCLUSION: This evaluation, including a large sample of WHO-reporting States Parties, found that the IHR's Annex 2 is perceived as useful for guiding decisions about notifiability of potential PHEICs. There is scope for the WHO to expand training and guidance on application of the IHR's Annex 2 to specific contexts.

Post-mortem microbiology (PMM) is crucial to identify the causative organism in deaths due to infection. MIA including the use of post-mortem (PM) computed tomography (CT) and PM magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is increasingly carried out as a complement or replacement for the traditional PM. In this setting, mirroring the traditional autopsy, PMM aims to: detect infectious organisms causing sudden unexpected deaths; confirm clinically suspected but unproven infection; evaluate the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy; identify emergent pathogens; and recognize medical diagnostic errors. Meaningful interpretation of PMM results requires careful evaluation in the context of the clinical history, macroscopic and microscopic findings. These guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary team with experts in various fields of microbiology and pathology on behalf of the ESGFOR (ESCMID C European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases - Study Group of Forensic and Post-mortem Microbiology, in collaboration with the ESP -European Society of Pathology-) based on a literature search and the authors expertise.

METHODS A new classification and standardized imaging diagnosis report mode of viral pneumonia was established by studying and summarizing the imaging findings of various kinds of viral pneumonia, combining with lesion density, interstitial changes, pleural effusion, lymph nodes, and some special signs. After systematic training, the radiologist experienced clinical practice for screening CT features. COVID-19 cases were screened retrospectively in the single-center. The confirmed cases were verified, and the diagnostic efficacy of the standardized imaging reporting system in screening COVID-19 was tested. RESULTS There were 912 patients in this stage receiving the screening imaging examination. Of them, 190 patients were screened in the report mode and 30 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19. The CT manifestation of COVID-19 was characterized by pure ground glass lesions or with a few solid components, predominant subpleural distribution, no lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion, and often with paving-way sign and air bronchus sign. In combination with the above signs, the diagnostic efficacy of COVID-19 was 0.942.

The secondary aim is to analyze the diagnostic value of hematologic parameters in COVID-19 complicated pregnancies. METHODS The current study is conducted in a high volume tertiary obstetrics center burdened by COVID-19 pandemics, in Turkey. In this cohort study, perinatal outcomes and complete blood count indices performed at the time of admission of 39 pregnancies (Study group) complicated by COVID-19 were compared with 69 uncomplicated pregnancies (Control group). RESULTS There was no significant difference between the obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnancies with COVID-19 compared to data of healthy pregnancies, except the increased C-section rate (p=0.026). Monocyte count, red cell distribution width (RDW), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR) were significantly increased (p<0.0001, p=0.009, p=0.043, p<0.0001, respectively) whereas the MPV and plateletcrit were significantly decreased (p=0.001, p=0.008) in pregnants with COVID-19. ROC analysis revealed that the optimal cut-off value for MLR was 0.354 which indicated 96.7% specificity and 59.5% sensitivity in diagnosis of pregnant women with COVID-19. A strong positive correlation was found between the MLR and the presence of cough symptom (r=41.4, p=<0.0001).

RECENT FINDINGS: From a total of 455 titles on COVID-19 and alcohol, 227 abstracts were screened, and 95 articles were reviewed (on November 25(th), 2020). The immediate effect was an increase in alcohol related emergencies including alcohol withdrawal, related suicides, and methanol toxicity. Although there are mixed findings with respect to changes in the quantity of drinking, there are reports of binge/heavy drinking during the lockdown as well as relapse postlockdown. Psychological, social, biological, economic and policy-related factors appear to influence the changes in drinking. Although preliminary data suggest no change in alcohol use among persons with comorbid mental illness, findings in this population are presently limited. Among patients with alcohol related liver disease, outcomes appear worse and caution is warranted with the use of medications. Alcohol also appears to increases the risk of COVID-19 infection and complicates its course. Although some nations banned alcohol sales completely during lockdown, others declared it as an essential commodity, resulting in different problems across countries. Alcohol use has added to the burden of the problem particularly among vulnerable groups like the adolescents, elderly, patients with cancer, as well as health professionals. Services for patients with alcohol use disorders have been affected. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has had considerable impact on alcohol use, with an increase in alcohol related emergencies, changes in alcohol use patterns, increased risk of contracting COVID-19, effect on alcohol policies and sales, and an effect on vulnerable groups. It is essential to understand and respond to the current situation, intervene early, and prevent further repercussions of the pandemic.

Our model postulates a general contact rate that represents a local measure of several factors: the population size of infected hosts that arrive at a given location as a function of total population size, the current incidence at neighboring locations, and the connectivity of the network where the disease spreads. This parameter can be interpreted as an indicator of outbreak risk at a given location. This parameter is tied to the fraction of individuals that move across boundaries (migration).

There was marked accumulation of eosinophils in mice given Irinotecan and eosinophil ablation inhibited intestinal mucositis. Treatment with Evasin-4, a chemokine receptor antagonist, reduced the recruitment of eosinophils and decreased Irinotecan-induced mucositis.

Adverse events were reported using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 and quality of life (QOL) with EORTC QLQ-C30 and CX24. A total of six symptoms with a related QOL question (diarrhoea, abdominal pain, anorexia, urinary incontinence, frequency and fatigue) were included. Month and severity score [MOSES=  (CTCAE grade x proportionate time)] was calculated. Cumulative-MOSES (C-MOSES) was calculated by summating these 6 individual MOSES. QoL was categorized as \\"substantially symptomatic\\" or \\"not\\". Receiver operator curve analysis was performed to determine the MOSES cut off that predicts for substantial QOL symptoms. CTCAE and MOSES were tested for accurately categorizing QOL impact. Findings: In the construction dataset, 201/300 patients had symptoms.

Empirical studies leveraging such methods when randomization is unethical or impractical have grown in the health sciences in recent years. The adoption of so-called causal methods to account for both/either measured and/or unmeasured confounders is an important addition to the methodological toolkit for understanding the distribution, progression, and consequences of infectious diseases (IDs) and interventions on IDs. In the face of the Covid-19 pandemic and in the absence of systematic randomization of exposures or interventions, the value of these methods is even more apparent. Yet to our knowledge, no studies have assessed how causal methods involving pooling individual-level, observational, longitudinal data are being applied in ID-related research. In this systematic review, we assess how these methods are used and reported in ID-related research over the last 10 years. Findings will facilitate evaluation of trends of causal methods for ID research and lead to concrete recommendations for how to apply these methods where gaps in methodological rigor are identified. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will apply MeSH and text terms to identify relevant studies from EBSCO (Academic Search Complete, Business Source Premier, CINAHL, EconLit with Full Text, PsychINFO), EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. Eligible studies are those that apply causal methods to account for confounding when assessing the effects of an intervention or exposure on an ID-related outcome using pooled, individual-level data from 2 or more longitudinal, observational studies.

Firstly, we computed the annual rate change in quarterly turnover to capture the effect of the COVID-19. Secondly, a multiple regression was estimated to identify factors explaining the perceived effect of the COVID-19 on the exporting companies. We found that the exporting companies experience on average a 53.308% drop in quarterly turnover in 2020 probably due to the COVID-19 crisis. Based on the forecasts, the results also revealed a very slow recovery in activities but the rate of change will remain negative until 2021 if nothing is done to support the MSMEs/MSMIs. Finally, we found that the perceived effect of the COVID-19 depends on the level of education of head of the companies, on the experience in exportation, and on the organization of the work because of the pandemic.

However, high incidence rates and rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants are concerning. In combination with acute supply deficits in Europe in early 2021, the question arises of whether stretching the vaccine, for instance by delaying the second dose, can make a significant contribution to preventing deaths, despite associated risks such as lower vaccine efficacy, the potential emergence of escape mutants, enhancement, waning immunity, reduced social acceptance of off-label vaccination, and liability shifts. A quantitative epidemiological assessment of risks and benefits of non-standard vaccination protocols remains elusive. To clarify the situation and to provide a quantitative epidemiological foundation we develop a stochastic epidemiological model that integrates specific vaccine rollout protocols into a risk-group structured infectious disease dynamical model. Using the situation and conditions in Germany as a reference system, we show that delaying the second vaccine dose is expected to prevent deaths in the four to five digit range, should the incidence resurge. We show that this considerable public health benefit relies on the fact that both mRNA vaccines provide substantial protection against severe COVID-19 and death beginning 12 to 14 days after the first dose. The benefits of protocol change are attenuated should vaccine compliance decrease substantially. To quantify the impact of protocol change on vaccination adherence we performed a large-scale online survey. We find that, in Germany, changing vaccination protocols may lead to small reductions in vaccination intention. In sum, we therefore expect the benefits of a strategy change to remain substantial and stable.","output":"Potential benefits of delaying the second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Testing patients for respiratory viruses should guide isolation precautions and provide a rationale for antimicrobial drug therapies, but few studies have evaluated these assumptions.

To understand the origin and molecular evolution of EPAC proteins, we performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of EPAC1 and EPAC2. Our study demonstrates that unlike its cousin PKA, EPAC proteins are only present in multicellular Metazoa. Within the EPAC family, EPAC1 is only associated with chordates, while EPAC2 spans the entire animal kingdom. Despite a much more contemporary origin, EPAC1 proteins show much more sequence diversity among species, suggesting that EPAC1 has undergone more selection and evolved faster than EPAC2. Phylogenetic analyses of the individual cAMP binding domain (CBD) and guanine nucleotide exchange (GEF) domain of EPACs, two most conserved regions between the two isoforms, further reveal that EPAC1 and EPAC2 are closely clustered together within both the larger cyclic nucleotide receptor and RAPGEF families. These results support the notion that EPAC1 and EPAC2 share a common ancestor resulting from a fusion between the CBD of PKA and the GEF from RAPGEF1. On the other hand, the two terminal extremities and the RAS-association (RA) domains show the most sequence diversity between the two isoforms.

The migration of the meiosis I spindle from the oocyte center to its cortex is mediated by F-actin. Specifically, an F-actin-cage surrounds the microtubule spindle and applies forces to it. To better understand how F-actin transmits forces to the spindle, we studied a potential direct link between F-actin and microtubules. For this, we tested the implication of Myosin-X, a known F-actin and microtubule binder involved in spindle morphogenesis and/or positioning in somatic cells, amphibian oocytes and embryos. Using a mouse strain conditionally invalidated for Myosin-X in oocytes and by live cell imaging, we show that Myosin-X is not localized on the spindle and dispensable for spindle and F-actin assembly. It is not required for force transmission since spindle migration and chromosome alignment occur normally. More broadly, Myosin-X is dispensable for oocyte developmental potential and female fertility. We therefore exclude a role for Myosin-X in transmitting F-actin-mediated forces to the spindle, opening new perspectives regarding this mechanism in mouse oocytes, which differs from most mitotic cells.","output":"Myosin-X is dispensable for spindle morphogenesis and positioning in the mouse oocyte."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In comparison to analytical tools, bioassays provide higher sensitivity and more complex evaluation of environmental samples and are indispensable tools for monitoring increasing in anthropogenic pollution. Nevertheless, the disadvantage in cellular assays stems from the material variability used within the assays, and an interlaboratory adaptation does not usually lead to satisfactory test sensitivities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of material variability on CXCL12 secretion by T47D cells, the outcome of an estrogenic activity assay, the CXCL-test. For this purpose, the cell line sources, sera suppliers, experimental and seeding media, and the amount of cell/well were tested. The multivariable linear model (MLM), employed as an innovative approach in this field for parameter evaluation, identified that all the tested parameters had significant effects. Knowledge of the contributions of each parameter has permitted step-by-step optimization. The most beneficial approach was seeding 20,000 cells/well directly in treatment medium and using DMEM for the treatment. Great differences in both basal and maximal cytokine secretions among the three tested cell lines and different impacts of each serum were also observed. Altogether, both these biologically based and highly variable inputs were additionally assessed by MLM and a subsequent two-step evaluation, which revealed a lower variability and satisfactory reproducibility of the test. This analysis showed that not only parameter and procedure optimization but also the evaluation methodology must be considered from the perspective of interlaboratory method adaptation. This overall methodology could be applied to all bioanalytical methods for fast multiparameter and accurate analysis.","output":"Key parameter optimization using multivariable linear model for the evaluation of the in vitro estrogenic activity assay in T47D cell lines (CXCL-test)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a critical capability for any autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). However, robust, accurate state estimation is still a work in progress when using low-cost sensors. We propose enhancing a typical low-cost sensor package using widely available and often free prior information; overhead imagery. Given an AUV's sonar image and a partially overlapping, globally-referenced overhead image, we propose using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate a synthetic overhead image predicting the above-surface appearance of the sonar image contents. We then use this synthetic overhead image to register our observations to the provided global overhead image. Once registered, the transformation is introduced as a factor into a pose SLAM factor graph. We use a state-of-the-art simulation environment to perform validation over a series of benchmark trajectories and quantitatively show the improved accuracy of robot state estimation using the proposed approach.

Most of these viruses encode their own endopeptidases, proteases with high substrate specificity that internally cleave large polyprotein precursors for the release of functional sub-units. Processing of the polyprotein, however, is not an all-or-nothing process in which endopeptidases act as simple peptide cutters. On the contrary, spatial-temporal modulation of these polyprotein cleavage events is crucial for a successful viral infection. In this way, the processing of the polyprotein coordinates viral replication, assembly and movement, and has significant impact on pathogen fitness and virulence. In this mini-review, we give an overview of plant viral proteases emphasizing their importance during viral infections and the varied functionalities that result from their proteolytic activities.","output":"Plant Viral Proteases: Beyond the Role of Peptide Cutters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mental health problems can occur in patients with chronic diseases such as tuberculosis, and the stress of a pandemic exacerbates the condition. The study aims to explore the magnitude of anxiety and depressive symptoms in tuberculosis (TB) patients in community health centers (CHCs) settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study design was quantitative and cross-sectional. Subjects were TB patients who were recruited from TB services by doctors in CHCs. TB patients (n=74) were screened for anxiety and depressive symptoms over 4 months. Screening results are uploaded on a cloud-based digital platform and analyzed. Non-TB patients, as a comparison, were recruited and screened from the same cloud-based digital platform (n=245) during the same period. Analysis was carried out using Rasch modeling for data transformation. Data was analyzed then for frequency distribution for both groups and the logistic binaries to measure the burden of the mixed anxiety and depressive symptoms among the TB patient ages sub-group. RESULTS: In both groups, there were 48.9% of mild, moderate, and severe categories of anxiety and 63.9% of depressive symptoms. In the TB-patients group, anxiety occurred at 48.7%, of which 23% were in the moderate and severe categories, compared to 13.4% for non-TB patients. Depressive symptoms were present in 71.6% of the TB patient group, of which 28.4% were in the moderate and severe categories, compared to 15.5% of non-TB patients. TB patients aged less than 20 years experienced moderateCsevere anxiety with depressive symptoms simultaneously (mixed) as much as 16.3% or 4.6 times more than those aged over 20 years (p<0.05).

Methods: In this study, pts with genitourinary malignancies (prostate, kidney, and bladder cancers) who had not received COVID-19 vaccination were included. Blood samples were collected prior to and after one dose of either an adenovirus- or mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine at the 2- and 6-month timepoints. Additional blood samples from pts receiving systemic treatment were collected at 3 consecutive therapy cycles following vaccination. Antibody titers were assessed using the SCoV-2 Detect IgG ELISA assay and results were reported as immune status ratios (ISR). T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing was performed using the MiXCR software (MiLabs) and custom strips were used to assess TCR abundance and homology clustering. Results: A total of 183 pts were enrolled, and 136 pts provided baseline blood samples. Among these, 59 (8:51 F:M) provided samples for both the 2-and 6-month timepoints by the 10/6/2021 data cut-off. In this subset of pts, median age was 66 (range 48-85) and 33 (55.9%), 25 (42.4%), and 1 (1.7%) pts had prostate, kidney, and bladder cancer, respectively. A majority of the pts (93.2%) were on systemic treatment with 23.7% on immune checkpoint inhibitors, 18.6% on targeted agents, and 1.7% on chemotherapy. The most commonly administered vaccines were BNT162b2 (61.0%) followed by mRNA-1273 (37.3%) and Ad26.COV2.S (1.7%). The mean (standard deviation) ISR values at baseline and 2 months were 0.681.59 and 6.621.75, respectively. At the 6-month timepoint, mean ISR was 5.461.61;this was significantly lower than the 2-month antibody titers (p < 0.0001), and reflects a reduction of 17.6%. Further data on TCR sequencing will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first data assessing the long-term serologic outcomes of COVID-19 vaccination in pts with cancer. Our data suggest waning immunity over time in cancer pts.

EC combined with Deep Learning (DL) is a promising technology and is widely used in several applications. However, in conventional DL architectures with EC enabled, data producers must frequently send and share data with third parties, edge or cloud servers, to train their models. This architecture is often impractical due to the high bandwidth requirements, legalization, and privacy vulnerabilities. The Federated Learning (FL) concept has recently emerged as a promising solution for mitigating the problems of unwanted bandwidth loss, data privacy, and legalization. FL can co-train models across distributed clients, such as mobile phones, automobiles, hospitals, and more, through a centralized server, while maintaining data localization. FL can therefore be viewed as a stimulating factor in the EC paradigm as it enables collaborative learning and model optimization. Although the existing surveys have taken into account applications of FL in EC environments, there has not been any systematic survey discussing FL implementation and challenges in the EC paradigm. This paper aims to provide a systematic survey of the literature on the implementation of FL in EC environments with a taxonomy to identify advanced solutions and other open problems. In this survey, we review the fundamentals of EC and FL, then we review the existing related works in FL in EC. Furthermore, we describe the protocols, architecture, framework, and hardware requirements for FL implementation in the EC environment. Moreover, we discuss the applications, challenges, and related existing solutions in the edge FL. Finally, we detail two relevant case studies of applying FL in EC, and we identify open issues and potential directions for future research.

Postviral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD) can be prolonged and clinically challenging to treat. Olfactory training (OT) has demonstrated potential benefit for patients with nonspecific olfactory dysfunction. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of OT specifically for PVOD by pooled analysis of the existing evidence. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. REVIEW METHODS Following PRISMA guidelines, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were queried and abstracts screened independently by 2 investigators. We included studies evaluating the efficacy of OT for PVOD and excluded studies evaluating pharmacologic interventions or olfactory loss from other causes. RESULTS Of the initial 1981 abstracts reviewed, 16 full-text articles were included. Sniffin' Sticks olfactory testing results were reported in 15 (93%) studies as threshold (T), discrimination (D), and identification (I) subscores and TDI total scores. All studies reported clinically significant results after OT, defined as a score improvement of TDI >5.5. Four studies were included in the meta-analysis, in which pooled estimates revealed that patients with PVOD who received OT had a 2.77 (95% confidence interval, 1.67-4.58) higher odds of achieving a clinically important difference in TDI scores compared to controls. CONCLUSION Meta-analysis of existing data demonstrates clinically significant improvements in PVOD associated with OT. Variability exists among OT protocols and may benefit from further optimization.

This approach has the potential to protect the most vulnerable from disease and provide society an incalculable economic benefit. Allo-priming healthy elderly adults is proposed to provide universal protection from progression of any type of viral infection, including protection against progression of the current outbreak of COVID-19 infection, and any future variants of the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus or the next Disease X. Allo-priming is an alternative approach for the COVID-19 pandemic that provides a back-up in case vaccination strategies to elicit neutralizing antibody protection fails or fails to protect the vulnerable elderly population. The allo-priming is performed using activated, intentionally mismatched, ex vivo differentiated and expanded living Th1-like cells (AlloStim(?)) derived from healthy donors currently in clinical use as an experimental cancer vaccine. Multiple intradermal injections of AlloStim(?) creates a dominate titer of allo-specific Th1/CTL memory cells in circulation, replacing the dominance of exhausted memory cells of the aged immune system. Upon viral encounter, by-stander activation of the allo-specific memory cells causes an immediate release of IFN-?, leading to development of an anti-viral state, by-stander activation of innate cellular effector cells and activation of cross-reactive allo-specific CTL. In this manner, the non-specific activation of allo-specific Th1/CTL initiates a cascade of spatial and temporal immune events which act to limit the early viral titer. The release of endogenous heat shock proteins (HSP) and DAMP from lysed viral-infected cells, in the context of IFN-?, creates of conditions for in situ vaccination leading to viral-specific Th1/CTL immunity. These viral-specific Th1/CTL provide sterilizing immunity and memory for protection from disease recurrence, while increasing the pool of Th1/CTL in circulation capable of responding to the next viral encounter. CONCLUSION: Allo-priming has potential to provide universal protection from viral disease and is a strategy to reverse immunosenescence and counter-regulate chronic inflammation (inflammaging). Allo-priming can be used as an adjuvant for anti-viral vaccines and as a counter-measure for unknown biological threats and bio-economic terrorism.","output":"Allo-priming as a universal anti-viral vaccine: protecting elderly from current COVID-19 and any future unknown viral outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyzes a sample of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the region of Madrid (Spain).

Given high rates of prescription opioid use/misuse and increasing illicit opioid use among older adults, factors associated with naloxone administration for older opioid poisoning cases need examination. METHODS We analyzed the 83,135 opioid-involved cases aged 50+ from the 2015-2020 National Poison Data System. Single-variable logistic regression was used to examine associations of naloxone administration with demographic factors, exposure site/reason, medical outcomes, management site/level of care, clinical effects, and other interventions. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to examine associations of naloxone administration with different types of opioids. RESULTS Over the six years, the proportion of prescription opioid cases that received naloxone therapy increased steadily from 21.9% to 28.4%. The proportion of illicit opioid cases that received naloxone therapy was 51.9% in 2015 and 59.8% in 2020 with a high of 64.4% in 2019. In 2020, the death rate for illicit opioid cases without naloxone therapy was 31.4% compared to 2.3% for those with the therapy. Cases managed at healthcare facilities (HCF) had higher odds of receiving naloxone therapy. Among prescription opioid cases, naloxone therapy rates among older and female cases and those managed at non-HCF settings were especially low even for major medical outcomes. Cases involving oxycodone, morphine, methadone, prescription fentanyl, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and other/unknown opioids had higher odds of naloxone administration. DISCUSSION Rates of naloxone therapy for older prescription opioid poisoning cases need improvement. While rates were higher among illicit opioid cases, the drop in 2020 and the sharp increase in deaths among illicit opioid cases without naloxone therapy confirm the importance of access to this life-saving intervention. CONCLUSIONS Increased naloxone co-prescribing and other means of facilitating access to naloxone are needed to prevent opioid poisoning deaths among older adults who use prescription opioids.","output":"Naloxone therapy for prescription and illicit opioid poisoning cases aged 50 + in the national poison data system, 2015-2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The addiction to illicit opioid and the misuse of prescription synthetic opioids pain relievers and fentanyl analogs generated an opioid epidemic in North America over the last two decades that affected public health with a constantly rising number of overdoses deaths.

METHOD MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials were searched to November 2021. Only randomised controlled trials were eligible for the subsequent network meta-analysis. RESULTS We included 107 studies based on 15 248 participants. Core (s.m.d. = -1.14, 95% credible interval (CrI) -1.72 to -0.55 [m.d. = -8.44]), complex (s.m.d. = -1.24, 95% CrI -1.85 to -0.64 [m.d. = -9.18]) and ultra-complex CBT (s.m.d. = -1.45, 95% CrI -1.88 to -1.02 [m.d. = -10.73]) were all significant in reducing depression up to 6 months from treatment onset. The significant benefits of the ultra-complex (s.m.d. = -1.09, 95% CrI -1.61 to -0.56 [m.d. = -8.07]) and complex CBT (s.m.d. = -0.73, 95% CrI -1.36 to -0.11 [m.d. = -5.40]) extended beyond 6 months. Ultra-complex CBT was most effective in individuals presenting comorbid mental health problems and when delivered by non-mental health specialists. Ultra-complex and complex CBT were more effective for people younger than 59 years. CONCLUSIONS For people without comorbid conditions healthcare and policy organisations should invest in core CBT.

Life sciences organizations (eg, pharmaceutical and med-tech companies) faced a rapidly increasing need for vital medical products, patient support, and vaccine development. Learning and development (L&D) departments play a crucial role in life sciences organizations as they apply learning initiatives to organizational strategy within a constantly evolving sector. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the work of L&D professionals in life sciences organizations changed profoundly during the abrupt shift to remote work, since learning and training normally occur in a face-to-face environment. Given the complex and dynamic situation of the pandemic, both individuals and organizations needed to learn quickly and apply what they learned to solve new, unprecedented problems. This situation presents an opportunity to study how characteristics of learning agility were evidenced by life sciences organizations and individual employees in the remote working mode. OBJECTIVE: In collaboration with Life Sciences Trainers & Educators Networks (LTEN), this study investigated the responses and learning agility of L&D professionals and their organizational leadership within the life sciences sector to the work changes due to the pandemic. The study answered the following questions: (1) How did L&D professionals in the life sciences sector respond to the changes in their work environment during the COVID-19 pandemic? (2) How did L&D professionals in the life sciences sector demonstrate learning agility during remote working? METHODS: We adopted a mixed methods approach that included a semistructured interview and a survey. Participants who were life sciences or health care L&D practitioners and in relevant positions were recruited via email through the LTEN and its partner pharmaceutical, biotech, or medical devices organizations. Interviews with 12 L&D professionals were conducted between June and August 2020 through phone or online conferencing, covering 22 open-ended questions to stimulate ideas that could be explored further in the survey. The semistructured interview questions were grounded in theory on learning agility. In total, 4 themes were developed from the interviews, which formed the basis for developing the survey items. The subsequent survey regarding 4 specific themes was conducted from August to October 2020 using Qualtrics. Both interview and survey data were analyzed based on a learning agility framework. RESULTS: Findings revealed generally positive organizational and individual responses toward the changes brought about by the pandemic. Results also indicated that a disruptive crisis, such as the shift from working in the office to working from home (WFH), required professionals learning agility to both self-initiate their own learning and to support the learning agility of others in the organization. CONCLUSIONS: This study was designed to better understand education and training in the life sciences field, particularly during the unique circumstances of the global COVID-19 pandemic. We put forward several directions for future research on the learning agility of L&D professionals in life sciences organizations.","output":"Learning Agility of Learning and Development Professionals in the Life Sciences Field During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Empirical Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Travel restrictions have proven to be an effective strategy to control the spread of the COVID-19 epidemics, in part because they help delay disease propagation across territories. The question, however, as to how different types of travel behaviour, from commuting to holiday-related travel, contribute to the spread of infectious diseases remains open. Here, we address this issue by using factorization techniques to decompose the temporal network describing mobility flows throughout 2020 into interpretable components. Our results are based on two mobility datasets: the first is gathered from Danish mobile network operators; the second originates from the Facebook Data-For-Good project. We find that mobility patterns can be described as the aggregation of three mobility network components roughly corresponding to travel during workdays, weekends and holidays, respectively. We show that, across datasets, in periods of strict travel restrictions the component corresponding to workday travel decreases dramatically. Instead, the weekend component, increases. Finally, we study how each type of mobility (workday, weekend and holiday) contributes to epidemics spreading, by measuring how the effective distance, which quantifies how quickly a disease can travel between any two municipalities, changes across network components.

We conducted a questionnaire study to disseminate the experience from China in terms of urology outpatient prevention and control measures under standardized prevention policies against COVID-19. Participants and Methods: From May 3, 2020 to June 25, 2020, we conducted an anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire study, focused on the status of and experiences with outpatient urology prevention and control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The targeted respondents were urologists in mainland China, covering all levels of hospitals and clinics. Results: A total of 216 (97%) valid responses were collected. We found that 183 (85%) respondents were from outside of Hubei province in China. One-hundred-and-fifty-eight (73%) respondents believed that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in urine, and that protection against urine exposure was needed.

Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies are rarely elicited in a mice model when NTD is used as an immunogen. We subsequently demonstrate that NTD has an altered antigenicity when expressed alone.

Cataract surgery is an efficacious intervention that usually restores vision. Although it is one of the most commonly conducted surgical interventions worldwide, good quality services (from being detected with operable cataract to undergoing surgery and receiving postoperative care) are not universally accessible. Poor quality understandably reduces the willingness of people with operable cataract to undergo surgery.

We conducted an exploratory single-center analysis to estimate the change in number of new stroke diagnoses in our region, and evaluate the proximate reasons for this change during the COVID-19 pandemic at a tertiary care center in New Jersey. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Comprehensive Stroke Center prospective cohort was retrospectively analyzed for the number of stroke admissions, demographic features, and short-term outcomes 5 months prior to 3/1/2020 (pre-COVID-19), and in the 6 weeks that followed (COVID-19 period). The primary outcome was the number of new acute stroke diagnoses before and during the COVID-19 period, as well as the potential reasons for a decline in the number of new diagnoses. RESULTS: Of the 328 included patients, 53 (16%) presented in the COVID-19 period. There was a mean fall of 38% in new stroke diagnoses (mean 1.13/day [SD 1.07] from 1.82/day [SD 1.38], p<0.01), which was related to a 59% decline in the number of daily transfers from referral centers (p<0.01), 25% fewer telestroke consultations (p=0.08), and 55% fewer patients presenting directly to our institution by private vehicle (p<0.01) and 29% fewer patients through emergency services (p=0.09). There was no significant change in the monthly number of strokes due to large vessel occlusion (LVO), however the proportion of new LVOs nearly doubled in the COVID-19 period (38% vs. 21%, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The observations at our tertiary care corroborate anecdotal reports that the number of new stroke diagnoses is falling, which seems related to a smaller proportion of patients seeking healthcare services for milder symptoms. These preliminary data warrant validation in larger, multi-center studies.","output":"Falling stroke rates during COVID-19 pandemic at a Comprehensive Stroke Center: Cover title: Falling stroke rates during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Patients with advanced kidney disease are less likely than many patients with other types of serious illness to enroll in hospice.

RESULTS Three dominant themes emerged from our qualitative analysis of the electronic medical records of 340 cohort members with notes containing hospice mentions: (1) hospice and usual care as antithetical care models: clinicians appeared to perceive a sharp demarcation between services that could be provided under hospice versus usual care and were often uncertain about hospice eligibility criteria. This could shape decision-making about hospice and dialysis and made it hard to individualize care; (2) hospice as a last resort: patients often were referred to hospice late in the course of illness and did not so much choose hospice as accept these services after all treatment options had been exhausted; and (3) care complexity: patients' complex care needs at the time of hospice referral could complicate transitions to hospice, stretch the limits of home hospice, and promote continued reliance on the acute care system.

The objectives of this paper are to describe the methods and responses to a COVID-19 survey administered by the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) to assess the impact of the pandemic on older women. METHODS: WHI is an ongoing prospective cohort study that recruited 161,808 postmenopausal women from 1993-1998. From June-October 2020, participants in active follow-up were surveyed by mail, phone, or online to assess health and well-being, living situations, lifestyle, health care, and self-reported COVID-19 testing, treatment, and preventive behaviors. RESULTS: Of 64,061 eligible participants, 49,695 (average age 83.6 years  5.6) completed the COVID-19 survey (response rate 77.6%). Many participants reported very good or good well-being (75.6%). Respondents reported being very concerned about the pandemic (51.1%) (more common in urban compared to rural areas), with 6.9% reporting disruptions in living arrangements and 9.7% reporting changes in medication access. Participants (54.4%) reported physical activity levels were much less or somewhat less compared to levels before the pandemic, and this was more pronounced in urban areas vs. rural areas (55.3% vs. 44.4%). Participants engaged in preventive behaviors including wearing a face mask (93.2%). A total of 18.9% reported testing for SARS-CoV-2, among whom 3.5% (n=311) reported testing positive.

However, the dysregulation of RNA m6A regulators (writers, readers, and erasers) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has never been reported. In this study, we showed that METTL3, one of the writers, was upregulated in NPC. Functional studies revealed that METTL3 promoted the migration and invasion of NPC cells. However, METTL3 knockdown reversed this effect and inhibited the migration, invasion and metastasis of NPC cells. METTL3 activated the luciferase activity of TOPflash (a reporter for beta-catenin/TCF signaling), and downregulation of METTL3 inhibited the expression of beta-catenin/TCF target genes vimentin and N-cadherin, which are two regulators of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, dominant negative beta-catenin blocked the migration and invasion of NPC cells. Further mechanistic studies showed that METTL3 silencing decreased the m6A methylation and total mRNA levels of Tankyrase, a negative regulator of axin. Moreover, Tankyrase overexpression abrogated the repressive effects of METTL3 silencing on the migration of NPC cells. Collectively, our study demonstrates the oncogenic roles of METTL3 in NPC, and suggests that METTL3 might be a therapeutic target for NPC.","output":"Upregulated METTL3 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma enhances the motility of cancer cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I formulate three basic biomedical/statistical assumptions that should ideally guide well-designed population prevalence studies of the present or past disease including COVID-19 On the basis of these assumptions alone, I compute several probability distributions required for statistical analysis of testing data collected from a sample of individuals drawn from a heterogeneous population I also construct a consistent asymptotically unbiased estimator of the population prevalence of the disease or infection from the collected data and derive a simple upper bound for its variance All the results are rigorously proved and valid for any test for COVID-19 or other disease provided that the sum of the test&rsquo;s sensitivity and specificity is larger than 1 A few recommendations for the design of COVID-19 prevalence studies informed by the results of this work are formulated The methodology developed in this article may prove applicable to diseases and conditions other than COVID-19 as well as in some non-epidemiological settings","output":"Estimation of Population Prevalence of COVID-19 Using Imperfect Tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a multifaceted disease and is associated with complications for newborns and mothers.

Objective: To describe the prevalence and severity of cardiac MRI findings of myocarditis in a population of competitive student athletes recovering from COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case series, an electronic health record search was performed at our institution (University of Wisconsin) to identify all competitive athletes (a consecutive sample) recovering from COVID-19, who underwent gadolinium-enhanced cardiac MRI between January 1, 2020, and November 29, 2020. The MRI findings were reviewed by 2 radiologists experienced in cardiac imaging, using the updated Lake Louise criteria. Serum markers of myocardial injury and inflammation (troponin-I, B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), an electrocardiogram, transthoracic echocardiography, and relevant clinical data were obtained. Exposures: COVID-19 infection, confirmed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence and severity of MRI findings consistent with myocarditis among young competitive athletes recovering from COVID-19. Results: A total of 145 competitive student athletes (108 male and 37 female individuals; mean age, 20 years; range, 17-23 years) recovering from COVID-19 were included. Most patients had mild (71 [49.0%]) or moderate (40 [27.6%]) symptoms during the acute infection or were asymptomatic (24 [16.6%]). Symptoms were not specified or documented in 10 patients (6.9%). No patients required hospitalization. Cardiac MRIs were performed a median of 15 days (range, 11-194 days) after patients tested positive for COVID-19. Two patients had MRI findings consistent with myocarditis (1.4% [95% CI, 0.4%-4.9%]). Of these, 1 patient had marked nonischemic late gadolinium enhancement and T2-weighted signal abnormalities over multiple segments, along with an abnormal serum troponin-I level; the second patient had 1-cm nonischemic mild late gadolinium enhancement and mild T2-weighted signal abnormalities, with normal laboratory values. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series study, based on MRI findings, there was a low prevalence of myocarditis (1.4%) among student athletes recovering from COVID-19 with no or mild to moderate symptoms. Thus, the utility of cardiac MRI as a screening tool for myocarditis in this patient population is questionable.","output":"Evaluation for Myocarditis in Competitive Student Athletes Recovering From Coronavirus Disease 2019 With Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most educational institutions switched to online learning as a standard education delivery model. The use of social media has since become an essential and integral component of students lives, both as a tool to facilitate learning as well as for social connections. The current study examines the use of social media and its association with depression among newly enrolled first-year university students during the national lockdown. Three hundred and eighty-six (N = 386) participants aged between 19C21 years from one faculty of a public university were recruited online for the study. Self-reports on daily time spent and emotional investment (frequency of visits) on social media were obtained. Depression was assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression Scale. Results from binary logistic regression showed that high levels of investment in a variety of social media activities were associated with symptoms of depression. Compared to the users at the lowest level, students in the higher usage groups had significantly increased odds of depression (AOR = 2.94, 95% CI = 1.22C7.08;AOR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.04C5.94, respectively), even after controlling for all covariates. Total time spent, however, was not found to associate with depression. Additionally, indigenous students from East Malaysia who mostly reside in rural areas recorded a significantly higher odds of experiencing depression during the pandemic (AOR = 3.32, 95% CI = 1.23C8.90, p =.02) compared to the Malays. Given the pervasive use of social media during the COVID-19 lockdown, the findings of the study suggest that educators at higher education institutions can leverage on the ubiquitous use of social media among students to disseminate targeted educational messages regarding mental health. ?

Many programmes had to ramp-down their activity, which may significantly affect transplant volumes. We aimed to pragmatically analyse measures of transplant activity and compare them by a countrys income level and cumulative COVID-19 incidence (CCI). DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: From June to September 2020, we surveyed transplant physicians identified as key informants in their programmes. Of the 1267 eligible physicians, 40.5% from 71 countries participated. OUTCOME: Four pragmatic measures of transplant activity. RESULTS: Overall, 46.5% of the programmes from high-income countries anticipate being able to maintain >75% of their transplant volume compared with 31.6% of the programmes from upper-middle-income countries, and with 21.7% from low/lower-middle-income countries (p<0.001). This could be because more programmes in high-income countries reported being able to perform transplantation/s (86.8%%C58.5%C67.9%, p<0.001), maintain prepandemic deceased donor offers (31.0%%C14.2%C26.4%, p<0.01) and avoid a ramp down phase (30.9%%C19.7%C8.3%, p<0.001), respectively. In a multivariable analysis that adjusted for CCI, programmes in upper-middle-income countries (adjusted OR, aOR=0.47, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.81) and low/lower-middle-income countries (aOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.67) had lower odds of being able to maintain >75% of their transplant volume, compared with programmes in high-income countries. Again, this could be attributed to lower-income being associated with 3.3C3.9 higher odds of performing no transplantation/s, 66%C68% lower odds of maintaining prepandemic donor offers and 37%C76% lower odds of avoiding ramp-down of transplantation. Overall, CCI was not associated with these measures. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of the pandemic on transplantation was more in lower-income countries, independent of the COVID-19 burden. Given the lag of 1C2 years in objective data being reported by global registries, our findings may inform practice and policy.

METHODS: In this study we designed, implemented, and validated an isolation space at a skilled nursing facility in Lancaster, PA. The overall goal was to minimize disease transmission between residents and staff within the facility. We created an isolation space by modifying an existing HVAC system of the SNF. We measured pressure on-site and performed computational fluid dynamics and Lagrangian particle-based modeling to test containment and possible transmission extent given the isolation space is considered negative rather than individual rooms. RESULTS: Pressure data shows the isolation space maintained an average (standard deviation) hourly value of -2.3 Pa (0.12 Pa) pressure differential between it and the external hallway connected to the rest of the facility. No transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between residents isolated to the space occurred, nor did any transmission to the staff or other residents occur. The isolation space was successfully implemented and, as of writing, continues to be operational through the pandemic.

In the quantitative stage, an integrated model based on innovation resistance theory and distrust theory was tested using the survey data collected from 194 non-adopters of the DCT app from India. The findings revealed that the factors, distrust, value barrier, information privacy concerns, and usage barrier predicted the resistance to the DCT app, and resistance, in turn, predicted intention to use. Additionally, distrust was found to be a key mediator between innovation barriers and resistance.

The aim of this research is to provide a high-resolution global model of the pandemic that overcomes the problem of biased country-level data on the number of infected cases. To achieve this we propose a novel SIR-type metapopulation transmission model and a set of analytically derived model parameters. We used them to perform a simulation of the disease spread with help of the Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEAM) framework embedding actual population densities, commute patterns and long-range travel networks. The simulation starts on 17 November 2019 with the index case (presymptomatic, yet infectious) in Wuhan, China, and results in an accurate prediction of the number of diagnosed cases after 154 days in multiple countries across five continents. In addition, the model outcome shows high compliance with the results of a random screening test conducted on pregnant women in the New York area. Methods: We have built a modified SIR metapopulation transmission model and parameterized it analytically either by setting the values of the parameters based on the literature, or by assuming their plausible values. We compared our results with the number of diagnosed cases in twenty selected countries, ones which provide reliable statistics but differ substantially in terms of strength and speed of undertaken Non-Drug Interventions. The obtained 95% confidence intervals for the predictions are in agreement with the empirical data. Results: The parameters that successfully model the pandemic are: the basic reproduction number R0, 4.4; a latent non-infectious period of 1.1. days followed by 4.6 days of the presymptomatic infectious period; the probability of developing severe symptoms, 0.01; the probability of being diagnosed when presenting severe symptoms of 0.6; the probability of diagnosis for cases with mild symptoms or asymptomatic, 0.001. Discussion: Parameters that successfully reproduce the observed number of cases indicate that both R0and the prevalence of the virus might be underestimated. This is in concordance with the newest research on undocumented COVID-19 cases. Consequently, the actual mortality rate is putatively lower than estimated. Confirmation of the pandemic characteristic by further refinement of the model and screening tests is crucial for developing an effective strategy for the global epidemiological crisis.","output":"From the index case to global spread: The global mobility based modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic implies higher infection rate and lower detection ratio than current estimates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the pathogen accountable for the recent COVID-19 outbreak that originated from China in December 2019.

There is a knowledge gap about the effect of pandemics on maternal, newborn, and child well-being. This systematic review was conducted to study maternal and child health (MCH) services utilization during pandemics (Zika, Ebola, and COVID-19) and the effectiveness of various interventions undertaken for ensuring utilization of MCH services. METHODOLOGY: A systematic and comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, Epistemonikos, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. Of 5643 citations, 60 potential studies were finally included for analysis. The included studies were appraised using JBI Critical appraisal tools. Study selection and data extraction were done independently and in duplicate. Findings are presented narratively based on the RMNCHA framework by World Health Organization (WHO). RESULTS: Maternal and child health services such as antenatal care (ANC) visits, institutional deliveries, immunization uptake, were greatly affected during a pandemic situation. Innovative approaches in form of health care services through virtual consultation, patient triaging, developing dedicated COVID maternity centers and maternity schools were implemented in different places for ensuring continuity of MCH care during pandemics. None of the studies reported the effectiveness of these interventions during pandemic-related health emergencies.

Vaccines are considered the best therapeutic strategy against the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the adverse reactions of vaccines significantly affect the rates of vaccination and may be more serious in patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This protocol aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which analysed the safety of vaccines in patients with NCDs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This study will be according to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols. A comprehensive search will be carried out to identify registered RCTs in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Library between 1 January 2020 and 31 May 2022. Selection of trials, data extraction, risk of bias assessment and quality of evidence assessment will be done by two researchers, and disagreements will be resolved by the corresponding author. The primary outcomes are local and systemic adverse events of vaccines in patients with NCDs. Additional outcomes are related events caused by vaccine adverse events, including but not limited to cases of adverse events leading to discontinuation from a dose or withdrawal from participation in the trial. Heterogeneity will be assessed with I2 statistics and data analysis will be conducted with RevMan V.5.4.1. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This is a protocol and ethical approval is not necessary.

To date, the 21L/BA.2 Omicron variant has remained very minority globally but became predominant in Denmark instead of the 21K/BA.1 variant. Here we describe the first cases diagnosed with this variant in south-eastern France. We identified thirteen cases using variant-specific qPCR and next-generation sequencing between 28/11/2021 and 31/01/2022, the first two cases being diagnosed in travellers returning from Tanzania. Overall, viral genomes displayed a mean (+/-standard deviation) number of 65.9+/-2.5 (range, 61-69) nucleotide substitutions and 31.0+/-8.3 (27-50) nucleotide deletions, resulting in 49.6+/-2.2 (45-52) amino acid substitutions (including 28 in the spike protein) and 12.4+/-1.1 (12-15) amino acid deletions. Phylogeny showed the distribution in three different clusters of these genomes, which were most closely related to genomes from England and South Africa, from Singapore and Nepal, or from France and Denmark. Structural predictions pointed out a significant enlargement and flattening of the 21L/BA.2 N-terminal domain surface compared with that of the 21K/BA.2 Omicron variant, which may facilitate initial viral interactions with lipid rafts.

Health systems may be uniquely suited to support these workers given their medical expertise, and mobile apps can reach local communities despite social distancing requirements. Formal evaluation of real-world mobile app-based interventions is lacking. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the adoption, acceptability, and appropriateness of an academic medical center-sponsored app-based intervention (COVID-19 Guide App) designed to support access of first responders and essential workers to COVID-19 information and testing services. We also sought to better understand the COVID-19-related needs of these workers early in the pandemic. METHODS: To understand overall community adoption, views and download data of the COVID-19 Guide App were described. To understand the adoption, appropriateness, and acceptability of the app and the unmet needs of workers, semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted by telephone, by video, and in person with first responders and essential workers in the San Francisco Bay Area who were recruited through purposive, convenience, and snowball sampling. Interview transcripts and field notes were qualitatively analyzed and presented using an implementation outcomes framework. RESULTS: From its launch in April 2020 to September 2020, the app received 8262 views from unique devices and 6640 downloads (80.4% conversion rate, 0.61% adoption rate across the Bay Area). App acceptability was mixed among the 17 first responders interviewed and high among the 10 essential workers interviewed. Select themes included the need for personalized and accurate information, access to testing, and securing personal safety. First responders faced additional challenges related to interprofessional coordination and a \\"culture of heroism\\" that could both protect against and exacerbate health vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS: First responders and essential workers both reported challenges related to obtaining accurate information, testing services, and other resources. A mobile app intervention has the potential to combat these challenges through the provision of disease-specific information and access to testing services but may be most effective if delivered as part of a larger ecosystem of support. Differentiated interventions that acknowledge and address the divergent needs between first responders and non-first responder essential workers may optimize acceptance and adoption.","output":"An App-Based Intervention to Support First Responders and Essential Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Needs Assessment and Mixed Methods Implementation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early in the pandemic, Florida municipal managers indicated that forecasting the impact on local revenues was one of their top priorities in responding to the pandemic, yet such a tool has not been widely available.

Comparing mothers and fathers who work exclusively at the workplace, exclusively from home, and part-day from home, we describe differences in time spent on housework, childcare, and leisure;the nature of time worked at home;and the subjective experiences of telecommuting. In addition to a broad descriptive portrait, we take advantage of a quasi-experimental design in the ATUS leave supplements to examine time working at home among those who report ever telecommuting, providing estimates of telecommutings effect on other uses of time that better approximate causal relationships than prior studies. We find that gender gaps in housework are larger for telecommuters, and, among telecommuters, larger on telecommuting days. Conversely, telecommuting may shrink the gender gap in childcare, particularly among couples with two full time earners, although childcare more frequently impinges upon mothers work time. Survey data collected following the March COVID19 stay-at-home orders show that telecommuting mothers more frequently report feelings of anxiety, loneliness and depression than telecommuting fathers.

Current approaches therefore typically transfer rankers trained on English data to other languages and cross-lingual setups by means of multilingual encoders: they fine-tune all the parameters of a pretrained massively multilingual Transformer (MMT, e.g., multilingual BERT) on English relevance judgments and then deploy it in the target language. In this work, we show that two parameter-efficient approaches to cross-lingual transfer, namely Sparse Fine-Tuning Masks (SFTMs) and Adapters, allow for a more lightweight and more effective zero-shot transfer to multilingual and cross-lingual retrieval tasks. We first train language adapters (or SFTMs) via Masked Language Modelling and then train retrieval (i.e., reranking) adapters (SFTMs) on top while keeping all other parameters fixed. At inference, this modular design allows us to compose the ranker by applying the task adapter (or SFTM) trained with source language data together with the language adapter (or SFTM) of a target language. Besides improved transfer performance, these two approaches offer faster ranker training, with only a fraction of parameters being updated compared to full MMT fine-tuning. We benchmark our models on the CLEF-2003 benchmark, showing that our parameter-efficient methods outperform standard zero-shot transfer with full MMT fine-tuning, while enabling modularity and reducing training times. Further, we show on the example of Swahili and Somali that, for low(er)-resource languages, our parameter-efficient neural re-rankers can improve the ranking of the competitive machine translation-based ranker.","output":"Parameter-Efficient Neural Reranking for Cross-Lingual and Multilingual Retrieval"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is likely to have significant implications for the cardiovascular care of patients. In most countries, containment has already started (on 17 March 2020 in France), and self-quarantine and social distancing are reducing viral contamination and saving lives. However, these considerations may only be the tip of the iceberg; most resources are dedicated to the struggle against COVID-19, and this unprecedented situation may compromise the management of patients admitted with cardiovascular conditions. Aim We aimed to assess the effect of COVID-19 containment measures on cardiovascular admissions in France. Methods We asked nine major cardiology centres to give us an overview of admissions to their nine intensive cardiac care units for acute myocardial infarction or acute heart failure, before and after containment measures. Results Before containment (02C16 March 2020), the nine participating intensive cardiac care units admitted 4.81.6 patients per day, versus 2.61.5 after containment (17C22 March 2020) (rank-sum test P =0.0006). Conclusions We confirm here, for the first time, a dramatic drop in the number of cardiovascular admissions after the establishment of containment. Many hypotheses might explain this phenomenon, but we feel it is time raise the alarm about the risk for patients presenting with acute cardiovascular disease, who may suffer from lack of attention, leading to severe consequences (an increase in the number of ambulatory myocardial infarctions, mechanical complications of myocardial infarction leading to an increase in the number of cardiac arrests, unexplained deaths, heart failure, etc.).

Risk factors for severe course of COVID-19 and increased mortality in these patients are unclear. Objectives: To evaluate the course of COVID-19 in our AAV cohort and identifying risk factors for mortality. Methods: Patients with AAV who were classified according to CHCC and whose scheduled last visit were after December 2019 were screened and evaluated for COVID-19 either by phone call or in the clinic. Records of patients with a history of hospital admission due to COVID-19 were evaluated. Cumulative clinical findings and treatment history were noted. Hypogammaglobulinemia (hIgG) was defined as IgG level below 700 mg/dl. All inpatients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were screened for hIgG and IVIG was administered if necessary. Results: Eighty-nine patients (47.2% female, mean age 56 + 12.5 (28-81)) were included into the study. The diagnosis was GPA in 56 (62.9%) and MPA in 33 (37.1%) patients. Mean follow up time was 91 + 53.4 (26-272) months. Anti-PR3 and anti-MPO were positive in 46 (51.7%) and 32 (35.9%) patients, respectively. Lower respiratory tract (LRT) involvement was present in 72 (80.9%) and 10 patients had a history of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH). Sixty-one patients (68.2%) had a history of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) and 21 (23.6%) had peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement. Fifteen (16.9%) patients had COVID-19;14 of them were PCR positive, one patient had symptoms and thorax CT findings compatible with COVID-19. Pulmonary infiltrates were observed in 13 patients (86.7%);9 (60%) had severe pneumonia. Twelve patients (85.7%) were hospitalized, 6 patients (42.9%) needed ICU admission and 5 patients (35.7%) died. Tocilizumab and anakinra for hyperinflammation during COVID-19 were used in 1 (6.7%) and 4 (26.7%) patients, respectively. Four out of five deceased patients (3 on RTX treatment, 1 with renal transplant) were in remission at the time of COVID-19. COVID-19 was detected in a patient with disease flare and DAH, during treatment with high dose steroids and plasmapheresis. hIgG was detected in all deceased patients from COVID-19 during hospital admission (mean IgG: 495113.2 mg/dL). Symptomatic COVID-19 was more frequent in patients with a history of DAH, RPGN and hIgG. hIgG during the follow-up was significantly associated with COVID-19 in multivariable analysis (p=0.01, OR=20,6 %95 CI (2-210). Comparison of patients who died of COVID-19 and survived showed that female sex, PNS involvement and hIgG during the clinical course and hospital admission were risk factors for increased mortality (Table 1). Age, smoking, treatments, history of flares or serious infections, remission status and chronic renal insufficiency did not differ between groups. Conclusion: The frequency and mortality from COVID-19 is found to be high in our AAV cohort compared to previous reports (1).

Smoking is the most common form of abuse with complications such as eosinophilic pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, acute interstitial pneumonia, and pulmonary fibrosis. We present an atypical methamphetamine-induced lung injury. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old female with a 40-pack year smoking history and polysubstance abuse presented with acute onset shortness of breath. On admission, she was hypoxic requiring 25 liters of high flow oxygen. On examination, the patient was afebrile with normal blood pressure. Chest auscultation revealed wheezing, most prominent in the left lung fields, while the rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable. Laboratories showed leukocytosis, normal liver, and renal function test. Sputum culture had no bacterial growth and Covid-19 PCR negative. Urine toxicology was positive for methamphetamine. Contrast CT chest showed diffuse interstitial thickening and ground-glass opacities throughout the right lung but normal left lung parenchyma with narrowing of the distal left mainstem bronchus by an endobronchial mass. The patient's hypoxemia improved with Methylprednisolone. Bronchoscopy showed a left mainstem lesion with near-complete obstruction of the left upper and lower lobes with biopsy revealing squamous cell carcinoma. There was normal airway mucosa on the right lung segments and scant inflammation without malignant cells on biopsy. The patient underwent successful tumor debulking with follow-up PET CT demonstrating decreased but persistence of alveolar septal thickening on the right lung with FDG positive mediastinal lymph nodes. The patient was weaned off supplemental oxygen 4 weeks later. DISCUSSION: Diagnosis of Methamphetamine-induced lung injury depends on the history of recent use, ground-glass opacities on imaging, and exclusion of other infections which was fulfilled by our patient but with the question of left lung sparing. Crystalline particles range in size from less than 250 nm-10 m, with clusters as large as 80 m where the obstructing mass may have prevented the flow of the drug vapor. Methamphetamine has also been postulated to release early response cytokines including TNF-alpha and IL-6 leading to recruitment of neutrophils and free radicals release causing acute lung injury. The management is mainly supportive with empiric steroids with improvement via impeding this inflammatory cascade. CONCLUSIONS: Our case demonstrates multiple learning points including particle size factor in passage through an obstructed airway, response to steroids supporting in settings of acute inflammation, and the persistence of residual lung disease on imaging in contrast to clinical improvement 4 weeks post-exposure.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a multi-hospital, academic medical institution in New York City. Outcomes included mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and AKI among hospitalized patients. We also evaluated risk of hospitalization among all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multilevel logistic regression models were used for analysis. RESULTS: We identified 6,893 patients who met inclusion criteria, of which 4,018 were hospitalized. Among hospitalized patients 374 (9%) had a history of cancer, 281 (7%) experienced AKI, and 1,045 (26%) died. In adjusted analyses, patients with a history of cancer had 1.33 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.69) times the odds of death compared to those without cancer and this appeared to be driven by lung cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 2.44, 95% CI= 1.05, 4.39). Patients with a history of genitourinary cancer were not at higher risk of mortality compared to those without cancer (OR=0.99, 95% CI= 0.61, 1.62). History of cancer was not associated with ICU admission or AKI in overall and subgroup analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of cancer who are hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection are not at greater risk for AKI, though they are at higher risk for mortality as compared to patients without a history of cancer. The increased risk in mortality appears driven by patients with pulmonary neoplasms. Patients with a history of genitourinary malignancies do not appear to be at higher risk for AKI or for mortality compared to the general population.","output":"Cancer, Mortality, and Acute Kidney Injury among Hospitalized Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Perfusion Index (PI) is an indirect, non invasive and continuous method to measure peripheral perfusion.

In this study, healthy volunteers with the age of 18-60 years were included. All the volunteers were evaluated with a pulse oximeter in all extremities of both the hands to check their PI. For significant results of repeated measure of ANOVA, post-hoc Bonferroni test were used to evaluate all multiple comparisons. All p-values <0.05 were considered significant. Results: A total of 96 healthcare volunteers with the mean age of 35.2511.074 years were included in the present study. Majority of the population were male (80.2%). The highest perfusion was recorded in the right hand ring finger (8.594.03%). The lowest reading was noted in the right hand thumb (6.272.89%). The PI noted in the right thumb was significantly less than all the other fingers (p-value <0.05) except left thumb and left little finger (p-value >0.05). Conclusion: From this study, authors more emphasis on the choice of the finger during the measurement of PI because both highest and lowest perfusions were reported in the dominant hand.","output":"Measurement of perfusion index of all the fingers of both the hands in healthcare volunteers: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13) acts as an exopeptidase and has been studied for decades. In recent years, it has been seen not only as a tumor-related target but also as a potential functional protein in various other physiological or pathological processes, such as analgesia, virus infection and inflammation. AREAS COVERED In this review, APN inhibitors in the patents publicized during 2006 - 2010 are introduced. Readers will gain information on the patent inhibitors, including chemical structures, original sources or synthetic methods, biological assays and application potential. EXPERT OPINION It is difficult to identify compounds that interact with the function not relevant with peptide-hydrolysis of APN in the enzyme activity assay, and such compounds have not been reported in the patents during the past 5 years. The progress of protein-small molecule interaction detecting means, such as surface plasmon resonance, will possibly help develop such compounds for the treatment of relevant diseases or new molecular probes in mechanism investigation.","output":"Aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2) inhibitors (2006 - 2010): a patent review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the disordered reactions of most governments made the importance of mathematical modelling and model-based predictions evident, even outside the scientific community.

Given the extent of the pandemic, it is urgent to identify risk factors associated with severe disease. Accurate prediction of those at risk of developing severe infections is also important clinically. Methods: Based on the UK Biobank (UKBB data), we built machine learning(ML) models to predict the risk of developing severe or fatal infections, and to evaluate the major risk factors involved. We first restricted the analysis to infected subjects, then performed analysis at a population level, considering those with no known infections as controls. Hospitalization was used as a proxy for severity. Totally 93 clinical variables (collected prior to the COVID-19 outbreak) covering demographic variables, comorbidities, blood measurements (e.g. hematological/liver and renal function/metabolic parameters etc.), anthropometric measures and other risk factors (e.g. smoking/drinking habits) were included as predictors. XGboost (gradient boosted trees) was used for prediction and predictive performance was assessed by cross-validation. Variable importance was quantified by Shapley values and accuracy gain. Shapley dependency and interaction plots were used to evaluate the pattern of relationship between risk factors and outcomes. Results: A total of 1191 severe and 358 fatal cases were identified. For the analysis among infected individuals (N=1747), our prediction model achieved AUCs of 0.668 and 0.712 for severe and fatal infections respectively. Since only pre-diagnostic clinical data were available, the main objective of this analysis was to identify baseline risk factors. The top five contributing factors for severity were age, waist-hip ratio(WHR), HbA1c, number of drugs taken(cnt_tx) and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels. For prediction of mortality, the top features were age, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference (WC), urea and WHR. In subsequent analyses involving the whole UKBB population (N for controls=489987), the corresponding AUCs for severity and fatality were 0.669 and 0.749. The same top five risk factors were identified for both outcomes, namely age, cnt_tx, WC, WHR and cystatin C. We also uncovered other features of potential relevance, including testosterone, IGF-1 levels, red cell distribution width (RDW) and lymphocyte percentage. Conclusions: We identified a number of baseline clinical risk factors for severe/fatal infection by an ML approach. For example, age, central obesity, impaired renal function, multi-comorbidities and cardiometabolic abnormalities may predispose to poorer outcomes. The presented prediction models may be useful at a population level to help identify those susceptible to developing severe/fatal infections, hence facilitating targeted prevention strategies. Further replications in independent cohorts are required to verify our findings.","output":"Uncovering clinical risk factors and prediction of severe COVID-19: A machine learning approach based on UK Biobank data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the financial trends in Medicare reimbursement rates for the most billed procedures at a single institution from 2000 to 2020 within pediatric otolaryngology. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective data analysis. SETTING: United States. METHODS: The most billed surgical and in-office procedures in pediatric otolaryngology at our institution were identified in the Physician Fee Schedule Look-up Tool from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to extract reimbursement data for each CPT code (Current Procedural Terminology). Monetary data were adjusted for inflation to 2020 US dollars per the changes to the consumer price index. Mean annual and total percentage changes in reimbursement were calculated by the adjusted values for all included procedures (N = 25). RESULTS: From 2000 to 2020, without adjusting for inflation, reimbursement for the most billed procedures increased by 10.9%, while the allocated relative value unit per procedure increased by 15.4%. However, when adjusted for inflation, reimbursement for these procedures decreased by 27.5% over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings identify a downward trend in reimbursement for the most billed procedures in pediatric otolaryngology at our institution. Given the low predominance of pediatric otolaryngology codes within Medicare reimbursement, these codes are rarely reviewed for accurate revaluation.

Unrealistic optimism occurs when individuals falsely believe that their personal outcomes will be more favorable than others' in the same risk category. Natural selection could favor overconfidence if its benefits, such as psychological resilience, outweigh its costs. However, just because optimism biases may have offered fitness advantages in our evolutionary past does not mean that they are always optimal. The current project examined relationships among personal risk for severe COVID-19, risk perceptions, and preventative behaviors. We predicted that those with higher risk of severe COVID-19 would exhibit unrealistic optimism and behave in ways inconsistent with their elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. Clinical risk scores for severe COVID-19 were calculated and compared with COVID-19 threat appraisal, compliance with shelter-in-place orders (March 13-May 22, 2020) and travel restrictions, compliance with public health recommendations, and potential covariates like self-rated knowledge about COVID-19 in a robust dataset including 492 participants from McLennan County, TX, USA. While those with high clinical risk acknowledged their greater likelihood of experiencing severe illness if infected, they actually reported lower perceived likelihood of becoming infected in the first place. While it is possible that those with higher clinical risk scores truly are less likely to become infected, the pattern and significance of these results held after controlling for possible occupational exposure, household size, and other factors related to infection probability. Higher clinical risk also predicted more recent travel within Texas and lower distress during the pandemic (i.e., feeling less stressed, depressed, and helpless). Additional behavioral data suggested that those with higher clinical risk scores did not generally behave differently than those with lower scores during the shelter-in-place order. While unrealistic optimism may provide some short-term psychological benefits, it could be dangerous due to improper assessment of hazardous situations;inferring that optimism bias has evolutionary origins does not mean that unrealistic optimism is \\"optimal\\" in every situation.

Ideally, tests should detect a minimum viral load, be minimally invasive, and provide a rapid and simple readout. Current FDA-approved RT-qPCR-based standard diagnostic approaches require invasive nasopharyngeal swabs and involve laboratory-based analyses that can delay results. Recently, a loop mediated isothermal nucleic acid amplification (LAMP) test that utilizes colorimetric readout received FDA approval. This approach utilizes a pH indicator dye to detect drop in pH from nucleotide hydrolysis during nucleic acid amplification. This method has only been approved for use with RNA extracted from clinical specimens collected via nasopharyngeal swabs. In this study, we developed a quantitative LAMP-based strategy to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva. Our detection system distinguished positive from negative sample types using a handheld instrument that monitors optical changes throughout the LAMP reaction. We used this system in a streamlined LAMP testing protocol that could be completed in less than two hours to directly detect inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in minimally processed saliva that bypassed RNA extraction, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 50 genomes/reaction. The quantitative method correctly detected virus in 100% of contrived clinical samples spiked with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 at either 1X (50 genomes/reaction) or 2X (100 genomes/reaction) of the LOD. Importantly the quantitative method was based on dynamic optical changes during the reaction so was able to correctly classify samples that were misclassified by endpoint observation of color.","output":"Real-time optical analysis of a colorimetric LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2 in saliva with a handheld instrument improves accuracy compared to endpoint assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic led to a widely documented disruption in cancer care pathway.

MATERIALS & METHODS The ONCOCARE-COV study was a comprehensive, retrospective, descriptive, and cross-sectional study comparing the years 2019 and 2020. All key indicators along the cancer care pathway assessing the oncological activity over four periods were described. This study was set in a high-volume, public, single tertiary care center divided in two complementary sites (Reims University Hospital and Godinot Cancer Institute, Reims, France) which was located in a high COVID-19 incidence area during both peaks of the outbreak. RESULTS A total of 26,566 patient's files were active during the year 2020. Breast screening (-19.5%), announcement dedicated consultations (-9.2%), Intravenous and Hyperthermic Intraoperative Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPECs) (-25%), and oncogeriatric evaluations (-14.8%) were heavily disrupted in regard to 2020 activity. We identified a clear second outbreak wave impact on medical announcement procedures (October, -14.4%), radiotherapy sessions (October, -16%), number of new health record discussed in multidisciplinary tumor board meeting (November, -14.6%) and HIPECs (November, -100%). Moreover, 2020 cancer care activity stagnated compared to 2019. DISCUSSION The oncological care pathway was heavily disrupted during the first and second peaks of the COVID-19 outbreak. Between lockdowns, we observed a remarkable but non-compensatory recovery as well as a lesser impact from the pandemic resurgence. However, in absence of an increase in activity, a backlog persisted.

This study sought to identify ivermectin-related virus infection pathway alterations in human ovarian cancer cells. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) quantitative proteomics was used to analyze human ovarian cancer cells TOV-21G treated with and without ivermectin (20 mol/L) for 24 h, which identified 4447 ivermectin-related proteins in ovarian cancer cells. Pathway network analysis revealed four statistically significant antiviral pathways, including HCMV, HPV, EBV, and HIV1 infection pathways. Interestingly, compared with the reported 284 SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19-related genes from GencLip3, we identified 52 SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19-related protein alterations when treated with and without ivermectin.

In Canada, over 80% of COVID-19 deaths during the first pandemic wave occurred in LTCFs. We sought to evaluate the effect of mitigation measures in LTCFs including frequent testing of staff, and vaccination of staff and residents. We developed an agent-based transmission model and parameterized it with disease-specific estimates, temporal sensitivity of nasopharyngeal and saliva testing, results of vaccine efficacy trials, and data from initial COVID-19 outbreaks in LTCFs in Ontario, Canada. Characteristics of staff and residents, including contact patterns, were integrated into the model with age-dependent risk of hospitalization and death. Estimates of infection and outcomes were obtained and 95% credible intervals were generated using a bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method. Weekly routine testing of staff with 2-day turnaround time reduced infections among residents by at least 25.9% (95% CrI: 23.3%-28.3%), compared to baseline measures of mask-wearing, symptom screening, and staff cohorting alone. A similar reduction of hospitalizations and deaths was achieved in residents. Vaccination averted 2-4 times more infections in both staff and residents as compared to routine testing, and markedly reduced hospitalizations and deaths among residents by 95.9% (95% CrI: 95.4%-96.3%) and 95.8% (95% CrI: 95.5%-96.1%), respectively, over 200 days from the start of vaccination.

Although emergency medicine (EM) residents are trained in POCUS, Thai medical students receive limited training. An introductory POCUS course was implemented for medical students to prepare them for internships. OBJECTIVE: This study described the perception and use of POCUS by graduates of an introductory POCUS course. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical students who completed the POCUS course were surveyed during their intern year from 2012 to 2015. The survey collected demographic characteristics. The Likert Scale was used to assess POCUS practice patterns and perceptions of the course. RESULTS: There were 230 respondents (98% response rate). All thought that POCUS was important. Furthermore, 96% of respondents felt that the POCUS course meaningfully impacted their ability to deliver care. POCUS use was greatest for obstetrics/gynecology and trauma cases. Over half of respondents (55.2%) felt very confident with using extended-Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma. Most respondents (81.8%) were positively impacted by the course, and 61.7% were satisfied with the scope of the course. Recommendations for improvement included increasing the course length, the content, and the hands-on time for POCUS practice. CONCLUSION: Graduates positively perceived the course and felt it dramatically impacted their clinical practice as novice physicians. An introductory POCUS course should be incorporated into the medical school curriculum to prepare graduates for practice. Future goals include increasing the scope of POCUS practice to help guide interns and residents in emergency patient care such as lung ultrasound in COVID-19 or pneumonia patients and studying the impact this course has on patient outcomes.","output":"Perception of an Introductory Point-of-Care Ultrasound Course for Thai Medical Students on Emergency Medicine Rotation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an ongoing pandemic it is critical to track the virus, understand pathogenesis and epidemiology, manage the cases and suppress transmission that requires effective laboratory testing In December 2019, a cluster of patients with a novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, China Initially tentatively named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the virus has now been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) This virus can cause the disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","output":"Laboratory testing COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper explores the utility of real exchange rate misalignments from their equilibrium for identification of currency crises in the former Soviet Union countries.

We hypothesised that people with asthma are likely to be more vulnerable to worse mental health during lockdown. Methods We examined COVID-19 surveys (completed April/May 2020), nested within two generations of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC): index-generation ALSPAC-G1 (n= 2942, mean age=28) and the parents generation ALSPAC-G0 (n=3737, mean age=59). We used Poisson and logistic regression models to estimate the effect of asthma on wellbeing, anxiety and depression, and factors related to COVID-19 and lockdown. Models were adjusted for validated pre-pandemic measures of mental health and socio-economic factors. Results Asthma was associated with a 13% increase in depression score in ALSPAC-G1 (p=0.005) and 15% increase in ALSPAC-G0 (p=0.05) compared to participants without asthma, anxiety scores increased by 14% in ALSPAC-G1 (p=0.005) and by 16% in ALSPAC-G0 (p=0.02). Asthma was associated with a similar increase of anxiety and depression scores during COVID-19 in both generations (Z test p values >0.80). Discussion People with asthma have worse mental health & wellbeing during lockdown compared to people without asthma. Although the effect of asthma on mental health is of similar magnitude between the generations, younger participants with asthma declined to lower levels of mental health despite reporting less symptoms, COVID-19 infection and self-isolation. This has important implications given repeated lockdowns. Young people with asthma should be closely monitored and supported to mitigate the impact of lockdown on their mental health.","output":"The impact of asthma on mental health & wellbeing during COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"P57 Table 1Differences between CPAP responders and CPAP non responders in Covid Pneumonia patientsVariable CPAP responder (n=23) CPAP non responder (n=20) p value Mean Age (years)52 9 (12 8) 52 7 (9 1)p=0 95Gender (%)42% male70% female57% male30% femalep=0 07Comorbidites-HypertensionIschaemic heart diseaseDiabetesCOPD5/23 (22%)0/233/23 (13%)2/23 (9%)7/20 (35%)0/205/20 (25%)0/20p=0 5p=1p=0 43p=0 4Body mass index (BMI)29 5 (28C37)31 5 (29C39)p=0 4FiO2 pre CPAP0 32 (0 32C0 6)0 4 (0 32C0 5)P=0 6Median Initial PEEP (cmH2O)Median Maximum PEEP (cmH2O)5 (5C10)10 (8C10)5 (5C10)10 (10C10)p=0 9p=0 7Median days on CPAP5 (3C7)1 (0C2)p0 001*Hospital length of stay (days)10 (8C11)18 (14C39)p0 0001*Hospital discharge100%100%60-day survival100%100%ConclusionsOver half of patients trialled on CPAP tolerated it well and avoided ICU admission with a shorter hospital stay These were younger patients with relatively few comorbidities Those who failed CPAP were mostly male and did so within the first 24 hours The non-responders to CPAP all survived to hospital discharge Early CPAP use in this group has had no adverse outcomes to date More work is needed to look at the use of early CPAP in older patients with more medical co-morbidities in respiratory failure due to Covid pneumonia ReferenceRECOVERY-RS Respiratory support : respiratory strategies in COVID-19;CPAP, High-flow, and standard care Available: http://www isrctn com/ISRCTN16912075","output":"P57 Early use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with respiratory failure due to Covid 19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported an increase in the incidence of pneumonia from an unknown cause Shortly after, SARS-CoV-19 was identified as the responsible coronavirus for the heavy progress of the disease, which can manifest itself distinctively in different individuals Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered a pandemic because of its high contagiousness before COVID-19 associated symptoms actually appear In response to the rapid and continuous spread of the virus around the globe governments have mobilized their forces to restrict contact and thus avoid further infection and invested significant resources in treatment and prevention strategies to tackle COVID-19 As a result, US FDA and EMA have granted emergency use authorization for two mRNA-based vaccines, namely the vaccines developed by BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna, for use in the USA and Europe Due to the existing critical situation, the stages of vaccine development and testing have probably never been gone through so fast as at present Here, we are briefly commenting on these two vaccines with their benefits, advantages and limitations","output":"First COVID-19 Vaccines Receiving the US FDA and EMA Emergency Use Authorization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"P62 Table 1The impact of timing of tracheostomy on Intensive Care Unit Length of Stay Mean(SD) ICU LoS (days) P value Early tracheostomy (&lt;10 days) n=10 31(14) p=0 005 Late tracheostomy (10 days &lt;27 days) n=82 38(15) Delayed tracheostomy (27 days) n=32 46(17) ConclusionThe low mortality rate suggests appropriate patient selection for tracheostomy, but also makes analysis of potential influences on mortality difficult to ascertain Our data suggests timing of tracheostomy could impact on ICU LoS This data could inform practice surrounding tracheostomy insertion during future global pandemics","output":"P62 A multi-centre observational study of tracheostomy outcomes during the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diverse risk factors intercede the outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

However, the progress has been considerably slow and at times disappointing. The unprecedented coronavirus disease created a worldwide panic and exposed all our weaknesses and unpreparedness. It also demonstrated a global demand for better public health infrastructure and preparedness to combat future pandemics. This unprecedented public health crisis acted as a great stimulus for putting together a concerted effort to develop vaccines. According to the experts, the time was right and within 48 hours after the information on the SARS-CoV-2 genome was posted, Moderna scientists had on paper a workable mRNA, which would code for the spike protein. The immune engineers at Moderna as well as BioNTech were able to put together a lipid nanoparticle delivery system for safe delivery of this precious cargo to the appropriate cells.

Indications and contraindications for renal denervation have been defined in an interdisciplinary manner. The efficacy and safety of the procedure were evaluated. RESULTS Currently, indication for renal denervation is limited to patients with primary hypertension and a systolic blood pressure of  160 mm Hg (or  150 mm Hg in diabetes type 2) despite optimal medical therapy with  3 different antihypertensive drugs. In this specific patient population, an average blood pressure reduction of 32/14 mmHg was observed in non-randomized/-controlled trials after renal denervation. These results were not confirmed in the first randomized controlled trial with a non-significantly superior blood pressure reduction of 14.1  23.9 mm Hg compared to controls (-11.74  25.94 mm Hg, difference -2.39 mm Hg p = 0.26 for superiority with a margin of 5 mm Hg) who underwent a sham procedure. CONCLUSION The efficacy and long-term effects of renal denervation need to be re-evaluated in light of the HTN3 study results. To date, renal denervation should not be performed outside of clinical trials. Future trials should also assess if renal denervation can be performed with sufficient safety and efficacy in patients with hypertension-associated diseases. The use of renal denervation as an alternative therapy (e. g. in patients with drug intolerance) can currently not be advocated. KEY POINTS The indication for renal denervation should be assessed in an interdisciplinary fashion and according to current guidelines with a special focus on ruling out secondary causes for arterial hypertension. 5 - 10 % of patients with hypertension suffer from refractory hypertension, but only about 1 % of patients meet the criteria for a renal denervation. Renal denervation leads to a significant decrease in office blood pressure; however, the impact on 24-hour blood pressure measurements remains unclear. In the first randomized controlled trial on renal denervation with a control group undergoing a sham procedure, blood pressure reduction failed to reach the anticipated level of superiority over best medical treatment. Periprocedural complications are rare, but long-term safety can currently not be appraised due to the limited data available.","output":"Renal denervation: unde venis et quo vadis?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The woven bone created during the healing of bone regeneration processes is characterized as being extremely inhomogeneous and having a variable stiffness that increases with time. Therefore, it is important to study how the mechanical properties of woven bone are dependent on its microarchitecture and especially on its porosity and mineral content. The porosity and the x-ray greyscale of specimens taken from bone transport studies in sheep were assessed by means of ex vivo imaging. Our study demonstrates that the porosity of the woven bone in the distraction area diminishes during the healing process from 73.3% 35 days after surgery to 31.9% 525 days after surgery. In addition, the woven bone's porosity is negatively correlated with its Young's modulus. The x-ray greyscale, was measured as an indicator of the level of mineralization of the woven bone. Greyscale index has been demonstrated to be inversely proportional to porosity and to increase to up to 60-80% of the level in cortical bone. The results of this study may contribute to the development of micromechanical models of woven bone and improvements in in silico modelling.","output":"Elastic Modulus of Woven Bone: Correlation with Evolution of Porosity and X-ray Greyscale."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cohort selection The aim was to evaluate interventions to minimise microbial contamination from aerosol generating procedures in the dental office. Seven electronic databases were searched using key words such as 'aerosols', 'droplets', 'spatter', 'microbial loads' etc to identify relevant randomised controlled trials and prospective non-randomised clinical trials until 6 April 2020. Data sources PubMed; Scopus; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; Open Grey; ClinicalTrials.gov; National Research Register; and hand searches. Data analysis Eligible studies were analysed for effectiveness of various interventions on the microbial counts in the aerosols generated in the dental office using predefined criteria. Data were analysed for assessment of quality of evidence and confidence in the estimated effect, risk of bias and other analyses using Stata 15.1 software. PRISMA guidelines extension for network meta-analysis were followed for reporting. Results Initial search identified 266 studies, of which 35 were evaluated for full text. Finally, 29 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria for qualitative synthesis. The majority of the included studies were published in the last decade, and 21 out of the 29 studies were randomised controlled trials. However, based on comparable procedural settings (study design, study populations, interventions and outcome measures), only 11 were eligible for contribution to the network meta-analysis. The setting of all interventions was ultrasonic scaling of adult patients in a clinical dental practice environment, and involved 16 direct and 29 indirect comparisons. A multivariate meta-analysis showed pre-procedural mouth rinse with tempered chlorhexidine 0.2% at 47C was most effective in reducing post-procedural bacterial load compared to the control. A mean difference of -0.92 (95% CI -15.4 to -0.29) in log10 colony-forming units was observed in air samples within 90 cm of the dental unit. Conclusions Notwithstanding the limitations of this network meta-analysis, pre-procedural mouth rinse with tempered chlorhexidine appears to be most effective in reducing bacterial counts in aerosols generated during dental operative procedures. Further randomised controlled clinical trials based on robust designs are required to establish the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents in reducing aerosol-related microbial loads (bacteria and viruses) in clinical environments.","output":"Evidence-based strategies to reduce contamination from aerosolised microbes in dental practice environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blood groups are inherited traits that vary across populations, likely due to both founder effects and natural selection.

The critical focus in our case study is to evaluate the outcomes of tracheostomy on intubated COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A multicentric prospective observational study of 1890 COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy across 120 hospitals was conducted over 7 weeks in Spain (March 28 to May 15, 2020). Data were collected with an innovative approach: instant messaging via WhatsApp. Outcome measurements: complications, achieved weaning and decannulation and survival. RESULTS: We performed 1,461 surgical (81.3%) and 429 percutaneous tracheostomies. Median timing of tracheostomy was 12 days (4C42 days) since orotracheal intubation. A close follow-up of 1616/1890 (85.5%) patients at the cut-off time of 1-month follow-up showed that in 842 (52.1%) patients, weaning was achieved, while 391 (24.2%) were still under mechanical ventilation and 383 (23.7%) patients had died from COVID-19. Decannulation among those in whom weaning was successful (n = 842) was achieved in 683 (81%) patients. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy. The critical focus is the unprecedented amount of tracheostomies: 1890 in 7 weeks.

Here we report the regeneration of severely damaged lungs repaired to meet transplantation criteria by utilizing an interventional cross-circulation platform in a clinically relevant swine model of gastric aspiration injury. Enabled by cross-circulation with a living swine, prolonged extracorporeal support of damaged lungs results in significant improvements in lung function, cellular regeneration, and the development of diagnostic tools for non-invasive organ evaluation and repair.

Respiratory samples (n=74) were collected for viral culture, serum samples for measurement of IgM/IgG levels (n=30), and plasma samples for levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (n=81). Disease severity was correlated with results from viral culture, serologic testing, and immune markers. RESULTS: 57 (57%) patients developed viral pneumonia, of whom 20 (20%) required supplemental oxygen including 12 (12%) invasive mechanical ventilation. Viral culture from respiratory samples was positive for 19 of 74 patients (26%). No virus was isolated when the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value was >30 or >14 days after symptom onset. Seroconversion occurred at a median of 12.5 days (IQR 9-18) for IgM and 15.0 days (IQR 12-20) for IgG; 54/62 patients (87.1%) sampled at day 14 or later seroconverted.

Ivermectin, an avermectin derivative, is used as a treatment for parasitic infections in humans and domesticated animals.Discussion: Ivermectin's mechanism of action involves binding to ligand-gated ion channel receptors including glutamate, GABA, and glycine, resulting in parasitic paralysis and death. Due to varying expression of these ion channel receptors in vertebrate species, ivermectin toxicity is rarely reported in mammals. Ivermectin is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein, which limits its neurological toxicity in humans. Genetic polymorphisms in P-glycoprotein or coadministration of P-glycoprotein inhibitors may increase the neurotoxicity of ivermectin. Other toxic effects of ivermectin after therapeutic oral use include edema, rash, headache, and ocular complaints. Most of these effects are mild and short in duration. Ivermectin exhibits antiviral effects in-vitro at very high concentrations. This has led to suggestions of ivermectin as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection, although the drug's pharmacokinetic parameters reduce the likelihood that high concentrations of the drug can be achieved in-vivo.Conclusion: Due to concern for adverse events, specifically neurotoxicity, as well as a paucity of supporting evidence, the use of ivermectin as a routine treatment or preventive measure for COVID-19 infection is not recommended at this time.","output":"Ivermectin: a mini-review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network was tasked with the strategic goal of seeking solutions, jointly with manufacturers, for enabling the stable, sustainable supply of quality vaccines to developing countries to increase global immunization. As vaccines are given to millions of healthy people, including children, to prevent life-threatening diseases, vaccines must meet high safety standards. Vaccine safety monitoring is of paramount importance to maintain trust in vaccination programs globally. Once a vaccine is licensed and recommended for use, its safety and effectiveness must be monitored during its whole lifecycle, as the safety profile and protective effectiveness may change over time. A well-established safety governance model across the organization with underlying processes for data collection, signal and risk management and communication is essential. A fit for purpose pharmacovigilance system may vary as it depends on several factors. However, all vaccine manufacturers strive to achieve a pharmacovigilance system satisfying Good Pharmacovigilance Practices, in compliance with national, international and supranational requirements, as applicable.

METHODS: Female patients with a clinical diagnosis of typical RTT (n = 66), MECP2 gene mutation, and apneas were enrolled (mean age: 12.5 years). Baseline clinical severity, arterial blood gas analysis, and red blood cell count were assessed. Breathing was monitored during the wakefulness and sleep states (average recording time: 13  0.5 h) with a portable polygraphic screening device. According to prevalence of breath holdings, the population was categorized into the wakefulness apnea (WA) and sleep apnea (SA) groups, and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was calculated. The impact of respiratory events on oxidative stress was assessed by plasma and intra-erythrocyte non-protein-bound iron (P-NPBI and IE-NPBI, respectively), and plasma F(2)-isoprostane (F(2)-IsoP) assays. RESULTS: Significant prevalence of obstructive apneas with values of AHI > 15 was present in 69.7% of the population with RTT. The group with SA showed significantly increased AHI values > 15 (p = 0.0032), total breath holding episodes (p = 0.007), and average SpO(2) (p = 0.0001) as well as lower nadir SpO(2) (p = 0.0004) compared with the patients with WAs. The subgroups of patients with WA and SA showed no significant differences in arterial blood gas analysis variables (p > 0.089). Decreased mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) (p = 0.038) was observed in the group with WAs. P-NPBI levels were significantly higher in the group with WA than in that with SAs (p = 0.0001). Stepwise multiple linear regression models showed WA being related to nadir SpO(2), average SpO(2), and P-NPBI (adjusted R(2) = 0.613, multiple correlation coefficient = 0.795 p < 0.0001), and P-NPBI being related to average SpO(2), blood PaCO(2), red blood cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV), age, and topiramate treatment (adjusted R(2) = 0.551, multiple correlation coefficient = 0.765, p < 0.0001).

In this study, the coding sequence of the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) main protease, 3CL(pro), was determined. Comparative sequence analyses revealed that FIPV 3CL(pro) and other coronavirus main proteases are related most closely to the 3C-like proteases of potyviruses. The predicted active centre of the coronavirus enzymes has accepted unique replacements that were probed by extensive mutational analysis. The wild-type FIPV 3CL(pro) domain and 25 mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and tested for proteolytic activity in a peptide-based assay. The data strongly suggest that, first, the FIPV 3CL(pro) catalytic system employs His(41) and Cys(144) as the principal catalytic residues. Second, the amino acids Tyr(160) and His(162), which are part of the conserved sequence signature Tyr(160)-Met(161)-His(162) and are believed to be involved in substrate recognition, were found to be indispensable for proteolytic activity. Third, replacements of Gly(83) and Asn(64), which were candidates to occupy the position spatially equivalent to that of the catalytic Asp residue of chymotrypsin-like proteases, resulted in proteolytically active proteins. Surprisingly, some of the Asn(64) mutants even exhibited strongly increased activities. Similar results were obtained for human coronavirus (HCoV) 3CL(pro) mutants in which the equivalent Asn residue (HCoV 3CL(pro) Asn(64)) was substituted. These data lead us to conclude that both the catalytic systems and substrate-binding pockets of coronavirus main proteases differ from those of other RNA virus 3C and 3C-like proteases.","output":"Mutational analysis of the active centre of coronavirus 3C-like proteases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Post stroke management has moved into the focus as it represents the only way to secure acute treatment effects in the long term. Due to individual courses, post stroke management appears rather challenging and is hindered by existing barriers between treatment sectors. As a novel concept, the PostStroke-Manager combines digital and sensor-based technology with personal assistance to enable intersectoral cooperation, best possible reduction of stroke-related disability, optimal secondary prevention, and detection of physical and psychological comorbidities. METHODS: This prospective single-center observational study aims to investigate the feasibility of the PostStroke-Manager concept in an outpatient setting. Ninety patients who have suffered an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or transient ischemic attack will be equipped with a tablet and mobile devices recording physical activity, blood pressure, and electrocardiographic signals. Through a server-based platform, patients will be connected with the primary care physician, a stroke pilot and, if necessary, other specialists who will use web-based platforms. Via the tablet, patients will have access to an application with 10 newly designed components including, for instance, a communication tool, medication schedule, medical records platform, and psychometric screenings (e.g., depression, anxiety symptoms, quality of life, adherence, cognitive impairment). During the 1-year follow-up period, clinical visits are scheduled at three-month intervals. In the interim, communication will be secured by an appropriate tool that includes text messenger, audio, and video telephony. As the primary endpoint, feasibility will be measured by a 14-item questionnaire that addresses digital components, technical support, and personal assistance. The PostStroke-Manager will be judged feasible if at least 50% of these aspects are rated positively by at least 75% of patients. Secondary endpoints include feedback from professionals and longitudinal analyses on clinical and psychometric parameters. PERSPECTIVE: This study will answer the question of whether combined digital and personal support is a feasible approach to post stroke management. Furthermore, the patient perspective gained regarding digital support may help to specify future applications. This study will also provide information regarding the potential use of remote therapies and mobile devices in situations with limited face-to-face contacts.

Significant numbers of health professionals are now required to provide end-of-life care with minimal training. Many health professionals report they lack confidence to provide this care, particularly those in acute hospital settings. This study explored the perceived benefits of online education on health professionals capacity to provide end-of-life care. METHODS: This qualitative study adopted a pragmatic approach. Thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted with allied health professionals, nurses and doctors who had completed a minimum of three End-of-Life Essentials online education modules. Interviews were held on line and face-to-face, audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Demographic data were also collected. Three major themes and one minor theme were constructed from the data using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Themes were (1). Perceptions of preparedness to provide end-of-life care, (2). Shifts in approaching end-of-life discussions and (3). Motivation for engagement with online modules. Participants reported validation of knowledge and improved confidence to have end-of-life discussions with patients, carers and team members. They also noted improved ability to recognise the dying process and improved conversations with team members about patient and carer needs. Videos portraying a novice and then more able end-of-life discussions were particularly valued by participants. Modules provided practical guidance on how to engage in discussions about the end of life and care needs. Participants were self-motivated to improve their knowledge and skills to enhance end-of-life care provision. Continuing professional development requirements were also a motivator for module completion. CONCLUSIONS: This study explored health professionals perspectives about the perceived benefits of online education modules on their clinical practice. Module completion enhanced participant confidence and self-reported improved competence in end-of-life care provision. Findings build on existing research that supports the valuable role online education plays in supporting confidence and ability to actively engage with patients, carers and colleagues about provision of end-of-life care; however, self-report cannot be used as a proxy for improved clinical competence.","output":"Its given me confidence: a pragmatic qualitative evaluation exploring the perceived benefits of online end\\\\of\\\\life education on clinical care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has become a serious hazard worldwide in a relatively short time. Scientific evidence supports that cancer patients infected with COVID-19 had a higher risk of developing severe complications. COVID-19 patients can be asymptomatic during part or all of their disease course, therefore it is a compelling need to develop universal pre-interventional COVID-19 screening guidelines. The aim of this study is to is review COVID-19 positive rate among asymptomatic cancer patients since the implementation of universal policy at our institution, and assess the impact of diagnosing COVID-19 on delay of oncologic interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population comprised of all cancer patients planned for high risk interventions between April 1, 2020 - May 14, 2020 at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi [CCAD] after implementing universal COVID-19 screening policy. DISCUSSION: Nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 among cancer patients could result in poor outcomes. Universal screening for high-risk populations may facilitate earlier diagnosis of COVID-19 and implementation of control strategies. Our review demonstrated that [7.5%] of asymptomatic cancer patients tested positive for COVID-19 after implementation of universal prospective screening policy. The overall evidence supporting universal COVID-19 screening of cancer patients is limited, yet as tests become more widely available, it may be reasonable to screen all cancer patients for COVID-19 before anticancer therapies. While such policy may delay and affect the timing of anticancer therapy as shown in this report, it should improve the safety of care for oncology patients and help protect healthcare workers. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection rate is higher in cancer patients than general population and can present without symptoms.

Remarkably, as long as the individuals with different capability of acquiring the disease interact with unequal frequency, there always exist a cross point for the fraction of vaccinated, below which the diversity of infection rate hinders the epidemic spreading and above which expedites it.

The ESM strategy suggests that random filters and neurons of the error-feedback fully connected layer are incrementally added to steadily compensate the prediction error during the construction process, and then a filter selection strategy is introduced to enable ESM-CNN to extract the different size of temporal features, providing helpful information at each iterative process for the prediction. The performance of ESM-CNN is justified on its prediction accuracy of one-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead forecasting tasks respectively. Comprehensive experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed ESM-CNN not only outperforms the state-of-art random neural networks, but also exhibits stronger predictive power and less computing overhead in comparison to trained state-of-art deep neural network models.","output":"Error-feedback stochastic modeling strategy for time series forecasting with convolutional neural networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract One of the routine health services that is being disrupted by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Africa is childhood immunization. This is because the immunization system relies on functioning health facilities and stable communities to be effective. Its disruption increases the risk of epidemics of vaccine-preventable diseases which can increase child mortality. Therefore, policymakers must quickly identify robust and context-specific strategies to rapidly scale-up routine immunization in order to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on their national immunization performance. To achieve this, we propose a paradigm shift towards systems thinking and use of implementation science in immunization decision making. Systems thinking can inform a more nuanced and holistic understanding of the interrelationship that between COVID-19, its control strategies and childhood immunization. Tools like causal loop diagrams can be used to explicitly illustrate the systems structure by identifying the feedback loops. Once mapped and leverage points for interventions have been identified, implementation science can be used to guide the rapid uptake and utilization of multifaceted evidence-based innovations in complex practice settings. As Africa re-strategize for the post-2020 era, these emerging fields can contribute significantly in accelerating progress towards universal access to vaccines for all children on the continent despite COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 and routine childhood immunization in Africa: leveraging systems thinking and implementation science to improve immunization system performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created strong pressure on national health critical care systems.

This perspective looks at the impact of COVID-19 in South America and argues that the health critical care systems of these countries are particularly vulnerable due to the underestimation of the number of cases currently confirmed and the strong need for treatment of these patients in intensive care units (ICUs). In particular, Bolivia will need to increase the number of ICU beds 60-fold while Brazil will need to grow 12-fold to meet the growth rates of COVID-19 by the end of July 2020. In this sense, it is argued that national and transnational measures should be taken urgently to face this challenge.

IGD is an area of concern in the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which can be objectively assessed by dysfunctional behaviour and the increasing time of being online, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Electroencephalography (EEG) identifies amplitude changes in the evoked response potential (ERP) among IGDs, correlated with underlying comorbidities. Materials and Methods: A scoping review was performed to elaborate on the research regarding resting-state EEG and task-based EEG, particularly for Go/No-go paradigms pertaining to subjects with IAD or specifically IGD. The role of EEG was identified in its diagnostic capability to identify the salient changes that occurred in the response to reward network and the executive control network, using resting-state and task-based EEG. The implication of using EEG in monitoring the therapy for IAD and IGD was also reviewed. Results: EEG generally revealed reduced beta waves and increased theta waves in addicts. IGD with depression demonstrated increased theta and decreased alpha waves. Whereas increased P300, a late cognitive ERP component, was frequently associated with impaired excessive allocation of attentional resources of the IAD towards addiction-specific cues. IGD had increased whole brain delta waves at baseline, which showed significant reduction post therapy.

In part two, with the objective to evaluate test sensitivity stratified by Ct (cycle threshold)-value and time since symptom onset, adults who had a positive qRT-PCR obtained at a MHS test center were eligible. FINDINGS: In part one (n = 352) SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was 4.8%, overall specificity 100% (95%CI: 989%-100%) and sensitivity 941% (95%CI: 711%-100%).

Scenarios varied by the duration of the disruption (6 or 24 months), steps in the screening process being disrupted (primary screening, surveillance, colposcopy, excisional treatment), and primary screening modality (cytology alone or cytology plus human papillomavirus \\"cotesting\\"). RESULTS: The models consistently showed that COVID-19-related disruptions yield small net increases in cervical cancer cases by 2027, which are greater for women previously screened with cytology compared with cotesting. When disruptions affected all four steps in the screening process under cytology-based screening, there were an additional 5-7 and 38-45 cases per one million screened for 6- and 24-month disruptions, respectively. In contrast, under cotesting, there were additional 4-5 and 35-45 cases per one million screened for 6- and 24-month disruptions, respectively. The majority (58-79%) of the projected increases in cases under cotesting were due to disruptions to surveillance, colposcopies, or excisional treatment, rather than to primary screening.

Hence, we examined neural activity in the NCL of pigeons and explored the local field potentials' (LFPs) spectral and functional connectivity patterns in a goal-directed spatial cognitive task with the detour paradigm. We found the pigeons progressively learned to solve the path adjustment task when the learned path was blocked suddenly. Importantly, the behavioral changes during the adjustment were accompanied by the modifications in neural patterns in the NCL. Specifically, the spectral power in lower bands (1-4 Hz and 5-12 Hz) decreased as the pigeons were tested during the adjustment. Meanwhile, an elevated gamma (31-45 Hz and 55-80 Hz) connectivity in the NCL was also detected. These results and the partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) modeling analysis provide insights into the neural activities in the avian NCL during the spatial path adjustment, contributing to understanding the potential mechanism of avian spatial encoding.

Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine factors contributing to longitudinal changes in depression and anxiety. We found that depression and anxiety levels were high in early April, but declined over time. Being female, younger age, lower-income, and previous psychiatric diagnosis correlated with higher overall levels of anxiety and depression; being married additionally correlated with lower overall levels of depression, but not anxiety. Importantly, worsening of COVID-related economic impact and increase in projected pandemic duration exacerbated both depression and anxiety over time. Finally, increasing levels of informedness correlated with decreasing levels of depression, while increased COVID-19 severity (i.e., 7-day change in cases) and social media use were positively associated with anxiety over time.

The various primary operations with their distinctive complications make this group of patients quite heterogeneous, and treatment has to be individualized. There are concerns regarding the safety profile and efficacy of these procedures. The objective of the present study was to analyze the indications, safety, and efficacy of RBS at a high-volume Asian center and provide insight into the different treatment options. METHODS Of a total of 1578 bariatric surgeries from July 2006 to June 2012, 52 patients underwent revisional bariatric procedures. The primary operations included 6 different procedures. The indications for surgery were grouped into weight loss failure (n = 21) or complications related to the primary operation (n = 31). The revisional operations performed were conversion to another procedure (n = 22), revision of existing anatomy (n = 29), or reversal to normal anatomy (n = 1). RESULTS 96% of revisional surgeries were performed laparoscopically. The median operating time was 72 minutes (25-240 min), and the median duration of hospital stay was 4 days (3-25 d). The mean body mass index for weight loss failure decreased significantly from 36.3 to 29.6 kg/m(2) after 1 year of revisional surgery (P<.01). However, revision of RYGB was only associated with a body mass index loss of 3.2 kg/m(2) and percentage of excess weight loss of 31.8%. More than 90% of the patients with complications had complete resolution of their preoperative symptoms. There were 3 major complications with an overall morbidity rate of 5.8%.

Aquaculture plays a vital and rapidly expanding role in food security, in some cases overtaking wild caught fisheries in the production of high-quality animal protein in this PFSC. We performed a rapid global assessment to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related emerging control measures on the aquaculture supply chain. Socio-economic effects of the pandemic were analysed by surveying the perceptions of stakeholders, who were asked to describe potential supply-side disruption, vulnerabilities and resilience patterns along the production pipeline with four main supply chain components: a) hatchery, b) production/processing, c) distribution/logistics and d) market. We also assessed different farming strategies, comparing land- vs. sea-based systems; extensive vs. intensive methods; and with and without integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, IMTA. In addition to evaluating levels and sources of economic distress, interviewees were asked to identify mitigation solutions adopted at local / internal (i.e., farm-site) scales, and to express their preference on national / external scale mitigation measures among a set of a priori options. Survey responses identified the potential causes of disruption, ripple effects, sources of food insecurity, and socio-economic conflicts. They also pointed to various levels of mitigation strategies. The collated evidence represents a first baseline useful to address future disaster-driven responses, to reinforce the resilience of the sector and to facilitate the design reconstruction plans and mitigation measures, such as financial aid strategies.","output":"The aquaculture supply chain in the time of covid-19 pandemic: Vulnerability, resilience, solutions and priorities at the global scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: This study aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a pragmatic, multicentre randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of an informal caregiver training programme to support the recovery of people following hip fracture surgery. METHODS: This will be a mixed-methods feasibility RCT, recruiting 60 patients following hip fracture surgery and their informal caregivers. Patients will be randomized to usual NHS care, versus usual NHS care plus a caregiver-patient dyad training programme (HIP HELPER). This programme will comprise of three, one-hour, one-to-one training sessions for the patient and caregiver, delivered by a nurse, physiotherapist, or occupational therapist. Training will be delivered in the hospital setting pre-patient discharge. It will include practical skills for rehabilitation such as: transfers and walking; recovery goal setting and expectations; pacing and stress management techniques; and introduction to the HIP HELPER Caregiver Workbook, which provides information on recovery, exercises, worksheets, and goal-setting plans to facilitate a good recovery. After discharge, patients and caregivers will be supported in delivering rehabilitation through three telephone coaching sessions. Data, collected at baseline and four months post-randomization, will include: screening logs, intervention logs, fidelity checklists, quality assurance monitoring visit data, and clinical outcomes assessing quality of life, physical, emotional, adverse events, and resource use outcomes. The acceptability of the study intervention and RCT design will be explored through qualitative methods with 20 participants (patients and informal caregivers) and 12 health professionals. DISCUSSION: A multicentre recruitment approach will provide greater external validity across population characteristics in England. The mixed-methods approach will permit in-depth examination of the intervention and trial design parameters. The findings will inform whether and how a definitive trial may be undertaken to test the effectiveness of this caregiver intervention for patients after hip fracture surgery.

We examined whether sera from individuals who received two or three doses of inactivated vaccine, could neutralize authentic Omicron. The seroconversion rates of neutralizing antibodies were 3.3% (2/60) and 95% (57/60) for 2- and 3-dose vaccinees, respectively. For three-dose recipients, the geometric mean neutralization antibody titer (GMT) of Omicron was 15, 16.5-fold lower than that of the ancestral virus (254). We isolated 323 human monoclonal antibodies derived from memory B cells in 3-dose vaccinees, half of which recognize the receptor binding domain (RBD) and show that a subset of them (24/163) neutralize all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), including Omicron, potently. Therapeutic treatments with representative broadly neutralizing mAbs individually or antibody cocktails were highly protective against SARS-CoV-2 Beta infection in mice. Atomic structures of the Omicron S in complex with three types of all five VOC-reactive antibodies defined the binding and neutralizing determinants and revealed a key antibody escape site, G446S, that confers greater resistance to one major class of antibodies bound at the right shoulder of RBD through altering local conformation at the binding interface.

As a possible vaccine candidate, we employed the rotavirus VP6-protein platform to construct a fusion protein (FP) displaying receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) at the N-terminus of VP6. The recombinant baculovirus-insect cell produced VP6-RBD FP was proven antigenic in vitro and bound to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. The FP was used to immunize BALB/c mice, and humoral- and T cell-mediated immune responses were investigated. SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific T cells were induced at a high quantity; however, no RBD or S-specific antibodies were detected. The results suggest that conformational B cell epitopes might be buried inside the VP6, while RBD-specific T cell epitopes are available for T cell recognition after the processing and presentation of FP by the antigen-presenting cells.

We reanalysed a previously published dataset, examining the relative effects of species' traits on patterns of viral diversity in bats and rodents. We expanded on prior work by using more highly resolved phylogenies for bats and rodents and incorporating a phylogenetically controlled principal components analysis. For rodents, sympatry and torpor use were important predictors of viral richness and, as previously reported, phylogeny had minimal impact in models. For bats, in contrast to prior work, we find that phylogeny does have an effect in models. Patterns of viral diversity in bats were related to geographical distribution (i.e. latitude and range size) and life history (i.e. lifespan, body size and birthing frequency). However, the effects of these predictors were marginal relative to citation count, emphasizing that the ability to accurately assess reservoir status largely depends on sampling effort and highlighting the need for additional data in future comparative studies.","output":"Phylogeny matters: revisiting a comparison of bats and rodents as reservoirs of zoonotic viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Evaluate pre-vaccine pandemic period COVID-19 death risk factors among nursing home (NH) residents.

RESULTS Among 608,251 elderly NH residents, 57,398 (9.4%) died of COVID-related illness April 1 to December 22, 2020. About 46.9% (26,893) of these COVID-19 deaths occurred without prior COVID-19 hospitalizations. We observed a consistently increasing age trend for COVID-19 deaths. Racial/ethnic minorities generally shared a similarly high risk of NH COVID-19 deaths with Whites. NH facility characteristics including for-profit ownership and low health inspection ratings were associated with higher death risk. Resident characteristics, including male (HR 1.69), end-stage renal disease (HR 1.42), cognitive impairment (HR 1.34), and immunocompromised status (HR 1.20) were important death risk factors. Other individual-level characteristics were less predictive of death than they were in community-dwelling population.

Unfractionated heparin, a glycosaminoglycan that must bind to antithrombin as a cofactor, is currently the standard anticoagulant adopted during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Antithrombin, beyond being a potent natural anticoagulant, acts in the cross-talk between coagulation and inflammatory system through anticoagulation and coagulation-independent effects. OBJECTIVES: In this review, we describe, in the adult setting of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, the pathophysiological rationale for antithrombin use, the current practice of administration, and the effects of antithrombin on anticoagulation, bleeding, and outcomes. DATA SOURCES: Studies on adults (18 years or older) on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation published from 1995 to 2018 in order to evaluate the use of antithrombin. RESULTS: In adults on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, antithrombin supplementation has a highly pathophysiological rationale since coagulation factor consumption, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and endothelial activation are triggered by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Eleven articles are focused on the topic but among the authors there is no consensus on the threshold for supplementation (ranging from 70% to 80%) as well as on the dose (rarely standardized) and time of administration (bolus vs continuous infusion). Consistently, antithrombin is considered able to achieve better anticoagulation targets in or not in the presence of heparin resistance. The impact of antithrombin administration on bleeding still shows contrasting results. CONCLUSION: Antithrombin use in veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be investigated on the threshold for supplementation, dose, and time of administration.","output":"A narrative review of antithrombin use during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in adults: rationale, current use, effects on anticoagulation, and outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant B.1.1.7 became prevalent in the United States (US).

Methods: We extended a published compartmental model and calibrated the model to the latest US COVID-19 data. We estimated the vaccine effectiveness against B.1.1.7 and evaluated the impact of a potential reduction in vaccine effectiveness on future epidemics. We projected the epidemic trends under different levels of social restoration. Results: We estimated the overall existing vaccine effectiveness against B.1.1.7 to be 88.5% (95%CI: 87.4-89.5%) and vaccination coverage would reach 70% by the end of August, 2021. With this vaccine effectiveness and coverage, we anticipated 498,972 (109,998-885,947) cumulative infections and 15,443 (3,828-27,057) deaths nationwide over the next 12 months, of which 95.0% infections and 93.3% deaths were caused by B.1.1.7.

However, if the vaccine effectiveness were reduced to 75%, 50% or 25% due to new SARS-CoV-2 variants, we predicted 667,075 (130,682-1,203,468), 1.7m (0.2-3.2m), 19.0m (5.3-32.7m) new infections and 19,249 (4,281-34,217), 42,265 (5,081-79,448), 426,860 (117,229-736,490) cumulative deaths to occur over the next 12 months. Further, social restoration at a lower vaccination coverage would lead to even greater future outbreaks. Conclusion: Current COVID-19 vaccines remain effective against the B.1.1.7 variant, and 70% vaccination coverage would be sufficient to restore social activities to a pre-pandemic level.

Methods: Using linked data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD and the Office for National Statistics, we identified migrants using country-of-birth, visa-status or other codes indicating international migration. We ran a controlled interrupted time series (ITS) using negative binomial regression to compare rates before and during the pandemic. Findings: In 262,644 individuals, pre-pandemic consultation rates per person-year were 4.35 (4.34-4.36) for migrants and 4.6 (4.59-4.6) for non-migrants (RR:0.94 [0.92-0.96]). Between 29 March and 26 December 2020, rates reduced to 3.54 (3.52-3.57) for migrants and 4.2 (4.17-4.23) for non-migrants (RR:0.84 [0.8-0.88]). Overall, this represents an 11% widening of the pre-pandemic difference in consultation rates between migrants and non-migrants during the first year of the pandemic (RR:0.89, 95%CI:0.84-0.94).

HIVST deployment and integration in health services is an emerging priority. We conducted a systematic review aiming to close the gap in evidence that summarizes the impact of digitally supported HIVST and to inform policy recommendations. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase for articles and abstracts on HIVST with digital supports published during the period February 1st, 2010 to June 15th, 2021, following Cochrane guidelines and PRISMA methodology. We assessed feasibility, acceptability, preference, and impact outcomes across all populations and study designs. Metrics reported were willingness to use HIVST, preferences for HIVST delivery, proportion of first-time testers, HIVST uptake, HIVST kit return rate, and linkage to care. Heterogeneity of the interventions and reported metrics precluded us from conducting a meta-analysis. FINDINGS: 46 studies were narratively synthesized, of which 72% were observational and 28% were RCTs. Half of all studies (54%, 25/46) assessed web-based innovations (e.g., study websites, videos, chatbots), followed by social media (26%, 12/46), HIVST-specific apps (7%, 3/46), SMS (9%, 4/46), and digital VMs (4%, 2/46). Web-based innovations were found to be acceptable (77C97%), preferred over in-person and hybrid options by more first-time testers (47C48%), highly feasible (93C95%), and were overall effective in supporting linkage to care (53C100%). Social media and app-based innovations also had high acceptability (87C95%) and linkage to care proportions (80C100%).

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl trans-peptidase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were significantly elevated in contrast to serum albumin that was reduced in COVID-19 survivors (P 0.001). Serum lipase, amylase and albuminuria were higher in COVID-19 survivors (P 0.001). Regression analysis (AOR, 95% CI) showed that ESR (P = 0.014), haemoglobin concentration (P = 0.039), serum lipase (P= 0.018), blood urea nitrogen (P= 0.003), albuminuria (P= 0.046), 25(OH) vitamin D (P= 0.002), and serum uric acid (P= 0.005) were the significant predictors of COVID-19 survivors (94.8% an overall prediction). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 survivors experienced residual significant clinical and biochemical alterations that necessitate comprehensive medical care and close follow-up for longer periods.","output":"Long-term clinical and biochemical residue after COVID-19 recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acellular amniotic membrane (AM) has been studied, with promising results on the reconstruction of lesioned tissues, and has become an attractive approach for tracheal repair. This study aimed to evaluate the repair of the trachea with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) differentiated in chondrocytes, grown on an experimental model. Tracheal defects were induced by surgical tracheostomy in 30 New Zealand rabbits, and the acellular amniotic membrane, with or without cells, was covering the defect. The hucMSCs were isolated and cultivated with chondrogenic differentiation over the culture of 14 days, and then grown on the AM. In this study, the AM was biocompatible and hucMSCs differentiated into chondrocytes. Our results demonstrated an important role for AM with cultured cells in the promotion of immature collagen, known to produce tissue regeneration. In addition, cartilaginous tissue was found at the tracheal defects, demonstrated by immunohistology results. This study suggests that this biomaterial implantation can be an effective future therapeutic alternative for patients with tracheal injury.","output":"Tracheal Repair with Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Differentiated in Chondrocytes Grown on an Acellular Amniotic Membrane: A Pre-Clinical Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human behaviour is known to be crucial in the propagation of infectious diseases through respiratory or close-contact routes like the current SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Our main objective was to assess the relationships between SARS-CoV-2 perceptions and social contact behaviour in Belgium. Understanding these relationships is crucial to maximize interventions' effectiveness, e.g. by tailoring public health communication campaigns. In this study, we surveyed a representative sample of adults in Belgium in two longitudinal surveys (8 waves of survey 1 in April 2020 to August 2020, and 11 waves of survey 2 in November 2020 to April 2021). Generalized linear mixed effects models were used to analyse the two surveys. Participants with low and neutral perceptions on perceived severity made a significantly higher number of social contacts as compared to participants with high levels of perceived severity after controlling for other variables. Furthermore, participants with higher levels of perceived effectiveness of measures and perceived adherence to measures made fewer contacts. However, the differences were small. Our results highlight the key role of perceived severity on social contact behaviour during a pandemic.

OBJECTIVES: To (1) document the prevalence of depression among MDR-TB cases registered at tuberculosis units (TUs) of Ahmedabad city and (2) assess determinants of depression. METHODOLOGY: Adult MDR-TB patients registered at all (23) TUs of Ahmedabad city, were studied using semi-structured questionnaire along with Gujarati translated version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) to assess the severity of depression based on 17 items. The sample size at 95% level of significance, was 251. Probability proportional to size sampling was adopted for selecting participants from each of the 23 TUs. Proportions and odds ratio with confidence interval with probability value were calculated. RESULTS: Of 251, only 185 (73.7%) cases could be contacted. Mortality proportion among selected cases was 18.7%. More than one-fifth (22%) had 1 comorbidity and 9.7% had another active TB case in the family. 161 (87.1) experienced 1 adverse event.

The devastation that stroke and COVID-19 oppress on an individual and a population is well established, and these traumas are potently magnified in the troughs of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, stroke has been shown to be a potential complication of COVID-19 infection, and while there is global controversy regarding this finding, it is undeniable that there are patients across the world presenting with both conditions concurrently. Thus, the topic of isolated stroke and the co-occurrence of stroke and COVID-19 amidst the pandemic both warrant considerable investigation on both a basic science level and a humanistic level. This opinion article advocates for a narrative medicine approach to better explicate the intertwining of stroke and COVID-19. Interviewing patients who presented with both stroke and COVID-19 as well as patients who present with stroke during the pandemic will provide the opportunity to gather and juxtapose individual illness experiences, including encounters with the health care system, relationship with care teams and care takers, recovery, and insights into the future. Creating, analyzing, and comparing such an anthology of illness narratives of the 2 patient populations will offer a unique understanding into the experience of different, yet over-lapping, medical traumas in an unprecedented time. With this deeper appreciation of patient accounts, the health care system can better recognize how to provide for future patients who present specifically with stroke or stroke and COVID-19.

Additionally, few studies have looked at neonatal respiratory distress and its predictors in developing countries, and thus we sought to investigate this issue in neonates who were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Black Lion Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted with 571 neonates from January 2013 to March 2018. Data were collected by reviewing patients' charts using a systematic sampling technique with a pretested checklist. The data was then entered using Epi-data 4.2 and analyzed with STATA 14. Median time, Kaplan-Meier survival estimation curves, and log-rank tests were then computed. Bivariable and multivariable Gompertz parametric hazard models were fitted to detect the determinants of respiratory distress. The hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval was subsequently calculated. Variables with reported p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The proportion of neonates with respiratory distress among those admitted to the Black Lion Specialized Hospital neonatal intensive care unit was 42.9% (95%CI: 39.3-46.1%) The incidence rate was 8.1/100 (95%CI: 7.3, 8.9). Significant predictors of respiratory distress in neonates included being male [Adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 2.4 (95%CI: 1.1, 3.1)], born via caesarean section [AHR: 1.9 (95%CI: 1.6, 2.3)], home delivery [AHR: 2.9 (95%CI: 1.5, 5,2)], maternal diabetes mellitus (AHR: 2.3 (95%CI: 1.4, 3.6)), preterm birth [AHR: 2.9 (95%CI: 1.6, 5.1)], and having an Apgar score of less than 7 [AHR: 3.1 (95%CI: 1.8, 5.0)]. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the proportion of respiratory distress (RD) was high. Preterm birth, delivery by caesarean section, Apgar score < 7, sepsis, maternal diabetes mellitus, and home delivery were all significant predictors of this condition. Based on our findings this would likely include encouraging more hospital births, better control of diabetes in pregnancy, improved neonatal resuscitation and addressing ways to decrease the need for frequent caesarean sections.","output":"Incidence of respiratory distress and its predictors among neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, Black Lion Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using network analysis, this paper develops a multidimensional methodological framework for understanding the uneven (cross-country) spread of COVID-19 in the context of the global interconnected economy.

Before estimating virus timescales, the shape of tree topologies can be used as a proxy to assess the effectiveness of the virus phylogeny in providing accurate estimates of evolutionary parameters. In short timescales, estimates have larger uncertainty. We compared the predictions from simulations with empirical data. The tree shape of SARS-CoV-2 was closer to shorter timescales scenarios, which yielded parametric estimates with larger uncertainty, suggesting that estimates from these datasets should be evaluated cautiously.

METHODS Hemodialysis patients (n = 36), peritoneal dialysis patients (n = 54), and healthy controls (n = 30) were included in the study. All the subjects were assessed with Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Body Image Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Scale, Golombok-Rust Inventory for Sexual Satisfaction, and Dyadic Adjustment Scale. RESULTS Depression (20.64 +/- 15.20) and anxiety levels (14.72 +/- 12.36) were significantly higher in hemodialysis group compared to peritoneal dialysis (13.54 +/- 12.51; 12.74 +/- 11.21) and control groups (7.17 +/- 5.58; 9.86 +/- 9.19). In peritoneal dialysis group, as depression and anxiety levels increased, body image was disturbed and sexual satisfaction decreased. In peritoneal dialysis group, body image (86.98 +/- 23.63) was better than hemodialysis group (101.58 +/- 26.51) and was not different from the control group (83.67 +/- 22.11).

PATIENTS Twenty-one HIV-seropositive patients (13 asymptomatic and eight with diarrhoea) and 12 controls from an urban referral-based tertiary care centre in Berlin who underwent duodenoscopy. METHODS A new miniaturized Ussing chamber allowed measurements on duodenal forceps biopsies. Epithelial barrier function was characterized by alternating current impedance analysis, which allows differentiation of epithelial and subepithelial resistance and by 3H-lactulose and 3H-mannitol flux measurements. Na+-glucose cotransport was quantified as phlorizin-sensitive short circuit current (Isc) and active ion secretion by baseline and bumetanide-sensitive Isc. RESULTS Duodenal biopsies from asymptomatic HIV-infected patients were no different from controls, whereas biopsies from HIV-infected patients with diarrhoea showed a decrease in epithelial resistance from 21.2+/-1.9 to 12.9+/-1.3 omega cm2 (P<0.01).

METHODS An international multidisciplinary (neurosurgery, neuroradiology, neurology, clinical epidemiology) group of 69 specialists was convened to develop and validate the UIATS model using a Delphi consensus. For internal (39 panel members involved in identification of relevant features) and external validation (30 independent external reviewers), 30 selected UIA cases were used to analyze agreement with UIATS management recommendations based on a 5-point Likert scale (5 indicating strong agreement). Interrater agreement (IRA) was assessed with standardized coefficients of dispersion (vr*) (vr* = 0 indicating excellent agreement and vr* = 1 indicating poor agreement). RESULTS The UIATS accounts for 29 key factors in UIA management. Agreement with UIATS (mean Likert scores) was 4.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.1-4.3) per reviewer for both reviewer cohorts; agreement per case was 4.3 (95% CI 4.1-4.4) for panel members and 4.5 (95% CI 4.3-4.6) for external reviewers (p = 0.017). Mean Likert scores were 4.2 (95% CI 4.1-4.3) for interventional reviewers (n = 56) and 4.1 (95% CI 3.9-4.4) for noninterventional reviewers (n = 12) (p = 0.290). Overall IRA (vr*) for both cohorts was 0.026 (95% CI 0.019-0.033). CONCLUSIONS This novel UIA decision guidance study captures an excellent consensus among highly informed individuals on UIA management, irrespective of their underlying specialty.

Concerns regarding SARS-CoV- 2 transmission risk to research staff and overburdened institutional environments create challenges for standard event monitoring. In addition, safety or outcome events often occur at other institutions rather than the enrollment site. Therefore, research methodology was adapted to effectively evaluate and categorize safety events using a remote low touch approach. Methods Trial over can be found at NCT04498273. Potential adverse events identified through patient electronic data capture survey or call center assessments are handled remotely by central clinical study staff. If an event is identified as a possible endpoint or SAE by the central study staff the electronic data collection (EDC) system notifies the central medical monitoring team, and the enrolling site coordinator if patient enrolled from an acute care setting, that additional source documents are necessary. The medical coordinator works with the site coordinator, or will reach out independently to treating institutions to obtain necessary source documents.

Indeed, most studies thus far have focused on the risk of increase and aggravation of other psychiatric disorders as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Yet, risk of onset or aggravation of panic disorder, especially the subtype with prominent respiratory symptoms, which is characterized by a fear response conditioning to interoceptive sensations (e.g., respiratory), and hypervigilance to these interoceptive signals, could be expected in the current situation. Indeed, respiratory symptoms, such as coughs and dyspnea, are among the most commonly associated with the SARS-CoV-2 (59-82% and 31-55%, respectively), and respiratory symptoms are associated with a poor illness prognosis. Hence given that some etiological and maintenance factors associated with panic disorder C i.e., fear conditioning to abnormal breathing patterns attributable or not to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), as well as hypervigilance towards breathing abnormalities C are supposedly more prevalent, one could expect an increased risk of panic disorder onset or aggravation following the COVID-19 pandemic in people who were affected by the virus, but also those who were not. In people with the comorbidity (i.e., panic disorder or panic attacks and the COVID-19), it is particularly important to be aware of the risk of hypokalemia in specific at-risk situations or prescriptions. For instance, in the case of salbutamol prescription, which might be overly used in patients with anxiety disorders and COVID-19, or in patients presenting with diarrhea and vomiting. Hypokalemia is associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointe, thus caution is required when prescribing specific psychotropic drugs, such as the antidepressants citalopram and escitalopram, which are first-line treatments for panic disorder, but also hydroxyzine, aiming at anxiety relief. The results reviewed here highlight the importance of considering and further investigating the impact of the current pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of panic disorder (alone or comorbid with the COVID-19).","output":"Panic and pandemic: narrative review of the literature on the links and risks of panic disorder as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the beginning of the COVID-19 US epidemic in March 2020, sweeping lockdowns and other aggressive measures were put in place and retained in many states until end of August of 2020; the ensuing economic downturn has led many to question the wisdom of the early COVID-19 policy measures in the US.

Demographic data, ECMO characteristics and clinical outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was to assess the complication rate and 28-day mortality; the secondary outcome was to compare patient and ECMO characteristics between COVID-19 patients on ECMO and non-COVID-19 related ARDS patients on ECMO (non-COVID-19; January 1, 2018 until July 31, 2019). RESULTS: During the study period 71 COVID-19 patients received ECMO, mostly veno-venous, for a median duration of 13 days (IQR 7-20). ECMO was initiated at 5 days (IQR 3-10) following invasive mechanical ventilation. Median PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio prior to initiation of ECMO was similar in COVID-19 patients (58 mmHg [IQR 46-76]) and non-COVID-19 patients (53 mmHg [IQR 44-66]), the latter consisting of 48 patients. 28-day mortality was 37% in COVID-19 patients and 27% in non-COVID-19 patients.

Despite recovery of the peripheral nerves, patients often have residual motor dysfunction of the upper extremity, leading to persistent pain related to altered biomechanics of the shoulder region. Building on clinical signs that suggest a role for cerebral mechanisms in these residual complaints, here we show and characterize cerebral alterations following neuralgic amyotrophy. Neuralgic amyotrophy patients often develop alternative motor strategies, which suggests that (mal)adaptations may occur in somatomotor and/or visuomotor brain areas. Here, we tested where changes in cerebral sensorimotor representations occur in neuralgic amyotrophy, while controlling for altered motor execution due to peripheral neuropathy. We additionally explore the relation between potential cerebral alterations in neuralgic amyotrophy and clinical symptoms. During functional MRI scanning, 39 neuralgic amyotrophy patients with persistent, lateralized symptoms in the right upper extremity and 23 matched healthy participants solved a hand laterality judgement task that can activate sensorimotor representations of the upper extremity, across somatomotor and visuomotor brain areas. Behavioural and cerebral responses confirmed the involvement of embodied, sensorimotor processes across groups. Compared with healthy participants, neuralgic amyotrophy patients were slower in hand laterality judgement and had decreased cerebral activity specific to their affected limb in two higher-order visual brain regions: the right extrastriate cortex and the parieto-occipital sulcus. Exploratory analyses revealed that across patients, extrastriate activity specific to the affected limb decreased as persistent pain increased, and affected limb-related parieto-occipital activity decreased as imagery performance of the affected limb became slower. These findings suggest that maladaptive cerebral plasticity in visuomotor areas involved in sensorimotor integration plays a role in residual motor dysfunction and subsequent persistent pain in neuralgic amyotrophy. Rehabilitation interventions that apply visuomotor strategies to improve sensorimotor integration may help to treat neuralgic amyotrophy patients.","output":"Visuomotor processing is altered after peripheral nerve damage in neuralgic amyotrophy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the widespread use of face masks to combat COVID-19, little is known about their social and behavioral consequences.

It also assessed the sensitivity of the initial brief screening and the detailed full assessment. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in 11 community centers in Hong Kong. Intrinsic capacity was assessed in two steps identical to WHO ICOPE handbook: using WHO ICOPE brief screening tool (step 1) and detailed full assessment (step 2) to assess the intrinsic capacity domains of locomotion, cognition, vitality, psychological well-being, and sensory capacity (hearing and vision). Structural equational modeling analysis was used to examine the relationship among intrinsic capacity, social engagement, and self-care capacity, and the mediating role of intrinsic capacity in the relationships. RESULTS: A total of 304 older adults with a mean age 76.73 (SD = 7.25) years participated in WHO ICOPE Step 1 brief screening, and 221 participants (72.7%) showed intrinsic capacity impairment. After completing Step 2 full assessment, 202 participants (66.4%) had one or more impaired intrinsic capacity domains. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the screening tool were 95% and 57.6% respectively, whereas the sensitivity of each domain ranged from 74.7% to 100%. The percentage of impairment in locomotion (117, 39.8%), cognition (75, 25.5%), psychological well-being (34, 11.6%), vision (75, 24.7%), hearing capacity (82, 27.9%), and vitality (8, 2.7%).

We evaluated the relationship between coagulation, inflammatory, and TEG parameters in patients with COVID-19 on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Methods: We performed a single center retrospective analysis of consecutive patients that received ECMO for the treatment of COVID-19. TEG, inflammatory, and coagulation markers were compared in patients with and without thrombotic complications. Correlation tests were performed to identify the coagulation and inflammatory markers that best predict hypercoagulability as defined by an elevated TEG MA. Results: 168 TEGs were available in 24 patients. C-reactive protein and fibrinogen were significantly higher in patients that developed a thrombotic event versus those that did not (p=0.038 and p=0.043 respectively). D-dimer was negatively correlated with TEG MA (p<0.001) while fibrinogen was positively correlated (p<0.001).

Significant difference in deaths at national level (P = 0.003), and higher male mortality than women (+18% versus +14%, P < 0.001 versus P = 0.01) was observed. Finally, higher mortality was strongly and positively correlated with latitude (R = 0.82, P < 0.001). ConclusionsOur findings support the absence of historical endogenous reasons capable of justifying the increase in deaths and mortality observed in Italy in 2020. Together with the current knowledge on the novel coronavirus 2019, these findings provide decisive evidence on the devastating impact of COVID-19 in Italy. We suggest that this research be leveraged by government, health, and information authorities to furnish proof against conspiracy hypotheses. Moreover, given the marked concordance between the predictions of the ARIMA and OLS regression models, we suggest that these models be exploited to predict mortality trends.","output":"Dying from COVID-19 or with COVID-19: a definitive answer through a retrospective analysis of mortality in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MCC is a tool designed for a very specific task: to transform the models of High-Level Petri nets, given in the PNML syntax, into equivalent Place/Transition nets.

The risk of mesh infection is increased in a contaminated environment or in patients who have comorbidities such as diabetes or smoking. The use of biological prostheses has been advocated because of their ability to resist infection. Initial results, however, have shown high hernia recurrence rates and wound occurrences. The objective of the present study is to evaluate early and mid-term outcomes in the largest French series that included 43 consecutive complex abdominal hernias repaired with biological prostheses. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective observational study of a prospective collected data bank. Patient demographics, history of previous repairs, intraoperative findings and degree of contamination, associated procedures, postoperative prosthetic-related complications, and long-term results were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS There were 25 (58%) incisional, 14 parastomal, and 4 midline hernia repairs. Hernias were considered \\"clean\\" (n = 5), \\"clean-contaminated\\" (n = 19), \\"contaminated\\" (n = 12), or \\"dirty\\" (n = 7). Wound-related morbidity occurred in 17 patients; 4 patients needed reoperation for cutaneous necrosis or abscess. Smoking was the only risk factor associated with wound complication (P = .022). No postoperative wound events required removal of the prosthesis. There were 4 hernia recurrences (9%). A previous attempt at repair (P = .018) and no complete fascia closure (P = .033) were associated with hernia recurrence. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that the use of bioprothesis in complex hernia repair allowed successful single-stage reconstruction. Wound-related complications were frequent. Cost-benefit analyses are important to establish the validity of these findings.","output":"Use of a bioprosthetic mesh in complex hernia repair: early results from a French multicenter pilot study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of November 2019, a novel coronavirus responsible for respiratory tract infections (COVID-19) emerged in China. Despite drastic containment measures, this virus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spread in Asia and Europe. The pandemic is ongoing with particular hotspot in Southern Europe and America in Spring 2020. Many studies predicted a similar epidemic in Africa as that currently seen in Europe and the United States of America. However, reported data do not confirm these predictions. Several hypotheses that could explain the later emergence and spread of COVID-19 pandemic in African countries are being discussed, including the lack of health care infrastructure capable of clinically detecting and confirming COVID-19 cases, the implementation of social distancing and hygiene, international air traffic flows, the climate, the relatively young and rural population, the genetic polymorphism of the ACE2 receptor, cross-immunity and the use of antimalarial drugs.","output":"What could explain the late emergence of COVID-19 in Africa?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND GOALS: The aim of the study is to know the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and professional staff of a medium or long-stay hospital during the peak period of the pandemic in Spain, spring 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS: At the end of February 2020, we developed at the hospital a strategy to diagnose the SARS-CoV-2 infection consisting of complementing the realization of PCR tests at real time with a quick technique of lateral flow immunochromatography to detect IgG and IgM antibodies against the virus. We also developed a protocol to realize those diagnostic tests and considered an infection (current or past) a positive result in any of the above tests. We included 524 participants in the study (230 patients and 294 hospital staff), and divided them into hospital patients and Hemodialysis outpatients. Furthermore, we divided the hospital staff into healthcare and non-healthcare staff. The documented period was from March, 20th to April, 21st, 2020. RESULTS: 26 out of 230 patients tested positive in any of the diagnostic techniques (PCR, antibodies IgG, IgM) with a 11.30% prevalence. According to patients groups, we got a 14.38% prevalence in hospital patients vs. 5.95% in outpatients, with a significantly higher risk in admitted patients after adjustment for age and gender (OR=3,309, 95%CI: 1,154-9,495). 24 out of 294 hospital staff tested positive in any of the diagnostic techniques, with a 8.16% prevalence. According to the groups, we got a 8.91% prevalence in healthcare staff vs. 4.26% in non-healthcare staff. Thus, we do not see any statistically significant differences between hospital staff and patients as far as prevalence is concerned (P=0,391), (OR=2,200, 95%CI: 0,500-9,689). CONCLUSIONS: The result of the study was a quite low prevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in both patients and hospital staff, being the hospital patients' prevalence rate higher than the outpatients', and the healthcare staff higher than the non-healthcare's.

A rapid review is an approach to evidence synthesis that provides timely information to decision-makers (eg, health care planners, providers, policymakers, and patients) by simplifying the evidence synthesis process. A rapid review is particularly appealing for urgent decisions.JBI is a world-renowned international collaboration for evidence synthesis and implementation methodologies. The principles for JBI evidence synthesis include comprehensiveness, rigor, transparency, and a focus on applicability to clinical practice. As such, JBI has not yet endorsed a specific approach for rapid reviews.In this paper, we compare rapid reviews versus other types of evidence synthesis, provide a range of rapid evidence products, outline how to appraise the quality of rapid reviews, and present the JBI position on rapid reviews. JBI-affiliated Centers conduct rapid reviews for decision-makers in specific circumstances, such as limited time or funding constraints. A standardized approach is not used for these cases; instead, the evidence synthesis methods are tailored to the needs of the decision-maker.The urgent need to deliver timely evidence to decision-makers poses challenges to JBI's mission to produce high quality, trustworthy evidence. However, JBI recognizes the value of rapid reviews as part of the evidence synthesis ecosystem. As such, it is recommended that rapid reviews be conducted with the same methodological rigor and transparency expected of JBI reviews. Most importantly, transparency is essential, and the rapid review should clearly report where any simplification in the steps of the evidence synthesis process have been taken.","output":"Rapid reviews and the methodological rigor of evidence synthesis: a JBI position statement."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Smart cities often rely on technological innovation to improve citizens' safety and quality of life.

We aimed to determine its incidence among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the United Kingdom and describe factors associated with outcome. METHODS: A structured survey of pneumomediastinum and its incidence was conducted from September 2020 to February 2021. United Kingdom-wide participation was solicited via respiratory research networks. Identified patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection and radiologically proven pneumomediastinum. The primary outcomes were to determine incidence of pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 and to investigate risk factors associated with patient mortality. RESULTS: 377 cases of pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 were identified from 58 484 inpatients with COVID-19 at 53 hospitals during the study period, giving an incidence of 0.64%. Overall 120-day mortality in COVID-19 pneumomediastinum was 195/377 (51.7%). Pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 was associated with high rates of mechanical ventilation. 172/377 patients (45.6%) were mechanically ventilated at the point of diagnosis. Mechanical ventilation was the most important predictor of mortality in COVID-19 pneumomediastinum at the time of diagnosis and thereafter (p<0.001) along with increasing age (p<0.01) and diabetes mellitus (p=0.08). Switching patients from continuous positive airways pressure support to oxygen or high flow nasal oxygen after the diagnosis of pneumomediastinum was not associated with difference in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumomediastinum appears to be a marker of severe COVID-19 pneumonitis.

We hypothesized that patients receiving LAI could be discharged faster than SPIN and TIVA patients. DESIGN Randomized, prospective trial. SETTING University hospital day-surgery center. PATIENTS 156 adult male patients (ASA 1-3) undergoing day-case open inguinal herniorrhaphy. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to either LAI (lidocaine+ropivacaine), SPIN (bupivacaine+fentanyl) or TIVA (propofol+remifentanil). Perioperative Ringer infusion was 1.5mL/h. Urinary bladder was scanned before and after surgery. Interviews were performed on postoperative days 1, 7 and 90. MEASUREMENTS Duration of surgery, duration of the patients' stay in the operating room and time until their readiness for discharge home. Patient satisfaction and adverse effects were registered. MAIN RESULTS Surgery lasted longer in LAI group (median 40min) than in SPIN group (35min) (P=.003) and TIVA group (33min) (P<.001). Although surgery was shortest in TIVA group, TIVA patients stayed longer in the operating room than LAI patients (P=.001). Time until readiness for discharge was shorter in LAI group (93min) than in TIVA (147min) and SPIN (190min) groups (P<.001). Supplementary lidocaine infiltration was given to 32 LAI patients, and IV fentanyl to 29 LAI and 4 SPIN patients. Ephedrine was required in 34 TIVA, 5 LAI and 5 SPIN patients. One SPIN and three LAI patients had to be given TIVA and another SPIN patient LAI to complete the operations. Urinary retention was absent. Discomfort in the scar (26%) three months postoperatively was not anesthesia-related. CONCLUSIONS Logistically, LAI was superior because of the fastest recovery postoperatively. The anesthetic techniques were adequate for surgery in all but a few LAI and SPIN patients. Lack of urinary retention was probably related to the small IV infusion volumes.","output":"Randomized comparison of the feasibility of three anesthetic techniques for day-case open inguinal hernia repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic will have a long-lasting impact on orthodontic practice.

Methods: We searched the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for relevant articles published up to November 8, 2020. Data regarding study characteristics, hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, and COVID-19 were retrieved in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the quality of the eligible studies. The pooled prevalence and mortality rate of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke were calculated. Results: The pooled estimate of prevalence of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.46% (95% CI 0.40%C0.53%; I (2)=89.81%) among 67,155 COVID-19 patients and that of ischemic stroke was 1.11% (95% CI 1.03%C1.22%; I (2)=94.07%) among 58,104 COVID-19 patients. Ischemic stroke was more predominant (incidence: 71.58%) than hemorrhagic stroke (incidence: 28.42%) in COVID-19 patients who experienced a stroke. In COVID-19 patients who experienced a stroke, hospital admission with respiratory symptoms was more commonly reported than that with neurological symptoms (20.83% for hemorrhagic stroke and 5.51% for ischemic stroke versus 6.94% for hemorrhagic stroke and 5.33% for ischemic stroke, respectively).

The first case in Turkey was detected on March 11, 2020. The aim of the current study was to reveal the effects of COVID-19 on cranial nerves by monitoring people infected with the disease based on repeated examinations and surveys. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The data of 356 patients with a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test who received treatment between June 2020 and August 2020 in our hospital were prospectively evaluated after the study was approved by the relevant ethics committee. RESULTS: Of the 356 patients included in the study, 47 under the age of 18 years were excluded due to their unreliable examination and anamnesis findings. In addition, seven patients that died while in hospital were excluded from the study due to the lack of examination and survey records during their hospitalization. The data of the remaining 302 patients were statistically analyzed. Symptoms of cranial nerve involvement were observed in 135 patients. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus commonly results in cranial nerve symptoms. The fact that these findings are more common and severe in COVID-19 than previous SARS and MERS outbreaks suggests that it has a more neurotrophic and more aggressive neuroinvasion.

Results Baseline variables were comparable in the two groups. The pretest scores were not significantly different in the two groups. The mean total marks scored by the online group (47.33/70) was not significantly different (t=0.68; p=0.50) from that of the class room group (45.70/70). The posttest scores were significantly higher than the pretest scores. Ninety-percent of students in the online course agreed that they could effectively learn through an online course.

This study aims to estimate the health burden of the first wave of COVID-19 in China and the cost-effectiveness of early versus late implementation of MRPs to inform preparation for future waves. METHODS: The SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered) modeling framework was adapted to simulate the health and cost outcomes of initiating MRPs at different times: rapid implementation (January 23, the real-world scenario), delayed by 1 week, delayed by 2 weeks, and delayed by 4 weeks. The end point was set as the day when newly confirmed cases reached zero. Two costing perspectives were adopted: healthcare and societal. Input data were obtained from official statistics and published literature. The primary outcomes were disability-adjusted life-years, cost, and net monetary benefit. Costs were reported in both Chinese renminbi (RMB) and US dollars (USD) at 2019 values. RESULTS: The first wave of COVID-19 in China resulted in 38 348 disability adjusted life-years lost (95% CI 19 417-64 130) and 2639 billion RMB losses (95% CI 1347-4688). The rapid implementation strategy dominated all other delayed strategies. This conclusion was robust to all scenarios tested. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 70 892 RMB (the national annual GDP per capita) per disability-adjusted life-year saved, the probability for the rapid implementation to be the optimal strategy was 96%. CONCLUSIONS: Early implementation of MRPs in response to COVID-19 reduced both the health burden and societal cost and thus should be used for future waves of COVID-19.","output":"Disease Burden Attributable to the First Wave of COVID-19 in China and the Effect of Timing on the Cost-Effectiveness of Movement Restriction Policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has created unprecedented challenges in caring for individuals living with kidney disease In response to a growing call for up-to-date information and evidence-informed advice, the Canadian Society of Nephrology has established a COVID-19 Rapid Response Team that will leverage existing evidence and national expertise to inform kidney care practices in the COVID-19 era Given limited published evidence and compressed timelines, formal clinical practice guidelines are not feasible, and we have adopted rapid review methods to instead provide interim guidance across identified priority areas In this article, we describe the methodological approach that was applied in developing a first iteration of guidance documents addressing clinical and operational aspects of care for patients treated with in-center hemodialysis, home dialysis, those with advanced chronic kidney disease, those with glomerulonephritis, and those with acute kidney injury We further describe strategies for maintaining ongoing engagement with the renal community to elicit emerging needs and perspectives as the situation unfolds","output":"The CSN COVID-19 Rapid Response Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The evolution of a strategy to access the family of rearranged spongian diterpenoids harboring a concave-substituted cis-2,8-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-3-one fragment is described.

Few studies have addressed practice trends in postoperative rhinoplasty care or questioned the frequency of packing and splinting. Many conventional postoperative techniques remain controversial (eg, packing). OBJECTIVE To investigate current postoperative practices in the United States, correlating the results with surgical education, practice type, and complication rates. METHODS An online survey was distributed to members of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. Respondents were polled about their background, route of education, type of practice, frequency and preference of postoperative nasal care, and most frequent rhinoplasty complications. Statistical analysis was performed with the (2) test. RESULTS Of the 1550 total surveys sent, 126 responses were received (8.1%). The majority of respondents were in private practice (86%) and trained in plastic surgery (83%). Approximately 33% continue to regularly employ packing following rhinoplasty, but data show that surgeons performing 21 or more rhinoplasties per year were less likely to utilize packing (P = .06). Those surgeons with higher rhinoplasty case volumes were significantly more likely to utilize a secondary therapy (eg, steroids, arnica) in combination with ice packs (P = .03) to prevent postoperative ecchymosis. Finally, surgeons with lower rhinoplasty case volumes reported more frequent postoperative nasal tip deformities (P = .01).

In the same year, the elderly suicide rate in Hong Kong showed a sharp upturn from a previous downward trend. METHODS Secondary analyses using Poisson Regression Models on the suicide statistics from the Census and Statistics Department of the Hong Kong Government were performed. RESULTS In a Poisson Regression Model on the annual suicide rates in elders aged 65 and over in years 1986-2003, 2002 served as the reference year. Suicide rates in 1986-1997 were significantly higher than the reference year, with an Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) of 1.34 to 1.61. However, rates in 1998-2001 did not differ from the reference year significantly, representing stabilization of suicide rates for 4 years after 1997. The elderly suicide rate increased to 37.46/100,000 in 2003, with an IRR of 1.32 (p=0.0019) relative to 2002. Such trend is preserved when female elderly suicide rates in 1993-2003 were analyzed, while suicide rates in elderly men and younger age groups did not follow this pattern. DISCUSSIONS Mechanistic factors such as breakdown of social network and limited access to health care might account for the findings. These factors could have potentiated biopsychosocial risk factors for suicide at individual levels, particularly in elderly. Female elders, by way of their previous readiness to utilize social and health services instituted in the past decade, are thus more susceptible to the effects of temporary suspension of these services during the SARS epidemic.

Using a tablet, participants answered a 3-minute electronic self-report questionnaire on the consumption of 23 subgroups of UPF commonly consumed in Brazil, regarding the day prior the survey. Each participant score corresponded to the number of subgroups reported. The dietary share of UPF on the day prior to the survey, expressed as a percentage of total energy intake, was calculated based on data collected on a 30-minute complete 24-hour dietary recall administered by trained nutritionists. The association between the score and the dietary share of UPF was evaluated using linear regression models. The Pabak index was used to assess the agreement in participants classification according to the fifths of Nova score and the fifths of dietary share of UPF. RESULTS: The average dietary share of UPF increased linearly and significantly with the increase of the Nova score for the consumption of ultra-processed foods. We found a substantial agreement in participants classification according to the fifths of the distribution of scores and the fifths of the dietary share of UPF (Pabak index = 0.67).

The present review tries to answer the question whether one can come to grip with the pandemic by a combination of vaccinations and non\\\\pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Several COVID\\\\19 vaccines are of remarkable efficacy and achieve high protection rates against symptomatic disease, especially severe disease, but mathematical models suggest that the current vaccination coverage in many countries is insufficient to achieve pandemic control. NPIs are needed as complementary measures because recent research has also revealed the limits of vaccination alone. Here, we review the evidence for efficacy of face mask wearing in various settings. Overall pooled analysis showed significant reduction in COVID\\\\19 incidence with mask wearing, although heterogeneity between studies was substantial. Controlled trials of mask wearing are difficult to conduct, separating mask wearing effects in population studies from the impact of other NPIs is challenging and the efficacy of masks depend on mask material and mask fit. The combination of vaccination and mask wearing is potentially synergistic since vaccination protects so far well from disease development (the omicron variant is currently an unknown) but immunity from infection wanes over few months after vaccination. In comparison, masks interfere with the virus transmission process at a level of a physical barrier independent of coronavirus variant. Vaccination and masks are much less costly to apply than other NPI measures which are associated with high economic and social costs, but paradoxically both measures are the target of a vocal opposition by a sizable minority of the society. In parallel with biomedical research, we need more social science research into this opposition to guide political decisions on how to end the pandemic.","output":"Can a combination of vaccination and face mask wearing contain the COVID\\\\19 pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: In the present manuscript we used Internet-derived data to assess whether Google Health Trends (GHT) search counts are able to track COVID-19 incidences in Africa.

We therefore aimed to investigate factors associated with COVID-19 outcomes in patients with primary systemic vasculitis or polymyalgia rheumatica. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, adult patients (aged 18 years) diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 12, 2020, and April 12, 2021, who had a history of primary systemic vasculitis (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ANCA]-associated vasculitis, giant cell arteritis, Beh?et's syndrome, or other vasculitis) or polymyalgia rheumatica, and were reported to the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry were included. To assess COVID-19 outcomes in patients, we used an ordinal COVID-19 severity scale, defined as: (1) no hospitalisation; (2) hospitalisation without supplemental oxygen; (3) hospitalisation with any supplemental oxygen or ventilation; or (4) death. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs), adjusting for age, sex, time period, number of comorbidities, smoking status, obesity, glucocorticoid use, disease activity, region, and medication category. Analyses were also stratified by type of rheumatic disease. FINDINGS: Of 1202 eligible patients identified in the registry, 733 (610%) were women and 469 (390%) were men, and their mean age was 638 years (SD 171). A total of 374 (311%) patients had polymyalgia rheumatica, 353 (294%) had ANCA-associated vasculitis, 183 (152%) had giant cell arteritis, 112 (93%) had Beh?et's syndrome, and 180 (150%) had other vasculitis. Of 1020 (849%) patients with outcome data, 512 (502%) were not hospitalised, 114 (112%) were hospitalised and did not receive supplemental oxygen, 239 (234%) were hospitalised and received ventilation or supplemental oxygen, and 155 (152%) died. A higher odds of poor COVID-19 outcomes were observed in patients who were older (per each additional decade of life OR 144 [95% CI 131C157]), were male compared with female (138 [105C180]), had more comorbidities (per each additional comorbidity 139 [123C158]), were taking 10 mg/day or more of prednisolone compared with none (214 [150C304]), or had moderate, or high or severe disease activity compared with those who had disease remission or low disease activity (212 [149C302]). Risk factors varied among different disease subtypes.

Furthermore, methods used to confirm past infection vary and the immunological response after mild COVID-19 is still not well defined. METHOD: 314 HCWs were recruited from a Swedish Infectious Diseases clinic caring for COVID-19 patients. IgG antibodies were measured using two commercial assays (Abbot Architect nucleocapsid (N)-assay and YHLO iFlash-1800 N and spike (S)-assays) at five time-points, from March 2020 to January 2021, covering two pandemic waves. Seroprevalence was assessed in matched blood donors at three time-points. More extensive analyses were performed in 190 HCWs in September/October 2020, including two additional IgG-assays (DiaSorin LiaisonXL S1/S2 and Abbot Architect receptor-binding domain (RBD)-assays), neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), and CD4(+) T-cell reactivity using an in-house developed in vitro whole-blood assay based on flow cytometric detection of activated cells after stimulation with Spike S1-subunit or Spike, Membrane and Nucleocapsid (SMN) overlapping peptide pools. FINDINGS: Seroprevalence was higher among HCWs compared to sex and age-matched blood donors at all time-points. Seropositivity increased from 6.4% to 16.3% among HCWs between May 2020 and January 2021, compared to 3.6% to 11.9% among blood donors. We found significant correlations and high levels of agreement between NAbs and all four commercial IgG-assays. At 200-300 days post PCR-verified infection, there was a wide variation in sensitivity between the commercial IgG-assays, ranging from <30% in the N-assay to >90% in the RBD-assay. There was only moderate agreement between NAbs and CD4(+) T-cell reactivity to S1 or SMN. Pre-existing CD4(+) T-cell reactivity was present in similar proportions among HCW who subsequently became infected and those that did not. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs in COVID-19 patient care in Sweden have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a higher rate compared to blood donors. We demonstrate substantial variation between different IgG-assays and propose that multiple serological targets should be used to verify past infection.

This study aimed to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among asymptomatic HCWs of the ED of a large tertiary center in Cairo, Egypt. METHODS: The study was conducted from June 1st to June 14th, 2020. All the recommended national and international indications on infection control measures were followed. Two hundred and three HCWs were included in the study and tested by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and rapid serological test (RST). Descriptive statistical analyses were used to summarize the data. RESULTS: Of the 203 HCWs, 29 (14.3 %) tested positive by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Thirty-seven (18.2 %) HCWs tested positive with RST: 20 with both IgM and IgG; 14 with IgM only, and 3 with IgG only. Age, gender, and/or occupation were not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Point prevalence of COVID-19 in asymptomatic HCWs in ED of tertiary care facility is 14.3 % by RT-PCR. This illustrates the importance of screening all HCWs regardless of symptoms, and the need for strict measures in securing HCWs to reduce transmission from healthcare facilities to the community during the current pandemic.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection among asymptomatic healthcare workers of the emergency department in a tertiary care facility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccination of cows has elicited broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs).

This study focused on the benefit of plant-based foods, functional foods and the modified lifestyle which enhance the immunity of all aged groups against COVID-19 in Bangladesh. An online close-ended randomly selected structured multiple-choice questionnaire survey was conducted for people of different parts of Bangladesh (n = 161; male 51.55%, female 48.45%). The total percentage was counted for all variables. We found that plant-based foods, functional foods, and physical exercise played a vital role in enhancing people's immunity to control COVID-19. Plant-based micronutrients, nutraceuticals and antioxidants mainly took part to boost the immune system against the virus. Furthermore, physical activity had a vital role in improving people's immunity to manage COVID-19.

Host innate immune response has been implicated in recognition, protection and immune pathological mechanisms. Host-viral interactions are generally initiated via host recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of the virus. This recognition occurs through host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which are expressed on innate immune cells such as epithelial cells, dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils. Multiple PRR families, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), contribute significantly to viral detection, leading to induction of cytokines, chemokines and type I interferons (IFNs), which subsequently facilitate the eradication of the virus. This review focuses on the current literature on RSV and hMPV infection and the role of PRRs in establishing/mediating the infection in both in vitro and in vivo models.

However, there are no reports of its anti-asthma activity or its effect on airway injury. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a standard experimental asthma model, male Balb/c mice that were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA), treated with baicalein (10 mg/kg, ip) or a vehicle control, either during (preventive use) or after OVA challenge (therapeutic use). In an alternate model, baicalein was administered to male Balb/c mice which were given either IL-4 or IL-13 intranasally. Features of asthma were determined by estimating airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), histopathological changes and biochemical assays of key inflammatory molecules. Airway injury was determined with apoptotic assays, transmission electron microscopy and assessing key mitochondrial functions. Baicalein treatment reduced AHR and inflammation in both experimental models. TGF-(1), sub-epithelial fibrosis and goblet cell metaplasia, were also reduced. Furthermore, baicalein treatment significantly reduced 12/15-LOX activity, features of mitochondrial dysfunctions, and apoptosis of bronchial epithelia.

Lower respiratory tract (LRT) viral infection was defined as either a positive immunofluorescence for virus, or a virus cultured from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Haemodynamic status was determined at cardiac catheterization. Normative data for BALF, but not ELF parameters, were obtained from 26 asymptomatic, noninfected normal children undergoing elective surgery. In the absence of LRT infection, the BALF macrophage, lymphocyte and neutrophil differential in CHD was not significantly different from the normal controls. In CHD, both increased pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio (Q'p/Q's) and increased pulmonary artery-to-left ventricular pressure ratio PAP/LVP were associated with a decrease in ELF protein (rs = -0.59; p < 0.0001; and rs = -0.50; p < 0.0001 respectively). A respiratory virus was isolated from the BALF in 8 (17%) of CHD children. Virus isolation was associated with an increased ELF total protein (p < 0.05 vs no infection), a decreased alveolar macrophage differential count (p < 0.01), and an increased neutrophil differential count (p < 0.05). ET-1 was detected in the BALF of 83% of the noninfected CHD children compared to only 23% of the controls (p < 0.001). ELF ET-1 concentrations did not correlate with haemodynamic status in CHD, but were up to 100 times higher than paired plasma levels. We conclude that, in congenital heart disease, both lower respiratory tract viral infection and increased pulmonary blood flow and/or pulmonary vascular pressure influence the alveolar milieu.

By seeing patients as individuals and integrating their religious and spiritual needs into their medical care, providers can deliver personalized health care. Their needs become even more critical for the frontline providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most patients want their physicians to address their religious and spiritual needs when it comes to their health (eg, during isolation precautions). Despite increases in educational curricula about this integration, most physicians still do not provide this aspect of patient-centered care. METHODS: In this observational study, we examined how medical students responded to a patient experiencing a religious and spiritual issue by having standardized patients (SPs) rate the students' level of engagement with them. We also asked students to reflect on their own spirituality, in terms of their current and ideal levels of spirituality, the difference of which indicates spiritual dissonance. Medical students (n=232) completed the Spiritual Health and Life-Outcome Measure (SHALOM) questionnaire, and their SPs completed the Princess Margaret Hospital Satisfaction With Doctor Questionnaire (PSQ-MD). RESULTS: Results indicated a significant, positive correlation between disengagement (from PSQ-MD) and transcendent spirituality dissonance (from SHALOM).

The aim of this study is to evaluate the agreement between the IgM/IgG rapid assays, based on lateral flow immunochromatographic assay, and the fully automated 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG, based on chemiluminescence immunoassay. Materials and methods: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured with the BIOSYNEX COVID-19 BSS IgM/IgG test (BIOSYNEX, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France) and the MAGLUMI CLIA (IgM and IgG) (SNIBE - Shenzhen New Industries Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen, China) in 70 serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed diagnosis. The strength of the agreement of the two methods was calculated by using the Cohen Kappa index. Results: The results showed a good grade of concordance between the two immunoassays with a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.71 (95%CI: 0.54-0.87) for IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and 0.70 (95%CI: 0.53-0.87) for IgM SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Recently, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was shown to be 10-100 times more sensitive than RT-qPCR, making this technology suitable for pool testing. ddPCR has the added value of providing the direct quantification of the RNA content at the end of the test. In the paper we show how this feature can be used for verification purposes. The analyses and strategies presented here should be useful to those considering the adoption of a pooling approach for RNA detection, particularly, for the identification of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Nested pool testing strategy for the reliable identification of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tracking moving objects is one of the most promising yet the most challenging research areas pertaining to computer vision, pattern recognition and image processing. The challenges associated with object tracking range from problems pertaining to camera axis orientations to object occlusion. In addition, variations in remote scene environments add to the difficulties related to object tracking. All the mentioned challenges and problems pertaining to object tracking make the procedure computationally complex and time-consuming. In this paper, a stochastic gradient-based optimization technique has been used in conjunction with particle filters for object tracking. First, the object that needs to be tracked is detected using the Maximum Average Correlation Height (MACH) filter. The object of interest is detected based on the presence of a correlation peak and average similarity measure. The results of object detection are fed to the tracking routine. The gradient descent technique is employed for object tracking and is used to optimize the particle filters. The gradient descent technique allows particles to converge quickly, allowing less time for the object to be tracked. The results of the proposed algorithm are compared with similar state-of-the-art tracking algorithms on five datasets that include both artificial moving objects and humans to show that the gradient-based tracking algorithm provides better results, both in terms of accuracy and speed.","output":"Tracking of a Fixed-Shape Moving Object Based on the Gradient Descent Method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many large national and transnational studies were dedicated to the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome. Most studies are focused on missense and nonsense mutations, however approximately 30% of the SARS-CoV-2 variants are synonymous, therefore changing the target codon without affecting the corresponding protein sequence. Here, by performing a large-scale analysis of more than 40000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, we show that, over time, the virus is adapting its codon usage to that of the human host through the accumulation of silent mutations, thus likely improving its effectiveness in using the human aminoacyl-tRNA set. The sole exception to this rule is represented by mutations bearing the signature of the defensive APOlipoprotein B Editing Complex (APOBEC) machinery, which show a negative profile. Taken globally, this study indicates that codon usage adaptation may play a relevant role in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, which appears to be much more complex than previously anticipated.

The possible alterations of CSF are relatively limited compared to the varieties of neurologic diseases that exist. Additionally, the type and degree of CSF abnormality seems to be related as much to the location of disease as to the cause or the severity of the lesion; meningeal and paraventricular diseases generally produce greater abnormalities than deep parenchymal diseases.

The diagnosis of COVID-19 is frequently based on a positive serological test. We noted the occurrence of false-positive results for COVID-19 in the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip (ICS) assay in sera from patients with autoimmune diseases (ADs). This study aimed to evaluate the possible reasons for the false-positive results in two ICS assays (Wondfo ICS and Innovita ICS) and to investigate the effect of urea dissociation in reducing false-positive results. Methods: The sera of 135 patients with ADs, 13 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 95 disease controls, and 120 healthy controls were tested for immunoglobin M (IgM) and IgG against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using Wondfo and Innovita ICS kits. The distributions of auto-antibodies in antibody-positive and antibody-negative groups were also compared, and bivariable logistic regression was used to assess auto-antibodies associated with false-positive results. A urea dissociation test of ICS was performed for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive samples. Results: Specificity of Wondfo ICS for the 95 disease controls was 94.74% compared to 98.95% and 96.84% for Innovita SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively. Specificity of Wondfo ICS for the 120 healthy controls was 97.5% compared to 100% and 99.17% for Innovita SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively. Specificity of Wondfo ICS for AD patients was 73.33% compared to 97.78% and 96.30% for Innovita SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively. Sensitivity was 74.07% for Wondfo compared to 70.37% for Innovita IgM and 66.67% for Innovita IgG. Using the Wondfo ICS, the percentage of elevated rheumatoid factor (RF) level (&gt;20 IU/mL) was higher in the SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive group compared with the antibody-negative group [27/36 (75.0%) vs. 34/99 (34.34%), P=0.001]. The elevated RF was associated with antibody positivity, with an odds ratio of 4.671 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.88-11.69]. The specificity of the Wondfo ICS assay for the AD patients was increased from 73.33% to 94.07% after the urea dissociation assay. Conclusions: An elevated serum RF level could lead to false-positive results when detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Wondfo ICS kit, and the urea dissociation assay would be helpful in reducing the incidence of false-positive results.","output":"False-positive colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip assay reactions for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with autoimmune diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the physical activity (PA) landscape through the closures of gymnasiums, schools, and many outdoor spaces. Physical distancing guidelines have also reduced opportunity for PA. The popularity of free web-based home fitness videos on video hosting platforms (eg, YouTube and Instagram) has spiked during the pandemic. Many web-based fitness videos offer a convenient, accessible, and cost-effective means of engaging in PA through regularly posted videos or discrete programs. Notably, traditional PA programs often suffer from poor adherence and high dropout rates, despite many advantages over web-based workout programs (eg, equipment, feedback, and in-person engagement). Thus, notwithstanding clear advantages of these web-based fitness videos, their ability to maintain long-term engagement and adherence is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We explored patterns of engagement (ie, views, likes, and comments) for channels posting daily or program-based web-based fitness videos since the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic, over 4 months. Our secondary objective was to examine potential moderators of engagement metrics. METHODS: An environmental scan was used to identify eligible channels. Eligible channels were (1) freely available on YouTube or Instagram and (2) posted daily or weekday series workouts or offered quarantine-specific workout programs. Searches for eligible channels were conducted on June 1 and 4, 2020. Engagement metrics of views, likes, and comments were then collected from channels videos posted between March 11 and June 26 or 30, 2020, inclusive, on June 26 or July 8, 2020. A series of multilevel modeling analyses were conducted to examine longitudinal changes in each of the 3 outcome variables. RESULTS: Ten channels were deemed eligible and included in analyses; 6 posted regularly, while the other 4 posted discrete workout programs. Multilevel models revealed that both views and likes significantly decreased across days. Visually, channels display the sharpest drop in engagement within the first week. Linear change estimate indicates that the number of views initially declined by 24,700 per day (95% CI C44,400 to C11,300, P=.01) on average across all the channels. Channels with more subscribers declined in their views, likes, and comments at a significantly higher rate than those with fewer subscribers (P.04). The day of the week a video is posted, virality, and content of a video appear to influence engagement. Integrating behavior change techniques and posting new and varied videos often may help garner further engagement with these videos. Future research should examine common elements of videos, which drive engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Despite raw engagement metrics, each channel demonstrated peak engagement with the initial video followed by decreased engagement with subsequent videos. As many countries maintain restrictions on traditional PA facilities owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, determining methods to improve engagement and adherence with web-based fitness videos becomes increasingly important.","output":"Engagement With Web-Based Fitness Videos on YouTube and Instagram During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The UK government introduced social distancing measures between 16-22 March 2020, aiming to slow down transmission of COVID-19.

RESULTS Two hundred fifty-seven surveys were received from department chairs (17.5%), program directors (24.1%), associate program directors (12.5%), and department faculty (45.9%). USMLE Step 1 has been the most heavily weighted metric for offering interviews (44.0%), and it has correlated with residents' medical knowledge (77.0%) and in-service performance (79.8%) but not with surgical skills (57.6%) or patient care (47.1%). In total, 68.1% disagreed with the decision to make USMLE Step 1 pass/fail. This change is anticipated to lead to an increase in significance of USMLE Step 2 CK (89.1%), core clerkship grades (80.9%), elective rotation at the respective institutions (65.7%), Alpha Omega Alpha and other awards (64.6%), and letters of recommendation (63.8%). The new scoring is also anticipated to especially benefit students from top-ranked schools (70.8%), increase medical students' anxiety/uncertainty regarding obtaining interview invites (59.1%), and negatively affect international (51.4%), doctor of osteopathic medicine (45.9%), and underrepresented students (36.9%).

METHODS: This study was a retrospective analytical study. The data of severe COVID-19 patients from Murni Teguh and Susanna Wesley Hospital Medan from January to May 2021 were collected. Data of cardiovascular comorbidities, cause of death, NLR, and D-dimer levels were collected. The categorical data were analysed using Chi-Square, while the numerical data were analysed using an independent T-test or Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Ninety samples were collected. The causes of death were unshockable cardiac arrest (64.8%), ventricular arrythmia (12.2%), and septic shock (22.2%). There were 43 (47.3%) patients with cardiovascular comorbidites.

Child, family and intervention-related factors are studied as possible predictors or moderators, together with the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is an open two-parallel group RCT, stratified by sex, that compares ICBT with telephone coaching to an education control. Children aged 10-13 are screened at yearly school healthcare check-ups using five items from the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) Questionnaire. The families of children who screen positive for anxiety are contacted to assess the family's eligibility for the RCT. The inclusion criteria include scoring at least 22 points in the 41-item SCARED Questionnaire. The primary outcome is the SCARED child and parent reports. The secondary outcomes include the impact of anxiety, quality of life, comorbidity, peer relationships, perceptions of school, parental well-being and service use.

However, the validity of such scores in COVID-19 is unknown. METHODS The North West Collaborative Organization for Respiratory Research (NW-CORR) performed a multi-centre prospective evaluation of adult patients admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 during a two-week period in April 2020. Clinical variables measured as part of usual care at presentation to hospital were recorded, including the CURB-65, NEWS2, and qSOFA scores. The primary outcome of interest was 30-day mortality. RESULTS Data were collected for 830 people with COVID-19 admitted across 7 hospitals. By 30 days, a total of 300 (36.1%) had died and 142 (17.1%) had been in ICU. All scores underestimated mortality compared to their original validation in non-COVID-19 populations, and overall prognostic performance was generally poor. Among the 'low risk' categories (CURB-65<2, NEWS2<5, qSOFA<2) 30-day mortality was 16.7%, 32.9% and 21.4%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression identified features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse as most relevant prognostic variables. CONCLUSION All existing prognostic scores evaluated here underestimated adverse outcomes and performed sub-optimally in the COVID-19 setting.

The red emission of CDs can be enhanced and enriched in silica spheres by a simple way. The amino ends of the N-?-(aminoethyl)-?3-aminopropyltrimethoxy anchor carboxyl-rich CDs and enhance the red emission, while the other end is embedded in the silica carrier. Then, the composite silica spheres werecoated with 3-(triethylsilyl) propylamine to protect the CDs, promote bioconjugation and obtain RCS spheres. The optimal emission peaks of the aqueous solution and the solid state of RCS spheres were at 634 nm and 638 nm, respectively, with quantum yields (QYs) of 48.5% and 35.7%, respectively. Their red emission has a wide excitation range (from the ultraviolet region to the red region), and the best excitation wavelength is about 580 nm. Two fluorescence detection modes of the RCS-LFI technology for the SARS-CoV-2 NP assay are available: the simple mode of observation under ultraviolet light has a sensitivity of 100 pg mL-1; the advanced mode of detection under a fluorescence microscope has a sensitivity of 10 pg mL-1.

In addition, the feasibility of this method in actual sample detection was verified in human serum by the standard-addition method, and the results show that the method has excellent practicability.

It may be asymptomatic or cause various symptoms, ranging from flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome and eventually death. At present, the only reliable test for COVID-19 diagnosis is quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Assessing the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 could increase the detection sensitivity of infected population. Hereby, we report the performances of a fully automated chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) on 276 serum samples. One hundred samples obtained from COVID-19 negative subjects (COVID-19 free) were analyzed to evaluate the diagnostic specificity of antibody (Ab) detection. Thereafter, 176 samples obtained from 125 patients with confirmed COVID-19 (COVID-19 patients) were selected to assess the diagnostic sensitivity of the CLIA. All samples were analyzed on MAGLUMI 800 platform. All COVID-19 free samples had Ab levels below the cutoff values. Hence, the diagnostic specificity was estimated at 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 96.3-100.0; positive predictive value = 100%). By the 18th day from the onset of symptoms, we reached an optimal diagnostic sensitivity (more than 95.0%) In fact, the diagnostic sensitivity increased over time and between 15 and 25 days after symptoms onset, reached 95.5% (95% CI = 84.9-99.2). The new automated CLIA analyzer appeared to be a robust and reliable method to measure specific Ab against COVID-19 at high throughput. Our data suggest that combining Ab and nucleic acid detection could increase diagnostic sensitivity.","output":"Clinical usefulness of fully automated chemiluminescent immunoassay for quantitative antibody measurements in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this retrospective multicentre cohort study that included 27 COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheostomy, the mean time between intubation and tracheostomy was 15.8 days and the negative conversion time of COVID-19 was 43.1 days.

Outbreaks of drug-resistant pathogens are ignited by the emergence and transmission of mutant variants descended from wild-type strains circulating in the community. In this work we investigate the stochastic dynamics of the emergence of a novel disease strain, introduced into a population in which it must compete with an existing endemic strain. In analogy with past work on single-strain epidemic outbreaks, we apply a branching process approximation to calculate the probability that the new strain becomes established. As expected, a critical determinant of the survival prospects of any invading strain is the magnitude of its reproduction number relative to that of the background endemic strain. Whilst in most circumstances this ratio must exceed unity in order for invasion to be viable, we show that differential control scenarios can lead to less-fit novel strains invading populations hosting a fitter endemic one. This analysis and the accompanying findings will inform our understanding of the mechanisms that have led to past instances of successful strain invasion, and provide valuable lessons for thwarting future drug-resistant strain incursions.","output":"On the probability of strain invasion in endemic settings: accounting for individual heterogeneity and control in multi-strain dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The worldwide pandemic caused by the coronavirus has disturbed the pure conception of the separation of powers.

METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis between diet quality using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010), pro-inflammatory potential using the Childrens Dietary Inflammatory Index (C-DII), and cardiometabolic outcomes. AHEI-2010 and C-DII scores were assessed by median intake determined from the sample distribution and associated with cardiometabolic measures using linear regression models. Changes in measures were evaluated in a sub-sample of participants invited to attend follow-up visits due to the presence of hypertensive blood pressure (n = 33). RESULTS: Participants (n = 90) reported an average energy intake of 1790 kcal/day (SD  734), AHEI-2010 score of 55.04 (SD  9.86) (range: 0 to 110) and C-DII score of ?0.12 (0.86) (range ?5 to 5). Participants with higher quality/anti-inflammatory diets trended towards more favorable cardiometabolic measures at baseline. Among the sub-sample (n = 33), there was a significant reduction in total energy (m = ?302 kcal/day; p-value= 0.03) but no change in AHEI-2010 (p-value = 0.73) or C-DII score (p-value = 0.85) over follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Despite stable diet quality scores, outpatient dietary and behavioral counseling may be an effective tool to reduce energy intake in youth with overweight/obesity and elevated blood pressure. IMPACT: Diet quality scores among obese, hypertensive, African American adolescents were low and reflect a pro-inflammatory diet. Reported intake was negligible for fruits, whole grains, nuts, and legumes, and well above the daily limit for sodium and saturated fat. Participants with high quality/anti-inflammatory diet quality scores trended toward improved cardiometabolic measures.

National guidelines currently recommend 12-14 in-person prenatal visits, a schedule unchanged since 1930. In scrutinizing the standard prenatal visit schedule, it quickly becomes clear that prenatal care is overdue for a redesign. We have strong evidence of the benefit of many prenatal services, like screening for gestational diabetes and maternal vaccination. Yet how to deliver these services is much less clear. Studies of prenatal services consistently demonstrate such care can be delivered in fewer than 14 visits, and that we do not need to provide all maternity services in person. Telemedicine has emerged as a promising care delivery option for patients seeking greater flexibility, and early trials leveraging virtual care and remote monitoring have shown positive maternal and fetal outcomes with high patient satisfaction. Our institution has worked for the past year on a new prenatal care pathway. Our initial work assessed the literature, elicited patient perspectives, and captured the insights of experts in patient-centered care delivery. Two key principles emerged to inform prenatal care redesign: 1) design care delivery around essential services, using in-person care for services that cannot be delivered remotely and offering video visits for other essential services; and 2) create flexible services for anticipatory guidance and psychosocial support that allow patients to tailor support to meet their needs through opt-in programs. The rise of COVID-19 prompted us to extend this early work and rapidly implement a redesigned prenatal care pathway. In this paper, we outline our experience rapidly transitioning prenatal care to a new model with 4 in-person visits, 1 ultrasound visit, and 4 virtual visits (the 4-1-4 prenatal plan). We then explore how lessons from this implementation can inform patient-centered prenatal care redesign during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Prenatal Care Redesign: Creating Flexible Maternity Care Models Through Virtual Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is known to mediate antimicrobial activity, but its role during rhinovirus (RV) infections and in asthma needs further investigation. Therefore, we addressed the role of IL-17A during allergic asthma and antiviral immune response in human and murine immunocompetent cells. In this study we found that asthmatic children with a RV infection in their upper airways have upregulated mRNA levels of the antiviral cytokine interferon type I (IFN)- and the transcription factor T-box 21 (TBX21) and reduced levels of IL-17A protein in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We also found that IL-17A inhibited RV1b replication in infected human lung epithelial cells A549. Furthermore, by using gene array analysis we discovered that targeted deletion of Il17a in murine lung CD4(+) T cells impaired Oas1g mRNA downstream of Ifn, independently from RV infection. Additionally, in PBMCs of children with a RV infection in their nasalpharyngeal fluid OAS1 gene expression was found downregulated. Finally RV1b inhibited IL-17A production in lung CD4(+) T cells in a setting of experimental asthma. These results indicate that the RV1b inhibits IL-17A in T helper type 17 cells and IL-17A clears RV1b infection in epithelial cells. In both cases IL-17A contributes to fend off RV1b infection by inducing genes downstream of interferon type I pathway.

However, there is limited published data on the rate of glaucoma progression in the hospital vs community setting. Here we aimed to compare rates of glaucomatous visual field progression in the Cambridge Community Optometrist Glaucoma Scheme (COGS) and Addenbrookes Hospital Glaucoma Clinic (AGC). METHODS: A retrospective comparative cohort review was performed. Patients with five or more visual field tests were included. Zeiss Forum software was used to calculate the MD progression rate (dB/year). Loss of sight years (LSY) were also calculated for both COGS and AGC. RESULTS: Overall, 8465 visual field tests from 854 patients were reviewed. In all, 362 eyes from the AGC group and 210 eyes from COGS were included. The MD deterioration rate was significantly lower in the COGS patients compared with the AGC group (?0.1 vs ?0.3 dB/year; p < 0.0001). No patients in the COGS group were predicted to become blind within their lifetime by LSY analysis. Fifteen patients were at risk in the AGC group.

A face-to-face interview was prospectively conducted from 20 May 2020 to 30 June 2020 between community physicians and the community residents. Suspected TIA that occurred during the pandemic was identified by symptoms recalled from the community residents. The behavior of seeking medical attention after the suspected TIA was investigated. Results: A total of 873 community residents (517 from the Wujing community and 356 from the Maqiao community) took part in face-to-face interviews. Among them, 143 (16.38%) suspected TIA cases were identified. Less than 20% of the community residents suspected of having a TIA went to the hospital during the Covid-19 pandemic. The most common reason for not seeking medical care during the pandemic was still that symptoms disappeared quickly (94.9%); however, the pandemic did have an impact on behavior. Fear of in-hospital infection (55.1%) and of complicated procedures involved in seeking medical attention during the pandemic (55.9%) made community residents hesitate to seek medical attention after the suspected TIA. Residents with a dual attack within 1 week or with aphasia or dysarthria were more likely to seek medical attention during the pandemic.

After a prolonged period of little to no transmission, there was an outbreak of unknown source in July, 2020, in the Da Nang region, but the outbreak was quickly suppressed. We aimed to use epidemiological, behavioural, demographic, and policy data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang to calibrate an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission for Vietnam, and to estimate the risk of future outbreaks associated with reopening of international borders in the country. METHODS: For this modelling study, we used comprehensive data from June 15 to Oct 15, 2020, on testing, COVID-19 cases, and quarantine breaches within an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to model a COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang in July, 2020. We applied this model to quantify the risk of future outbreaks in Vietnam in the 3 months after the reopening of international borders, under different behavioural scenarios, policy responses (ie, closure of workplaces and schools), and ongoing testing. FINDINGS: We estimated that the outbreak in Da Nang between July and August, 2020, resulted in substantial community transmission, and that higher levels of symptomatic testing could have mitigated this transmission. We estimated that the outbreak peaked on Aug 2, 2020, with an estimated 1060 active infections (95% projection interval 890-1280). If the population of Vietnam remains highly compliant with mask-wearing policies, our projections indicate that the epidemic would remain under control even if a small but steady flow of imported infections escaped quarantine into the community. However, if complacency increases and testing rates are relatively low (10% of symptomatic individuals are tested), the epidemic could rebound again, resulting in an estimated 2100 infections (95% projected interval 1050-3610) in 3 months. These outcomes could be mitigated if the behaviour of the general population responds dynamically to increases in locally acquired cases that exceed specific thresholds, but only if testing of symptomatic individuals is also increased. INTERPRETATION: The successful response to COVID-19 in Vietnam could be improved even further with higher levels of symptomatic testing.

METHOD One hundred and thirty eight patients were treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, a combination of ribavirin and low dose corticosteroid, and then intravenous high dose methylprednisolone according to responses. Sustained response to treatment was defined as (1) defervescence for > or =4 consecutive days, (2) resolution of lung consolidation by >25%, and (3) oxygen independence by the fourth day without fever. Patients with defervescence who achieved either criterion 2 or 3 were classified as partial responders. Patients who fell short of criteria 2 and 3 were non-responders. RESULTS Laboratory confirmation of SARS coronavirus infection was established in 132 (95.7%). None responded to antibiotics but 25 (18.1%) responded to ribavirin + low dose corticosteroid. Methylprednisolone was used in 107 patients, of whom 95 (88.8%) responded favourably. Evidence of haemolytic anaemia was observed in 49 (36%). A high level of C-reactive protein at presentation was the only independent predictor for use of methylprednisolone (odds ratio 2.18 per 10 mg/dl increase, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 4.25, p = 0.02). Thirty seven patients (26.8%) required admission to the intensive care unit and 21 (15.2%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. There were 15 deaths (mortality rate 10.9%), most with significant co-morbidities, whereas 122 (88.4%) had been discharged home 4 months after the outbreak onset.

Despite growing evidence on the suitability of antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) for mass screening at the event entry, this strategy has not been assessed under controlled conditions. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a prevention strategy during a live indoor concert. METHODS: We designed a randomised controlled open-label trial to assess the effectiveness of a comprehensive preventive intervention for a mass-gathering indoor event (a live concert) based on systematic same-day screening of attendees with Ag-RDTs, use of facial masks, and adequate air ventilation. The event took place in the Sala Apolo, Barcelona, Spain. Adults aged 18-59 years with a negative result in an Ag-RDT from a nasopharyngeal swab collected immediately before entering the event were randomised 1:1 (block randomisation stratified by age and gender) to either attend the indoor event for 5 hours or go home. Nasopharyngeal specimens used for Ag-RDT screening were analysed by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and cell culture (Vero E6 cells). 8 days after the event, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected and analysed by Ag-RDT, RT-PCR, and a transcription-mediated amplification test (TMA). The primary outcome was the difference in incidence of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at 8 days between the control and the intervention groups, assessed in all participants who were randomly assigned, attended the event, and had a valid result for the SARS-CoV-2 test done at follow-up. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04668625. FINDINGS: Participant enrollment took place during the morning of the day of the concert, Dec 12, 2020. Of the 1140 people who responded to the call and were deemed eligible, 1047 were randomly assigned to either enter the music event (experimental group) or continue with normal life (control group). Of the 523 randomly assigned to the experimental group, 465 were included in the analysis of the primary outcome (51 did not enter the event and eight did not take part in the follow-up assessment), and of the 524 randomly assigned to the control group, 495 were included in the final analysis (29 did not take part in the follow-up). At baseline, 15 (3%) of 495 individuals in the control group and 13 (3%) of 465 in the experimental group tested positive on TMA despite a negative Ag-RDT result. The RT-PCR test was positive in one case in each group and cell viral culture was negative in all cases. 8 days after the event, two (<1%) individuals in the control arm had a positive Ag-RDT and PCR result, whereas no Ag-RDT nor RT-PCR positive results were found in the intervention arm. The Bayesian estimate for the incidence between the experimental and control groups was -015% (95% CI -072 to 044).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to rapidly obtain information on public perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19 in order to identify deficiencies in key areas of public education. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, a survey web link was posted on the social media and messaging platforms Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp by the study investigators. Participants, aged &#8805;18 years, filled out the survey on a voluntary basis. The main outcomes measured were knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, protective measures against COVID-19, and source(s) of information about COVID-19. Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine the effects of age, gender, underlying illness, and working or studying in the health care industry on the perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19 and getting vaccinated. RESULTS: A total of 5677 subjects completed the survey over the course of 1 week. \\"Fever or chills\\" (n=4973, 87.6%) and \\"shortness of breath\\" (n=4695, 82.7%) were identified as the main symptoms of COVID-19. Washing and sanitizing hands (n=4990, 87.9%) and avoiding public places and crowds (n=4865, 85.7%) were identified as the protective measures most frequently used against COVID-19. Social media was the most utilized source for information on the disease (n=4740, 83.5%), followed by the World Health Organization (n=2844, 50.1%). Subgroup analysis revealed that younger subjects (<35 years), males, and those working or studying in health care reported a higher perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19, whereas older subjects, females, and those working or studying in non-health care areas reported a lower perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19. Similar trends were observed for vaccination against COVID-19, with older subjects, females, and those working or studying in non-health care sectors reporting a lower likelihood of vaccinating against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are indicative of a relatively well-informed cohort implementing appropriate protective measures.

SA was performed exclusively in the sitting position, then the patient was transferred to the horizontal position with the head end elevated by 30-45-60 degrees (depending on the needs). Respiratory support was used at all stages of preparation, performance, and administration of anesthesia: insufflation of humidified oxygen, high-flow oxygenation (HFO) through nasal cannula or face mask, and noninvasive mechanical lung ventilation through the face mask. Maintenance of normotension was provided by intravenous boluses of 50 g phenylephrine.ResultsThe above-described features of SA were used by us during CS in 30 women in labor with severe coronavirus pneumonia. Compliance with the characteristics of SA caused by coronavirus pneumonia was expressed in the following: 1) sitting position C half sitting at all stages of the perioperative period;2) constant respiratory support, mainly HFO;3) early transfer to the pron-position in the postoperative period, accompanied by effective postoperative anesthesia for its provision;5) a quick return to heparin therapy in therapeutic doses.

L. pneumophila were not detected by either method; Legionella spp., nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), however, were widespread. Using quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), the estimated risks of illness from exposure to L. pneumophila and MAC via showering were generally low (i.e., less than a 10-7 daily risk threshold), with the exception of systemic infection risk from MAC exposure in some buildings. Flushing rapidly restored the total chlorine (as chloramine) residual and decreased bacterial gene targets to building inlet concentrations within 30 min. During the postflush stagnation period, the residual chlorine dissipated within a few days and bacteria rebounded, approaching preflush concentrations after 6-7 days.

The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is varied, and has been explored in many studies. there is still a need to quantify the extent of the risk of developing the severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 that require admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation initiation. The present study aims to assess ICU admission among COVID-19 confirmed cases and those who required invasive mechanical ventilation. MEDLINE, Web of Science, and SCOPUS electronic databases were searched for epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of COVID-19 atthe end of April 2020. Eligible articles that reported on admission to ICUs and mechanical ventilation were included. A random-effects model was used to pool results. A total of 23 articles reported on a total of 6124 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The majority of included articles were from China. The proportion of all hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 who required ICU admission was between 0.01% to 53%, with the pooled proportion of 18% (95%CI 22,73%, I2 = 97.2%, p<0.001).

OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Our objective is to investigate the transmission and population dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in New Mexico and other Mountain West states using whole genome sequencing. Understanding how the virus is spreading within and between communities is vital for the design of rational, evidence-based control measures. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We obtained an aliquot of 500ul - 1 ml of inactivated viral transport media (VTM) from positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs as determined by qPCR from the New Mexico Department of Health, TriCore Reference Laboratory, Idaho Bureau of Laboratories, and Wyoming Public Health Laboratory. We extracted viral RNA from the VTM, and sequenced the genomes using the methodology as described by the widely adopted ARTIC amplicon tiling protocol for SARS-CoV-2. Viral genomes were then sequenced on either an Illumina MiSeq or an Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) GridION. We placed these samples within the context of globally representative sequences made available via the GISAID database. Consensus sequences were aligned and added into this global dataset using the Nextstrain augur pipeline. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We sequenced over 1,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes thus far from New Mexico (n=861), Wyoming (n=213) and Idaho (n=44). We used this sequence data to infer the transmission dynamics and spread of the virus, both within states and in context of regional and international spread. We inferred at least 128 separate introductions of the virus into New Mexico and at least 29 introductions into Wyoming. The origins of these introductions are diverse, spread across multiple regions in the US and abroad. We also sequenced samples from an individual who had multiple positive tests over time. Our results suggest that this individual was re-infected with a different strain than that of the initial infection. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: Our data show that New Mexico and other Mountain West states have continually experienced many introductions of the virus that then seed local outbreaks. By understanding the number of introductions over time, we can assess the impact of travel restrictions on transmission. Our data also supports that some individuals can be re-infected.","output":"16306 Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 across New Mexico and the Mountain West"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the first phase of Japan's response to COVID-19 ends with reasonable success, the country now moves on to the second phase This essay aims to explain the first phase response from three perspectives First, how does Japan's response compare to that in Taiwan and South Korea?

METHODS: All patients were followed up in the hospital with daily interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, d-dimer, full blood count, and procalcitonin. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) was performed on admission, when oxygen support was necessary, and seven days after TCZ started. Disease course of the patients was grouped as severe or critical, according to their clinical, laboratory and radiologic evaluations. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were included: 70% were male; the median age was 64 years (minimum-maximum: 27-94); and six (14%) patients died. The median duration of oxygen support before the onset of TCZ was shorter among the severe patient group than the critical patient group (1 vs. 4 days, p < 0.001). Three cases of 21 (14%) who received TCZ in the ward were transferred to ICU, and none of them died. The levels of IL-6, CRP, ferritin, d-dimer, and procalcitonin were significantly lower in the severe cases group than the critical cases group (p = 0.025, p = 0.002, p = 0.008, p = 0.002, and p = 0.001, respectively).

One management approach that has been recommended and widely implemented for chronic LBP is group-based exercise programs, however, their clinical value compared with other non-pharmacological interventions has not been investigated systematically. OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of group-based exercise with other non-pharmacological interventions in people with chronic LBP. METHODS Four electronic databases were searched by two independent reviewers. Only randomized controlled trials that compared group-based exercise with other non-pharmacological interventions for chronic LBP were eligible. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook for systematic reviews of Interventions by two independent reviewers. RESULTS Eleven studies were eligible. We identified strong evidence of no difference between group exercise and other non-pharmacologic interventions for disability level and pain scores 3-month post-intervention in people with chronic LBP. We could not find any strong or moderate evidence for or against the use of group-based exercise in the rehabilitation of people with chronic LBP for other time-points and health measurement outcomes. We found no statistically significant differences in disability and quality of life and pain between the group and individual non-pharmacological interventions that included exercise. CONCLUSION With this equivocal finding, group-based exercise may be a preferred choice given potential advantages in other domains not reviewed here such as motivation and cost. Further research in this area is needed to evaluate this possibility.","output":"Comparing the effectiveness of group-based exercise to other non-pharmacological interventions for chronic low back pain: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Black tea is the most widely consumed tea drink in the world and has consistently been reported to possess anti-aging benefits.

However, there are numerous reports of vaccine loss due to temperature variations, and, currently, people getting vaccinated have no control if their vaccine was kept safe. Blockchain is a technology solution that can provide public and verifiable records. We review the World Health Organization (WHO) cool chain and Blockchain technology.

However, the role of key components of neutrophil innate immunity in severe forms of COVID\\\\19 has deserved insufficient attention. We aimed to evaluate the involvement of neutrophil elastase, histone\\\\DNA, and DNases in systemic and multi\\\\organ manifestations of COVID\\\\19. METHODS: We performed a multicenter study of markers of neutrophil innate immunity in 155 cases consecutively recruited in a screening center, local hospitals, and two regional university hospitals. The cases were evaluated according to clinical and biological markers of severity and multi\\\\organ manifestations and compared to 35 healthy controls. RESULTS: Blood neutrophil elastase, histone\\\\DNA, myeloperoxidase\\\\DNA, and free dsDNA were dramatically increased, and DNase activity was decreased by 10\\\\fold, compared with controls. Neutrophil elastase and histone\\\\DNA were associated with intensive care admission, body temperature, lung damage, and markers of cardiovascular outcomes, renal failure, and increased interleukin\\\\6 (IL\\\\6), IL\\\\8, and CXCR2.

Environmental footprint reductions could be achieved by reducing waste, reducing resource use, and reducing ecological emissions by introducing environmental management systems in the supply chains. For this aim, the projects initiatives play a crucial role. This study has the primary purpose of examining the impact of ecological footprints on financial performance achieved by US corporations initiatives implemented through projects during the COVID-19 period. The final sample comprises 9997 company-year observations over the investigation period between 2010 and 2020. The results suggest that firms implementing the initiatives to reduce environmental footprint have shown a significant positive financial performance during the COVID-19 period. The results are robust to alternative specifications of informativeness and sensitivity tests controlling for time-invariant firm characteristics and alternative firms' performance measures.

Objectives: The aims of this study were: 1. To analyze cardiovascular involvement by echocardiography in the recovery phase from COVID-19 disease, and 2. To explore its association with: a) the severity of the acute phase and b) the presence of persistent symptoms. Methods: An analytical, observational, prospective and single-center study was carried out, including consecutive patients attending the center for post-COVID-19 evaluation who underwent a transthoracic color Doppler echocardiogram looking for pathological outcomes. Results: A total of 600 patients were included from September 1, 2020 to May 1, 2021, and 29 of these patients (4.8%) presented pathological findings in the echocardiogram. Patients with moderate or severe acute phase COVID-19 infection had a higher prevalence of wall motion disorders (4.3% vs. 0.5%, p=0.02) and pericardial effusion (4.3% vs. 0.24%, p=0.01) compared with those with asymptomatic or mild symptoms;however, after multivariate adjustment, this association did not reach statistical significance. In 28.6% of cases, patients reported persistent symptoms, with no evident association between their presence and pathological echocardiographic results. Conclusion: The prevalence of cardiovascular involvement evaluated by echocardiography was 4.8% in the recovery phase from COVID-19 disease.

In the last decade, there has been a revolution in our understanding of how metabolism underlies key macrophage functions. While these initial observations were made during steady state or using in vitro polarised macrophages, recent studies have indicated that during many chronic lung diseases (CLDs), AMs adapt their metabolic profile to fit their local niche. By generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) for pathogen defence, utilising aerobic glycolysis to rapidly generate cytokines, and employing mitochondrial respiration to fuel inflammatory responses, AMs utilise metabolic reprogramming for host defence, although these changes may also support chronic pathology. ?This review focuses on how metabolic alterations underlie AM phenotype and function during CLDs.

Objective: This review seeks to impact patient care by qualitatively reviewing available evidence in support of medical and procedural treatment options for PVOD. Systematic evaluation of data quality and of the level of evidence was completed to generate current treatment recommendations. Methods: A systematic review was conducted to identify primary studies that evaluated treatment outcomes for PVOD.

Arteries gradually stiffen with aging; however, it can be worsened by the presence of conditions associated with metabolic syndrome. In this study, we investigated the combined effects of diet-induced metabolic syndrome and aging on the biomechanical properties of mouse common carotid arteries (CCA). Male mice at 2 months of age were fed a normal or a high fat and high sucrose (HFHS) diet for 2 (young group), 8 (adult group) and 18-20 (old group) months. CCAs were excised and subjected to in vitro biaxial inflation-extension tests and the Cauchy stress-stretch relationships were determined in both the circumferential and longitudinal directions. The elastic energy storage of CCAs was obtained using a four-fiber family constitutive model, while the material stiffness in the circumferential and longitudinal directions was computed. Our study showed that aging is a dominant factor affecting arterial remodeling in the adult and old mice, to a similar extent, with stiffening manifested with a significantly reduced capability of energy storage by a??50% (p < 0.05) and decreases in material stiffness and stress (p < 0.05), regardless of diet. On the other hand, high fat high sucrose diet resulted in an accelerated arterial remodeling in the young group at pre-diabetic stage by affecting the circumferential material stiffness and stress (p < 0.05), which was eventually overshadowed by aging progression.

We estimated reported, infected, and unreported cases from cumulative reported cases and simulated data. We also estimated the basic reproduction rates at different phases of the pandemic. Outputs show that the modified SIR model fits very well with the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic for the studied countries and could be generalized to other countries. The model prediction emphasizes the value of significant interventions in public health in regulating the epidemic taking into account that a constant fraction of the infected cases remain unreported during the pandemic. We report and analyze the effectiveness of preventive/intervention measures applied to the overall community to curb the severity of the pandemic. Our model could be used to support public health authorities with respect to post-outbreak reopening decisions, highlighting effective measures that need to be maintained, eased, or implemented to support safe reopening strategies in the GCC countries. ABSTRACT: Epidemiological Modeling supports the evaluation of various disease management activities. The value of epidemiological models lies in their ability to study various scenarios and to provide governments with a priori knowledge of the consequence of disease incursions and the impact of preventive strategies. A prevalent method of modeling the spread of pandemics is to categorize individuals in the population as belonging to one of several distinct compartments, which represents their health status with regard to the pandemic. In this work, a modified SIR epidemic model is proposed and analyzed with respect to the identification of its parameters and initial values based on stated or recorded case data from public health sources to estimate the unreported cases and the effectiveness of public health policies such as social distancing in slowing the spread of the epidemic. The analysis aims to highlight the importance of unreported cases for correcting the underestimated basic reproduction number. In many epidemic outbreaks, the number of reported infections is likely much lower than the actual number of infections which can be calculated from the models parameters derived from reported case data. The analysis is applied to the COVID-19 pandemic for several countries in the Gulf region and Europe.","output":"Using Unstated Cases to Correct for COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak and Its Impact on Easing the Intervention for Qatar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human serum contains large amounts of anti-carbohydrate antibodies, some of which may recognize epitopes on viral glycans. Here, we tested the hypothesis that such antibodies may confer protection against COVID-19 so that patients would be preferentially found among people with low amounts of specific anti-carbohydrate antibodies since individual repertoires vary considerably. After selecting glycan epitopes commonly represented in the human anti-carbohydrate antibody repertoire that may also be expressed on viral glycans, plasma levels of the corresponding antibodies were determined by ELISA in 88 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, including 13 asymptomatic, and in 82 non-infected controls. We observed that anti-Tn antibodies levels were significantly lower in patients as compared to non-infected individuals. This was not observed for any of the other tested carbohydrate epitopes, including anti-Gal antibodies used as a negative control since the epitope cannot be synthesized by humans. Owing to structural homologies with blood groups A and B antigens, we also observed that anti-Tn and anti-Gal antibodies levels were lower in blood group A and B, respectively. Analyses of correlations between anti-Tn and the other anti-carbohydrates tested revealed divergent patterns of correlations between patients and controls, suggesting qualitative differences in addition to the quantitative difference. Furthermore, anti-Tn levels correlated with anti-S protein levels in the patients group, suggesting that anti-Tn might contribute to the development of the specific antiviral response.

The objective of this planned systematic review is therefore to collate, summarise, and critically appraise the psychometric properties of self-report health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and subjective wellbeing measures used by adolescents (aged 11-16) with an intellectual disability. METHODS We designed and registered a study protocol for a systematic review of studies which explores the psychometric properties of self-report HRQoL and subjective wellbeing measures used by adolescents with intellectual disabilities. Electronic databases including PsycINFO, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and ERIC will be searched using predefined search terms to identify relevant studies. Quantitative and mixed-methods studies, and studies published in peer-reviewed journals or grey literature, will be included. Review papers, editorials, and case studies will be excluded. Eligible studies should identify self-report measures which assess HRQoL and subjective wellbeing among adolescents with intellectual disabilities. The methodological quality of the included studies will be assessed by applying the COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist. The quality of the evidence (i.e. the total body of evidence used for the overall ratings on each psychometric property of an instrument) will be evaluated in accordance with the modified GRADE guidelines. DISCUSSION This systematic review will be among the first to systematically explore the psychometric properties of self-report HRQoL and subjective wellbeing measures used by adolescents with intellectual disabilities. By providing evidence-based knowledge about measures being used in HRQoL and subjective wellbeing research amongst this population, and more importantly how reliable and valid these measures are, the most suitable for use will be identified. Our findings will be of potential interest to clinicians, researchers, and service providers who need information about the methodological quality and the characteristics of measures to make informed decisions about the most reliable and valid tool for a specific purpose.

There has been increasing concern regarding the impact of COVID-19 on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly in patients treated with immunosuppressants or biologics. The aim of our study is to understand the incidence of COVID-19 in a large cohort of patients with IBD. Furthermore, we analyzed possible risk factors for infection and severity of COVID-19. METHODS: This was an observational study evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on IBD patients in a single tertiary center. A 23 multiple-choice-question anonymous survey was administered to 1200 patients with IBD between March 10th and June 10th 2020. RESULTS: 1158 questionnaires were analyzed. The majority of patients had Crohn's disease (CD) (60%) and most of them were in clinical remission. Among the 26 patients (2.2%) who tested positive for COVID-19, only 5 (3CD) were on biological treatment and none required hospitalization. Two patients died and were on treatment with mesalazine only. Of the 1158 patients, 521 were on biological therapy, which was discontinued in 85 (16.3%) and delayed in 195 patients (37.4%).

The aim of this study was to assess the association between pre-admission anticoagulants use and COVID-19 adverse outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort studying using the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) claims data released by the South Korean government. Our study population consisted of South Koreans who were aged 40 years or older and hospitalized with COVID-19 between 1 January 2020 through 15 May 2020. We defined anticoagulants users as individuals with inpatient and outpatient prescription records in 120 days before cohort entry. Our primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation use. Individual components of the primary endpoint were secondary endpoints. We compared the risk of endpoints between the anticoagulants users and non-users by logistic regression models, with the standardized mortality ratio weighting (SMRW) adjustment. RESULTS: In our cohort of 4,349 patients, for the primary endpoint of mortality, mechanical ventilation and ICU admission, no difference was noted between anticoagulants users and non-users (SMRW OR 1.11, 95% CI: 0.60-2.05).

Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models have been used to predict CKD effects on transporter-mediated renal active secretion and CLr for hydrophilic nonpermeable compounds. However, no studies have shown systematic PBPK modeling of renal passive reabsorption or CLr for hydrophobic permeable drugs in CKD. The goal of this study was to expand our previously developed and verified mechanistic kidney model to develop a universal model to predict changes in CLr in CKD for permeable and nonpermeable drugs that accounts for the dramatic nonlinear effect of CKD on renal passive reabsorption of permeable drugs. The developed model incorporates physiologically-based tubular changes of reduced water reabsorption/increased tubular flow rate per remaining functional nephron in CKD. The final adaptive kidney model successfully (absolute fold error (AFE) all < 2) predicted renal passive reabsorption and CLr for 20 permeable and nonpermeable test compounds across the stages of CKD. In contrast, use of proportional glomerular filtration rate reduction approach without addressing tubular adaptation processes in CKD to predict CLr generated unacceptable CLr predictions (AFE = 2.61-7.35) for permeable compounds in severe CKD. Finally, the adaptive kidney model accurately predicted CLr of para-amino-hippuric acid and memantine, two secreted compounds, in CKD, suggesting successful integration of active secretion into the model, along with passive reabsorption. In conclusion, the developed adaptive kidney model enables mechanistic predictions of in vivo CLr through CKD progression without any empirical scaling factors and can be used for CLr predictions prior to assessment of drug disposition in renal impairment.","output":"Novel Mechanistic PBPK Model to Predict Renal Clearance in Varying Stages of CKD by Incorporating Tubular Adaptation and Dynamic Passive Reabsorption."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the UK, AVT Reliability, a company which provides products and services that focus on helping industry improve plant reliability and manage assets, is using its expertise in thermal imaging C usually employed to detect faults in factory equipment C to help companies protect their workforce","output":"Reliability thermal imaging is used to screen employees for a classic sign of COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate factors associated with the stigmatization of people of Asian descent during COVID-19 in the United States and factors that can mitigate or prevent stigmatization. DESIGN A national sample survey of adults (N = 842) was conducted online between May 11 and May 19, 2020. Outcome variables were two dimensions of stigmatization, responsibility and persons as risk. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed. RESULTS Racial prejudice, maladaptive coping, and biased media use each explained stigmatization. Racial prejudice, comprising stereotypical beliefs and emotion toward Asian Americans, was a stronger predictor of stigmatization than maladaptive coping or biased media use. Fear concerning the ongoing COVID-19 situation and the use of social media and partisan cable TV also predicted stigmatization. Low self-efficacy in dealing with COVID-19, when associated with high estimated harm of COVID-19, increased stigmatization. High perceived institutional efficacy in the handling of COVID-19 increased stigmatization when linked to high estimated harm of COVID-19. On the other hand, high perceived collective efficacy in coping with COVID-19 was associated with low stigmatization. More indirect contacts with Asians via the media predicted less stigmatization. CONCLUSIONS Efforts to reduce stigmatization should address racial stereotypes and emotions, maladaptive coping, and biased media use by providing education and resources to the public. Fostering collective efficacy and media-based contacts with Asian Americans can facilitate these efforts.","output":"Testing three explanations for stigmatization of people of Asian descent during COVID-19: maladaptive coping, biased media use, or racial prejudice?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, the role of human microbiota as a short- and long-term health promoter and modulator has been affirmed and progressively strengthened. In the course of ones life, each subject is colonized by a great number of bacteria, which constitute its specific and individual microbiota. Human bacterial colonization starts during fetal life, in opposition to the previous paradigm of the sterile womb. Placenta, amniotic fluid, cord blood and fetal tissues each have their own specific microbiota, influenced by maternal health and habits and having a decisive influence on pregnancy outcome and offspring outcome. The maternal microbiota, especially that colonizing the genital system, starts to influence the outcome of pregnancy already before conception, modulating fertility and the success rate of fertilization, even in the case of assisted reproduction techniques. During the perinatal period, neonatal microbiota seems influenced by delivery mode, drug administration and many other conditions. Special attention must be reserved for early neonatal nutrition, because breastfeeding allows the transmission of a specific and unique lactobiome able to modulate and positively affect the neonatal gut microbiota.

All data were gathered from an electronic information recording system, which included patients demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, complication, and duration of hospitalization. Results Among all patients (11,709) admitted to King Abdullah Specialized Childrens Hospital with predominant respiratory symptoms during the study period, 193 (1.6%) patients had bocavirus infections. Most of the patients were diagnosed in winter months. Cough was the primary presenting symptom (91.7%) followed by fever (83.4%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were also common (anorexia in 62% and vomiting in 39%). In 80% (n=154/193) of cases, bocavirus co-existed with other viruses, namely, human rhinovirus (45.8%), human adenovirus (31.2%), and respiratory syncytial virus type A (17.5%). Moreover, those who required oxygen supply stayed longer in the hospital (p<0.001) and were more likely to receive multiple medications such as bronchodilators (p<0.001), corticosteroids (p<0.001), and nebulized racemic epinephrine (p>0.05). Children infected with bocavirus and co-existing viruses were less likely to require oxygen supply (p<0.050).

In due time, when analyzing the desorption of hydrogen molecules from crystalline adsorbents, attempts were made to associate this behavior with the manifestation of second-order effects, when the rate of desorption is limited by the rate of surface diffusion of hydrogen atoms with their subsequent association into molecules. However, the estimates made in the present work show that the dominance of second-order effects should be expected in the region of times significantly exceeding those where the kinetics of H2 desorption have long acquired a non-Debye character. To explain the observed regularities, an approach has been developed according to which frozen fluctuations in the activation energy of desorption play a crucial role in the non-Debye kinetics of the process. The obtained closed expression for the desorption rate has a transparent physical meaning and allows us to give a quantitative interpretation of a number of experiments on the desorption kinetics of molecules not only from crystalline (containing frozen defects) but also from amorphous adsorbents.

We describe the guidelines that were applied in our cardiac rehabilitation unit (CRU) during the containment phase in France, from March 17 to May 11, 2020. We report the incidence of COVID-19 confirmed cases by RT-PCR testing among symptomatic inpatients and health care workers (HCWs) within the same timeframe. Our strategy was focused on isolation of all inpatients and protection of the professionals. The main measures were systematically placing admitted patients in a single room, generalizing the use of surgical masks for HCWs and inpatients, suspending day hospital activity. The CR program was based on individual exercise and education, plus collective activities involving 2 or 3 patients with respect of enhanced barrier measures. From March 17, to May 11, 2020, 97 patients have been hospitalized in the CRU. The average length of stay was 24 days. Five members of the health care staff (5/205, 2.4%) were suspected cases and all tested negative for COVID-19. Eighteen inpatients (18/97, 18%) tested for COVID-19 and 2 (2/18, 11%) tested positive. Patient No. 1 had a positive test 10 days after her admission to the CRU. Patient No. 2 tested positive on the day of his admission. Both had recent cardiac surgery. They were transferred back to the hospital. No secondary case was detected in the CRU. CR can be performed in a safe way for both inpatients and HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic era.

METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional, internet-based survey delivered by Qualtrics. The survey was conducted at the Oklahoma University Health Sciences Center between May 21 and June 18, 2020. The medical center is composed of seven healthcare colleges, child and adult hospitals, a Veterans Hospital, and outpatient services clinics across the Oklahoma city area. Faculty, staff, and students (N = 1,761) from the Oklahoma University Health Sciences Center completed the survey. RESULTS: COVID-19 fear is highest among nonclinical employees, smokers, and those with pre-existing conditions. Males and females, both clinicians and nonclinicians, appear to express their COVID-19 fears differently. Employees worried most about their families contracting the virus. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale is a valid and reliable assessment instrument among US healthcare workers. Responses were compared based on pre-existing medical condition(s), patient care or nonpatient care, sex, and occupational specialization. Analyses reveal a strong Cronbach's  measure of internal consistency ( = 0.87). Significant differences were observed among employees with a nonclinical emphasis (p = 0.02), with a predisposing medical health condition (p < 0.001), and with a nonacademic occupational specialization (p < 0.01), and by sex (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION: COVID-19 fear significantly impacts academic medical center employees. Medical centers should address both healthcare and nonhealthcare workers' COVID-19-related fears. It is important to recognize that men and women may have different types of fears and express them differently, necessitating a gender-specific approach to managing COVID-19 fears.

The city was founded by 19th- and 20th-century colonists from Chile (Chilo) and Europe (Croatia). This work uses uniparental and ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) to explore the effects of historic migratory and admixture patterns on the current genetic composition of Punta Arenas. METHODS We analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), Y-chromosome single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and 141 AIMs obtained from 129 DNA samples from male residents with regional ancestry. After characterizing uniparental lineages and ancestry proportions, multivariate analysis was used to explore relationships among the various types of data. RESULTS Punta Arenas has an admixed population with three main genetic components: European (56.5%), northern Native (11.3%), and south-central Native (28.6%). The Native component is preponderant in the mtDNA (83.76%), while the foreign component predominates in the Y-chromosome (92.25%). Non-Native mtDNA lineages are associated with European genetic ancestry, and Native mtDNA lineages originated mainly in the southern and southernmost regions of Chile. Most non-Native Y-chromosome SNPs originated in Spain, and secondly, in Croatia. CONCLUSIONS The population of Punta Arenas is mainly of Chilote origin with south-central Native and Spanish ancestral components, as well as some Croatian components. The persistence of local Native lineages is notable, suggesting continuity with the ancestral populations of the region such as the Kawsqar, A?nikenk, Ymana, or Selknam peoples.

Gastroenterologists have been challenged to adopt to virtual consultations and accommodate medical trainees in their virtual clinics. AIMS: To assess the impact of virtual care on medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic METHODS: A REDCap survey was disseminated among gastroenterology providers via email. The subsection of the survey on medical education consisted of 4 questions pertaining to inclusion of trainees in virtual clinics, type of virtual clinic, observation method and an open-ended question for additional comments. Quantitative data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 27 and qualitative theme analysis was applied for short answer responses. RESULTS: Of the 24 respondents that completed the survey, only 6 (25%) had trainees involved in their clinics (Table 1). The type of clinic consultations conducted were telephone only (50%), a combination of telephone, video and hospital-base telehealth (33.3%) and hospital-based telehealth only (16.7%). There was an equal split between direct and indirect observations. Preceptors that had previous experience with virtual consultation prior to the pandemic, were more likely to include trainees in their virtual clinics (66.6% vs 33.4%; Fishers exact test, p=0.033). For preceptors who included trainees in their virtual clinics, their overall satisfaction averaged 0.51 points lower (95% CI: 0.19C0.84, p=0.004). Concerns identified were lack of trainee engagement, adequate remuneration for healthcare providers, and lack of training for trainee and preceptors on how to navigate virtual platforms.

However, when it comes to creative ideation, it is unclear how the demographic cues of one's peers can influence the network dynamics and the associated performance outcomes of people. In this paper, we ask: (1) Given the task of creative idea generation, how do social network connectivities adapt to people's demographic cues? (2) How are creative outcomes influenced by such demography-informed network dynamics? We find that link formations in creativity-centric networks are primarily guided by the creative performances of one's peers. However, in the presence of demographic information, the odds of same-gender links to persist increase by 82.03%, after controlling for merit-based link persistence. In essence, homophily-guided link persistence takes place when demographic cues are available. We further find that the semantic similarities between socially stimulated idea-sets increase significantly in the presence of demographic cues (P<1e-4), which is counter-productive for the purposes of divergent creativity. This result can partly be explained by the observation that people's ideas tend to be more homogeneous within demographic groups than between demographic groups (P<1e-7). Therefore, choosing to maintain connections based on demographic similarity can negatively impact one's creative inspiration sources by taking away potential diversity bonuses.

METHODS: The genome sequence and protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. ABCpred and BepiPred servers were utilized for sequential B-cell epitope analysis. Discontinuous B-cell epitopes were predicted via DiscoTope 2.0 program. IEDB server was utilized for HLA-1 and HLA-2 binding peptides computation. Surface accessibility, antigenicity, and other important features of forecasted epitopes were characterized for immunogen potential evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 63 sequential B-cell epitopes on spike protein were predicted and 4 peptides (Spike315-324, Spike333-338, Spike648-663, Spike1064-1079) exhibited high antigenicity score and good surface accessibility.

We identified three lysine residues (K469, K595 and K622) located on the surface of SAMHD1 as the major SUMOylation sites. We demonstrated that phosphorylated SAMHD1 can be SUMOylated by PIAS1 and SUMOylated SAMHD1 can also be phosphorylated by viral protein kinases.

There are a few reports of allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a potential treatment for ARDS. In this phase 1 clinical trial, we present the safety, feasibility, and tolerability of the multiple infusions of high dose MSCs, which originated from the placenta and umbilical cord, in critically ill COVID-19-induced ARDS patients. METHODS: A total of 11 patients diagnosed with COVID-19-induced ARDS who were admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of two hospitals enrolled in this study. The patients were critically ill with severe hypoxemia and required mechanical ventilation. The patients received three intravenous infusions (200  106 cells) every other day for a total of 600  106 human umbilical cord MSCs (UC-MSCs; 6 cases) or placental MSCs (PL-MSCs; 5 cases). FINDINGS: There were eight men and three women who were 42 to 66 years of age. Of these, six (55%) patients had comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and cardiomyopathy (CMP). There were no serious adverse events reported 24-48 h after the cell infusions. We observed reduced dyspnea and increased SpO2 within 48-96 h after the first infusion in seven patients. Of these seven patients, five were discharged from the ICU within 2-7 days (average: 4 days), one patient who had signs of acute renal and hepatic failure was discharged from the ICU on day 18, and the last patient suddenly developed cardiac arrest on day 7 of the cell infusion. Significant reductions in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;; P < 0.01), IL-8 (P < 0.05), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (P < 0.01) were seen in all six survivors. IL-6 levels decreased in five (P = 0.06) patients and interferon gamma (IFN-?3) levels decreased in four (P = 0.14) patients. Four patients who had signs of multi-organ failure or sepsis died in 5-19 days (average: 10 days) after the first MSC infusion. A low percentage of lymphocytes (< 10%) and leukocytosis were associated with poor outcome (P = 0.02). All six survivors were well with no complaints of dyspnea on day 60 post-infusion. Radiological parameters of the lung computed tomography (CT) scans showed remarkable signs of recovery. INTERPRETATION: We suggest that multiple infusions of high dose allogeneic prenatal MSCs are safe and can rapidly improve respiratory distress and reduce inflammatory biomarkers in some critically ill COVID-19-induced ARDS cases. Patients that develop sepsis or multi-organ failure may not be good candidates for stem cell therapy. Large randomized multicenter clinical trials are needed to discern the exact therapeutic potentials of MSC in COVID-19-induced ARDS.","output":"Mesenchymal stem cells derived from perinatal tissues for treatment of critically ill COVID-19-induced ARDS patients: a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUNDThe significant risks posed to mothers and fetuses by COVID-19 in pregnancy have sparked a worldwide debate surrounding the pros and cons of antenatal SARS-CoV-2 inoculation, as we lack sufficient evidence regarding vaccine effectiveness in pregnant women and their offspring. We aimed to provide substantial evidence for the effect of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine versus native infection on maternal humoral, as well as transplacentally acquired fetal immune response, potentially providing newborn protection.METHODSA multicenter study where parturients presenting for delivery were recruited at 8 medical centers across Israel and assigned to 3 study groups: vaccinated (n = 86); PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected during pregnancy (n = 65), and unvaccinated noninfected controls (n = 62). Maternal and fetal blood samples were collected from parturients prior to delivery and from the umbilical cord following delivery, respectively. Sera IgG and IgM titers were measured using the Milliplex MAP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Panel (for S1, S2, RBD, and N).RESULTSThe BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine elicits strong maternal humoral IgG response (anti-S and RBD) that crosses the placenta barrier and approaches maternal titers in the fetus within 15 days following the first dose. Maternal to neonatal anti-COVID-19 antibodies ratio did not differ when comparing sensitization (vaccine vs. infection). IgG transfer ratio at birth was significantly lower for third-trimester as compared with second trimester infection. Lastly, fetal IgM response was detected in 5 neonates, all in the infected group.CONCLUSIONAntenatal BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination induces a robust maternal humoral response that effectively transfers to the fetus, supporting the role of vaccination during pregnancy.FUNDINGIsrael Science Foundation and the Weizmann Institute Fondazione Henry Krenter.","output":"Efficient maternal to neonatal transfer of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In sub-Saharan Africa, women bear a disproportionate burden of HIV/AIDS while also facing economic and gender inequalities.

PURPOSE: Given the substantial decline in well-child visits and influenza vaccinations, we sought to examine sociodemographic (i.e., parent age, education, employment status, child age, insurance coverage, household size, race and ethnicity, income, COVID-19 incidence in state) and psychosocial (i.e., child temperament, parent mental health, parent personality traits) factors associated with preventative pediatric care (well-child visits, influenza vaccines) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: As part of a larger, ongoing study, 1875 parents (96% mothers, 65% age 35 or younger, 58% with a college degree) reported whether they had missed any recommended or scheduled well-child visits since the pandemic and whether they had vaccinated their child against the flu. Using data collected during fall 2020, we examine differences in these health outcomes across social/demographic factors and psychological profiles. In addition, we use lasso logistic regression models to (1) estimate the accuracy with which we can predict adherence from these characteristics and (2) identify factors most strongly, independently associated with adherence. RESULTS: Parent psychological factors were associated with outcomes above and beyond known demographic and social factors. For example, parent industriousness and orderliness were associated with greater likelihoods of attending well-child visits and vaccinating children, while parent conservatism and creativity were associated with lower rates. We also replicate prior work documenting that health insurance, income, and household size are major factors in receiving adequate pediatric care. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to preventive pediatric care varies as a function of psychological factors, suggesting that the current system of pediatric care favors some psychological profiles over others. However, the specific traits associated with non-adherence point to potentially fruitful interventions, specifically around increasing functional proximity.","output":"Psychosocial factors associated with preventive pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Identification of host factors contributing to replication of viruses and resulting disease progression remains a promising approach for development of new therapeutics.

A fast diagnosis is crucial for patient management. Proteins that are synthesized during the inflammatory response can be used as biomarkers, helping in a rapid clinical assessment or an early diagnosis of infection. The aim of this study was to identify biomarkers of inflammation for the diagnosis and prognosis of infection in patients with suspected sepsis. Methods: In total 406 episodes were included in a prospective cohort study. Plasma was collected from all patients on the first day of a new episode. Samples were analysed using a 92-plex proteomic panel based on a proximity extension assay with oligonucleotide-labelled antibody probe pairs (OLink, Uppsala, Sweden). Supervised and unsupervised differential expression analyses and pathway enrichment analyses were performed. Results: Supervised differential expression analysis revealed 21 proteins that were significantly lower in circulation of patients with viral infections compared to patients with bacterial infections. More strongly, higher expression levels were observed for 38 proteins in patients with high SOFA scores (>4), and for 21 proteins in patients with worse outcome. These proteins are mostly involved in pathways known to be activated early in the inflammatory response. Unsupervised, hierarchical clustering confirmed that inflammatory response was more strongly related to disease severity than to aetiology. Conclusion: Several differentially expressed inflammatory proteins were identified that could be used as biomarkers for sepsis. These proteins are mostly related to disease severity.

Knowledge about people's lived experiences regarding COVID-19 vaccination can enhance vaccine promotion and increase uptake. Aim: To use COVID-19 vaccine trial participants' experiences to identify key themes in the lived experience of vaccination early in the vaccine approval and distribution process. Methods: We interviewed 31 participants in the Iowa City, Iowa US site of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine phase 3 clinical trial. While trial participation differs from clinical receipt of an approved vaccine in key ways, it offers the first view of people's lived experiences of potentially receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. The trial context is also useful since decision-making about vaccination and medical research participation often involve similar hopes and concerns, and because the public appears to view even approved COVID-19 vaccines as experimental given their novelty. Semi-structured interviews addressed subjects' experiences, including decision-making and telling others about their trial participation. We analyzed verbatim transcripts of these interviews thematically and identified common themes relevant for vaccination decision-making. Results: Participants across demographic groups, including age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation, described largely similar experiences. Key motivations for participation included ending the pandemic/restoring normalcy, protecting oneself and others, doing one's duty, promoting/modeling vaccination, and expressing aspects of identity like being a helper, career-related motivations, and support of science/vaccines. Participants often felt uniquely qualified to help via trial participation due to personal attributes like health, sex/gender or race/ethnicity.

Data on the surgical factors that improved and were statistically correlated with the number of procedures experienced were extracted and used to create CUSUM curves. RESULTS The average time for para-aortic lymphadenectomy was 149.4 min to harvest an average of 65.3 para-aortic lymph nodes. Intra- and postoperative complications were observed in nine cases (6.7%). A switch to the transperitoneal approach was necessary in three cases (2.2%). The number of harvested para-aortic lymph nodes and the procedure time were strongly correlated with the number of procedures the patient underwent (p < 0.01).

METHODS: The development of the RAPID guidelines was based on the Guidance for Developers of Health Research Reporting Guidelines. Following a comprehensive search of the literature, the Executive Group identified ten themes in Pediatric Dentistry and compiled a draft checklist of items under each theme. The themes were categorized as: General, Oral Medicine, Pathology and Radiology, Children with Special Health Care Needs, Sedation and Hospital Dentistry, Behavior Guidance, Dental Caries, Preventive and Restorative Dentistry, Pulp Therapy, Traumatology, and Interceptive Orthodontics. A RAPID Delphi Group (RDG) was formed comprising of 69 members from 15 countries across six continents. Items were scored using a 9-point rating Likert scale. Items achieving a score of seven and above, marked by at least 70% of RDG members were accepted into the RAPID checklist items. Weighted mean scores were calculated for each item. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 and one-way ANOVA was used to calculate the difference in the weighted mean scores between the themes. RESULTS: The final RAPID checklist comprised of 128 items that were finalized and approved by the RDG members in the online consensus meeting. The percentage for high scores (scores 7 to 9) ranged from 69.57 to 100% for individual items. The overall weighted mean score of the final items ranged from 7.51 to 8.28 (out of 9) and the difference was statistically significant between the themes (p < 0.05).

This result suggests that low levels of antibody titers 6 months after vaccination do not provide sufficient antibodies to prevent the omicron variant breakthrough infection, which may occur with a higher anti-spike antibody titer after vaccination with mRNA-1273. However, antibody titers in some patients were comparable to those immediately after the second vaccination with either mRNA vaccine.","output":"Anti-spike protein antibody titer at the time of breakthrough infection of SARS-CoV-2 omicron"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community-based organizations are uniquely positioned to address critical gaps in social support that contribute to inequities in maternal health.

In this paper, we offer an interpretation for the slow growth based on Minskys financial instability hypothesis and recent literature on financialization and growth. We analyze the balance sheet of large non-financial companies over the period 2012C2019, a period that comprises the positive investment cycleinitiated during the commodities boom which lasted from the second half of the 2000s until 2014the 2015C2016 recession, and the period preceding the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on Minskys taxonomy of financial profiles, we map a proxy for financial instability at the firm level based on Davis et al. (2019). We also propose an aggregate financial stability index. We conclude that after the 2015C2016 recession, companies have been restructuring their debt profile and adopting a defensive behavior, increasing their liquidity preference. Our analysis supports the interpretation that, even with the sharp fall in domestic real interest rates, the degree of confidence on expectations to recover investment in productive assets is low. This corroborates with the thesis that agents decisions do not respond only to supply stimulus, but are guided by expectations of future returns, which fundamentally depend on the performance of aggregate demand. Since 2015, Brazilian economic policy has been driven by fiscal consolidation, which has proven ineffective in increasing economic growth.","output":"Why has the Brazilian economy stagnated in the 2010s?

Many vaccine development studies at clinical trials are currently conducted to combat SARS-CoV-2. Plants are a rich source of phytochemicals with different biological activities, including antiviral activities, which are the focus of many studies. AREAS COVERED: This review shows compounds of traditional plants listed on RENISUS list have therapeutic properties against SARS-CoV-2 targets. EXPERT OPINION: The rise of new variants, more pathogenic and virulent, impacts in the increase of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thus, the control of the outbreaks of disease remains a global challenge. Other's drug and vaccines development is an essential element in controlling SARS-COV-2. Therefore, it is imperative that approach to tackle this pandemic has to be solidly evidence-informed. It should be noticed that the immune system does play critical roles in fighting viruses. Studies show that T cells levels decreased continuously as the disease progressed. T cell-mediated cellular immune response, probably by immunological memory, is essential for direct virus eradication after infection whilst B cells functions in producing antibodies that neutralize virus.But, have distinct patterns of T cell response exist in different patients, suggesting the possibility of distinct clinical approaches. Efforts are concentrated to elucidate the underlying immunological mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and progression for better design of diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive strategies. We seek to identify biomolecules with the potential to act in biomarkers that predict how severe the disease can get. But it is important to warn that the plants that produce the compounds mentioned here should not be used without a physician prescription. Finally, we speculate that these compounds may eventually attract the attention of physicians and researchers to perform tests in specific contexts of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and if they show positive results, be tested in Clinical trials.","output":"Compounds of plants with activity against SARS-CoV-2 targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Live bacteria contain a variety of intracellular biomolecules that have specific excitation and emission wavelength spectra characterizing their intrinsic fluorescence.

In response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the innate immune response is the first line of defense, triggering multiple signaling pathways to produce interferons, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and initiating the adaptive immune response against the virus. Unsurprisingly, the virus has developed strategies to evade detection, which can result in delayed, excessive activation of the innate immune system. The response elicited by the host depends on multiple factors, including health status, age, and sex. An overactive innate immune response can lead to a cytokine storm, inflammation, and vascular disruption, leading to the vast array of symptoms exhibited by COVID-19 patients.

Therefore, we proposed the use of gut microbiota from a pre-screened healthy adult donor adapted to the local pathogen load to perform a fecal microbiota transplantation in neonatal dairy calves. Our results suggest that early life fecal microbiota transplantation in neonatal dairy calves is a relatively safe method, influencing growth and development and possibly alleviating the stress caused by weaning procedures. ABSTRACT: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of early life fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on the health and performance of neonatal dairy calves. The donor was selected based on health and production records and fecal material testing negative for infectious pathogens. Sixteen healthy newborn Holstein calves were randomized to either a baseline nutritional program (CON) or 1/d inoculations with 25 g of fecal donor material (FMT) mixed in the milk replacer (n = 8/TRT) from 8 to 12 days of age. Blood and fecal samples were collected weekly, and calves were weaned at 7 weeks of age. A TRT  Week interaction was observed in haptoglobin, which was reflected in a positive quadratic effect in FMT calves but not in CON. A trend for a TRT  Week interaction was observed in the liver function biomarker paraoxonase, which resulted in greater paraoxonase in FMT calves than CON at three weeks of age. Fecal microbial community analysis revealed a significant increase in the alpha-diversity between week 1 and week 5 for the FMT calves. These results suggest that early life FMT in neonatal calves has positive effects in mediating the inflammatory response and gut microbial maturation.","output":"Early Life Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Neonatal Dairy Calves Promotes Growth Performance and Alleviates Inflammation and Oxidative Stress during Weaning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The timely management of vascular graft/endograft infection (VGEI) is crucial to a favourable outcome, yet can be challenging as there is no validated gold standard diagnostic test. Recently, a new case definition has been proposed by the Management of Aortic Graft Infection Collaboration (MAGIC) to close the diagnostic gap. The aim of this study was to validate the MAGIC criteria as a suggested diagnostic standard for the diagnosis of suspected VGEI in the prospective Vascular Graft Cohort study (VASGRA). METHODS: VASGRA is an open, prospective, observational cohort study. Prospective participants in VASGRA between 2013 and 2019 were included (257 patients; 137 with VGEI). The accuracy of the MAGIC criteria for a diagnosis of VGEI was evaluated retrospectively by calculating the sensitivity and specificity vs. the consensually adjudicated VASGRA infection status. RESULTS: The VASGRA cohort categorised 137 (53.3%) patients as \\"diseased\\" and 120 patients as \\"not diseased\\"; using the MAGIC criteria, 183/257 (71.2%) patients were considered to be \\"diseased\\". Thus, for the MAGIC criteria, a sensitivity of 99% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96-100) and a specificity of 61% (95% CI 52-70) were calculated. Considering suspected VGEI according to the MAGIC criteria as \\"not diseased\\" achieved congruent assessments of the VASGRA team and the MAGIC criteria, with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 93%. The accuracy of the MAGIC criteria for the different graft locations were also compared. If the suspected VGEIs were assigned to the \\"not diseased\\" group, VGEIs of the thoracic aorta seemed to have a poorer sensitivity (86%; 95% CI 73-95) than the other graft locations. CONCLUSION: The current MAGIC criteria offer good sensitivity and specificity in the context of true infections but a reduced specificity for a possible VGEI.","output":"Validation of the Management of Aortic Graft Infection Collaboration (MAGIC) Criteria for the Diagnosis of Vascular Graft/Endograft Infection: Results from the Prospective Vascular Graft Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Despite the availability of screening programs, oral cancer is often diagnosed due to the lack of effective biomarkers. Therefore, the identification of new effective diagnostic and late prognostic biomarkers is of fundamental importance for the management of this tumor type. In our previous computational study, we have identified a set of microRNAs (miRNAs) significantly dysregulated in oral cancer and with a potential diagnostic and prognostic significance for oral cancer patients. Starting from our preliminary bioinformatics results, the aim of the present study was to validate the diagnostic potential of four selected miRNAs, hsa-miR-133a-3p, hsa-miR-375-3p, hsa-miR-503-5p and hsa-miR-196a-5p, in liquid biopsy samples obtained from oral cancer patients and healthy donors. For this purpose, the expression levels of the selected miRNAs were determined in plasma samples by using specific miRNA probes and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The ddPCR results showed that the hsa-miR-133a-3p and hsa-miR-375-3p were significantly down-regulated in oral cancer and their evaluation in liquid biopsy samples can predict the risk of oral cancer development with high sensitivity and specificity. Finally, the computational analysis of miRNA expression and clinical-pathological features of patients allowed us to establish the functional role and prognostic significance of the two validated miRNAs. ABSTRACT: Despite the availability of screening programs, oral cancer deaths are increasing due to the lack of diagnostic biomarkers leading to late diagnosis and a poor prognosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover novel effective biomarkers for this tumor. On these bases, the aim of this study was to validate the diagnostic potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) through the analysis of liquid biopsy samples obtained from ten oral cancer patients and ten healthy controls. The expression of four selected miRNAs was evaluated by using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in a pilot cohort of ten oral cancer patients and ten healthy donors. Bioinformatics analyses were performed to assess the functional role of these miRNAs. The expression levels of the predicted down-regulated hsa-miR-133a-3p and hsa-miR-375-3p were significantly reduced in oral cancer patients compared to normal individuals while no significant results were obtained for the up-regulated hsa-miR-503-5p and hsa-miR-196a-5p. ROC analysis confirmed the high sensitivity and specificity of hsa-miR-375-3p and hsa-miR-133a-3p. Therefore, both miRNAs are significantly down-regulated in cancer patients and can be used as biomarkers for the early diagnosis of oral cancer. The analysis of circulating miRNAs in a larger series of patients is mandatory to confirm the results obtained in this pilot study.","output":"Droplet Digital PCR Analysis of Liquid Biopsy Samples Unveils the Diagnostic Role of hsa-miR-133a-3p and hsa-miR-375-3p in Oral Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been widely described as the cause for a proinflammatory and hypercoagulable state.The inflammatory process involving the alveolar vascular endothelium in the respiratory system, is a determining factor for the onset of primary Pulmonary Artery Thrombosis (PAT) even in patients with heparin prophylactic treatment.Little is known about the efficacy of the anticoagulant therapy during the course of PAT caused by COVID-19.In this paper we describe the results obtained in patients with moderate COVID-19 disease, previously threated with prophylactic enoxaparin, who then received full Anticoagulant treatment after diagnosis of PAT.After three months Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography demonstrated a complete resolution of the vascular obstructive lesions in all patients, while all the coagulation tests were normal.","output":"Resolution of pulmonary artery thrombosis in patients with moderate COVID-19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 outbreak has brought tremendous psychological pressure to the general population, especially to those with associated cardiovascular disease An online Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) survey on consecutive congenital heart disease (CHD) patients, was carried out to determine depression during the Spanish coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quarantine Two-hundred forty-two out of 407 (59%) CHD patients answered the survey, 123 (51%) had mild defects, 88 (36%) moderate and 31 (13%) great defects, most of them between 18 and 24 years old and 51% were male Patients were dichotomized to no or mild (PHQ-9 = 10) depressive symptoms Thirty-four (14%) patients showed a PHQ-9 &gt;= 10 and 10 of them (29%) were under anxiolytic or antidepressant treatment during the quarantine During the study period, 9 (4%) patients had COVID-19 symptoms Patients with a NYHA above 2 (P=0 025), living in houses without garden or balcony (P=0 014), needing psychological/psychiatric evaluation/medication in the previous 12 months or being under anxiolytic/antidepressant treatment during the confinement had, significantly, a PHQ-9 score &gt;= 10 (P = 10) In conclusion depression was frequent during the COVID-19 quarantine among CHD patients, with only a third of them being under anxiolytic or antidepressant treatment Needing psychological/psychiatric evaluation/treatment during the previous 12 months to the lockdown was a predictive factor for an abnormal PHQ-9 score","output":"COVID-19 quarantine and depression in patients with congenital heart disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Trazodone is a serotonin receptor antagonist and reuptake inhibitor used extensively as an anxiolytic in human and small animal veterinary medicine.

To be precise, the obtained accuracy, when comparing both decisions, reaches the 96.43%, which, joint to the high measured interpretability of the decision making system, result in a powerful tool in order to avoid death in patients, even in health centers without specialized clinical staff, and to reduce the stress in medical centers by reducing reaction times in critical patient situations. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Interpretable Fuzzy Rule-Based System for Fatal Ventricular Arrhythmia Risk Level Estimation due to QT-Prolonging Treatments*"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Very little is known about the impact of previous epidemics on the care of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, particularly in terms of mental health services. The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to exacerbate existing health inequalities as well as expose gaps in service provision for this vulnerable population group. Methods We investigated the responses of 648 staff working in mental healthcare with people with intellectual disabilities and/or developmental disabilities. Participants contributed to a UK-wide online survey undertaken by the National Institute for Health Research Mental Health Policy Research Unit between 22nd April and 12th May 2020. Recruitment was via professional networks, social media and third sector organisations. Quantitative data describing staff experience over three domains (challenges at work, service user and carer problems, sources of help at work) were summarised and differences between groups explored using Chi square tests. Content analysis was used to organise qualitative data focusing on service changes in response to the pandemic. Results The majority of survey respondents worked in the NHS and in community mental health services. One third had managerial responsibility. Major concerns expressed by mental healthcare staff were: difficulties for service users due to lack of access to usual support networks and health and social care services during the pandemic; and difficulties maintaining adequate levels of support secondary to increased service user need. Staff reported having to quickly adopt new digital ways of working was challenging; nevertheless, free text responses identified remote working as the innovation that staff would most like to retain after the pandemic subsides.

The power of both pancultural parenting behaviors (i.e., emotional warmth and rejection) and specific parenting controlling behaviors that are relatively common in Turkish culture (i.e., intrusion and guilt induction) in predicting academic self-efficacy was tested. A total of 1,931 children completed measures of parenting behaviors and academic self-efficacy in math and literature courses in their school. Overall, girls reported higher levels of literature self-efficacy, whereas boys reported higher levels of math self-efficacy. Compared to boys, girls perceived higher levels of positive parenting behaviors from both their fathers and mothers. The results of the regression analyses showed that, whereas father warmth had stronger effects on boys' math self-efficacy, mother warmth had stronger effects on girls' literature self-efficacy. Examination of the effects of co-parenting quality demonstrated that children with positively consistent parents (i.e., both parents having high positive and low negative parenting behaviors) reported the highest level of academic self-efficacy, whereas those having negatively consistent parents had the lowest level of academic self-efficacy. Analyses on inconsistent co-parenting, however, yielded compensatory effects, which were similar to positively consistent parents, and deterioration effects, which were similar to negatively consistent parents depending on the gender of parent and child, domain of parenting behavior, and academic efficacy. This study contributed to the current literature by showing the unique role of fathers over and beyond mothers, and confirmed the importance of positive parenting and parenting consistency in promoting children's academic efficacy.

Speeches vary in topics, which are not discriminated ex-ante by text analysis. In this paper we develop a topic-weighted central bank sentiment index as a combination of machine learning and text analysis techniques to investigate large datasets. First, we grid search the best Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to uncover the latent topics in central banks' speeches and releases of the last twenty years. Then, we build a topic-weighted Central Bank Sentiment Index (CBSIw) for the Bank of Canada (BoC), the Bank of England (BoE), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed). We find that the CBSIws main common drivers are monetary policy, macroprudential policy and payments and settlements. We also detect topics related to new challenges, for example innovation and climate change. Moreover, we find that the CBSIw decreases after the Great Recession as well as during the COVID-19 crisis. Finally, we employ a probit regression to further assess the predictive power of our monetary policy topic-specific index. We find that the indicator helps predicting future changes in policy rate, corroborating the evidence that central banks communication signals future monetary policy decisions.","output":"The informative value of central banks talks: a topic model application to sentiment analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The probability of zoonoses, such as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), emerging is strongly related to remediable factors such as habitat encroachment and trade in wild animals. Tackling these underlying determinants is important to prevent future pandemics from the approximately 700,000 viruses with the potential to cause zoonoses. Reversing habitat destruction is also vital to halt the accelerating rate of extinction of a wide array of life forms - with all the adverse consequences these extinctions will have for human health. These insights depend on viewing health and disease from within an ecological theoretical framework. We therefore argue that preventing future zoonotic outbreaks as well as dealing with a range of contemporary health issues would be facilitated by grounding our health sciences in more a more explicitly ecological conceptual framework.","output":"We Need to Address the Underlying Ecological Determinants of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sinomenine (SINO), which is used clinically to treat rheumatoid arthritis and neuralgia, is derived from the root and stems of Sinomenium acutum. SINO has been reported to exert analgesic, sedative and anti-inflammatory effects, and provides a protective role against shock and organ damage. Studies have suggested that SINO primarily exerts it anti-inflammatory function by inhibiting NF-B signaling. There is also evidence to indicate that SINO may regulate inflammation Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) signaling. The present study aimed to investigate whether the anti-inflammatory and cerebral protective effects of SINO were induced through Nrf2 both in vitro and in vivo. The results revealed that SINO significantly upregulated Nrf2 protein expression levels, increased Nrf2 nuclear translocation and the upregulated the protein expression levels of downstream factors. The treatment of a middle cerebral artery occlusion model mice with SINO effectively reduced cerebral damage and inflammation, and restored the balance in cerebral oxidative stress. In addition, SINO treatment also promoted Nrf2-dependent microglia M1/M2 polarization and inhibited the phosphorylation of IB as well as NF-B nuclear translocation. This revealed an important upstream event that contributed to its anti-inflammatory and cerebral tissue protective effects. In conclusion, the findings of the present study identified a novel pathway through which SINO may exert its anti-inflammatory and cerebral protective functions, and provided a molecular basis for the potential applications of SINO in the treatment of cerebral inflammatory disorders.","output":"Sinomenine activation of Nrf2 signaling prevents inflammation and cerebral injury in a mouse model of ischemic stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of smartphones, tablets and laptops/PCs has become ingrained in adults and increasingly in childrens lives, which has sparked a debate about the risk of addiction to digital devices. Previous research has linked specific use of digital devices (e.g. online gaming, smartphone screen time) with impulsive behavior in the context of intertemporal choice among adolescents and adults. However, not much is known about childrens addictive behavior towards digital devices and its relationship to personality factors and academic performance. This study investigated the associations between addictive use of digital devices, self-reported usage duration, delay discounting, self-control and academic success in children aged 10 to 13. Addictive use of digital devices was positively related to delay discounting, but self-control confounded the relationship between the two variables. Furthermore, self-control and self-reported usage duration but not the degree of addictive use predicted the most recent grade average. These findings indicate that childrens problematic behavior towards digital devices compares to other maladaptive behaviors (e.g. substance abuse, pathological gambling) in terms of impulsive choice and point towards the key role self-control seems to play in lowering a potential risk of digital addiction.","output":"Addictive use of digital devices in young children: Associations with delay discounting, self-control and academic performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the relationship between interpersonal cognitive distortions and family role performances in spouses during the pandemic process.

The aim of this study was to compare the performance of saliva to that of NPS in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in paediatric patients with mild symptoms. This study evaluated saliva samples from children with suspected COVID-19 who attended public healthcare services of Araraquara, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Children were asked to spit into a sterile container for collection of about 1ml of saliva after the NPS collection. SARS-COV-2 detection was performed by using the Altona RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0. The sample consisted of 50 patients, in which 27 were girls (54%) and 23 were boys (46%). Ten were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in at least one sample collected. The mean age was 10.24 years old and saliva was collected after 4.76 days from the symptoms.

Moreover, an open waste bin is placed in each users cubicle to collect used toilet paper and tissues. Such practices, which are common in East Asia and central America, have induced a dilemma of toilet paper disposal because some municipalities have removed waste bins from public toilets to prevent virus transmission by fecal matter. As a consequence, users were forced to flush down their used toilet paper and tissues. Yet, it is unknown whether standard toilet paper can be flushed easily without causing issues in sewer operations. Here, we surveyed the conditions of toilets in university campus and other public facilities in different regions across China. We also evaluated the disintegration characteristics of toilet paper products both by conducting online surveys and by physical disintegration experiments. We found that only 15% of toilets provided toilet paper, while open waste bins occurred at nearly all sites. Further, our survey indicated that 82% of toilet paper products sold in China did not give any indication on their flushability, whereas 77% of US products did. Disintegration results showed that none of the five popular, best-selling toilet paper products passed the flushability standard.

Older adults were disproportionally affected by routine care disruption. To our knowledge, no data has been published so far on the impact of service disruption on 30-day readmission. Methods We performed a retrospective observational study of all patients admitted to a single east London hospital with laboratory-confirmed or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 between 16th March and 6th April 2020. Older patients were defined as aged 80 years and over. Readmission was captured within 30 days of discharge. Comparator defined as the same period in 2019. Descriptive statistics were used. Results Three hundred and ninety-three patients were included. The majority survived to discharge (69.7%). Positive laboratory testing was similar between older and younger patients (85.7% vs 84.7%, p = NS). Mortality was significantly higher for older patients on index presentation (60.2% vs 20.3%, p &lt; 0.001). Length of stay was also significantly longer for these patients (median 9 vs 7 days, p = 0.00694). The readmission rate for the 274 individuals discharged after index admission was 11.3% (n = 31). Amongst older patients, readmission rate during the study period was slightly higher than the same period in 2019 (17.9% vs 14.8%, p = 0.36). The median time interval between discharge and re-attendance was 8 [1C29]days. All re-attending older patients were re-admitted, whereas 54.2% of younger patients were sent home directly from the emergency department. Only 1 of the 31 patients re-attended because of insufficient social care. Conclusions Our data shows that readmission rates in the older population of East London during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were largely similar to non-pandemic periods. During this period, readmission rates appear to have been driven by clinical rather than social imperatives. This suggests that adapted social care services performed well and should be reinforced for future surges.","output":"110 A Single Centre Study on the Thirty-Day Hospital Reattendance and Readmission of Older Patients During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sweeping reviews will be conducted once the COVID-19 pandemic concludes to support public health system strengthening.

In the present review, dietary patterns, smoking and the use of psychotropic medications are discussed as potential extrinsic risk factors and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) gene polymorphisms are considered as potential intrinsic risk factors. A genetics-based prediction model for SMI using ACE-I/D genotyping is also proposed for use in patients experiencing severe COVID-19. Furthermore, the literature suggests that ACE inhibitors may have protective effects against SMI or severe COVID-19, which is often linked to hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities.

CI is expected to enable us to probe the wind launching region of externally photoevaporating discs. Of the 8 targets observed, no 3$\\\\sigma$ detections of the CI line were made despite reaching sensitivities deeper than the anticipated requirement for detection from prior APEX CI observations of nearby discs and models of external photoevaporation of quite massive discs. By comparing both the proplyd mass loss rates and CI flux constraints with a large grid of external photoevaporation simulations, we determine that the non-detections are in fact fully consistent with the models if the proplyd discs are very low mass. Deeper observations in CI and probes of the disc mass with other tracers (e.g. in the continuum and CO) can test this. If such a test finds higher masses, this would imply carbon depletion in the outer disc, as has been proposed for other discs with surprisingly low CI fluxes, though more massive discs would also be incompatible with models that can explain the observed mass loss rates and CI non-detections. The expected remaining lifetimes of the proplyds are estimated to be similar to those of proplyds in the ONC at 0.1Myr.

Globally, the disease burden is increasing, and the mortality has reached over 2 041 426 compared with 323 000 in May 2020. In West Africa, the pandemic has shown a slow but steady rise in many countries. Existing protocols and their utilization are best assessed after the occurrence of the index case. General aim. The study assessed the health worker's response to COVID-19 protocols at three designated areas of the in-hospital management care triaging, holding area, and treatment centers. Method. A qualitative design was used to assess the response of healthcare workers with regards to early case detection, infection prevention, risk communication to clients and compliance to protocols. The study conducted observational visits and purposively selected healthcare workers comprising of clinicians, nurses, emergency medical technicians, and laboratory technicians who perform routine duties at the triaging, holding, and treatment centers. A total of 41 observations were made over two weeks. Results. Participants comprised 23 males and 18 females. At all observed units, the case definition was being used to screen attendants presenting, and appropriate categorization of patients was ensured. The use of temperature in screening for COVID-19 at the units was generally adhered to. Only 50% of participants used the prescribed PPEs. The physical distancing between healthcare workers and client and between clients and caregivers were not enforced; however, hand hygiene was practiced. Disinfection of working surfaces and equipment with 0.5% chlorine or 70% alcohol-based rubs were used most of the time. It was observed however that no psychological counselling was given to suspected cases or their relatives. Conclusion. Healthcare workers showed discordant response to different parts of the protocols for COVID-19 especially appropriate distancing. There was an enhanced awareness among healthcare workers and improvement in infection prevention protocols. The study also observed that as the risk of infection increased from triaging to holding area and to treatment centers, the response of healthcare workers to COVID-19 protocols also improved. Risk communication is an essential part of the COVID-19 management strategy. At the treatment centers, healthcare workers adhered to this protocol, whereas it was a major gap at the triaging and holding areas.","output":"Response of Healthcare Workers to COVID-19 Protocols after the Index Case at 37 Military Hospital, Ghana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To examine functional outcomes of post-acute care for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-three community-dwelling adults &#8805;65 years of age admitted for post-acute care from 2 SNFs from March 15, 2020, to May 30, 2020. MEASURE(S): COVID-19 status was determined from chart review. Frailty was measured with a deficit accumulation frailty index (FI), categorized into nonfrail, mild frailty, and moderate-to-severe frailty. The primary outcome was community discharge. Secondary outcomes included change in functional status from SNF admission to discharge, based on modified Barthel index (mBI) and continuous functional scale scored by physical (PT) and occupational therapists (OT). RESULTS: Among 73 admissions (31 COVID-19 negative, 42 COVID-19 positive), mean [standard deviation (SD)] age was 83.5 (8.8) and 42 (57.5%) were female, with mean FI of 0.31 (0.01) with no differences by COVID-19 status. The mean length of SNF stay for rehabilitation was 21.2 days (SD 11.1) for COVID-19 negative with 20 (64.5%) patients discharged to community, compared to 23.0 (SD 12.2) and 31 (73.8%) among patients who tested positive for COVID-19. Among those discharged to the community, all groups improved in mBI, PT, and OT score. Those with moderate-to-severe frailty (FI >0.35) had lower mBI scores on discharge [92.0 (6.7) not frail, 81.0 (15.4) mild frailty, 48.6 (20.4) moderate-to-severe frailty; P = .002], lower PT scores on discharge [54.2 (3.9) nonfrail, 51.5 (8.0) mild frailty, 37.1 (9.7) moderate-to-severe frailty; P = .002], and lower OT score on discharge [52.9 (3.2) nonfrail, 45.8 (9.4) mild frailty, 32.4 (7.4) moderate or worse frailty; P = .001].

For emerging adults, who are already at greater risk for psychopathology, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted daily routines, potentially changing sleep patterns and heightening risk factors for the emergence of affective dysregulation, and consequently mood-related disturbances. This study aimed to determine whether variability in sleep patterns across a 3-month period was associated with next-day positive and negative affect, and affective dynamics, proximal affective predictors of depressive symptoms among young adults during the pandemic. METHODS: College student participants (N=20, 65% female, Mage=19.80, SDage=1.0) wore non-invasive wearable devices (the Oura ring https://ouraring.com/) continuously for a period of 3-months, measuring sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, total sleep, and time spent in different stages of sleep (light, deep and rapid eye movement). Participants reported daily PA and NA using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule on a 0-100 scale to report on their affective state. RESULTS: Multilevel models specifying a within-subject process of the relation between sleep and affect revealed that participants with higher sleep onset latency (b= -2.98, p<.01) and sleep duration on the prior day (b= -.35, p=.01) had lower PA the next day. Participants with longer light sleep duration had lower PA (b= -.28, p=.02), whereas participants with longer deep sleep duration had higher PA (b= .36, p=.02) the next day. On days with higher total sleep, participants experienced lower NA compared to their own average (b= -.01, p=.04). Follow-up exploratory bivariate correlations revealed significant associations between light sleep duration instability and higher instability in both PA and NA, whereas higher deep sleep duration was linked with lower instability in both PA and NA (all ps< .05). In the full-length paper these analyses will be probed using linear regressions controlling for relevant covariates (main effects of sleep, sex/age/ethnicity). CONCLUSION: Sleep, an important transdiagnostic health outcome, may contribute to next-day PA and NA. Sleep patterns predict affect dynamics, which may be proximal predictors of mood disturbances.

The decentralization and resultant conflicts in disease control activities produced different protection behaviours and local government measures. In the present study, we investigated how political partisanship and socio-economic factors determined the outcome of COVID-19 at the local level in Brazil. Methods A retrospective study of COVID-19 deaths was carried out using mortality databases between Feb 2020, and Jun 2021 for the 5570 Brazilian municipalities. Socio-economic parameters including city categories, income and inequality indexes, health service quality and partisanship, assessed by the result of the second round of the 2018 Brazilian presidential elections, were included. Regression tree analysis was carried out to identify the statistical significance and conditioning relationships of variables. Findings Municipalities that supported then-candidate Jair Bolsonaro in the 2018 elections were those that had the worst COVID-19 mortality rates, mainly during the second epidemic wave of 2021. This pattern was observed even considering structural inequalities among cities. Interpretation In general, the first phase of the pandemic hit large and central cities hardest, while the second wave mostly impacted Bolsonarian municipalities, where scientific denialism among the population was stronger. Negative effects of partisanship towards the right-wing on COVID-19 outcomes counterbalances favourable socioeconomic indexes in affluent Brazilian cities. Our results underscore the fragility of public health policies which were undermined by the scientific denialism of right-wing supporters in Brazil.

Although studies have investigated the neural mechanisms of self- and other-referential processing in adolescents, the development of these mechanisms remain largely unaddressed. Here, we report a three-year longitudinal study with annual measurements, and investigate the developmental trajectories of activity and connectivity underlying self- and other-referential processes in 34 participants from early to mid-adolescence (mean age timepoints 1, 2, 3= 12.9, 13.9, 15.0 years). Moreover, we probe whether these correlates continue to develop from mid-adolescence to young adulthood by comparing neural correlates of the adolescents at the last measurement to an independent group of 42 young adults (mean age 22 years). Participants underwent functional MRI while performing a trait judgement task in which they indicated whether an adjective described themselves, a similar or a dissimilar peer. Brain activity within the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) and right temporal parietal junction (TPJ) showed a quadratic change from early to mid-adolescence, with a peak in activity at the second measurement when evaluating the self, the similar and dissimilar peer. No differential activity was observed when comparing the adolescents to young adults. Functional connectivity did not change from early to mid-adolescence, however, connectivity of the dMPFC with a posterior midline region during self- and other-referential processing relative to the control condition reduced from mid-adolescence to young adulthood. Together, these findings provide insight in the developmental trajectories of brain activity and connectivity underlying the development of the self-concept and representations of peers in adolescence.","output":"Development of the neural correlates of self- and other-referential processing across adolescence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Last week, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that the predicted overdose death count for the 12\\\\month period ending April 2021 is more than 100,000.

For them the coronavirus is an enemy that should be defeated as a part of ones job. They do, however, also have a daily life with family while doing their work obligations. The purpose of this study was to gain an in-depth understanding of the frontline healthcare professionals experience of balancing work life and family life during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A sample of 22 frontline healthcare professionals caring for patients with COVID-19 was included and interviewed individually from May to August 2020. Ricoeurs phenomenological hermeneutical philosophy inspired the methodology in this study. Result: Frontline healthcare professionals treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are, voluntarily or involuntarily, forced to be ready to change departments as well as being ready to face the unknown coronavirus. The frontline work leads to feelings of being abandoned among their families and friends due to the threat of bringing the infection home and spreading the virus. Although healthcare professionals are facing a working life filled with uncertainty and unpredictability impacting their family life, they express opposing feelings of being a part of something bigger. Conclusion: The work life balance for these healthcare professionals is threatened by changes in professional responsibilities, working hours and shifts. Fear of bringing the infection home challenges them ethically and creates a distance between healthcare professionals and their families, leading to a conflict within the individual if their work on the frontline is worth it - or if it is a too high price to pay.

In the dermatological setting, patients with stable plaque psoriasis on maintenance therapy with biological drugs may be suitable candidates for telemedicine, although their preference for telemedicine has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the preference for telemedicine versus in-person visit among patients with psoriasis receiving biological drugs and the reported reasons behind their preferences. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis in stable clinical remission (Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI] &#8804; 3 for at least 12 months) receiving maintenance biological therapy answered a survey investigating whether they would choose telemedicine or in-person visit for the next scheduled visit and the reasons behind their preference. The survey was undertaken through a questionnaire that was developed according to a structured process. RESULTS: Of the 246 participants in the survey, 118 (48%) preferred telemedicine over an in-person visit for their next scheduled visit with a dermatologist. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that previous experience with digital video-communication tools was a significant predictor for the preference for telemedicine (odds ratio [OR] 10.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.61-32.03), while older age (< 60 years) was negatively associated with the preference for telemedicine (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.10-0.90). The most common reasons (75%) for preferring telemedicine were saving time and safety in relation to the risk presented by the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic (38%). In contrast, 56% of the patients who preferred the in-person visit option declared that they were unable to use video-communication tools.

Variance in protein sequence might lead to change in protein structure and interaction, then further affect the viral physiological characteristics, which could bring tremendous influence on the pandemic. In this study, we investigated 20 non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome which incidence rates were all &#8805;1% as of September 1st, 2020, then modeled and analyzed the mutant protein structures. The results showed that four types of mutations caused dramatic changes in protein structures (RMSD &#8805;5.0 ?), which were Q57H and G251V in open reading frames 3a (ORF3a), S194L and R203K/G204R in nucleocapsid (N). Next, we found that these mutations also affected the binding affinity of intraviral protein interactions. In addition, the hot spots within these docking mutant complexes were altered, among which the mutation Q57H was involved in both Orf3a-S and Orf3a-Orf8 protein interactions. Besides, these mutations were widely distributed all over the world, and their occurrences fluctuated as time went on. Notably, the incidences of R203K/G204R in N and Q57H in Orf3a were both over 50% in some countries. Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mutations could change viral protein structure, binding affinity and hot spots of the interface, thereby might have impacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.

However, no scholars have explained the mechanism from the perspective of hemodynamics. Two patients were clinically selected; their angiography showed 70% coronary stenosis, and the FFRs were 0.7 (patient 1) and 0.95 (patient 2). The FFR non-invasive computational model of the two patients was constructed by a 0C3D coupled multiscaled model, in order to verify that the model can accurately calculate the FFR results. Virtual bypass surgery was performed on these two stenoses, and a CABG multiscaled model was constructed. The flow rate of the graft and the stenosis coronary artery, as well as the wall shear stress (WSS) and the oscillatory shear index (OSI) in the graft were calculated. The non-invasive calculation results of FFR are 0.67 and 0.91, which are close to the clinical results, which proves that our model is accurate. According to the CABG model, the flow ratios of the stenosis coronary artery to the graft of patient 1 and patient 2 were 0.12 and 0.42, respectively. The time-average wall shear stress (TAWSS) results of patient 1 and patient 2 grafts were 2.09 and 2.16 Pa, respectively, and WSS showed uniform distribution on the grafts. The OSI results of patients 1 and 2 grafts were 0.0375 and 0.1264, respectively, and a significantly high OSI region appeared at the anastomosis of patient 2. The FFR value of the stenosis should be considered when performing bypass surgery. When the stenosis of high FFR values is grafted, a high OSI region is created at the graft, especially at the anastomosis.

This paper describes a panel of lentiviral pseudotypes bearing the spike (S) proteins for each of the seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs), generated under similar conditions optimized for high titre production allowing a high-throughput investigation of antibody neutralization breadth. Optimal production conditions and most readily available permissive target cell lines were determined for spike-mediated entry by each HCoV pseudotype: SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 best transduced HEK293T/17 cells transfected with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV preferentially entered HUH7 cells, and CHO cells were most permissive for the seasonal betacoronavirus HCoV-HKU1. Entry of ACE2 using pseudotypes was enhanced by ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in target cells, whilst TMPRSS2 transfection rendered HEK293T/17 cells permissive for HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 entry. Additionally, pseudotype viruses were produced bearing additional coronavirus surface proteins, including the SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) and Membrane (M) proteins and HCoV-OC43/HCoV-HKU1 Haemagglutinin-Esterase (HE) proteins.

Therefore, this study was designed to determine the critical role of physical evaluation self-efficacy in the path of perceived exercise benefit and perceived severity of disease and weakness affecting the amount of exercise of college students. Methods: By means of Physical Fitness Health Belief of College Students Scale and Physical Activity Rating Scale (PARS-3), 801 undergraduate students were investigated in this study. Results: (1) When perceived exercise benefit, exercise self-efficacy, and severity of perceived disease and weakness predicted the amount of exercise separately, the first two have a positive effect on the amount of exercise, but the latter has no effect. However, when these three factors entered the regression equation at the same time, the perceived severity of disease and weakness had a negative effect on the amount of exercise. (2) The influence of physical evaluation self-efficacy on the college students' the amount of exercise was bigger than benefit of perceived exercise and the perceived severity of disease and weakness in both separated and simultaneous comparison conditions.

We explored the type and nature of patient safety incidents in French primary care settings during the COVID-19 first wave to make tentative recommendations for improvement. Methods. A national patient safety incident reporting survey was distributed to General Practitioners (GPs) in France on April 28, 2020. Reports were coded using a classification system aligned to the WHO International Classification for Patient Safety (incident types, contributing factors, incident outcomes and severity of harm). Analysis involved data coding, processing, iterative generation of data summaries using descriptive statistical and thematic analysis. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04346121. Results. Of 132 incidents, 58 (44%) related to delayed diagnosis, assessments and referrals. Cancellations of appointments, hospitalizations or procedures was reported in 22 (17%) of these incidents. Home confinement-related incidents accounted for 15 (10%) reports, and inappropriate stopping of medications for five (4%). Patients delayed attending or did not consult their general practitioner or other healthcare providers due to their fear of contracting COVID-19 infection at an in-person visit in 26 (10%) incidents, or fear of burdening their GPs in eight (3%) incidents.

OUTCOMES: The SFCS enrolled 16 students, was supported by 13 faculty members, and produced 87 peer-reviewed evidence syntheses. Of the 16 SFCS students, 13 (81%) completed evaluations; of 128 Stanford Primary Care and Population Health clinicians, 48 (38%) completed evaluations. Overall student satisfaction with the SFCS was 4.9/5 (standard deviation [SD] 0.3). Self-assessed achievement of SFCS learning objectives exceeded 90% for all objectives. Overall faculty satisfaction with the SFCS was 4.4/5 (SD 0.8). Most faculty (40/46 [87%]) planned to use the database to answer future COVID-19 questions. NEXT STEPS: The SFCS is a novel, student-initiated VAME curriculum focused on increasing students' meaningful contributions to patient care. The authors will track SFCS students throughout their clerkships to gauge clerkship performance/preparedness, and they will develop training for integrating VAME into preclerkship curricula at other institutions. Given its adaptive, student-driven design, the VAME framework used to develop the SFCS empowers students to create their own personalized, experiential learning.","output":"Implementing Value-Added Medical Education: Lessons Learned From the Student-Initiated \\"Stanford Frontline\\" COVID-19 Consult Service"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In developing countries, overweight among children becomes an alarming problem and a health concern Obesity is a factor in disease severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) having the greatest impact on patients AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of overweight in some of the Egyptian governmental primary school children, its nutritional and socioeconomic determinants Special focus was directed to identify the current dietary practices including risky nutritional habits of overweight children as a weak point leading to increasing their vulnerability to catching COVID-19 infection METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on primary school children aged 6C12 years General demographic data, socioeconomic data, dietary pattern, intake of a diversity of nutrient-rich food versus calorie-dense food, and anthropometrical data were collected RESULTS: Of 1600 child, there were 8% overweight who are considered at risk of COVID-19 infection Considering the weekly share of the stomach, only one-third of the food consumed by overweight children is nutrient-rich, with high consumption of French fries and Candies (once per day among 95% and 78 % of overweight children, respectively) Moreover, 90% of them consume sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) more than once per day The majority of overweight children belonged to small, middle-income families, and had illiterate or read and write mothers CONCLUSION: Overweight children eat narrow diversity of nutrient-rich food that includes vegetables, fruits, protein, and dairy products They eat more calorie-dense foods, every day The increase of family income increased the likelihood of having overweight children with a high intake of SSB, candies, and chips;consumption of snacks between meals and before sleep Protective predictors against overweight were highly educated mothers, taking breakfast before school, having dinner, and taking meals on time RECOMMENDATION: Nutritional behavioral education aiming at choosing nutritious and varied options of food that is effective for improving childrens nutritional status is the key to decreasing vulnerability toward COVID 19","output":"Vulnerability and weaknesses of eating habits of overweight school children as an entry risk for covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research suggests there could be an increase in the number of COVID-19-related psychosis episodes during the pandemic outbreak This case series outlines the clinical presentation of first-onset psychosis in three older adults and their treatment in the 30?days following their initial admission The authors postulate that these COVID-19-related psychoses are qualitatively different to psychoses prior to the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"First-onset psychosis in older adults: social isolation influence during COVID pandemic C a UK case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laminarin is an abundant algal polysaccharide that serves as carbon storage and fuel to meet the nutrition demands of heterotrophic microbes. Laminarin depolymerization catalyzed by microbial extracellular enzymes initiates remineralization, a key process in ocean biogeochemical cycles. Here, we described a glycoside hydrolase 16 (GH16) family laminarinase from a marine algae-associated flavobacterium at the biochemical and structural levels. We found that the endolytic enzyme cleaved laminarin with a preference for -1,3-glycoside linkages and showed transglycosylation activity across a broad range of acceptors. We also solved and compared high-resolution crystal structures of laminarinase in the apo form and in complex with -1,3-tetrasaccharides, revealing an expanded catalytic cleft formed following substrate binding. Moreover, structure and mutagenesis studies identified multiple specific contacts between the enzyme and glucosyl residues essential for the substrate specificity for -1,3-glucan. These results provide novel insights into the structural requirements for substrate binding and catalysis of GH16 family laminarinase, enriching our understanding of bacterial utilization of algal laminarin.IMPORTANCE Heterotrophic bacterial communities are key players in marine biogeochemical cycling due to their ability to remineralize organic carbon. Processing of complex organic matter requires heterotrophic bacteria to produce extracellular enzymes with precise specificity to depolymerize substrates to sizes sufficiently small for uptake. Thus, extracellular enzymatic hydrolysis initiates microbe-driven heterotrophic carbon cycling. In this study, based on biochemical and structural analyses, we revealed the depolymerization mechanism of -1, 3-glucan, a carbon reserve in algae, by laminarinase from an alga-associated marine flavobacterium. The findings provide new insights into the substrate recognition and catalysis of bacterial laminarinase and promote a better understanding of how extracellular enzymes are involved in organic matter cycling.","output":"Molecular basis for substrate recognition and catalysis by a marine bacterial laminarinase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although rapid phenotypic evolution has been documented often, the genomic basis of rapid adaptation to natural environments is largely unknown in multicellular organisms. Population genomic studies of experimental populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) provide a unique opportunity to study this phenomenon. Guppy populations that were transplanted from high-predation (HP) to low-predation (LP) environments have been shown to evolve toward the phenotypes of naturally colonized LP populations in as few as eight generations. These changes persist in common garden experiments, indicating that they have a genetic basis. Here, we report results of whole genome variation in four experimental populations colonizing LP sites along with the corresponding HP source population. We examined genome-wide patterns of genetic variation to estimate past demography and used a combination of genome scans, forward simulations, and a novel analysis of allele frequency change vectors to uncover the signature of selection. We detected clear signals of population growth and bottlenecks at the genome-wide level that matched the known history of population numbers. We found a region on chromosome 15 under strong selection in three of the four populations and with our multivariate approach revealing subtle parallel changes in allele frequency in all four populations across this region. Investigating patterns of genome-wide selection in this uniquely replicated experiment offers remarkable insight into the mechanisms underlying rapid adaptation, providing a basis for comparison with other species and populations experiencing rapidly changing environments.","output":"Rapid genomic convergent evolution in experimental populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Metastatic disease caused by prostate cancer (PCa) is the principal cause of PCa-related mortality. Long non-protein-coding RNAs may possess significant cellular functions. Plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1), a long non-coding RNA encoded by the human PVT1 gene, is an oncogene, which can regulate several tumor-related genes. In PCa, the function and mechanism of PVT1 are unclear. NOP2 is being pursued as a prognostic marker for cancer aggressiveness, which promotes mouse fibroblast growth and tumor formation. Essentially, nothing is known about the specific interactions between the PVT1 and NOP2. Methods 190 pairs of PCa tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected and RNA sequencing was used to identify the differential lncRNAs. Real-time quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) confirmed these results and gene regulatory relationship. Lentiviral vectors were used to alter PVT1 and genes to analyze their effects on PCa progression. Transwell migration and invasion assays were performed to test the metastasis ability. Biofunction of PVT1 and NOP2 were confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Results In this study, we reported that the long noncoding RNA-PVT1 was upregulated in PCa metastasis tissues and promoted migration of PCa cells in vitro and their metastasis in vivo. High levels of PVT1 significantly downregulated tumor suppressor microRNAs (miRNAs), such as miR-15b-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-143-3p, and miR-627-5p, whose levels in metastasis tissues were low compared to those in non-metastasis tissues. In vitro and in vivo, PVT1 promotes PCa metastasis via targeting miRNAs. Furthermore, the expression level of PVT1 was positively associated with the expression of NOP2, a cancer metastasis-related protein. We demonstrated that NOP2 promoted invasion and migration of PCa. For specific mechanism, correlation analysis showed that PVT1 promoted metastasis by up-regulating NOP2. Conclusion Taken together, our results show that PVT1 acts as an inducer of PCa metastasis via targeting miRNAs, thereby promoting NOP2. This axis may have diagnostic and therapeutic potential for advanced PCa.","output":"Long Noncoding RNA PVT1 Promotes Prostate Cancer Metastasis by Increasing NOP2 Expression via Targeting Tumor Suppressor MicroRNAs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Contexte: Le COVID-19 est une pidmie mondiale de croissance rapide Objectifs Nous avons tudi l'incidence des arythmies cardiaques dans une cohorte fran?aise de patients implants de dfibrillateur automatique implantable (DAI) pendant les cinq premiers mois de 2020 Mthode: 5954 patients implants d'un DAI suivis en tl cardiologie ont t analyss pendant la premire partie de l'pidmie de COVID-19 (du 1er janvier au 31 mai 2020) Les donnes ont t automatiquement extraites en utilisant la plate-forme de tl-cardiologie Implicty Pour l'ensemble des patients, le type d'arythmie (fibrillation atriale, tachycardie ventriculaire ou fibrillation ventriculaire), le nombre d'pisodes d'arythmie ventriculaire, et le type de thrapie dlivre par le DAI ont t recueillis Rsultats: Au total, 472 (7 9%) patients ont prsent 4917 pisodes d'arythmie ventriculaire Une augmentation de l'incidence des arythmies ventriculaires a t observe aprs le premier cas de COVID-19 en France et particulirement pendant les semaines 10 et 11, au moment des principales mesures gouvernementales Une lvation de l'incidence de stimulation antitachycardique dlivre par le DAI a galement t observe pendant cette priode Pendant la semaine numro 11, avant le dbut du confinement, on met en vidence une corrlation entre le pourcentage d'information ddi au COVID-19 sur les cha?nes d'information tlvise et l'incidence des arythmies ventriculaires Pendant le confinement, l'incidence des arythmies ventriculaires a diminu de fa?on significative compare  la priode avant confinement (0 050 7 vs 0 091 2 pisodes par patient par semaine, p&lt;0 001) Aucune corrlation n'est observe entre l'incidence des arythmies ventriculaires et l'incidence de nombre de cas de COVID-19 Aucun changement n'a t observ concernant l'incidence des arythmies supraventriculaires pendant cette priode Conclusion: Une augmentation de l'incidence des arythmies ventriculaires est observe dans les deux semaines avant le confinement, au moment des principales mesures gouvernementales Pendant le confinement, l'incidence des arythmies ventriculaires a significativement diminu Summary Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a fast-growing worldwide pandemic Aims: We aimed to investigate the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias among a large French cohort of implantable cardioverter defibrillator recipients over the first 5 months of 2020 Methods: 5954 implantable cardioverter defibrillator recipients were followed by remote monitoring during the COVID-19 period (from 01 January to 31 May 2020) Data were obtained from automated remote follow-up of implantable cardioverter defibrillators utilizing the Implicity? platform For all patients, the type of arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation), the number of ventricular arrhythmia episodes and the type of implantable cardioverter defibrillator-delivered therapy were recorded Results: A total of 472 (7 9%) patients presented 4917 ventricular arrhythmia events An increase in ventricular arrhythmia incidence was observed after the first COVID-19 case in France, and especially during weeks #10 and #11, at the time of major governmental measures, with an increase in the incidence of antitachycardia pacing delivered therapy During the 11 weeks before the lockdown order, the curve of the percentage of live-stream television coverage of COVID-19 information matched the ventricular arrhythmia incidence During the lockdown, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia decreased significantly compared with baseline (0 05  0 7 vs 0 09  1 2 episodes per patient per week, respectively;P &lt; 0 001) Importantly, no correlation was observed between ventricular arrhythmia incidence and the curve of COVID-19 incidence No changes were observed regarding atrial fibrillation/atrial tachycardia episodes over time Conclusions: An increase in ventricular arrhythmia incidence was observed in the 2 weeks before the lockdown order, at the time of major governmental measures Ventricular arrhythmia incidence decreased dramatically during the lockdown","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in implantable cardioverter defibrillator recipients followed by remote monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Foodborne illnesses associated with contaminated fresh produce are a common public health problem and there is an upward trend of outbreaks caused by enteric viruses, especially human noroviruses (HNoVs) and hepatitis A virus (HAV).

Hence, in this study, we focused on the patients from an isolated area, investigated the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of four serial passages of the virus. METHODS: From January 25 to February 29, 2020, all patient data on the SARS-CoV-2 passages in this isolated area were traced, and the patients were grouped according to the passaging of SARS-CoV-2. Clinical characteristics of patients, including laboratory, radiology, treatment and outcomes, were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients with four passages of virus transmission were included in this study. One patient transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to 8 patients (passage 2, P2), who next infected 23 patients (passage 3, P3), and then 46 patients (passage 4, P4). P2 received antiviral treatment when they had symptom, whereas P4 received antiviral treatment during their asymptomatic period. The incubation periods for P2, P3 and P4 patients were 7 days (IQR:2C12), 8 days (IQR:4C13) and 10 days (IQR:7C15), respectively. P2 patients showed lymphocytopenia (0.79  10(9)/L), decreased lymphocyte percentages (12.15%), increased white blood cell count (6.51  10(9)/L), increased total bilirubin levels (25% of P2 patients), increased C-reactive protein levels (100% of P2 patients) and abnormal liver function. By chest CT scans, all P2 patients (100%), 15 of P3 patients (65.22%) and 16 of P4 patients (34.78%) showed abnormality with typical feature of ground glass opacity. All of P2 patients (100%) received oxygen therapy, and in contrast, 19 of P4 patients (41.3%) received oxygen therapy. Further, significant decreased nucleic acid positive periods was found in P4 group (16 days, IQR: 10C23), compared with that of P2 group (22 days, IQR: 16C27).

However, synthesis and full investigation from preclinical studies to phase III trials of new medications is a time-consuming procedure, and not viable in a global emergency, such as the one we are facing. MAIN BODY: Drug repurposing/repositioning, a strategy effectively employed in cancer treatment, can represent a valid alternative. Most drugs considered for repurposing/repositioning in the therapy of the COVID-19 outbreak are commercially available and their dosage and toxicity in humans is well known, due to years (or even decades) of clinical use. This can allow their fast-track evaluation in phase IICIII clinical trials, or even within straightforward compassionate use. Several drugs being re-considered for COVID-19 therapy are or have been used in cancer therapy. Indeed, virus-infected cells are pushed to enhance the synthesis of nucleic acids, protein and lipid synthesis and boost their energy metabolism, in order to comply to the viral program. Indeed, the same features are seen in cancer cells, making it likely that drugs interfering with specific cancer cell pathways may be effective as well in defeating viral replication.

Its use rapidly expanded thereafter to include human medical treatments for a variety of acute and chronic disorders. Due to reports of severe adverse effects, the US Food and Drug Administration withdrew levamisole's approval for human use in 2000; however, medical options outside the US and illicit options worldwide allow continued accessibility to levamisole. The compound is rapidly metabolized in the body, with at least two known active metabolites. Levamisole has a broad range of immunomodulatory effects, including both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on immune responses. It is generally well tolerated at therapeutic concentrations, although a variety of autoimmune-related adverse effects have been reported, including agranulocytosis, leukopenia, purpura, and visible necrotized skin tissue. Individuals with levamisole-compromised immune systems are more susceptible to infections, including COVID-19. Since the early 2000's, levamisole has been frequently used as an adulterating agent in illicit street drugs, especially cocaine, fentanyl, and heroin. Although its prevalence has varied over time and geographically, levamisole has been detected in up to 79% of the street supply of cocaine at levels up to 74% by weight. Its presence in illicit drug markets also raises concern over the potential for exposure of children and neonates, although this is supported by only limited anecdotal evidence. Levamisole is not currently included in routine drug testing panels, although a variety of confirmatory testing techniques exist across a range of antemortem and postmortem specimen options.

Subcellular localization demonstrated that GhirNAC2 was located in the nucleus. Co-suppression of GhirNAC2 in cotton led to larger stomata aperture, elevated water loss and finally reduced transgenic plants tolerance to drought stress. Furthermore, the endogenous ABA content was significantly lower in GhirNAC2-suppressed transgenic plant leaves compared to wild type. in vivo and in vitro studies showed that GhirNAC2 directly binds to the promoter of GhNCED3a/3c, key genes in ABA biosynthesis, which were both down-regulated in GhirNAC2-suppressed transgenic lines. Transient silencing of GhNCED3a/3c also significantly reduced the resistance to drought stress in cotton plants. However, ectopic expression of GhirNAC2 in tobacco significantly enhanced seed germination, root growth and plant survival under drought stress.

The paper aims to identify the most important aspects of the system, as well as the most vulnerable ones and the extent to which the system meets the sustainability requirements of the society. The Balanced Scorecard approach is used to ensure that the system remains sustainable and resilient. The indicators to measure the aspects of this design are developed. A Quality Function Deployment approach is used to identify the extent to which a designed system satisfies the sustainability requirements of the society. The problem is formulated as an engineering design problem in which the customer requirements are presented using a sustainability Triple Bottom Line framework. The results indicate that a well-designed engineering education system is capable of addressing the majority of the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) identified by the United Nations.

Here, we examined whether data collected from an initial pandemic wave could be informative, for the need to implement non-pharmaceutical measures in any resurgent wave. Drawing from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in 10 states in the USA, we calibrated simple mathematical models of influenza transmission dynamics to data for virologically confirmed hospitalisations during the initial spring wave. We then projected pandemic outcomes (cumulative hospitalisations) during the fall wave, and compared these projections with data. Model results show reasonable agreement for all states that reported a substantial number of cases in the spring wave. Using this model we propose a probabilistic decision framework that can be used to determine the need for pre-emptive measures such as postponing school openings, in advance of a fall wave.

Therefore, it is crucial to better understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in this age-group. Objective: The objective was to investigate and compare the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in three age groups (1C6 years, 7C10 years, 11C19 years) and to examine the associations with psychological factors. Methods: An anonymous online survey was conducted from 9 April to 11 May 2020 during the acute phase of major lockdown measures. In this cross-sectional study, children and adolescents aged between 1 and 19 years were recruited as a population-based sample. They were eligible if they were residents in Austria, Germany, Liechtenstein or Switzerland, were parents/caregivers of a child aged between 1 and 10 years or adolescents 11 years, had sufficient German language skills and provided informed consent. Results: Among 5823 participants, between 2.2% and 9.9% reported emotional and behavioural problems above the clinical cut-off and between 15.3% and 43.0% reported an increase in these problems during the pandemic. Significant age-related effects were found regarding the type and frequency of problems (2(4)50.2, P  0.001). While preschoolers (1C6 years) had the largest increase in oppositional-defiant behaviours, adolescents reported the largest increase in emotional problems.

There are no current therapeutic approaches with the ability to excise large multi-exon duplications, leaving this patient cohort without mutation-specific treatment. Using CRISPR/Cas9 could provide a valid alternative to achieve targeted excision of genomic duplications of any size. Here we show that the expression of a single CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease targeting a genomic region within a DMD duplication can restore the production of wild-type dystrophin in vitro. We assessed the extent of dystrophin repair following both constitutive and transient nuclease expression by either transducing DMD patient-derived myoblasts with integrating lentiviral vectors or electroporating them with CRISPR/Cas9 expressing plasmids. Comparing genomic, transcript and protein data, we observed that both continuous and transient nuclease expression resulted in approximately 50% dystrophin protein restoration in treated myoblasts. Our data demonstrate that a high transient expression profile of Cas9 circumvents its requirement of continuous expression within the cell for targeting DMD duplications. This proof-of-concept study therefore helps progress towards a clinically relevant gene editing strategy for in vivo dystrophin restoration, by highlighting important considerations for optimizing future therapeutic approaches.","output":"Transiently expressed CRISPR/Cas9 induces wild-type dystrophin in vitro in DMD patient myoblasts carrying duplications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleic acid aptamers show clear promise as diagnostic reagents, as highly specific strands were reported against a large variety of biomarkers.

SGIV is a highly infectious DNA virus that causes a massive loss in marine aquaculture. Ectopic expression of VP88GFP, a fusion between green fluorescent protein and the envelope protein VP088, did not compromise the ES cell properties and susceptibility to SGIV infection. Although VP88GFP disperses evenly in the cytoplasm of non-infected cells, it undergoes aggregation and redistribution in SGIV-infected cells. Real-time visualization revealed multiple key stages of VP88GFP redistribution and the dynamics of viral assembly site (VAS).

We present a rare case of spontaneous pneumothorax from rupture of lung bulla as a late sequela from COVID-19 pneumonia and superinfection of the bulla by R. Planticola. Case: A 37-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with a sudden onset of sharp right-sided chest pain and shortness of breath after an episode of dry cough. One month before the presentation, he was tested positive for COVID-19, with the only symptom being dry cough, without hospitalization or treatment. He works in construction, never smoked. On arrival, he was in respiratory distress with tachypnea. Chest radiograph revealed subcutaneous emphysema and right-sided pneumothorax with large bleb at the right mid lung field. An emergent pigtail catheter tube was placed with the resolution of pneumothorax. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from nasopharyngeal swab detected infection by COVID-19. Serologic workup revealed leukocytosis and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 34 mm/hr. Computed tomography (CT) showed (Image) large right-sided bulla, bilateral patchy infiltrates. Sputum analysis was negative for bacteria, fungi, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. Further workup was negative for eosinophilia, aspergillus, autoimmune diseases, and HIV. His symptoms and leukocytosis improved without needing antibiotics or steroids. Later the chest tube was removed and was discharged. Post-discharge follow-up in the pulmonary clinic, he complained of hemoptysis and was referred to the ED. Repeat CT revealed patchy ground-glass opacities, new bullae in the left lung, and resolving right lung bulla with fluid and debris in the dependent portion, which led to suspect pneumonia and bullous infection. Sputum culture grew R. Planticola, resistant to ampicillin;he was started on amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with improvement in symptoms and was subsequently discharged.

In this review, the antioxidant proprieties of several natural products with potential for treatment of CID in human and veterinary medicine are highlighted. Unfortunately, few clinical trials report the use of these products for treating CID in humans and none in animals. ABSTRACT: Chronic intestinal disorders (CID) are characterized by persistent, or recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) signs present for at least three weeks. In human medicine, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic GI diseases and includes Crohns disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). On the other hand, the general term chronic enteropathies (CE) is preferred in veterinary medicine. Different therapeutic approaches to these diseases are used in both humans and pets. This review is focused on the use of traditional therapies and nutraceuticals with specific antioxidant properties, for the treatment of CID in humans and animal patients. There is strong evidence of the antioxidant properties of the nutraceuticals included in this review, but few studies report their use for treating CID in humans and none in animals.

active compounds in LJF In all, 94 potential targets were recognized, including IL6, TNF, PTGS2, APP, F2, and GRM5 The pathways revealed that the possible targets of LJF involved in the regulation of the IL-17 signalling pathway Then, in vivo experiments indicated that LJF decreased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6) in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, decreased the levels of oxidative stress factors (MDA and MPO) and increased the activities of SOD and GSH-Px in lung tissue The RNA-Seq results revealed that 7811, 775 and 3654 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Ctrl (control group), ALI-LJF (Lonicerae japonicae flos group) and ALI-DXSM (dexamethasone group), respectively KEGG pathway analysis showed that the DEGs associated with immune response and inflammation signalling pathways and the IL-17 signalling pathway were significantly enriched in LJF Compared with those in ALI, the expression of CXCL2, CXCL1, CXCL6, NFKBIA, IFNG, IL6, IL17A, IL17F, IL17C, MMP9 and TNFAIP3, which are involved in the IL-17 signalling pathway, were significantly decreased in the LJF group according to the qRT-PCR analyses Conclusions In view of the network

high-quality academic performance with less fear The survey was conducted on 94 nursing college students in J City, South Korea, from June 27 to June 30, 2020 The State Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1975) was employed online Result: The findings showed that there was a significant difference (t=12 113, p= 000) in anxiety between face-to-face (53 059 41/80) and non-face-to-face class groups (37 467 63/80) That of face-to-face was 1 41 times higher than that of non-face-to-face There were significant differences with regards to class preference (t=12 113, p= 000) and gender (t=12 113, p= 000) only in the face-to-face but not in the non-face-to-face group The non-face-to-face preferred group had scored 1 22 times higher than the other group and females had scored 1 19 times higher than the males These results were highly significant (t=13 958, p= 000) in the high anxiety than low anxiety group in both classes The score above 40 in the high anxiety group (54 667 215) of the face-to-face was 1 86 times higher than in the low group (29 334 131) 93 62% belonged to the high anxiety group in the face-to-face group Factors affecting anxiety were class preference (=- 546, p= 001) and gender

We aimed to evaluate the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using a mixed-methods design. METHODS: This longitudinal study drew from a preexisting sample of 957 adults living in Soweto, a major township near Johannesburg. Psychological assessments were administered across two waves between August 2019 and March 2020 and during the first 6 weeks of the lockdown (late March-early May 2020). Interviews on COVID-19 experiences were administered in the second wave. Multiple regression models examined relationships between perceived COVID-19 risk and depression. RESULTS: Full data on perceived COVID-19 risk, depression, and covariates were available in 221 adults. In total, 14.5% of adults were at risk for depression. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk predicted greater depressive symptoms (p < 0.001), particularly among adults with histories of childhood trauma, though this effect was marginally significant (p = 0.063). Adults were about two times more likely to experience significant depressive symptoms for every one unit increase in perceived COVID-19 risk (p = 0.021; 95% CI 1.10-3.39). Qualitative data identified potent experiences of anxiety, financial insecurity, fear of infection, and rumination. CONCLUSIONS: Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection is associated with greater depressive symptoms during the first 6 weeks of quarantine.

New drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are in urgent need. Considering the long development time for new drugs, the identification of promising inhibitors from FDA-approved drugs is an imperative and valuable strategy. Recent studies have shown that the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 utilize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the receptor to infect human cells. METHODS: We combined molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to identify potential inhibitors for ACE2 from available commercial medicines. We also designed coronavirus pseudoparticles that contain the spike protein assembled onto green fluorescent protein or luciferase reporter gene-carrying vesicular stomatitis virus core particles. RESULTS: We found that thymoquinone, a phytochemical compound obtained from the plant Nigella sativa, is a potential drug candidate. SPR analysis confirmed the binding of thymoquinone to ACE2. We found that thymoquinone can inhibit SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and NL63 pseudoparticles infecting HEK293-ACE2 cells, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 4.999, 7.598, and 6.019 M, respectively.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective, blinded, randomized study. ANIMALS Ninety-three healthy mixed breed cats. METHODS After premedication with intramuscular acepromazine (0.05 mg kg(-1)) and buprenorphine (0.01 mg kg(-1)), cats were randomly allocated to receive either propofol (Group P) or alfaxalone (Group A) for induction of anaesthesia. Following endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane vaporized in oxygen. The quality of induction, physiological parameters throughout anaesthesia and the duration of both surgery and anaesthesia were recorded. The level of ambient noise, recovery times, number of attempts to stand, reaction of the cat to touch 15 minutes after extubation, and other relevant characteristics of the recovery period were noted and a video recording of the recovery was made. The videos were assessed by a second, blinded anaesthetist, using simple descriptive and visual analogue scales. RESULTS No statistically significant differences between groups with respect to preoperative data, premedication, surgery, anaesthesia and recovery times and scores were observed. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of patients paddling and trembling on recovery in Group A (p = 0.032) even though there was no statistically significant difference in the level of ambient noise in the recovery ward or in the overall quality of recovery. CONCLUSIONS Both propofol and alfaxalone provide good recovery characteristics in premedicated cats undergoing short procedures in clinical settings.

The responses of 112 gynecologists representing all U.S. regions and several other countries were analyzed. Results: In response to the pandemic, almost all providers' institutions took action to increase social-distancing efforts (99.1%) and to encourage use of personal protective equipment (95.5%). Furthermore, 75.5% of institutions cancelled elective surgeries and 80% started utilizing telemedicine. Practice volume dropped by 27% among respondents, and 64% felt that patients were delaying needed care. The gynecologic diagnosis felt to be most impacted by COVID-19 secondary to delays in care was pelvic pain. The pandemic accelerated implementation of telemedicine, and, interestingly, 65% of providers reported that they would continue to use telemedicine 25% of the time going forward.

METHODS We used a systematic approach to retrieve and extract data about relevant studies. We identified 2248 citations, of which 21 studies met criteria for inclusion; 20 studies were randomized controlled trials, and 1 was a controlled clinical trial. The following information and communication technologies were evaluated: websites (5 studies), computer software (3 studies), Web-based workshops (2 studies), computerized decision support systems (2 studies), electronic educational game (1 study), email (2 studies), and multifaceted interventions that consisted of at least one information and communication technology component (6 studies). RESULTS Website studies demonstrated significant improvements in perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, but not for knowledge, reducing barriers, and intention to use clinical practice guidelines. Computer software studies demonstrated significant improvements in perceived usefulness, but not for knowledge and skills. Web-based workshop and email studies demonstrated significant improvements in knowledge, perceived usefulness, and skills. An electronic educational game intervention demonstrated a significant improvement from baseline in knowledge after 12 and 24 weeks.

Three findings are particularly noteworthy. First, health and economic risk experiences are primarily located in different horizontal segments of the employment structure. Perceived health risks are highest for the classes based on the interpersonal work logic, whereas the independent classes and the technical classes experience higher economic risks. Second, risk experience among wage earners is vertically stratified. In each horizontal segment, members of the lower classes report significantly higher health and economic risks than the upper classes. Third, although health and economic risks have their centres in different horizontal segments, the risks overlap among production and service workers at the lower end of the employment structure;thus, amplifying pre-existing class inequalities.","output":"Covid-19, social class and work experience in Germany: inequalities in work-related health and economic risks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although Vaccines seem like the first ray of hope in a long time, it is still far too early to assume that this pandemic calamity is over. The corona virus is a persistent and highly contagious disease which can evolve faster than most self-acclaimed SoundCloud Rappers dying careers. Fortunately, computed tomography (CT) and X-Ray chest images have been proven to be very effective in diagnosing pneumonia. Although, CT scans are more accurate, they are slower, less available and more expensive than X-Ray. Chest X-Ray diagnosis requires a highly experienced medical expert, though. The popularity of Deep Learning has been sky rocketing ever since 2012s ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). Accordingly, deep learning techniques can provide an alternate computer aided diagnosis given that enough data is available for the machine learning process. This paper proposes 2 early COVID19 diagnosis deep learning models through transfer learning using frontal X-ray Chest Images, one for binary (as COVID19 and Normal) and another for multi-class (as COVID19, Normal and Viral Pneumonia) classification. The models are proposed after a comparative study on the performance of several state of the art Convolutional Neural Networks is made on both classification types. The images quality is first enhanced with Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) algorithm and augmented. After having its Hyper Parameter optimized, each model is fine tuned to fit the data. The recall, precision, specificity, f1 Score, and accuracy are used to evaluated the performance of the models. The results indicate that the fined tuned VGG16 performed the best in multi-class classification with 96.7% and 97.8% COVID19 f1 score and testing accuracy respectively. In binary classification, ResNet50 displayed superior results with COVID19 f1 score and testing accuracy of 96.4% and 98.3% respectively. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Deep Learning Based Early Diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 Using Chest X-Ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The family Arenaviridae contains several pathogens of major clinical importance.

While these arenaviruses are highly pathogenic in humans, recent evidence indicates that pathogenic OW and NW arenaviruses interact with the host immune system differently, which may have differential impacts on viral pathogenesis. Severe Lassa fever cases are characterized by profound immunosuppression. In contrast, pathogenic NW arenavirus infections are accompanied by elevated levels of Type I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Their effectiveness has been shown for the prevention and treatment of various mental disorders. However, their potential when delivered as add-on to conventional treatment (ie, blended care) is less clear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to study the effectiveness of an internet intervention (ASCENSO) implemented in addition to face-to-face treatment as usual (TAU) for depression. METHODS: A 2-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial was conducted in an outpatient private mental health care center in Chile. In all, 167 adults, diagnosed with major depressive disorder, without severe comorbidities, and with internet access, were included. Eighty-four participants were assigned to the intervention group and received medical and psychological TAU from the mental health center plus access to the ASCENSO online platform. The control group (n=83) received only TAU. The ASCENSO platform includes psycho-educational information, depressive symptom monitoring and feedback, and managing emergencies based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy. Emergency management was mental health providerCassisted. TAU includes access to primary care physicians and psychiatrists, to a brief individual psychotherapy, and to medication when needed. The baseline questionnaires were administered in person, and 6- and 9-months assessments were conducted online. Depression symptoms and quality of life were measured by self-administered questionnaires, and treatment adherence was determined via the Mental Health Centers internal records. The usage of ASCENSO was assessed by server logs. Reduction on depressive symptomatology was considered as the primary outcome of the intervention and quality of life as a secondary outcome. RESULTS: Of the 84 participants in the intervention group, 5 participants (6%) never accessed the online platform. Of the remaining 79 participants who accessed ASCENSO, 1 (1%, 1/79) did not answer any of the symptom questionnaire, and most participants (72/79, 91%) answered the monitoring questionnaires irregularly. The ASCENSO intervention implemented in addition to face-to-face care did not improve the outcome of the usual care delivered at the mental health center, either in terms of reduction of depressive symptoms (F(2,6087)= 0.48; P=.62) or in the improvement of quality of life (EQ-5D-3L: F(2,7678)=0.24; P=.79 and EQ-VAS: F(2,6670)= 0.13; P=.88). In contrast, for the primary (F(2,850)=78.25; P<.001) and secondary outcomes (EQ-5D-3L: F(2,1067)=37.87; EQ-VAS: F(2,4390)= 51.69; P<.001) in both groups, there was an improvement from baseline to 6 months (P<.001), but there was no change at 9 months. In addition, no effects on adherence to or use of TAU were found. Finally, the dropout rate for the face-to-face treatment component was 54% (45/84) for the intervention group versus 39% (32/83) for the control group (P=.07). CONCLUSIONS: The fact that the adjunctive access to ASCENSO did not improve outcome could be due to both the rather high effectiveness of TAU and to patients limited use of the online platform.

Guidelines of the Israeli Pediatric Association and the Israeli Society for Developmental Pediatrics specify the role of the primary-care pediatrician in screening and early identification of mild developmental behavioral conditions and define the criteria for referral to child development institutes. The aims of this study were to examine and describe how directors of these institutes perceive the role and involvement of community pediatricians in child development. METHODS: Qualitative interviews of the directors of 22 child development institutes from the ministry of health and the four health plans. RESULTS: According to the interviewees, there is little involvement of community pediatricians in detecting developmental delays, and it is mainly nurses and preschool teachers who detect such delays. They report that the key barriers that deter community pediatricians from greater involvement in child development diagnosis and treatment are lack of time, lack of compensation, and insufficient clinical knowledge. The interviewees would like to see community pediatricians conducting the primary medical evaluation, providing parental guidance, referring to therapists in mild cases, exercising discretion before referring children to child development institutes and providing relevant information to the institutes in the referral process. The mechanisms that they proposed for increasing the involvement of community pediatricians were expansion of pediatricians training, increased pediatricians use of teleconsultation with child development specialists and incentives for thorough performance of developmental assessments. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the importance of the Issue, we strongly recommend that policymakers require child development principles, evaluation, and providing appropriate parental guidance in the curriculum of the Israeli pediatric residency program. In addition, health plans should compensate pediatricians who need to conduct longer visits for children with developmental delays. The health plans should also develop teleconsultation channels for pediatricians with child development specialists to reduce unnecessary referrals to child development institutes.","output":"The involvement of community pediatricians in the treatment of developmental-behavioral difficulties as perceived by directors of child development centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objective There is a shortage of supplies for the protection of professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic 3D printing offers the possibility to compensate for the production of some of the equipment needed The objective is to describe the role of 3D printing in a health service during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an emphasis on the process to develop a final product ready to be implemented in the clinical environment Methods A working group was formed between the healthcare administration, clinicians and other public and private institutions in Cantabria, Spain coordinated by the Valdecilla Virtual Hospital The process included receiving the printing proposals, learning about the printing resources in the region, selecting the devices, creating a team for each project, prototyping, evaluation and redesign, manufacturing, assembly and distribution Results The following supplies are produced: 1) devices that help protect providers: face protection screens (2400 units), personalized accessories for photophores (20 units) and ear-protection forks for face-masks (1200 units);2) products related to the ventilation of infected patients: connectors for non-invasive ventilation systems;and 3) oral and nasopharyngeal swabs (7500 units) for the identification of coronavirus carriers with the aim of designing action protocols in clinical areas Conclusions 3D printing is a valid resource for the production of protective material for professionals whose supply is reduced during a pandemic Resumen Antecedentes y objetivo Durante la pandemia de COVID-19 se produce una reduccin del material para la proteccin de los profesionales La impresin 3D ofrece la posibilidad de compensar la escasez de algunos de los suministros El objetivo es describir el papel de la impresin 3D en un servicio de salud durante la pandemia de COVID-19, con nfasis en proceso para desarrollar un producto final listo para ser implementado en el entorno clnico Materiales y mtodos Se form un grupo de trabajo entre la administracin sanitaria, clnicos y otras instituciones pblico-privadas de Cantabria coordinado en el Hospital virtual Valdecilla El proceso incluy la recepcin de las propuestas de impresin, el conocimiento de los recursos de impresin en la regin, la seleccin de los dispositivos, la creacin de un equipo para cada proyecto, dise?o de prototipos, evaluacin y redise?o, fabricacin montaje y distribucin Resultados Se producen 1) dispositivos que ayudan a prevenir el contagio de los profesionales: pantallas de proteccin facial (2 400 unidades), accesorios personalizados para fotforos (20 unidades) y horquillas salvaorejas para mascarillas (1 200 unidades);2) productos relacionados con la ventilacin de pacientes infectados: conectores de sistemas de ventilacin no invasive entre tubuladura y mascarilla;y 3) hisopos oro y nasofarngeos (7 500 unidades) para la identificacin de portadoras del coronavirus con el objetivo de dise?ar protocolos de actuacin en las rea clnicas Conclusiones La impresin 3D es un recurso vlido para la produccin de material de proteccin de los profesionales cuyo suministro est reducido durante una pandemia","output":"Role of 3D printing in the protection of surgical and critical care professionals in the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The laparoscopic approach in the treatment of mid- or low-rectal cancer is still controversial. Compared with open surgery, laparoscopic resection of extraperitoneal cancer is associated with improved short-time non-oncological outcomes, although high-level evidence showing similar short- and long-term oncological outcomes is scarce. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our paper is to study the oncological and non-oncological outcomes of laparoscopic versus open surgery for extraperitoneal rectal cancer. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of MedLine, EMBASE, and CENTRAL from January 1990 to October 2020 was performed by combining various key words. STUDY SELECTION: Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing laparoscopic versus open surgery for extraperitoneal rectal cancer were included. The quality of RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane reviewer's handbook. This meta-analysis was based on the recommendation of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. INTERVENTION(S): This study analyzes laparoscopic versus open surgery for extraperitoneal rectal cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were oncological parameters. RESULTS: Fifteen RCTs comprising 4,411 patients matched the selection criteria. Meta-analysis showed a significant difference between laparoscopic and open surgery in short-time non-oncological outcomes. Although laparoscopic approach increased operation time, it decreases significantly the blood loss and length of hospital stay. No significant difference was noted regarding short- and long-term oncological outcomes, but 4 and 5 years disease-free survival were statistically higher in the open group. LIMITATIONS: There are still questions about the long-term oncological outcomes of laparoscopic surgery for extraperitoneal rectal cancer being comparable to the open technique. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that all surgical resections have been performed in high volume centers by expert surgeons, the minimally invasive surgery in patients with extraperitoneal cancer could still be not considered equivalent to open surgery in terms of oncological radicality.","output":"Mid- and low-rectal cancer: laparoscopic vs open treatment-short- and long-term results.

Immunohistochemistry showed that compared to the control, the cell number of SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX2)+/brain lipid binding protein (BLBP)+/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ cells in the DG was significantly less, but the number of SOX2+/GFAP- cells was not, reflecting a decreased number of type 1 and type 2a neural precursor cells.

However, evaluating these systems can be challenging due to the extra difficulty of gathering data from people with special needs (e.g., communication barriers involving older adults with dementia and children with autism). Thus, in this systematic review, we focus on studying data gathering methods for evaluating socially assistive systems (SAS). Six academic databases (i.e., Scopus, Web of Science, ACM, Science Direct, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore) were searched, covering articles published from January 2000 to July 2021. A total of 65 articles met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. The results showed that existing SASs most often targeted people with visual impairments, older adults, and children with autism. For instance, a common type of SASs aimed to help blind people perceive social signals (e.g., facial expressions). SASs were most commonly assessed with interviews, questionnaires, and observation data. Around half of the interview studies only involved target users, while the other half also included secondary users or stakeholders. Questionnaires were mostly used with older adults and people with visual impairments to measure their social interaction, emotional state, and system usability.

Disease notification is a mandatory procedure for most infectious diseases, even during non-pandemic periods in healthcare. The main rationale behind MRID is the protection of public health. The information and data provided by infectious disease reports are used for many purposes, such as preventing the spread and potential negative impact of infectious diseases, assessing the national and global situation regarding reported diseases, conducting scientific research and planning health policy. In this context, the relevant information benefits public health, health systems and scientific work. Additionally, the follow up and treatment of individuals with infectious diseases is a necessity in certain cases to protect those who cohabit with them. However, these benefits cannot be accepted as unrestricted justifications for MRID, since it is evident that reporting should be conducted within ethical and legal boundaries. MRID should only be devised and implemented with due regard to balancing potential benefits between all individuals, as well as between the individual and the rest of society.

Though vaccines require certain temperatures and conditions to maintain their potency, supply chain controls vary greatly at different legs of the global journey. Vaccine manufacture is closely managed; but inconsistencies plague the cold chain when vaccines are shipped and stored in variable conditions. Monitoring vaccine temperatures throughout the cold chain is of paramount importance to ensure quality. The emerging COVID-19 vaccines present the world with new challenges and additional opportunities to establish best practices for safeguarding human health. AREAS COVERED We review the risks associated with the vaccine cold chain that require temperature monitoring throughout shipment and storage. Electronic and chemical monitoring devices are compared along with data needs. Regulatory oversight and guidance are also discussed. EXPERT OPINION Regulatory oversight has contributed to the creation of a risk management and quality culture among private sector players in the vaccine field. Meanwhile, the public sector (the main player at the country level) remains largely untouched by regulatory oversight.

Test, trace and isolate are the three crucial components of the response to COVID-19 identified by the World Health Organisation. Mathematical models of contact tracing often over-simplify the ability of traced contacts to quarantine or isolate. Method. We use an age-structured branching process model of individual disease transmission combined with a detailed model of symptom onset, testing, contact quarantine and case isolation to model each aspect of the test, trace, isolate strategy. We estimated the effective reproduction number under a range of scenarios to understand the importance of each aspect of the system. Findings. People's ability to quarantine and isolate effectively is a crucial component of a successful contact tracing system. 80% of cases need to be quarantined or isolated within 4 days of quarantine or isolation of index case to be confident the contact tracing system is effective. Interpretation. Provision of universal support systems to enable people to quarantine and isolate effectively, coupled with investment in trained public health professionals to undertake contact tracing, are crucial to success. We predict that a high-quality, rapid contact tracing system with strong support structures in place, combined with moderate social distancing measures, is required to contain the spread of COVID-19.

DESIGN Scoping review guided by the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis. DATA SOURCES Six electronic databases and five web-based resources were systematically searched to identify relevant literature published between 2010 and April 2021. REVIEW METHODS The search results received two-stage screening: (1) title and abstract (2) full-text screening. For sources of evidence to progress, agreement needed to be reached by two reviewers. Data were extracted and cross-checked. Data were analysed, sorted by themes and mapped to region and country. RESULTS Literature was reported across five georegions. Nurses with a range formal and informal training were identified as providing critical care. Availability of staff was frequently reported as a problem. No reports provided a comprehensive description of CCN in LICs/LMICs. However, a variety of nursing practices and non-clinical responsibilities were highlighted. Availability of equipment to fulfil the nursing role was widely discussed. Perceptions of inadequate resourcing were common. Undergraduate and postgraduate-level preparation was poorly described but frequently reported. The delivery of short format critical care courses was more fully described. There were reports of educational evaluation, especially regarding internationally supported initiatives. CONCLUSIONS Despite commonalities, CCN is unique to regional and socioeconomic contexts. Nurses work within a complex team, yet the structure and skill levels of such teams will vary according to patient population, resources and treatments available. Therefore, a universal definition of the CCN role in LIC/LMIC health systems is likely unhelpful.

Methods: Data were extracted from Round 6 of the European Social Survey (2012). The dataset comprised of 2058 people aged 80 years and older from 24 countries. Mediation analyses determined possible links between the welfare state, including eleven intervening variables representing life conditions and five mental wellbeing dimensions. Results: Our study confirms that the higher the level of welfare state, the better mental wellbeing, irrespective of dimension. Although several life conditions were found to mediate the welfare state effect on mental wellbeing, subjective general health, coping with income and place in society were the most important intervening variables. Conclusions: All three variables centre around supporting autonomy in the oldest old age. By teasing out how the welfare state influences mental wellbeing in the oldest old, we can better understand the many drivers of wellbeing and enable evidence informed age-friendly policy making.","output":"Life Conditions as Mediators of Welfare State Effect on Mental Wellbeing among Oldest Old in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background From the first report of the respiratory disease caused by SARS-Cov-2 towards the end of 2019, in Wuhan, China, to June 8, 2020, 6,931,000 people had been affected in the world, and 113,619 in Mexico, where there is a lack of literature describing the tomographic behavior of this disease throughout its evolution and its correlation with patient clinical data. Objective To identify, describe and classify the manifestations detected on chest computed tomography images of patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. Method Hospitalized patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and who underwent a plain chest tomography were included. Results The most common tomographic patterns were ground glass opacity, consolidation, cobblestone pattern and mixed pattern, with peripheral and subpleural distribution and bilateral involvement in up to 95 %. Subpleural bands that distorted the architecture were identified in up to 62 % of patients, with an average of seven days of evolution.

Yet launching and implementing trials with the rigor necessary to produce convincing results is a complicated and time-consuming process. Balancing rigor and efficiency involves relying on designs that employ flexible features to respond to a fast-changing landscape, measuring valid endpoints that result in translational actions and disseminating findings in a timely manner. We describe the challenges involved in creating infrastructure with potential utility for shared learning. METHODS: We have established a shared infrastructure that borrows strength across multiple trials. The infrastructure includes an endpoint registry to aid in selecting appropriate endpoints, a registry to facilitate establishing a Data & Safety Monitoring Board, common data collection instruments, a COVID-19 dedicated design and analysis team, and a pragmatic platform protocol, among other elements. RESULTS: The authors have relied on the shared infrastructure for six clinical trials for which they serve as the Data Coordinating Center and have a design and analysis team comprising 15 members who are dedicated to COVID-19. The authors established a pragmatic platform to simultaneously investigate multiple treatments for the outpatient with adaptive features to add or drop treatment arms. CONCLUSION: The shared infrastructure provides appealing opportunities to evaluate disease in a more robust manner with fewer resources and is especially valued during a pandemic where efficiency in time and resources is crucial. The most important element of the shared infrastructure is the pragmatic platform. While it may be the most challenging of the elements to establish, it may provide the greatest benefit to both patients and researchers.","output":"Clinical trials in a COVID-19 pandemic: Shared infrastructure for continuous learning in a rapidly changing landscape"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The growth and development of smartphones and eHealth technologies have enabled the potential for extended care hospitals (e-hospitals) in China in order to facilitate the success of a primary healthcare centre (PHC)-based integrated delivery model. Although the adoption of e-hospitals is essential, few studies have directed their research towards understanding the perspectives of healthcare providers. This study aims to identify the current readiness of healthcare providers to adopt e-hospital technologies, determine the factors influencing this adoption and describe the perceived facilitators and barriers in regard to working at e-hospitals. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study conducted in Sichuan, China, between June and September 2019. SETTINGS: Information was collected from healthcare providers who have more than 3 years of work experience from a tertiary hospital, secondary hospital, PHCs and private hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 2298 medical professionals were included in this study. OUTCOME MEASURE: This study included a self-administered questionnaire that was used to assess participants sociodemographic characteristics, online medical practices, willingness to use e-hospitals and perceived facilitators/barriers to working at e-hospitals. Multivariate regression analysis was performed in order to evaluate the independent factors associated with e-hospital work. RESULTS: Overall, 86.3% had a positive response towards working at e-hospitals. Age (p<0.05), familiarity with e-hospitals (p<0.001) and prior work practices in online healthcare settings (p<0.001) were associated with participants readiness to work at e-hospitals. Gender, education level, professional level, the tier of their affiliated hospital and workload were not statistically associated. Healthcare providers who had positive attitudes towards e-hospitals considered improved efficiency, patient satisfaction, communication among physicians, increased reputation and income, and alleviated workload to be advantages of adoption. The participants who were unwilling to work at e-hospitals perceived lack of time, insufficient authenticity/reliability and underdeveloped policies as potential barriers. CONCLUSION: Improving operative proficiency in electronic devices, accommodating to work schedules, increasing familiarity with e-hospitals and regulating practices will improve the readiness of healthcare providers to work at e-hospitals.","output":"Readiness of healthcare providers for e-hospitals: a cross-sectional analysis in China before the COVID-19 period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Studies on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in unselected patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) show that clinical characteristics and dosing practices differ per region, but lack data on edoxaban. METHODS: With data from Edoxaban Treatment in routiNe clinical prActice for patients with AF in Europe (ETNA-AF-Europe), a large prospective observational study, we compared clinical characteristics (including the dose reduction criteria for edoxaban: creatinine clearance 15-50a?ml/min, weight &#8804;60a?kg, and/or use of strong p-glycoprotein inhibitors) of patients from Belgium and the Netherlands (BeNe) with those from other European countries (OEC). RESULTS: Of all 13,639 patients in ETNA-AF-Europe, 2579 were from BeNe. BeNe patients were younger than OEC patients (mean age: 72.3 vs 73.9 years), and had lower CHA2DS2-VASc (mean: 2.8 vs 3.2) and HAS-BLED scores (mean: 2.4 vs 2.6). Patients from BeNe less often had hypertension (61.6% vs 80.4%), and/or diabetes mellitus (17.3% vs 23.1%) than patients from OEC. Moreover, relatively fewer patients in BeNe were prescribed the reduced dose of 30a?mg edoxaban (14.8%) than in OEC (25.4%). Overall, edoxaban was dosed according to label in 83.1% of patients. Yet, 30a?mg edoxaban was prescribed in the absence of any dose reduction criteria in 36.9% of 30a?mg users (5.5% of all patients) in BeNe compared with 35.5% (9.0% of all patients) in OEC.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of acquiring infectious diseases and may be among the first to contract emerging infections. This study aims to explore European HCWs' perceptions and attitudes towards monitoring their absence and symptom reports for surveillance of newly circulating infections. METHODS: A qualitative study with thematic analysis was conducted using focus group methodology. Forty-nine hospital-based HCWs from 12 hospitals were recruited to six focus groups; two each in England and Hungary and one each in Germany and Greece. RESULTS: HCWs perceived risk factors for occupationally acquired infectious diseases to be 1.) exposure to patients with undiagnosed infections 2.) break-down in infection control procedures 3.) immuno-na?vety and 4.) symptomatic colleagues. They were concerned that a lack of monitoring and guidelines for infectious HCWs posed a risk to staff and patients and felt employers failed to take a positive interest in their health. Staffing demands and loss of income were noted as pressures to attend work when unwell. In the UK, Hungary and Greece participants felt monitoring staff absence and the routine disclosure of symptoms could be appropriate provided the effectiveness and efficiency of such a system were demonstrable. In Germany, legislation, privacy and confidentiality were identified as barriers. All HCWs highlighted the need for knowledge and structural improvements for timelier recognition of emerging infections. These included increased suspicion and awareness among staff and standardised, homogenous absence reporting systems. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring absence and infectious disease symptom reports among HCWs may be a feasible means of surveillance for emerging infections in some settings.

In addition to academic pressure and stressful tasks, another aggravating factor in student life is the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of the study was to examine the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms in Czech and Slovak college students during the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate possible socio-demographic determinants of mental health problems. A total of 3,099 respondents participated in this cross-sectional study (Czech Republic: 1,422, Slovakia: 1,677). The analyzes included the Patient Health Questionnaire for somatic symptoms (PHQ-15), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder instrument (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression (PHQ-9). Socio-demographic factors were gender, age, family structure, marital status, form of study, degree of study, year of study, field of study, distance between home and college, residence, and housing during the semester. Among Czech students, prevalence of somatic complaints, anxiety and depression was 72.2, 40.3, and 52%, respectively. Among Slovak students, prevalence of somatic complaints, anxiety and depression was 69.5, 34.6, and 47%, respectively. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the most severe mental health problems were identified in a non-negligible part of the sample (Czech Republic: PHQ-15 = 10.1%, GAD-7 = 4.9%, PHQ-9 = 3.4%; Slovakia: PHQ-15 = 7.4%, GAD-7 = 3.5%, PHQ-9 = 2.7%). Regarding the differences between the analyzed countries, a significantly higher score in somatic symptoms, anxiety, and depression was identified in the Czech Republic. Significant differences in mental disorders were found in most socio-demographic characteristics. The main results of the logistic regression analysis revealed that risk factors for mental health disorders in Czech and Slovak students were female gender, younger age, third degree of study, and study of Informatics, Mathematics, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Especially in the case of these high-risk groups of students, public policies should consider a response to impending problems. The findings are an appeal for a proactive approach to improving the mental health of students and for the implementation of effective prevention programs, which are more than necessary in the Czech and Slovak college environment.","output":"Somatic Symptoms, Anxiety, and Depression Among College Students in the Czech Republic and Slovakia: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CL sup Pro /sup ) is a highly conserved cysteine protease employing a catalytic dyad for its functions 3CL sup Pro /sup is essential to the viral life cycle and, therefore, is an attractive target for developing antiviral agents However, the detailed catalytic mechanism of coronavirus 3CL sup Pro /sup remains largely unknown We took an integrated approach of employing X-ray crystallography, mutational studies, enzyme kinetics study, and inhibitors to gain insights into the mechanism Such experimental work is supplemented by computational studies, including the prereaction state analysis, the ab initio calculation of the critical catalytic step, and the molecular dynamic simulation of the wild-type and mutant enzymes Taken together, such studies allowed us to identify a residue pair (Glu-His) and a conserved His as critical for binding;a conserved GSCGS motif as important for the start of catalysis, a partial negative charge cluster (PNCC) formed by Arg-Tyr-Asp as essential for catalysis, and a conserved water molecule mediating the remote interaction between PNCC and catalytic dyad The data collected and our insights into the detailed mechanism have allowed us to achieve a good understanding of the difference in catalytic efficiency between 3CL sup Pro /sup from SARS and MERS, conduct mutational studies to improve the catalytic activity by 8-fold, optimize existing inhibitors to improve the potency by 4-fold, and identify a potential allosteric site for inhibitor design All such results reinforce each other to support the overall catalytic mechanism proposed herein","output":"Comprehensive Insights into the Catalytic Mechanism of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 3C-Like Protease and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 3C-Like Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a novel emerging virus infection that was first found and reported in Peoples Republic of China in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

In brain slices from hamster, which has an ACE2 sequence similar to human ACE2, angiotensin II alone evoked only a small capillary constriction, but evoked a large pericyte-mediated capillary constriction generated by AT1 receptors in the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). The effect of the RBD was mimicked by blocking ACE2. A mutated non-binding RBD did not potentiate constriction. A similar RBD-potentiated capillary constriction occurred in human cortical slices. This constriction reflects an RBD-induced decrease in the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7). The clinically-used drug losartan inhibited the RBD-potentiated constriction.

Various strategies have been tried to prevent or control HAIs. Positive deviance, a strategy that has been used in the last decade, is based on the observation that a few at-risk individuals follow uncommon, useful practices and that, consequently, they experience better outcomes than their peers who share similar risks. We performed a systematic literature review to measure the impact of positive deviance in controlling HAIs. METHODS A systematic search strategy was used to search PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Embase through May 2020 for studies evaluating positive deviance as a single intervention or as part of an initiative to prevent or control healthcare-associated infections. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Downs and Black score. RESULTS Of 542 articles potentially eligible for review, 14 articles were included for further analysis. All studies were observational, quasi-experimental (before-and-after intervention) studies. Hand hygiene was the outcome in 8 studies (57%), and an improvement was observed in association with implementation of positive deviance as a single intervention in all of them. Overall HAI rates were measured in 5 studies (36%), and positive deviance was associated with an observed reduction in 4 (80%) of them. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections were evaluated in 5 studies (36%), and positive deviance containing bundles were successful in all of them.

Data were gathered from posts to the r/COVID19_support subreddit forum from February 2020 through December 2020. The second step of Klonsky and May's (2015) Three-Step Theory (3ST) of suicide, connectedness as a key protective factor, was used as the theoretical framework. This study explored r/COVID19_support's constructed environment, users' dialogical interactions, and the four primary tenets of connectedness as proposed by Klonsky and May C Purpose and Meaning, Relationships, Religiosity, and Employment. Findings demonstrate a deep sense of connectedness for online community members. Relationships and Purpose and Meaning featured as the most salient sources of connectedness within this subreddit, whereas Religiosity was rarely discussed, and Employment was often spoken of in negative terms (i.e., creating mental distress, rather than facilitating connectedness). Contributors' responses offered various opportunities for connectedness both on- and off-line. Safe online spaces, such as r/COVID19_support, can serve as a protective factor amid suicidality, facilitating connectedness, and thereby helping to curtail suicidal thoughts from advancing to suicidal actions.

METHODS We added an external filter to the expiratory limb and measured tidal volume (VT) from 6 ICU ventilators: 2 with built-in expiratory filter (Avea, Puritan Bennett 840), and 4 without (Engstr?m Carestation, Evita XL, Evita V500, and Servo-i), set in volume controlled mode, at BTPS (body temperature and pressure saturated) condition, with a heated humidifier and a lung model (compliance 16 mL/cm H2O, resistance 20 cm H2O/L/s) placed inside a neonatal incubator. The temperature was targeted at 37C for both the heated humidifier and the incubator. The setup was run continuously for 24 hours. In the latter 4 ICU ventilators, a Hygrobac or Sterivent S external filter was placed upstream from the expiratory valve for an additional 24-hour period for each. At the end of this period, VT was measured at 4 nominal VT values (300, 400, 500, and 800 mL) with a pneumotachograph. The volume error computed from the ratio of set to measured VT (% set VT) was the primary end point. RESULTS In these warm and wet conditions, volume error averaged 96  3% for Avea, 100  7% for Puritan Bennett 840, 90  2% for Evita XL, 100  7% for Evita V500, 105  2% for Servo-i, and 108  4% for Engstr?m Carestation (P < .001).

METHODS Data were collected from 1463 young adults (M age = 22.2, SD = 3.2; 59.5% women) enrolled across community colleges in Hawai'i at two time-points six months apart. RESULTS Higher frequency of e-cigarette use at baseline was predictive of higher alcohol (B = 0.06, SE = 0.02, p < 0.01) and marijuana (B = 0.06, SE = 0.02, p < 0.01) use problems at six-month follow up, adjusting for baseline cigarette smoking, problem alcohol/marijuana use, sensation seeking, and demographic variables.

In recent years, there have been many in-depth studies on mammalian lncRNAs, but the relevant studies in fish are very limited. Meanwhile, since lncRNAs are not conserved among species, it is difficult to apply the existing results directly to unstudied species. RESULTS: To obtain the information of lncRNAs in Megalobrama amblycephala, one of the most economically important freshwater fish in China, also to better understand the biological significance of lncRNAs in the immunity system, the fish liver at 0, 4, 12, 24, and 72 h post Aeromonas hydrophila infection (hpi) were obtained for lncRNA-sequencing (lncRNA-seq). A total of 14,849 lncRNAs were identified, and 2196 lncRNAs showed significant differences at different time points post A. hydrophila infection. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses showed that the target genes of the differentially expressed lncRNAs were enriched in several pathways related to immune such as apoptosis, inflammation, and immune response. Time-specific modules were then identified, using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA), and 28 modules significantly correlated with different time point after infection were found. Furthermore, four immune-related genes and six lncRNAs in the time-specific modules were subsequently verified by RT-qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: The above findings reveal the discovery of widespread differentially expressed lncRNAs in the M. amblycephala liver post A. hydrophila infection, suggesting that lncRNAs might participate in the regulation of host response to bacterial infection, enriching the information of lncRNAs in teleost and providing a resources basis for further studies on the immune function of lncRNAs.

Involving the intended end users in the development process through user-centered design and usability testing is crucial for maximizing user engagement and adoption of internet-based treatments, but so far this has been lacking for internet-based treatments for child anxiety. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an internet-based treatment for child anxiety through a process of user-centered design (phase 1) and usability testing (phase 2), based on an existing evidence-based, face-to-face, therapist-supported, parent-led cognitive behavioral therapy intervention. It is intended that the internet-based version of this treatment would consist of a parent website, case management system for clinicians, and mobile game app for children. METHODS: Parents, children, and clinicians who were familiar with the face-to-face version of the treatment were recruited from 2 National Health Service clinics. In phase 1, participants participated in 3 workshops to gain feedback on the overall concept, explore their wants and needs for the websites and game, generate ideas on how the treatment may look, and gain feedback on initial mock-ups of the websites and game. In phase 2, participants attended 3 individual usability testing sessions where they were presented with working prototypes of the website or game and asked to perform a series of tasks on the website (parents and clinicians) or play the game (children). The frequency and details on usability errors were recorded. Participants were asked for their feedback on the website and game using a standardized usability questionnaire and semistructured interviews. The websites and game were iterated after each round of usability testing in response to this feedback. RESULTS: In phase 1, participants approved the general concept and rated the initial mock-ups of the website and game positively. In phase 2, working prototypes were rated positively and usability errors declined across the iterations and were mainly cosmetic or minor issues relating to esthetic preference, with few issues regarding ability to navigate the website or technical issues affecting functionality. Feedback from the semistructured interviews further supported the positive response of participants to the website and game, and helped identify areas for improvement during the iteration process. The final iteration of the website and game are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Taking an iterative approach to development through user-centered design and usability testing has resulted in an internet-based treatment for child anxiety (Online Support and Intervention for child anxiety) that appears to meet the needs and expectations of the intended users (parents, children, and clinicians) and is easy and enjoyable to use.","output":"Online Support and Intervention for Child Anxiety (OSI): Development and Usability Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mourning is a coping-with-loss stage that prevents grief from becoming pathologic, i.e., complicated grief (CG) syndrome and persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD), recently included in international classification systems.

A recent unbiased genomics-guided tracing of the SARS-CoV-2 targets in human cells identified vitamin D among the three top-scoring molecules manifesting potential infection mitigation patterns. Growing pre-clinical and epidemiological observational data support this assumption. We hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation may improve the prognosis of COVID-19. The aim of this trial is to compare the effect of a single oral high dose of cholecalciferol versus a single oral standard dose on all-cause 14-day mortality rate in COVID-19 older adults at higher risk of worsening. METHODS: The COVIT-TRIAL study is an open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled superiority trial. Patients aged  65 years with COVID-19 (diagnosed within the preceding 3 days with RT-PCR and/or chest CT scan) and at least one worsening risk factor at the time of inclusion (i.e., age  75 years, or SpO2  94% in room air, or PaO2/FiO2  300 mmHg), having no contraindications to vitamin D supplementation, and having received no vitamin D supplementation > 800 IU/day during the preceding month are recruited. Participants are randomized either to high-dose cholecalciferol (two 200,000 IU drinking vials at once on the day of inclusion) or to standard-dose cholecalciferol (one 50,000 IU drinking vial on the day of inclusion). Two hundred sixty participants are recruited and followed up for 28 days. The primary outcome measure is all-cause mortality within 14 days of inclusion. Secondary outcomes are the score changes on the World Health Organization Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI) scale for COVID-19, and the between-group comparison of safety. These outcomes are assessed at baseline, day 14, and day 28, together with the serum concentrations of 25(OH)D, creatinine, calcium, and albumin at baseline and day 7. DISCUSSION: COVIT-TRIAL is to our knowledge the first randomized controlled trial testing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the prognosis of COVID-19 in high-risk older patients.

The study focusses on a Portuguese rural county, Penamacor, which, for several decades, has suffered a continuous exodus of population and the consequent aging of the remaining population but where, recently, there was a spontaneous phenomenon of foreign people arriving and settling in the area. Thus, through the case of Penamacor, this study aims to answer the following questions: Who are these migrants, and what are their motivations for mobility and to settle in the territory? Are they all the same? How do they make a living in Penamacor? In particular, it seeks to understand whether entrepreneurship (in tourism or other sectors) is a possibility of income generation for these immigrants. Furthermore, it intends to understand what the impact of these immigrants in the territory is, concerning the creation of wealth and well-being in the community. Do they act as community entrepreneurs? Does their presence in the territory generate other mobility flows, through the attraction of other (family and friends) tourists or immigrants?","output":"Tourism, Immigrants and Lifestyle Entrepreneurship: The (In)coming of People as a Key Factor for Sustainability of Low-Density TerritoriesA Case Study in Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Analysis of long-term potentiation (LTP) provides a powerful window into cellular mechanisms of learning and memory. Prior work shows late LTP (L-LTP), lasting >3 hr, occurs abruptly at postnatal day 12 (P12) in the stratum radiatum of rat hippocampal area CA1. The goal here was to determine the developmental profile of synaptic plasticity leading to L-LTP in the mouse hippocampus. Two mouse strains and two mutations known to affect synaptic plasticity were chosen: C57BL/6J and Fmr1-/y on the C57BL/6J background, and 129SVE and Hevin-/- (Sparcl1-/- ) on the 129SVE background. Like rats, hippocampal slices from all of the mice showed test pulse-induced depression early during development that was gradually resolved with maturation by 5 weeks. All the mouse strains showed a gradual progression between P10-P35 in the expression of short-term potentiation (STP), lasting &#8804;1 hr. In the 129SVE mice, L-LTP onset (>25% of slices) occurred by 3 weeks, reliable L-LTP (>50% slices) was achieved by 4 weeks, and Hevin-/- advanced this profile by 1 week. In the C57BL/6J mice, L-LTP onset occurred significantly later, over 3-4 weeks, and reliability was not achieved until 5 weeks. Although some of the Fmr1-/y mice showed L-LTP before 3 weeks, reliable L-LTP also was not achieved until 5 weeks. L-LTP onset was not advanced in any of the mouse genotypes by multiple bouts of theta-burst stimulation at 90 or 180 min intervals. These findings show important species differences in the onset of STP and L-LTP, which occur at the same age in rats but are sequentially acquired in mice.","output":"Developmental onset of enduring long-term potentiation in mouse hippocampus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We compared two rapid, point-of care nucleic acid amplification tests for detection of influenza A and B viruses (Alere i [Alere] and cobas Liat [Roche Diagnostics]) with the influenza A and B virus test components of the FilmArray respiratory panel (BioFire Diagnostics) using 129 respiratory specimens collected in universal viral transport medium (80 influenza A virus and 16 influenza B virus positive) from both adult and pediatric patients.

Approximately, more than 8,807,398 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and 464,483 deaths have been reported globally till the end of 21 June 2020. Until now, there is no specific drug therapy or vaccine available for the treatment of COVID-19. However, some potential antimalarial drugs like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, antifilarial drug ivermectin and antiviral drugs have been tested by many research groups worldwide for their possible effect against the COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin have been identified to act by creating the acidic condition in cells and inhibiting the importin (IMP/1) mediated viral import. There is a possibility that some other antimalarial drugs/antibiotics in combination with immunomodulators may help in combatting this pandemic disease. Therefore, this review focuses on the current use of various drugs as single agents (hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, azithromycin, favipiravir, remdesivir, umifenovir, teicoplanin, nitazoxanide, doxycycline, and dexamethasone) or in combinations with immunomodulators additionally. Furthermore, possible mode of action, efficacy and current stage of clinical trials of various drug combinations against COVID-19 disease has also been discussed in detail.

Mortality, clinical disease, gross lesions, microscopic lesions and body weights were observed. TRVs replicated poorly and did not cause disease in chickens. Clinical disease induced by the TRV isolates, characterized by diarrhoea and depression, was mild in both SPF and commercial origin poults. Several TRV isolates caused moderate to severe bursal atrophy in poults. Additionally, each of the TRV isolates caused significant body weight decreases in SPF and/or commercial poults as compared with sham inoculates.

Next-generation sequencing is the state of the art in open-view pathogen detection, and one of the few methods available at the earliest stages of an epidemic, even when the biological threat is unknown. Analyzing the samples as the sequencer is running can greatly reduce the turnaround time, but existing tools rely on close matches to lists of known pathogens and perform poorly on novel species. Machine learning approaches can predict if single reads originate from more distant, unknown pathogens but require relatively long input sequences and processed data from a finished sequencing run. Incomplete sequences contain less information, leading to a trade-off between sequencing time and detection accuracy. Using a workflow for real-time pathogenic potential prediction, we investigate which subsequences already allow accurate inference. We train deep neural networks to classify Illumina and Nanopore reads and integrate the models with HiLive2, a real-time Illumina mapper. This approach outperforms alternatives based on machine learning and sequence alignment on simulated and real data, including SARS-CoV-2 sequencing runs. After just 50 Illumina cycles, we observe an 80-fold sensitivity increase compared to real-time mapping. The first 250 bp of Nanopore reads, corresponding to 0.5 s of sequencing time, are enough to yield predictions more accurate than mapping the finished long reads. The approach could also be used for screening synthetic sequences against biosecurity threats.","output":"Deep learning-based real-time detection of novel pathogens during sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Besides maintaining health precautions, vaccination has been the only prevention from SARS-CoV-2, though no clinically proved 100% effective vaccine has been developed till date. At this stage, to withhold the debris of this pandemic, experts need to know the impact of the vaccine efficacy rate's threshold and how long this pandemic may extent with vaccines that have different efficacy rates. In this article, a mathematical model study has been done on the importance of vaccination and vaccine efficiency rate during an ongoing pandemic. We simulated a five compartment mathematical model to analyze the pandemic scenario in both California, and whole U.S. We considered four vaccines, Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson and Johnson, which are being used rigorously to control the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition with two special cases: a vaccine with 100% efficacy rate and no vaccine under use. Both the infection and death rates are very high in California. Our model suggests that the pandemic situation in California will be under control in the last quartile of the year 2023 if frequent vaccination is continued with the Pfizer vaccine. During this time, six waves will happen from the beginning of the immunization where the case fatality and recovery rates will be 1.697% and 98.30%, respectively. However, according to the considered model, this period might be extended to the mid of 2024 when vaccines with lower efficacy rates are used. The more effective a vaccine, the less people suffer from this malign infection.

Many cellular agriculture companies appear poised to follow a centralized supply system, in which production is concentrated within a small number of large plants and products are distributed over a wide area. This model benefits from economies of scale, but has several weaknesses to food security. By being built of a handful of plants with products distributed by a large transportation network, the centralized model is vulnerable to closures, as became clear for animal-sourced centralized system during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cellular agriculture systems are being built now;therefore, alternative supply system models of decentralized and distributed systems should be considered as the systems of cellular agriculture production are established.

Drug repositioning, the process of finding new therapeutic indications for marketed drugs, is a promising alternative to new drug development, with lower costs and shorter development times. Here, we present two computational approaches that have been designed to assist drug repurposing projects for COVID-19. The aim of these methods is to provide rankings of drugs that can be used for directing experimental research. Our first approach consists of a novel non-negative matrix factorisation algorithm to rank broad spectrum antivirals that have been approved, or are being developed, for viruses. Our second approach, rooted in ideas from network medicine, aims at ranking drugs by estimating the perturbation each drug induces on a subnetwork of the human interactome that is crucial for SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication. Using graph kernels and host proteins weighted by gene expression data from SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines, we obtained a ranking of 1853 therapeutically diverse FDA-approved drugs. Our experiments show that nine out of 10 of our top predicted broad spectrum antivirals are already indicated for compassionate use in COVID-19 patients worldwide;and that the ranking obtained by our perturbation analysis approach aligns with independent experimental data on in vitro screenings. Finally, we present the COVID-19 Repositioning Explorer (CoREx), an interactive online tool that we developed for assisting drug repositioning projects for COVID-19. CoRex allows scientists to explore the interplay between approved drugs and SARS-CoV-2 host proteins in the context of biological networks, protein function, drug clinical use, and the Connectivity Map.

Knowledge of risk factors of coronavirus disease among Brazilians remains scarce, especially in the adult population. This study verified the risk factors for intensive care unit admission and mortality for coronavirus disease among 20-59-year-old Brazilians. METHODS: A Brazilian database on respiratory illness was analyzed on October 9, 2020, to gather data on age, sex, ethnicity, education, housing area, and comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors for coronavirus disease. RESULTS: Overall, 1,048,575 persons were tested for coronavirus disease; among them, 43,662 were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 34,704 patients died. Male sex (odds ratio=1.235 and 1.193), obesity (odds ratio=1.941 and 1.889), living in rural areas (odds ratio=0.855 and 1.337), and peri-urban areas (odds ratio=1.253 and 1.577) were predictors of intensive care unit admission and mortality, respectively.

Unlike other recently published studies, where patient-cohort included a more morbid group and cancer surgeries, we report on a group of patients who had limb surgery and were more akin to elective orthopaedic surgery. Methods: The study included 214 patients who underwent orthopaedic trauma surgeries in the hospital between 12th March and 12th May-2020 when the pandemic was on the rise in the United Kingdom. Data was collected on demographic profile including comorbidities, ASA grade, COVID-19 testing, type of procedures and any readmissions, complications or mortality due to COVID-19. Results: There were 7.9% readmissions and 52.9% of it was for respiratory complications. Only one patient had positive COVID-19 test during readmission. 30-day mortality for trauma surgeries was 0% if hip fractures were excluded and 2.8% in all patients. All the mortalities were for proximal femur fracture surgeries and between ASA Grade 3 and 4 or in patients above the age of 70 years. Conclusion: This study suggests that presence of COVID-19 virus in the community and hospital did not adversely affect the outcome of orthopaedic trauma surgeries or lead to excess mortality or readmissions in patients undergoing limb trauma surgery.

Whereas, the pathogenesis underlying these neurological manifestations remains elusive. Although in vitro models and animal models are widely used in studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection, human organ models that can reflect the pathological alterations in a multi-organ context are still lacking. In this study, we propose a new strategy to probe the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on human brains in a linked alveolus-BBB organ chip platform. The new multi-organ platform allows to recapitulate the essential features of human alveolar-capillary barrier and blood-brain barrier in a microfluidic condition by co-culturing the organ-specific cells. The results reveal direct SARS-CoV-2 exposure has no obvious effects on BBB chip alone. While, infusion of endothelial medium from infected alveolus chips can cause BBB dysfunction and neuroinflammation on the linked chip platform, including brain endothelium disruption, glial cell activation and inflammatory cytokines release. These new findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could induce neuropathological alterations, which might not result from direct viral infection through hematogenous route, but rather likely from systemic inflammation following lung infection. This work provides a new strategy to study the virus-host interaction and neuropathology at an organ-organ context, which is not easily obtained by other in vitro models.

A case-control study including patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 between February 20 and May 31, 2020, was conducted. Patients reporting myalgia and patients without myalgia at hospital admission were scheduled for a telephone interview 7 months after hospital discharge. Hospitalisation and clinical data were collected from medical records. A list of post-COVID symptoms with attention to musculoskeletal pain was evaluated. Anxiety and depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were likewise assessed. From a total of 1200 hospitalised patients with COVID-19, 369 with and 369 without myalgia at hospital admission were assessed 7.2 months (SD 0.6) after hospital discharge. A greater proportion (P = 0.03) of patients with myalgia at hospital admission (20%) showed 3 post-COVID symptoms when compared with individuals without myalgia (13%). A higher proportion of patients presenting myalgia (odds Rratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.90) exhibited musculoskeletal post-COVID pain when compared to those without myalgia. The prevalence of musculoskeletal post-COVID pain in the total sample was 38%. Fifty percent of individuals with preexisting musculoskeletal pain experienced a worsening of their symptoms after COVID-19. No differences in fatigue, dyspnoea, anxiety/depressive levels, or sleep quality were observed between myalgia and nonmyalgia groups.

Recent studies have highlighted the role of mechanical signals in mammalian dermal wound healing. However, the biological link between mechanical stimulation of wounded tissue and the subsequent cellular response has not been fully determined. The capacity for researchers to study this link is partially limited by the lack of instrumentation capable of applying controlled mechanical stimuli to wounded tissue. The studies outlined here tested the hypothesis that it was possible to control the magnitude of induced wound tissue deformation using a microfabricated dressing composed of an array of open-faced, hexagonally shaped microchambers rendered in a patch of silicone rubber. By connecting the dressing to a single vacuum source, the underlying wounded tissue was drawn up into each of the microchambers, thereby inducing tissue deformation. For these studies, the dressings were applied to full-thickness murine dermal wounds with 200 mmHg vacuum for 12 h. These studies demonstrated that the dressing was capable of inducing wound tissue deformation with values ranging from 11 to 29%. Through statistical analysis, the magnitude of the induced deformation was shown to be a function of both microchamber height and width. These results demonstrated that the dressing was capable of controlling the amount of deformation imparted in the underlying tissue. By allowing the application of mechanical stimulation with varying intensities, such a dressing will enable the performance of sophisticated mechanobiology studies in dermal wound healing.","output":"Controlled induction of distributed microdeformation in wounded tissue via a microchamber array dressing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The Ocular manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reported include conjunctivitis, conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, episcleritis, retinal manifestations included cotton wool spots (CWS), micro-hemorrhages, papillophlebitis and neuro-ophthalmic manifestations.Purpose: To report post COVID-19 ophthalmic manifestations using multimodal imaging.Results: A 66-year-old Asian Indian male presented to us with bilateral blurring of vision, RE>LE, of 3 days following a diagnosis of COVID-19 disease.

Ebola, Influenza A (H1N1), SARS, MERS, and Zika virus have had a massive global impact in terms of economic disruption, the strain on local and global public health. Most recently, the global outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is a newly discovered virus from the coronavirus family in Wuhan city, China, known to be a great threat to the public health systems. As of 15 April 2020, The Johns Hopkins University estimated that the COVID-19 affected more than two million people, resulting in a death toll above 130,000 around the world. Infected people in Europe and America correspond about 40% and 30% of the total reported cases respectively. At this moment only few Asian countries have controlled the disease, but a second wave of new infections is expected. Predicting inhibitor and target to the COVID-19 is an urgent need to protect human from the disease. Therefore, a protocol to identify anti-COVID-19 candidate based on computer-aided drug design is urgently needed. Thousands of compounds including approved drugs and drugs in the clinical trial are available in the literature. In practice, experimental techniques can measure the time and space average properties but they cannot be captured the structural variation of the COVID-19 during the interaction of inhibitor. Computer simulation is particularly suitable to complement experiments to elucidate conformational changes at the molecular level which are related to inhibition process of the COVID-19. Therefore, computational simulation is essential tool to elucidate the phenomenon. The structure-based virtual screening computational approach will be used to filter the best drugs from the literature, the investigate the structural variation of COVID-19 with the interaction of the best inhibitor is a fundamental step to design new drugs and vaccines which can combat the coronavirus.

This is especially true given the small number of COVID-19 X-rays that are publicly available. Deep learning experts commonly use transfer learning to offset the small number of images typically available in medical imaging tasks. Our COV-SNET model is a deep neural network that was pretrained on over one hundred thousand X-ray images. In this paper, we designed two COV-SNET models with the purpose of diagnosing Covid-19. The experimental results demonstrate the robustness of our deep learning models, ultimately achieving sensitivities of 95% for our three-class and two-class models. We also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of such an approach, focusing mainly on the limitations of public X-ray datasets on current Covid-19 deep learning models.

Detection of ST and SPA in wastewater can be used as a surveillance strategy to determine burden of infection and identify priority areas for water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions and vaccination campaigns. However, sensitive and specific detection of ST and SPA in environmental samples has been challenging. In this study, we developed and validated two methods for concentrating and detecting ST/SPA from wastewater: the Moore swab trap method for qualitative results, and ultrafiltration (UF) for sensitive quantitative detection, coupled with qPCR. We then applied these methods for ST and SPA wastewater surveillance in Kolkata, India and Dhaka, Bangladesh, two enteric fever endemic areas. The qPCR assays had a limit of detection of 17 equivalent genome copies (EGC) for ST and 25 EGC for SPA with good reproducibility. In seeded trials, the Moore swab method had a limit of detection of approximately 0.05C0.005 cfu/mL for both ST and SPA. In 53 Moore swab samples collected from three Kolkata pumping stations between September 2019 and March 2020, ST was detected in 69.8% and SPA was detected in 20.8%. Analysis of sewage samples seeded with known amount of ST and SPA and concentrated via the UF method, followed by polyethylene glycol precipitation and qPCR detection demonstrated that UF can effectively recover approximately 8, 5, and 3 log(10) cfu of seeded ST and SPA in 5, 10, and 20 L of wastewater. Using the UF method in Dhaka, ST was detected in 26.7% (8/30) of 20 L drain samples with a range of 0.11C2.10 log(10) EGC per 100 mL and 100% (4/4) of 20 L canal samples with a range of 1.02C2.02 log(10) EGC per 100 mL.

Here we present a model that in addition to describing the dynamics of epidemic spreading with the traditional compartmental approach takes into account the social behaviour of the population distributed over a geographical region. The region to be modelled is defined as a two-dimensional grid of cells, in which each cell is weighted with the population density. In each cell a compartmental SEIRS system of delay difference equations is used to simulate the local dynamics of the disease. The infections between cells are modelled by a network of connections, which could be terrestrial, between neighbouring cells, or long range, between cities by air, road or train traffic. In addition, since people make trips without apparent reason, noise is considered to account for them to carry contagion between two randomly chosen distant cells. Hence, there is a clear separation of the parameters related to the biological characteristics of the disease from the ones that represent the spatial spread of infections due to social behaviour. We demonstrate that these parameters provide sufficient information to trace the evolution of the pandemic in different situations. In order to show the predictive power of this kind of approach we have chosen three, in a number of ways different countries, Mexico, Finland and Iceland, in which the pandemics have followed different dynamic paths. Furthermore we find that our model seems quite capable of reproducing the path of the pandemic for months with few initial data.

In addition to limited operative opportunities, cancellation of such courses has severely impacted surgical training, especially in a craft-based specialty such as head-neck surgery. The aim of this educational project was to: (1) study the feasibility of an in-person head-neck cadaveric dissection course during COVID-19 pandemic; and (2) validate the educational benefit of this teaching method to ear, nose and throat (ENT) trainees. METHODS: We developed a 2-day head-neck cadaveric dissection course for ENT trainees. The course programme covered essential head-neck open surgical procedures. Content validity (subjective feedback) was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. Construct validity (objective usefulness) was evaluated via two pre- and post-course questionnaires, estimating knowledge of head-neck surgical anatomy and self-assessment of levels of confidence with head-neck procedures, respectively. RESULTS: A risk assessment was conducted and a protocol developed (risk was deemed to be low/tolerable). Content validity showed high satisfaction compared with a median Likert score of 3, 'average' (p=0.000002). For construct validity, the mean score per question improved significantly (p=0.001). Overall levels of confidence showed a trend towards improvement (p=0.08). There was significant improvement in laryngectomy (p=0.01) and level I dissection (p=0.01), with an indication of improvement in level II-V dissection (p=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that a cadaveric dissection course, using thorough risk assessment and protocol, could be safely conducted with high content and construct validation during these unprecedented times.

METHODS: An online survey was carried out using a questionnaire administered to a network of interested individuals with different roles in the academic world: students, professors, and members of the Italian Network for Global Health Education. The features of courses were analysed through a score. RESULTS: A total of 61 responses were received from affiliates of 33 out of the 44 medical schools in Italy. The national mean of GH courses for each faculty was 1.2, reflecting an increase from 2007. The courses increased nationwide, resulting in a dispersed GHE presence in northern, central and southern Italy. One of the most critical points was related to the nature of elective courses, which were not mandatory in the curricula. Enrollees tended to be students genuinely interested in GH issues.

METHODS: Patients staying at least 48 h in ICU from 22 March 2020 to 25 May 2021 were included. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were analyzed. RESULTS: The median age of the sample (n = 470) was 66 years (IQR 56.0-76.0), and 64% were male. The three most common comorbidities were hypertension (49.8%), diabetes mellitus (32.8%), and coronary artery disease (25.7%). Further, 252 BSI episodes developed in 179 patients, and the BSI incidence rate was 50.2 (95% CI 44.3-56.7) per 1000 patient-days. The source of BSI is central venous catheter in 42.5% and lower respiratory tract in 38.9% of the episodes. Acinetobacter baumannii (40%) and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (21%) were the most common pathogens. CRP levels were lower in patients receiving tocilizumab. Multivariable analysis revealed that continuous renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and treatment with a combination of methylprednisolone and tocilizumab were independent risk factors for BSI.

Call volumes, ambulance dispatches, and response intervals for the 2 weeks after announcement were compared to 2017C2019 data and the week before. RESULTS: For 2 weeks following outbreak announcement, the primary\\\\level PSAP (police/fire/EMS) averaged 56% more daily calls compared to prior years and recorded 9281 (106% increase) on Day 4, averaging 400/hour. The secondary\\\\level (EMS) PSAP recorded an analogous 63% increase with 3863 calls (161/hour; 264% increase) on Day 3. The COVID\\\\19 response team processed the more complex cases (n = 5361), averaging 432  110 daily (one\\\\fifth of EMS calls). Although community COVID\\\\19 cases increased exponentially, ambulance response intervals and dispatches (averaging 1120  46 daily) were successfully contained, particularly compared with the week before (1174  40; P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: With sudden escalating EMS call volumes, rapid reorganization of dispatch operations using tailored algorithms and specially assigned personnel can protect EMS system resources by optimizing patient dispositions, controlling ambulance allocations and mitigating hospital impact.

The clear reversal in the epidemic trajectory combined with information on the timing and geographical scope of policy interventions offers the opportunity to estimate the relative contribution of each change. We developed a compartmental model of the COVID-19 epidemic in Victoria that incorporated age and geographical structure, and calibrated it to data on case notifications, deaths and health service needs according to the administrative divisions of Victoria's healthcare, termed clusters. We achieved a good fit to epidemiological indicators, at both the state level and for individual clusters, through a combination of time-varying processes that included changes to case detection rates, population mobility, school closures, seasonal forcing, physical distancing and use of face coverings. Estimates of the risk of hospitalisation and death among persons with disease that were needed to achieve this close fit were markedly higher than international estimates, likely reflecting the concentration of the epidemic in groups at particular risk of adverse outcomes, such as residential facilities. Otherwise, most fitted parameters were consistent with the existing literature on COVID-19 epidemiology and outcomes. We estimated a significant effect for each of the calibrated time-varying processes on reducing the risk of transmission per contact, with broad estimates of the reduction in transmission risk attributable to seasonal forcing (27.8%, 95% credible interval [95%CI] 9.26-44.7% for mid-summer compared to mid-winter), but narrower estimates for the individual-level effect of physical distancing of 12.5% (95%CI 5.69-27.9%) and of face coverings of 39.1% (95%CI 31.3-45.8%). That the multi-factorial public health interventions and mobility restrictions led to the dramatic reversal in the epidemic trajectory is supported by our model results, with the mandatory face coverings likely to have been particularly important.","output":"Understanding how Victoria, Australia gained control of its second COVID-19 wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe safety and immunogenicity of heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine regimens with one shot of a recombinant adenovirus type-5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine Convidecia has not been reported.

Eligible participants who were primed with one or two doses of CoronaVac were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to receive a booster dose of Convidecia or CoronaVac. Participants were masked to the vaccine received but not to the three-dose or two-dose regimen. The occurrences of adverse reactions within 28 days after the vaccination were documented. The geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies against live SARS-CoV-2 virus were measured at 14 and 28 days after the booster vaccination. ResultsBetween May 25 and 26, 2021, a total of 300 participants were enrolled. Participants who received a booster shot with a heterologous dose of Convidecia reported increased frequencies of solicited injection-site reactions than did those received a homogeneous dose of CoronaVac, but frequencies of systemic reactions.

In this study we sought to assess the impact of mental disorders and other health disparities on health-care-utilization in patients with PAH. METHODS: In a cross-sectional observational study of patients with PAH, mental disorders were characterized using a structed clinical interview. In addition, patients completed a self-administered questionnaire to assess QoL, symptoms of anxiety and depression, lifestyle-factors and educational status. Number of outpatient visits and communication events per year were calculated as a surrogate for health-care-utilization and were compared by the presence of mental disorder. Linear regression analysis was conducted to assess the impact on health-care-utilization. RESULTS: 117 patients with PAH participated in this study (70% female, median age 59 (interquartile range, 49C70) years). Significant differences between patients with or without mental disorders were found in anxiety, depression and QoL. There were no significant differences in clinical parameters. Patients with mental disorders had higher rates of outpatient visits and communication events than patients without mental disorders. Linear regression revealed a gain of 2.2 communication events per year in the presence of any mental disorders.

To expand this search, we additionally surveyed the official statements from key health agencies, organizations, and societies for relevant citations. RESULTS: Our initial database search resulted in five articles that met inclusion criteria, with 26 articles added from the expanded search. Our search did not reveal any relevant randomized clinical trials or cohort studies. We found that moist mask heating (65-80C at 50-85% relative humidity for 20-30 min) and vaporous hydrogen peroxide treatment were supported by the literature to provide consistent viral decontamination without compromising mask seal and filtration efficiency.

This is to draw attention to the setbacks the COVID-19 pandemic has caused to post-war (ie, post 2001) Afghan private education. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with the help of Afghanistans Educational Centers Association (AECA) members to analyze the impact of the COVID-19-related lockdown. The questionnaire for the survey was distributed through SurveyMonkey to founders of educational institutes. It included basic demographics, perception of and exposure to COVID-19 by the participants and the educational and financial state of their institutions. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS software version 25. RESULTS: Almost all participants who completed the questionnaire were male; 82% of them were under 35 years old, the others were older. Fifty-one percent obtained their COVID-19-related information through social media. Fifty-six percent confirmed that either they themselves or employees had tested positive with COVID-19.

METHODS: We described our monocenter experience with allogeneic HSC donors from February 1 to the October 31, 2020 to verify whether the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 screening altered the donor eligibility and/or entailed a prolongation of the evaluation process. RESULTS: A total of 21 allogeneic HSC donors were screened during the above-mentioned period upon request by the local transplant physicians or by the Italian Bone Marrow Donor Registry; among the HSC donors (n = 17) who completed the eligibility process and further received the nasopharyngeal swab, all but one were negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, volume changes in the spleen related to nutrition were studied using plethysmographic measurements. Rhythmical and regulatory functions of the spleen were demonstrated in the haemodynamics of the splanchnic region and were described as a \\"hepatolienal pendulum,\\" a \\"Windkessel function,\\" or a \\"pressure compensation.\\" These studies were mainly published in German-speaking countries and have not, as far as is known, been discussed in the English-speaking world so far. SUMMARY This review explores the historical development of the rhythmical regulatory function of the spleen in the splanchnic region. Older studies and results are followed up in the modern literature, wherever possible, up to the present. The clinical relevance is illustrated with portal hypertension (with congestive or hyperdynamic splenomegaly), coeliac disease, and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (with functional hyposplenism). Key Message: The spleen's rhythmical regulatory function in nutrition is based on an autonomous rhythm comprising cycles of contractions and dilations of the spleen of around 1 min. These cycles can be influenced by sympathetically mediated single contractions with a release of pooled blood or by portal vein congestion. After food ingestion, the spleen responds either with contraction according to a vasomotor reaction or postprandial congestion with significant increases in volume. The spleen's rhythmical function is lost in the clinical picture of portal hypertension or in coeliac disease and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. In the aforementioned gastrointestinal diseases, we recommend taking more account of the haemodynamics between the spleen, liver, and intestine. New innovative techniques for recording splenograms are required which, besides elastographic measurements of spleen stiffness, could offer an important tool for early detection, diagnosis, and therapeutic evaluation.","output":"Splenic Rhythms and Postprandial Dynamics in Physiology, Portal Hypertension, and Functional Hyposplenism: A Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging with potential increased transmissibility highlighting the great unmet medical need for new therapies.

In this report, the role of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domains of gH in membrane fusion was investigated by generating chimeric constructs in which these regions were replaced with analogous domains from other molecules and by introducing amino acid substitutions within the membrane-spanning sequence. gH molecules which lack the authentic transmembrane domain or cytoplasmic tail were unable to mediate cell-cell fusion when coexpressed with gB, gD, and gL and were unable to rescue the infectivity of a gH-null virus as efficiently as a wild-type gH molecule. Many amino acid substitutions of specific amino acid residues within the transmembrane domain also affected cell-cell fusion, in particular, those introduced at a conserved glycine residue. Some gH mutants that were impaired in cell-cell fusion were nevertheless able to rescue the infectivity of a gH-negative virus, but these pseudotyped virions entered cells more slowly than wild-type virions. These results indicate that the fusion event mediated by the coexpression of gHL, gB, and gD in cells shares common features with the fusion of the virus envelope with the plasma membrane, they point to a likely role for the membrane-spanning and cytoplasmic tail domains of gH in both processes, and they suggest that a conserved glycine residue in the membrane-spanning sequence is crucial for efficient fusion.","output":"The transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein H play a role in membrane fusion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES High-intensity laser therapy (HILT) has recently been used to control pain and symptom improvement in knee osteoarthritis.

When COVI-19 infect the upper and lower respiratory tract it can cause mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1? and IL-6. The binding of COVI-19 to the Toll Like Receptor (TLR) causes the release of pro-IL-1? which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature IL-1? which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis.

Random effects meta-analyses on the 11 RCT samples (n = 618: MBIs n = 335, controls n = 283) showed that MBIs significantly reduced binge eating severity (g = -0.39, 95% CI -0.68, -0.11) at end of trial, but was not maintained at follow-up (g = -0.06, 95% CI, -0.31, 0.20, k = 5). No evidence of publication bias was detected. On the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2, trials were rarely rated at high risk of bias and drop-out rates did not differ between MBIs and control groups. MBIs also significantly reduced depression, and improved both emotion regulation and mindfulness ability. CONCLUSION MBIs reduce binge eating severity at the end of trials. Benefits were not maintained at follow-up; however, only five studies were assessed. Future well-powered trials should focus on assessing diversity better, including more men and people from ethnic minority backgrounds.","output":"Two decades of mindfulness-based interventions for binge eating: A systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disproportionately affects individuals with various comorbidities. Among these, chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been shown to be strongly associated with the progression to severe disease. This study aimed to assess the severity and disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection and CKD. Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted at a tertiary care hospital from July 2021 to September 2021. The case records of patients with CKD and COVID-19 were studied. They were compared with age and gender-matched controls equally. The presenting symptoms, clinical course, severity of illness, laboratory markers, need for ventilator support, and mortality outcomes were studied. Results: In total, 40 CKD and 40 non-CKD patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. It was also observed that among the patients with CKD, more patients had fever, breathlessness, and diarrhea. The requirement for noninvasive ventilation, ventilator, and inotropes was on the higher average for patients with CKD. Overall mortality was 27.5% in the CKD group and 2.5% in the non-CKD group, which was statistically significant (p = 0.002). Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with CKD had more severe illnesses with a requirement of ventilator support and had higher mortality than the patients without CKD. Patients with CKD are a key subset of patients with COVID-19 for whom more aggressive early treatment and stricter preventive measures may be beneficial.","output":"Study of Disease Severity and Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease at a Tertiary Care Hospital in South India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has facilitated a shift in working arrangements.

Rescue devices were proved to increase the reperfusion rate, but the efficacy is unclear. Objective: In this retrospective study, we evaluated the efficacy of rescue therapy in different locations of LVO. Methods: We analyzed the outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy from a prospective registry of consecutive 82 patients in Taipei Medical University Hospital. The reperfusion rate and the functional outcome were compared in patients who received first-line therapy only and patients who need rescue therapy. Results: An 84.1% reperfusion rate was achieved in our cohort. We applied first-line stent retriever (SR) treatment in 6 patients, among which 4 (66.6%) achieved successful reperfusion. We applied a direct-aspiration first-pass technique (ADAPT) as the first-line treatment in 76 patients, among which 46 (60.5%) achieved successful reperfusion. Successful reperfusion could not be achieved in 30 cases (39.5%); therefore, we applied a second-line rescue SR for 28 patients, and reperfusion was established in 18 (64.3%) of them. These results revealed that the LVO in anterior circulation has a higher chance to respond to SR rescue therapy than posterior circulation lesions (68 vs. 33.3%, P < 0.001). Patients who received only first-line therapy exhibited significantly better functional outcomes than those who were also treated with rescue SR therapy (41.2 vs. 16.7%, P = 0.001). In addition, patients with LVO in the anterior circulation were found to have a higher probability of achieving functional independence than patients with posterior circulation lesions (10.7 vs. 0.0%, P < 0.001). The adjusted multivariate analysis revealed that successful reperfusion and treatment type (first-line or rescue therapy) were significantly related to a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days. Conclusion: This study reveals that rescue SR therapy improves the reperfusion rate. Patients who require rescue SR therapy have a lower likelihood of functional independence. LVO in the anterior circulation responds better to rescue SR therapy and results in better functional outcomes than posterior circulation lesions.","output":"Added Value of Rescue Devices in Intra-Arterial Thrombectomy: When Should We Apply Them?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In early April 2020, the 3-month-long city-wide lockdown was lifted in Wuhan, the epicenter of China during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic.

Therefore, it is important that the required insulin value is constant and controlled. The aim of this study is to control the blood glucose value that is achieved as a desired value and to maintain it as a constant value using a proportional, integral, and derivative control unit (FOPID) fractional order of the control parameters. In this research, the new control unit is applied to Bergman's mathematical model as a non-linear and simple model that simulates the mechanism of the interaction of glucose and insulin in the blood, and based on this, a closed control loop was designed to regulate the level of blood sugar to be an automatic control of blood glucose using the measured data from Special sensor. The contribution in this scientific paper is to define the (FOPID) parameters according to the closed loop responses of the system, and these parameters were adjusted using new meta-heuristic algorithms including the Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO), the PSO Particle Swarm optimization, the Genetic Algorithm (GA), The bat optimization algorithm (BA) and (ACO). As a result, the results of the five modern algorithms were compared based on several criteria to find out which one was better using MATLAB / SIMULINK simulation. It was found that the IWO algorithm performs better than PSO. The simulation results of the closed-loop system of this controller at the time of settling, overshoot and control inputs indicate very positive results compared to previous results. In addition, a new method has been proposed which is to design a pump in the form of a valve to control insulin pumping by controlling it with the fuzzy logic control unit, which in turn, we obtained better results, compared to the results of other previous studies. ? 2021 Lavoisier.

METHODS Semi-structured interviews were conducted with general practitioners (GPs), veterinarians, government authorities, researchers, and representatives from the farming industry. Transcripts were thematically analysed. RESULTS Six major themes were identified as key factors underpinning an effective approach to Q fever: understanding Q fever burden; effective surveillance; the role of general practitioners and other stakeholders; barriers and enablers of vaccination; an integrated approach; and increased Q fever awareness. Most participants perceived GPs to play a central role in disease detection, notification, treatment and prevention through health promotion and vaccination, despite GPs acknowledging limited awareness of Q fever. Participants suggested leadership is required from the Department of Health (DoH) to foster inter-sectoral communication and collaboration. CONCLUSIONS A One Health approach holds opportunities for zoonosis prevention. We recommend that medical curricula and professional development be enhanced, zoonosis working group networks strengthened, government-industry partnerships established, and relevant stakeholders included within an integrated program.

Recognition of viral RNA by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) activates a signaling cascade that leads to type I interferon (IFN-&#945;/?) gene transcription. Multiple proteins in this signaling pathway (e.g. RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, TBK1, IRF3) are regulated by (de)ubiquitination events. Most viruses have evolved mechanisms to counter this antiviral response. The leader protease (Lpro) of foot-and-mouth-disease virus (FMDV) has been recognized to reduce IFN-&#945;/? gene transcription; however, the exact mechanism is unknown. The proteolytic activity of Lpro is vital for releasing itself from the viral polyprotein and for cleaving and degrading specific host cell proteins, such as eIF4G and NF-&#954;B. In addition, Lpro has been demonstrated to have deubiquitination/deISGylation activity. Lpro's deubiquitination/deISGylation activity and the cleavage/degradation of signaling proteins have both been postulated to be important for reduced IFN-&#945;/? gene transcription. Here, we demonstrate that TBK1, the kinase that phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor IRF3, is cleaved by Lpro in FMDV-infected cells as well as in cells infected with a recombinant EMCV expressing Lpro. In vitro cleavage experiments revealed that Lpro cleaves TBK1 at residues 692-694. We also observed cleavage of MAVS in HeLa cells infected with EMCV-Lpro, but only observed decreasing levels of MAVS in FMDV-infected porcine LFPK &#945;V?6 cells. We set out to dissect Lpro's ability to cleave RLR signaling proteins from its deubiquitination/deISGylation activity to determine their relative contributions to the reduction of IFN-&#945;/? gene transcription. The introduction of specific mutations, of which several were based on the recently published structure of Lpro in complex with ISG15, allowed us to identify specific amino acid substitutions that separate the different proteolytic activities of Lpro. Characterization of the effects of these mutations revealed that Lpro's ability to cleave RLR signaling proteins but not its deubiquitination/deISGylation activity correlates with the reduced IFN-? gene transcription.","output":"Dissecting distinct proteolytic activities of FMDV Lpro implicates cleavage and degradation of RLR signaling proteins, not its deISGylase/DUB activity, in type I interferon suppression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Video Description: Designing and implementing clinical trials for novel infectious disease treatments brings many challenges, especially during a rapidly evolving pandemic A new disease brings uncertainties arising from an imperfect understanding about illness, limited information about proposed countermeasures, and complexities in measuring relevant patient outcomes A pandemic adds an overloaded medical system with limited resources for research, heightened pressure to find cures quickly, and unpredictability about potential case numbers I will discuss issues related to designing and conducting treatment trials in outbreaks of Ebola and COVID [coronavirus disease] based on my experience with three studies: Prevail II (the West African Ebola virus disease study of ZMapp), PALM (the Democratic Republic of the Congo Ebola virus disease study of ZMapp, mAb114, REGN-EB3 and remdesivir) and ACTT-1 (the multinational, platform COVID-19 study of remdesivir vs placebo) The duration of the video is 57 minutes and 48 seconds COVID-19 (Disease);Clinical trials;Epidemics;Ebola virus disease","output":"Clinical Trials in Public Health Emergencies: The Ebola and COVID Experiences [video]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare data in Ireland is often fragmented and siloed making it difficult to access and use, and of the data that is digitized, it is rarely standardised from the perspective of data interoperability.

Twenty-two patients and 13 family members were interviewed one-to-one about their experiences and challenges caused by the pandemic and home-confinement directives. Verbatim transcripts of the interviews were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Five overarching themes were identified: (1) changing point of reference: confusion and legitimization of OCD behavior, (2) coping strategies were challenged: too much or too little exposure to obsessional concerns, (3) distress but also relief in some areas, (4) developing a new equilibrium within the family, (5) changes in accessibility and nature of therapy: perils and merits of online treatment. These findings make clear the importance of the accessibility of mental health services during this pandemic through direct patient contacts or in a remote format. In therapy therapists should focus on challenging the changing point of reference, providing practical advice on coping, stimulating to engage in exposure and encouraging patients to seek social support.

However, tremendous efforts have been made worldwide to counter-steer and control the epidemic by now labelled as pandemic. In this contribution, we provide an overview on the potential for computer audition (CA), i.e., the usage of speech and sound analysis by artificial intelligence to help in this scenario. We first survey which types of related or contextually significant phenomena can be automatically assessed from speech or sound. These include the automatic recognition and monitoring of COVID-19 directly or its symptoms such as breathing, dry, and wet coughing or sneezing sounds, speech under cold, eating behaviour, sleepiness, or pain to name but a few. Then, we consider potential use-cases for exploitation. These include risk assessment and diagnosis based on symptom histograms and their development over time, as well as monitoring of spread, social distancing and its effects, treatment and recovery, and patient well-being. We quickly guide further through challenges that need to be faced for real-life usage and limitations also in comparison with non-audio solutions. We come to the conclusion that CA appears ready for implementation of (pre-)diagnosis and monitoring tools, and more generally provides rich and significant, yet so far untapped potential in the fight against COVID-19 spread.","output":"COVID-19 and Computer Audition: An Overview on What Speech & Sound Analysis Could Contribute in the SARS-CoV-2 Corona Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to identify service user demographic and clinical characteristics of an acute mental health service in South Auckland during the first New Zealand coronavirus-related lockdown.

The response strategy included early diagnosis, patient isolation, symptomatic monitoring of contacts as well as suspected and confirmed cases, and public health quarantine. In this context, telemedicine, particularly video consultations, has been promoted and scaled up to reduce the risk of transmission, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Based on a literature review, the first conceptual framework for telemedicine implementation during outbreaks was published in 2015. An updated framework for telemedicine in the COVID-19 pandemic has been defined. This framework could be applied at a large scale to improve the national public health response. Most countries, however, lack a regulatory framework to authorize, integrate, and reimburse telemedicine services, including in emergency and outbreak situations. In this context, Italy does not include telemedicine in the essential levels of care granted to all citizens within the National Health Service, while France authorized, reimbursed, and actively promoted the use of telemedicine.

The incidence of persistent CMO (pCMO; defined as CMO present after 3 months) following uncomplicated surgery is uncertain. We wished to identify the incidence, management and visual outcomes of such patients. METHODS: A Scottish Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit (SOSU) questionnaire was sent monthly to every ophthalmic specialist in Scotland over an 18-month period from 1st January 2018 asking them to report all new patients with pCMO confirmed on OCT scanning following uncomplicated cataract surgery. A follow-up questionnaire was sent 9 months after initial presentation. RESULTS: Fourteen cases of pCMO were reported, giving an incidence of 2.2 cases of pCMO per 10,000 uncomplicated cataract surgeries. Mean age was 74.9 years (SD 10.2; range 44C86) with a male preponderance (72.7%). Two patients developed pCMO in each eye. Six cases (46.2%) had hypertension and one had diabetes. Three eyes required intracameral adjuncts (two iris hooks, one intracameral phenylephrine). Postoperative visual acuity (VA) at 3 months was logMAR 0.48 (0.2C0.8). Average mean central retinal thickness (CRT) at 3 months was 497microns (270C788). The most common initial treatment comprised topical steroids and topical NSAIDs (61.5%).

AIMS: This study aims to compare the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with cancer (with and without COVID-19) and characterize the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: Real-world data (RWD) from two health systems were used to identify 146 702 adults diagnosed with cancer between 2015 and 2020; 1267 COVID-19 cases were identified between February 1 and July 30, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic characteristics were extracted. Incidence of all-cause mortality, hospitalizations, and invasive respiratory support was assessed between February 1 and August 14, 2020. Among patients with cancer, patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be Non-Hispanic black (NHB), have active cancer, have comorbidities, and/or live in zip codes with median household income <$30 000. Patients with COVID-19 living in lower-income areas and NHB patients were at greatest risk for hospitalization from pneumonia, fluid and electrolyte disorders, cough, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure and were more likely to receive hydroxychloroquine. All-cause mortality, hospital admission, and invasive respiratory support were more frequent among patients with cancer and COVID-19. Male sex, increasing age, living in zip codes with median household income <$30 000, history of pulmonary circulation disorders, and recent treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy were associated with greater odds of all-cause mortality in multivariable logistic regression models. CONCLUSION: RWD can be rapidly leveraged to understand urgent healthcare challenges. Patients with cancer are more vulnerable to COVID-19 effects, especially in the setting of active cancer and comorbidities, with additional risk observed in NHB patients and those living in zip codes with median household income <$30 000.","output":"Rapid real-world data analysis of patients with cancer, with and without COVID-19, across distinct health systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

We explored the association between stroke subtypes and COVID-19 susceptibility to understand whether biological mechanisms specific to SARS-CoV-2 uptake/infection could be leading to excess stroke risk in this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We constructed a polygenic risk score (PRS) of COVID-19 susceptibility and tested its association with stroke subtypes using individual- and summary-level genetic data (SiGN, MEGASTROKE). We generated co-expression networks of genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 uptake/infection (ACE2, TMPRSS2, BEST3, ISLR2 and ADAM17) based on existing tissue expression libraries. Gene-based association testing was performed using S-PrediXcan and VEGAS2. Permutation independence tests were performed to assess SARS-CoV-2-related gene enrichment in stroke and its subtypes. RESULTS: Our PRS demonstrated an association between COVID-19 susceptibility and LAS in SiGN (OR = 1.05 per SD increase, 95% CI: (1.00, 1.10), p = 0.04) and MEGASTROKE (? = 0.510, 95% CI: (0.242, 0.779), FDR-p = 0.0019). The SARS-CoV-2 risk-related ISLR2 co-expression gene network was significantly associated with genetic risk of LAS in aorta, tibial arteries, and multiple brain regions (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Presence of genetic correlation and significant pathway enrichment suggest that increases in LAS risk reported in COVID-19 patients may be intrinsic to the viral infection, rather than a more generalized response to severe illness.","output":"Shared genetic background between SARS-CoV-2 infection and large artery stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to examine health-related quality of life of adolescents before and during the COVID-19 outbreak, and its relationship to resilience embodied in hope and a sense of coherence. Typically developed adolescents between the ages of 13 to 18 participated in the study; 84 were recruited before the pandemic outbreak and 64 in March to April 2020 during the worldwide outbreak. The participants completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Sense of Coherence Scale, and Childrens Hope Scale. During the outbreak, adolescents reported higher physical health-related quality of life scores (F(1146) = 3.710, p < 0.05, 2 = 0.027) and lower school health-related quality of life scores (F(1146) = 5.748, p < 0.05, (2) = 0.028), compared to adolescents during the pre-outbreak period. Furthermore, adolescents during the outbreak reported a significantly (p < 0.05) higher sense of coherence but no difference in levels of hope. Finally, the results of multiple linear regression indicated that resilience factors (hope and sense of coherence) contributed to the prediction of health-related quality of life, independent of socio-demographic variables. Hope and a sense of coherence were both found to positively impact one core aspect of health, which highlights the importance of addressing resilience factors in educational and therapeutic settings for adolescents thus that they are better able to adapt to stressful events such as pandemics.","output":"Adolescents and Resilience: Factors Contributing to Health-Related Quality of Life during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death attributed to a single infectious organism.

One of the principal barriers to vaccine development against M. tuberculosis is the complexity of the immune response to infection, with uncertainty as to what constitutes an immunological correlate of protection. In this paper, we seek to give an overview of the immunology of M. tuberculosis infection, and by doing so, investigate possible targets of vaccine development. This encompasses the innate, adaptive, mucosal and humoral immune systems. Though MVA85A did not improve protection compared with BCG alone in a large-scale clinical trial, the correlates of protection this has revealed, in addition to promising results from candidate such as VPM1002, M72/ASO1E and H56:IC31 point to a brighter future in the field of TB vaccine development.","output":"Towards new TB vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is good evidence that colorectal cancer (CRC) screening has been successful at reducing both CRC incidence and death. Colonoscopy, utilized as either a primary screening tool or a follow-up exam when other screening tests are positive, has significantly contributed to these encouraging trends. However, it is well recognized that colonoscopy is not perfectly sensitive for the detection of neoplasia and that CRC can be diagnosed within a short interval following a colonoscopy that did not detect one. The literature surrounding these cases has rapidly expanded over the last decade. Specifically, studies aimed at understanding the frequency of these events and the likely explanations for their occurrence have been performed. This review will highlight current knowledge around the epidemiology of interval post colonoscopy CRC (PCCRC). The common explanations for these cancers including missed lesions, new lesions, and incompletely resected lesions will be reviewed and their contribution to interval PCCRC estimated. Finally, the relationship of these putative explanations to potential opportunities to prevent interval PCCRC will be explored. Current approaches to prevention largely center on consistent adherence to quality colonoscopy standards. Future approaches include advances in technology to better visualize the colon and adequately resect detected neoplasia.

The identification of potential drug candidates that can rapidly enter clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is an urgent need, despite the recent introduction of several new vaccines for the prevention and protection of this infectious disease, which in many cases becomes severe. Drug repurposing (DR), a process for studying existing pharmaceutical products for new therapeutic indications, represents one of the most effective potential strategies employed to increase the success rate in the development of new drug therapies. We identified raloxifene, a known Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM), as a potential pharmacological agent for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Following a virtual screening campaign on the most relevant viral protein targets, in this work we report the results of the first pharmacological characterization of raloxifene in relevant cellular models of COVID-19 infection. The results obtained on all the most common viral variants originating in Europe, United Kingdom, Brazil, South Africa and India, currently in circulation, are also reported, confirming the efficacy of raloxifene and, consequently, the relevance of the proposed approach. Taken together, all the information gathered supports the clinical development of raloxifene and confirms that the drug can be proposed as a viable new option to fight the pandemic in at least some patient populations.

How does the COVID-19 epidemic influence consumption? Using high-frequency payment system panel data, we explicitly consider the individual consumption changes and the substitution effect between online and offline markets of multiple categories by constructing autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models and conducting regression analyses. The p value and regression coefficients of the substitution elasticity are used to estimate the changes and the substitution effects from the offline to the online channels. The results show that consumption saw a remarkable decline after the surge of COVID-19 in 2020 compared to 2019. Overall, online markets were more resilient than the offline markets and the substitution effects after the epidemic's outbreak between the online and offline markets were significant for one-third of the consumption categories. However, the online market could not replace the offline market for some categories due to the product characteristics. The vulnerable industries in the face of the epidemic's intervention are determined as being traditional catering, transportation, tourism, and education, and the shortage of healthcare services in extreme events is also pointed out.

However, constraints in sharing medical data outside the institutional or geographical space, as well as difficulties in getting AI models and modeling platforms to work across different environments, have led to a reproducibility crisis in digital medicine. METHODS: This study details the implementation of a web platform that can be used to mitigate these challenges by orchestrating a digital pathology AI pipeline, from raw data to model inference, entirely on the local machine. We discuss how this federated platform provides governed access to data by consuming the Application Program Interfaces exposed by cloud storage services, allows the addition of user-defined annotations, facilitates active learning for training models iteratively, and provides model inference computed directly in the web browser at practically zero cost. The latter is of particular relevance to clinical workflows because the code, including the AI model, travels to the users data, which stays private to the governance domain where it was acquired RESULTS: We demonstrate that the web browser can be a means of democratizing AI and advancing data socialization in medical imaging backed by consumer-facing cloud infrastructure such as Box.com. As a case study, we test the accompanying platform end-to-end on a large dataset of digital breast cancer tissue microarray core images. We also showcase how it can be applied in contexts separate from digital pathology by applying it to a radiology dataset containing COVID-19 computed tomography images.

Limiting phosphate and iron in growth media induced expression of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from the P. tricornutum HASP1 promoter in the wild-type strain and in a histidine auxotrophic strain that alleviates the requirement for antibiotic selection of expression plasmids. The RBD was purified from whole cell extracts (algae-RBD) with yield compromised by the finding that 90C95% of expressed RBD lacked the genetically encoded C-terminal 6X-histidine tag. Constructs that lacked the TEV protease site between the RBD and C-terminal 6X-histidine tag retained the tag, increasing yield.

Recent studies have shown that Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 virus interacts with the nuclear export receptor complex, which includes nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1) and nuclear transport factor 2-like export factor 1 (NXT1). The NXF1CNXT1 complex plays a crucial role in the transport of host messenger RNA (mRNA). Nsp1 interferes with the proper binding of NXF1 to mRNA export adaptors and its docking to the nuclear pore complex. We propose that drugs targeting the binding surface between Nsp1 and NXF1CNXT1 may be a useful strategy to restore host antiviral gene expression. Exploring this strategy forms the main goals of this paper. Crystal structures of Nsp1 and the heterodimer of NXF1CNXT1 have been determined. We modeled the docking of Nsp1 to the NXF1CNXT1 complex, and discovered repurposed drugs that may interfere with this binding. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at drug-repurposing of this complex. We used structural analysis to screen 1993 FDA-approved drugs for docking to the NXF1CNXT1 complex. The top hit was ganirelix, with a docking score of ?14.49. Ganirelix competitively antagonizes the gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor (GNRHR) on pituitary gonadotrophs, and induces rapid, reversible suppression of gonadotropin secretion. The conformations of Nsp1 and GNRHR make it unlikely that they interact with each other. Additional drug leads were inferred from the structural analysis of this complex, which are discussed in the paper. These drugs offer several options for therapeutically blocking Nsp1 binding to NFX1CNXT1, which may normalize nuclear export in COVID-19 infection.","output":"Understanding COVID-19 Pathogenesis: A Drug-Repurposing Effort to Disrupt Nsp-1 Binding to Export Machinery Receptor Complex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[...]these dramatic changes have also had positive impacts, such as the majority of people WFH welcoming the change and some reporting higher efficiency and productivity (Ipsen et al., 2021).

The dependence on non-standard algorithms makes it hard to integrate segmented models in state-of-the-art deep learning architectures that critically depend on gradient-based optimization techniques. In this work, we formulate a relaxed variant of segmented models that enables joint estimation of all model parameters, including the segmentation, with gradient descent.

Since many measurements are of relatively short duration (seconds to hours), a tool is needed to estimate emissions over these time scales rather than the annual totals reported in most emission inventories. This work presents a tool for estimating routine emissions from oil and gas well sites at multiple time scales; emissions at well sites vary over time due to changes in oil and gas production rates, operating practices and operational modes at the sites. Distributions of routine emissions (expected and inventoried) from well sites are generally skewed, and the nature and degree to which the distributions are skewed depends on the time scales over which emissions are aggregated. Abnormal emissions can create additional skew in these distributions. At very short time scales (emissions aggregated over 1a?min) case study distributions presented in this work are both skewed and bimodal, with the modes depending on whether liquid storage tanks are flashing at the time of the measurement and whether abnormal emissions are occurring. At longer time scales (emissions aggregated over 1a?day) distributions of routine emissions simulated in this work can have multiple modes if short duration, high emission rate events, such as liquid unloadings or large abnormal emissions, occur at the site. Multiple applications of the methane emission estimation tool (MEET), developed in this work, are presented. These results emphasize the importance of developing detailed emission inventories, which incorporate operational data, when comparing measurements to routine emissions.

Caveolae are integral to numerous signaling pathways and these membrane domains have been previously implicated in viral entry but not antiviral defense. This study shows, for the first time, the importance of spatio-temporal regulation of signaling receptors and the importance of the regulation of clustering for downstream signaling. A novel mechanism for virus evasion of host cell defenses is demonstrated through disruption of clusters of signaling molecules organized within caveolin-rich domains. Viral infection leads to a downregulation in Caveolin-1b (Cav-1b), disrupting clusters of CRFB1, a zebrafish type I interferon receptor (CR) subunit. Super-resolution microscopy has enabled the first single-molecule imaging of CRFB1 association with cav-1b-containing membrane domains. Strikingly, downregulation of Cav-1b, the major protein component of caveolae, caused CRFB1 clusters to disperse. Dispersal of CRFB1 clusters led to a suppressed antiviral immune response both in vitro and in vivo, through abrogation of downstream signaling. This response strongly suggests that CRFB1 organization within cav-1b-containing membrane domains is critical for IFN-mediated antiviral defense and presents a previously undescribed antiviral evasion strategy to alter IFN signaling and the antiviral immune response.","output":"Super Resolution Microscopy Reveals that Caveolin-1 Is Required for Spatial Organization of CRFB1 and Subsequent Antiviral Signaling in Zebrafish"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the development of vaccines and the emergence of various treatments for COVID-19, the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is increasing worldwide, and it is unlikely that the disease will ever disappear completely.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic coloanal anastomosis is an attractive new surgical option in patients with low rectal cancer because laparotomy is not necessary due to transanal specimen extraction. Risks of tumor spillage and fecal incontinence induced by transanal extraction are not known. METHODS Between 2000 and 2010, 220 patients with low rectal cancer underwent laparoscopic rectal excision with hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis. The rectal specimen was extracted transanally in 122 patients and transabdominally in 98 patients. End points were circumferential resection margin, mesorectal grade, local recurrence, survival, and functional outcome. RESULTS The mortality rate was 0.5% and surgical morbidity rate was 17%. The rate of positive circumferential resection margin was 9% and the mesorectum was graded complete in 79%, subcomplete in 12%, and incomplete in 9%. After a follow-up of 51 months (range, 1-151), the local recurrence rate was 4% and overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 83% and 70% at 5 years, respectively. The continence score was 6 (range, 0-20). There was no difference of mortality rate, morbidity rate, circumferential resection margin, mesorectal grade, local recurrence (4% vs 5%, P = 0.98), and disease-free survival rate (72% vs 68%, P = 0.63) between transanal and transabdominal extraction groups. Continence score was also similar (6 vs 6, P = 0.92).

The population that particularly has been affected by the pandemic is the group of patients suffering from diabetes mellitus. Having taken the public health in considerations, we have decided to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of diabetes mellitus on in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature review (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane) including all published clinical trials or observational studies published till December 10, 2020, was performed using following terms \\"diabetes mellitus\\" OR \\"diabetes\\" OR \\"DM\\" AND \\"survival\\" OR \\"mortality\\" AND \\"SARS-CoV-2\\" OR \\"COVID-19\\". RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included out of the 7327 initially identified studies. Mortality of DM patients vs non-DM patients was 21.3 versus 6.1%, respectively (OR = 2.39; 95%CI: 1.65, 3.64; P < 0.001), while severe disease in DM and non-DM group varied and amounted to 34.8% versus 22.8% (OR = 1.43; 95%CI: 0.82, 2.50; P = 0.20). In the DM group, the complications were observed far more often when compared with non-DM group, both in acute respiratory distress (31.4 vs. 17.2%; OR = 2.38; 95%CI:1.80, 3.13; P < 0.001), acute cardiac injury (22.0% vs. 12.8%; OR = 2.59; 95%CI: 1.81, 3.73; P < 0.001), and acute kidney injury (19.1 vs. 10.2%; OR = 1.97; 95%CI: 1.36, 2.85; P < 0.001).

Methods: A total of 4677 medical staff from 348 hospitals in 31 provinces of China were investigated by an online survey based on \\"questionnaire star\\" from February 17 to 24, 2020. A self-designed questionnaire was used to collection information of social-demographic characteristics and mental health service demands. Psychological problem was defined if the screening results of any of the following instruments were positive, including Self Report Questionnaire for emotional pain, Self-rating Anxiety Scale for anxiety symptoms, and Self-rating Depression Scale for depression symptoms. Mental health service demands were recorded according to the self-report of the respondents. Results: Prevalence of psychological problem was 39. 3% and the demands of mental health services among medical staff with any psychological problem was 27. 2%. The results of multivariate analysis showed that fewer instruments with positive screening results ( only one instrument, OR = 3. 02, 95% CI: 2.35  3. 89, two instruments, OR = 1. 65, 95% CI: 1.26  2. 16), aged 29 and less ( OR = 1. 66, 95% CI: 1. 01  2.74), working in departments with lower risk ( OR = 1. 28, 95% CI: 1. 003  1. 64), and no epidemic isolation from themselves or the people around them ( OR = 1. 54, 95% CI: 1. 09 2. 18) were associated with less mental health service demands. There were significant differences among the intentions to the provided methods of mental health services among medical staff with different types of screening results. Promoting health knowledge by mobile phone was the top intention in each subgroup. Conclusion: The rate of mental health service demands for medical staff with psychological problems is relatively low during the COVID-19 epidemic. Different intervention methods should be used for different populations during the psychological interventions.

Here, we demonstrate that the repeating protein subunit pattern common to most virus capsids is a molecular pattern that induces a Toll-like-receptor-2 (TLR2)-dependent antiviral immune response. This early antiviral immune response regulates the clearance of subsequent bacterial superinfections, which are a primary cause of morbidities associated with influenza virus infections. Utilizing this altered susceptibility to subsequent bacterial challenge as an outcome, we determined that multiple unrelated, empty, and replication-deficient capsids initiated early TLR2-dependent immune responses, similar to intact influenza virus or murine pneumovirus. These TLR2-mediated responses driven by the capsid were not dependent upon the capsids shape, size, origin, or amino acid sequence. However, they were dependent upon the multisubunit arrangement of the capsid proteins, because unlike intact capsids, individual capsid subunits did not enhance bacterial clearance. Further, we demonstrated that even a linear microfilament protein built from repeating protein subunits (F-actin), but not its monomer (G-actin), induced similar kinetics of subsequent bacterial clearance as did virus capsid. However, although capsids and F-actin induced similar bacterial clearance, in macrophages they required distinct TLR2 heterodimers for this response (TLR2/6 or TLR2/1, respectively) and different phagocyte populations were involved in the execution of these responses in vivo. Our results demonstrate that TLR2 responds to invading viral particles that are composed of repeating protein subunits, indicating that this common architecture of virus capsids is a previously unrecognized molecular pattern.","output":"Induction of Antiviral Immune Response through Recognition of the Repeating Subunit Pattern of Viral Capsids Is Toll-Like Receptor 2 Dependent"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leishmania protozoans are the causal agents of neglected diseases that represent an important public health issue worldwide.

The objective of the current study was to provide an updated overview of the published evidence on the exposure to pathogens among non-healthcare workers. Because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, we also aimed to gain more evidence about exposure to several respiratory tract pathogens. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified in MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane between 2009 and 8 December 2020. The protocol was registered with International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42019107265). An additional quality assessment was applied according to the Equator network guidelines. RESULTS: The systematic literature search yielded 4620 papers of which 270 met the selection and quality criteria. Infectious disease risks were described in 37 occupational groups; 18 of them were not mentioned before. Armed forces (n=36 pathogens), livestock farm labourers (n=31), livestock/dairy producers (n=26), abattoir workers (n=22); animal carers and forestry workers (both n=16) seemed to have the highest risk.

The current research addressed the mechanisms underlying a sharp increase in the detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) observed in a closed-management unit of elderly patients with mental disorders in 2020 as compared with the previous 4 years. We first conducted microbial detection in staff-hand and environment and a molecular epidemiology analysis, rejecting the hypothesis that the MRSA increase was due to an outbreak. Afterward, we turned to disinfectant concentration and frequency of use and analyzed the varied MRSA detection rates with different concentrations and frequencies of disinfection in 2020 and the previous 4 years. The MRSA detection rate increased with elevated concentration and frequency of disinfection, with 1,000 or 500 mg/L two times per day since January in 2020 vs. 500 mg/L 2C3 times per week in 2016C2019. When the disinfectant concentration was reduced from 1,000 to 500 mg/L, the MRSA detection decreased which indicated a modulatory role of disinfectant concentration. With a sustained frequency of disinfection in 2020, the MRSA detection rate was still higher, even after May, than that in the previous years. This suggested that the frequency of disinfection also contributed to the MRSA increase. Overall, the MRSA detection was augmented with the increase in disinfection concentration and frequency during the COVID-19 epidemic, suggesting that highly-concentrated and highly-frequent preventive long-term disinfection is not recommended without risk assessments in psychiatric hospitals.","output":"High Concentration and Frequent Application of Disinfection Increase the Detection of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Infections in Psychiatric Hospitals During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a model based on discrete latent variables, which are spatially associated and time specific, for the analysis of incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Here we present a challanging case of a patient successfully treated in Vietnam, using limited medical resources. The patient (22 month old, male) was diagnosed with congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation in his 1st hospital admission. After 6 months of onset, the patient was diagnosed with PPB type II in the fourth hospitalization following analysis of a lung CT scan and a pathology report. After the aggressive chemotherapy regimen, the patient had two episodes of severe neutropenia and infection from which he recovered. The patient received chemotherapy and surgery treatment at our hospital, but received radiation under general anesthesia and rehabilitation therapy to improve respiration at another hospital over 600 km away. It has been 1.5 years after entering remission, and he is starting kindergarten. Lung CT scan and pathology should be analyzed to avoid missing diagnosis of PPB in patients with cystic or mixed cystic and solid lung lesions. Biopsies from cases of suspected PPB should be sent for expert pathology review. Two factors important to the successful application of the protocol are good supportive care and the multidisciplinary collaboration between medical facilities to provide proper resources during treatment.

SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by targeting the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is present on endothelial cells in the lung, heart, kidney, and gastrointestinal tissue. The pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in SARS-CoV-2 infection has a component of lung perfusion dysregulation and is described as a \\"cytokine storm\\" that causes increased vascular permeability and disease severity.

The standard for SARS-CoV-2 testing is through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, which has presented problems due to low sensitivity and possible co-infection with other pathogens. Treatment for ARDS in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 should follow pre-established goals of care and the wishes of the patient and family members or caregivers and consider the high risk for polypharmacy, cognitive decline, malnutrition, and depression, particularly in older adults.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a national, prospective cohort study of all hospitalized pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from 01/03/2020 to 31/08/2020 using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System. Incidence rates were estimated using national maternity data. Overall, 1148 hospitalized women had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy, 63% of which were symptomatic. The estimated incidence of hospitalization with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was 2.0 per 1000 maternities (95% CI 1.9-2.2) and for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was 1.2 per 1000 maternities (95% CI 1.1-1.4). Compared to pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2, women hospitalized with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be overweight or obese (adjusted OR 1.86, (95% CI 1.39-2.48) and aOR 2.07 (1.53-2.29)), to be of Black, Asian or Other minority ethnic group (aOR 6.24, (3.93-9.90), aOR 4.36, (3.19-5.95) and aOR 12.95, (4.93-34.01)), and to have a relevant medical comorbidity (aOR 1.83 (1.32-2.54)). Hospitalized pregnant women with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be admitted to intensive care (aOR 57.67, (7.80-426.70)) but the absolute risk of poor outcomes was low.

However, these biotextiles are commonly manufactured with fibers with diameters on the micrometer scale (> 10 m). Recently, nanofibrous materials have aroused extensive attention in the fields of fiber science and textile engineering because the fibers with nanoscale diameters exhibited obviously superior performances, such as size and surface/interface effects as well as optical, electrical, mechanical, and biological properties, compared to microfibers. A combination of innovative electrospinning techniques and traditional textile-forming strategies opens a new window for the generation of nanofibrous biotextiles to renew and update traditional microfibrous biotextiles.

Both experts and workshops attendees from protected municipalities overwhelmingly attributed depopulation figures to structural causes linked to transport accessibility, basic service provision and the existence of job opportunities, which they perceived to be unrelated to the PAs regulations or management. Local residents did generally not perceive any impact on their collective or individual wellbeing from those PAs, and most who did, expressed a negative impact chiefly due to socioeconomic restrictions. Four-fifths of the experts and half of the workshops attendees from protected municipalities, however, expressed that PAs administrations could help improve depopulation figures in their towns mainly through promoting tourism and greater compatibility of land uses, including housing and infrastructure development. While the assessed Natura 2000 sites certainly have scope for tourism promotion, their lenient legal regimes make it largely unfeasible to broaden land use compatibility without damaging protected features.","output":"Protected Areas and Rural Depopulation in Spain: A Multi-Stakeholder Perceptual Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A critical goal of patient management for anesthesiologists and intensivists is to maintain oxygen homeostasis in patients admitted to operation theaters and intensive care units. For this purpose, it is imperative to understand the strategies of the body against oxygen imbalance-especially oxygen deficiency (hypoxia). Adaptation to hypoxia and maintenance of oxygen homeostasis involve a wide range of responses that occur at different organizational levels in the body. These responses are greatly influenced by perioperative patient management including factors such as perioperative drugs. Herein, the influence of perioperative patient management on the body's response to oxygen imbalance was reviewed with a special emphasis on hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), transcription factors whose activity are regulated by the perturbation of oxygen metabolism. The 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to three researchers who made outstanding achievements in this field. While previous studies have reported the effect of perioperatively used drugs on hypoxia-induced gene expression mediated by HIFs, this review focused on effects of subacute or chronic hypoxia changes in gene expression that are mediated by the transcriptional regulator HIFs. The clinical implications and perspectives of these findings also will be discussed. Understanding the basic biology of the transcription factor HIF can be informative for us since anesthesiologists manage patients during the perioperative period facing the imbalances the oxygen metabolism in organ and tissue. The clinical implications of hypoxia-dependent signaling in critical illness, including Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in which disturbances in oxygen metabolism play a major role in its pathogenesis will also be discussed.","output":"Hypoxia-dependent signaling in perioperative and critical care medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SNS (sympathetic nervous system) activation is a common feature of arterial hypertension and has been demonstrated to contribute to the development and progression of the hypertensive state. Persuasive evidence suggests a strong association between SNS overactivity and variety of disease states, including chronic renal failure, insulin resistance, congestive heart failure, sleep apnoea, ventricular arrhythmias and others. Although sympatholytic agents are available to target SNS overactivity pharmacologically, they are not widely used in clinical practice, leaving the SNS unopposed in many patients. The recent introduction of catheter-based renal denervation as an alternative approach to target the SNS therapeutically has been demonstrated to result in a clinically relevant blood pressure reduction in patients with resistant hypertension, presumably through its effects on both efferent and afferent renal nerve traffic. Available data on this interventional procedure demonstrate a favourable vascular and renal safety profile. Preliminary data obtained primarily from small and mostly uncontrolled studies in related disease states often characterized by overactivity of the SNS are promising, but require confirmation in appropriately designed clinical trials. In the present paper, we briefly review the physiology of the renal nerves and their role in hypertension and other relevant disease states, summarize the data currently available from clinical studies pertaining to the safety and efficacy of renal denervation in resistant hypertension, discuss potential future implications and the available data supporting such a role for renal denervation, and describe some of the newer devices currently under investigation to achieve improved blood pressure control via renal denervation.","output":"Renal denervation: current implications and future perspectives."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of a larger study on the spread of COVID-19 related mis/disinformation in Italy, we detected a network of 26 Facebook Pages that performed Coordinated Link Sharing.

Since drug development is an expensive, intense and time-consuming path, timely repurposing of the existing drugs is often explored wherein the research avenues including genomics, bioinformatics, molecular modeling approaches offer valuable strengths. Here, we have examined the binding potential of Withaferin-A (Wi-A), Withanone (Wi-N) (active withanolides of Ashwagandha) and Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester (CAPE, bioactive ingredient of propolis) to a highly conserved protein, Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. We found that Wi-N and CAPE, but not Wi-A, bind to the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with efficacy and binding energies equivalent to an already claimed N3 protease inhibitor. Similar to N3 inhibitor, Wi-N and CAPE were interacting with the highly conserved residues of the proteases of coronaviruses. The binding stability of these molecules was further analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations. The binding free energies calculated using MM/GBSA for N3 inhibitor, CAPE and Wi-N were also comparable. Data presented here predicted that these natural compounds may possess the potential to inhibit the functional activity of SARS-CoV-2 protease (an essential protein for virus survival), and hence (i) may connect to save time and cost required for designing/development, and initial screening for anti-COVID drugs, (ii) may offer some therapeutic value for the management of novel fatal coronavirus disease, (iii) warrants prioritized further validation in the laboratory and clinical tests.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

In this context, the anterior approach becomes an important technique. However, one of the main limitations of this methods is the need for dedicated retractors, which requires larger incisions for its positioning and increases the cost of the procedure. The objective of the present study is to describe a technique for retracting abdominal structures by anterior approaches to the lumbar spine using Steinmann's wires. METHODS: This manuscript consists in a technique description of anterior approach for lumbar spine. RESULTS: Surgical treatment of degenerative lumbar spine disease is often necessary when the patients have symptoms refractory to conservative treatments. Many of them will be candidates for surgical treatment due to anterior approach, either for arthrodesis/ALIF or arthroplasty. Small incisions are performed for positioning the modified Langenbeck retractors and the Steinmann wires. These retractors are easily positioned and provide good exposure of the lumbar discs making it possible to implant appropriate cages for restoring the necessary height, lordosis and sagittal balance.

Due to the limited results, until specific treatments are available, other therapeutic approaches need to be considered.

Its activation can lead to beneficial results such as decreased viral entry, decreased viral replication, and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-&#945;, or IFN-?3. Moreover, endocannabinoid system activation can lead to an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines, mainly represented by IL-10. Overall, the cannabinoid system can potentially reduce pulmonary inflammation, increase the immunomodulatory effect, decrease PMN infiltration, reduce fibrosis, and decrease viral replication, as well as decrease the 'cytokine storm'.

Real-time PCR, reverse transcriptase PCR, isothermal PCR, immunological-based detection technique and nano-based diagnostic system have been explained for the identification and differentiation of different types of virus including SARS-COV-2. Synthetic nanoparticles can closely mimic the virus and interact strongly with its virulent proteins due to their morphological similarities. Some of the antiviral nanomaterials are also discussed, for example zinc oxide nanoparticle is an antiviral agent with a tetrapod morphology that mimics the cell surface by interacting with the viral capsid. It suppressed the viral proteins upon UV radiation due to reaction caused by photocatalysis. Hence, nanoparticle-based strategies for tackling viruses have immense potential. The second part of the review points to the latest in vitro and in vivo procedures for screening viral particles and the usage of nanoparticles in diagnostic and therapeutics.

We identified PEDV replicase encoded papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) as an IFN antagonist that depends on catalytic activity for its function. We show that levels of ubiquitinated proteins are reduced during PEDV infection and that PEDV PLP2 has deubiquitinase (DUB) activity that recognizes and processes both K-48 and K-63 linked polyubiquitin chains.

Data collection was conducted by phone interview. The study variables comprised age, sex, coronary heart diseases, diabetes, and some symptoms at admission. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained by logistic regression. The direct method was applied to calculate ASMR (per 100,000) of COVID-19. The analysis was applied by STATA software 12.0. RESULTS: A total of 208 cases of COVID-19 (out of 3050 total infected cases) were dead and 2500 cases were recovered. The mean age of dead patients was 70 years. The COVID-19 fatality rate in the population equaled 6.8%; in those patients who were 70 years old or more, however, the case fatality rate was 16.4%. The ASMR of COVID-19 was 12.9 (CI 95%: 11.2, 14.8). The odds of COVID-19-related death in the age over 60 were 10.87 (CI 95%: 6.30, 18.75) times than lower 45 years old.

These two ideas are combined in order to argue that seasonal changes in a given microbiome may influence the functionality of the host's immune system and consequently make it easier for infectious agents to infect the host at certain times of year.

We studied six categories of adversity including both worries and experiences of: illness with COVID-19, financial difficulty, loss of paid work, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to personal safety. Anxiety and depression were measured using the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire. We used fixed-effect regression models to account for time-invariant confounders. RESULTS: Cumulative number of worries and experience of adversities were both related to higher levels of anxiety and depression. A number of worries were associated more with anxiety than depression, but number of experiences were equally related to anxiety and depression. There were clear associations between specific worries and poorer mental health. There was weak evidence that individuals of lower socio-economic position were more negatively affected psychologically by the adverse experiences. CONCLUSION: Measures over the first few weeks of lockdown in the UK appear to have been insufficient at reassuring people given that we see clear associations with mental health and cumulative worries.

Furthermore, PCOS MUO patients had lower adherence to the MD (p < 0.001) in spite of the same total energy intake (p = 0.102) as compared to PCOS MHO. The presence of MUO was associated with highest hs-CRP levels (OR = 1.49, p < 0.001), more severe hyperandrogenism and cardio-metabolic indices (p < 0.001). On the contrary, being PCOS MUO was associated with lower adherence to the MD (OR = 0.28, p < 0.001), and smaller PhAs (OR = 0.04, p < 0.001).

The present study examined associations of self\\\\reported sleep quality and anticipatory threat appraisals of the pandemic with PTSD symptoms 6 months later in a sample enriched for pre\\\\pandemic trauma exposure and PTSD. The sample included 590 adults (mean age 38.2 years) who completed a baseline survey in August/September 2020 and follow\\\\up survey in March/April 2021. The sample was recruited from a pool of participants interested in a prior study about traumatic stress.

Baseline sleep quality was associated with PTSD symptoms at follow\\\\up controlling for baseline PTSD symptoms (B = ?2.49, p = 0.001). Perceived anticipatory threat of the pandemic moderated this association such that worse sleep quality was related to more severe PTSD symptoms at follow\\\\up for participants with higher (B = ?4.07, p < 0.001) but not lower (B = ?0.43, p = 0.679) anticipatory threat about the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

However, most of these studies were of low-to-moderate quality and many were based on convenience samples or used mental health measures with low validity, or both. Consequently, it has been difficult to draw conclusions. METHODS Both the 2020 Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health (SCMH) and the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) (2015-2019) used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 to screen for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults aged 18 or older. The prevalence of MDD was compared between the SCMH and the CCHS. Risk and protective factors for MDD in the SCMH were examined using bivariate and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS Based on SCMH data, 15.2% (95% CI: 14.2-16.2) of Canadians screened positive for MDD. The prevalence of MDD was more than two times higher in the SCMH (during COVID-19) than in the CCHS (predating COVID-19). In bivariate analysis, Canadians reporting five or more COVID-19-related risk factors were close to 30 times more likely to have MDD than those reporting no risk factors. Mastery and a sense of community belonging were protective factors for MDD. CONCLUSION After remaining stable for two decades, the prevalence of depression among Canadians increased substantially with the onset of COVID-19. Ongoing monitoring of this common condition associated with major morbidity is vital to determine if elevated levels of MDD persist as we progress through and beyond future waves of COVID-19.","output":"Symptoms of major depressive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic: results from a representative sample of the Canadian population."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to detect the role of teaching staff members in increasing university students' awareness, health protection, moral, and value aspects through the e-learning, and to reveal the differences in the level of the teaching staff members about their roles due to the path of college, academic degree, and academic experience.

Topical therapy is the gold standard for psoriasis patients with mild disease courses and for complementary and maintenance treatment in moderate and severe forms. However, while new systemic therapies are rapidly implemented in the daily routine as our pathomechanistic understanding of psoriasis evolves, the development of topical psoriasis therapies stagnates. Modern topical treatments though would require not only new active substances but also improved galenics. Due to their unique ability to directly exert biologic functions, but also to deliver drugs in optimal concentrations, enabling increased therapeutic efficacy, reduced adverse effects and improved patient compliance, nanoparticles may represent ideal drug carriers for local therapeutics in psoriasis. In recent years, a series of reports added important insights into the biology of skin-nanoparticles interactions and on how they impact the epidermal and dermal inflammatory compartments in vitro and in psoriasis plaques. Furthermore, by targeting anti-inflammatory substances to specific skin compartments, nanotechnological advances offer the exciting opportunity to fine tune skin inflammation at molecular and cellular levels, paving the road to a high-precision, skin-directed topical therapy in psoriasis.

METHODS: An obesity model was established by feeding Sprague-Dawley rats (ORs) a high-fat diet (HFD) and treating them with COST for 8 weeks. A model of lipid accumulation in hepatocellular carcinoma cells was established by treating HepG2 cells with free fatty acids and COST for 24 h. RESULTS: COST treatment of ORs reduced weight gain, inhibited adipose tissue hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and reduced the fat-to-weight ratio. COST improved dyslipidaemia, reduced liver weight and organ index, inhibited hepatic lipid accumulation, and prevented liver steatosis, and the high COST dose increased TC and TG excretion in the stool. Treatment of lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells with COST reduced lipid accumulation and TG levels. COST modulated the expression of genes related to fat metabolism and ER stress response pathway-related factors in liver tissue and HepG2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: COST can inhibit weight gain and improve dyslipidaemia and lipid metabolism in ORs.

Non-communicable diseases are now leading risk factors for death in such countries. Thus, the influence of chronic diseases on the outcome of falciparum malaria is an issue of major importance. Aim of the present study was to assess whether non-communicable diseases increase the risk for severe imported falciparum malaria. METHODS: A retrospective observational study of all adult cases with imported falciparum malaria hospitalized between 2001 and 2015 in the tertiary care Charit University Hospital, Berlin, was performed. RESULTS: A total of 536 adult patients (median age 37 years; 31.3% female) were enrolled. Of these, 329 (61.4%) originated from endemic countries, 207 patients (38.6%) from non-endemic regions. Criteria for severe malaria were fulfilled in 68 (12.7%) cases. With older age, lack of previous malaria episodes, being a tourist, and delayed presentation, well-characterized risk factors were associated with severe malaria in univariate analysis. After adjustment for these potential confounders hypertension (adjusted odds ratio aOR, 3.06 95% confidence interval, CI 1.34C7.02), cardiovascular diseases (aOR, 8.20 95% CI 2.30C29.22), and dyslipidaemia (aOR, 6.08 95% CI 1.13C32.88) were individual diseases associated with severe disease in multivariable logistic regression.

Restaurant owners have put delivery services on the spotlight, urging them to cut down their commission rates as they are negatively implicating their businesses. Third-party services have been known to take commissions out of the restaurant owners they partner with.

Such preferences are often similarly attributed to factors such as aesthetic impressions, attributed meaning from the visual properties, or processing fluency. Because shapes and fonts were rarely studied together, we investigated whether these qualities had a similar impact on preference judgment of object-word pairs. Each pair consisted of an abstract object with either preferred or disliked shape qualities and a pseudoword with either preferred or disliked font qualities. We found that only shape qualities, but not font qualities, influenced preference ratings of the object-word pairs, with higher preferences for pairs with preferred than disliked shapes. Moreover, eye movement results indicated that while participants fixated the word before the object, their prolonged fixation on the object when first attending to it might have contributed to the preference ratings. Nonetheless, other measures, including response times, total fixation numbers, and total dwell time, showed different patterns for shape and font qualities, revealing that participants attended more to objects with preferred than disliked shapes, and to words with disliked than preferred fonts.

Results: Of 3,813,465 children, 17.7% (1 in 6) were clinically vulnerable (9.5% born preterm or low birthweight, 10.3% had a chronic condition). Deficits in hospital care during the pandemic were much higher for clinically vulnerable children than peers: respectively, outpatient attendances (314 versus 73 per 1000 child years), planned admissions (55 versus 10), and unplanned admissions (105 versus 79). Clinically vulnerable children accounted for 50.1% of the deficit in outpatient attendances, 55.0% in planned admissions, and 32.8% in unplanned hospital admissions. During the pandemic, weekly rates of planned care returned to pre-pandemic levels for infants with chronic conditions but not older children. Deficits in care differed by ethnic group and level of deprivation. Virtual outpatient attendances increased from 3.2% to 24.8% during the pandemic. Conclusion: 1 in 6 clinically vulnerable children accounted for one-third to one half of the deficit in hospital care during the pandemic.","output":"Deficits in hospital care among clinically vulnerable children aged 0 to 4 years during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The review is devoted to modern trends in the chemistry of 2-amino and 2-mercapto substituted benzothiazoles covering the literature since 2015.

However, none of them has been as widely studied as cannabidiol (CBD), most likely because, individually, the others offer only partial effects or can activate potential harmful pathways. In this regard, CBD has proven to be of great value as a cardioprotective agent since it is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory molecule. Thus, we conducted a review to condensate the currently available knowledge on CBD as a therapy for different experimental models of cardiomyopathies and heart failure to detect the molecular pathways involved in cardiac protection. CBD therapy can greatly limit the production of oxygen/nitrogen reactive species, thereby limiting cellular damage, protecting mitochondria, avoiding caspase activation, and regulating ionic homeostasis. Hence, it can affect myocardial contraction by restricting the activation of inflammatory pathways and cytokine secretion, lowering tissular infiltration by immune cells, and reducing the area of infarct and fibrosis formation. These effects are mediated by the activation or inhibition of different receptors and target molecules of the endocannabinoid system. In the final part of this review, we explore the current state of CBD in clinical trials as a treatment for cardiovascular diseases and provide evidence of its potential benefits in humans.","output":"Therapeutic Applications of Cannabinoids in Cardiomyopathy and Heart Failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is a disorder encountered in infancy that is caused by hypertrophy of the musculature of the pylorus of the stomach.

It is not yet clear whether the tendency to thrombosis is increased in the mild-to-moderate course of COVID-19. Our research aims to show the clinical benefit of Q-SPECT/CT in diagnosing PD in outpatients treated with mild-to-moderate course of COVID-19 and to determine the frequency of perfusion defects in these patients having relatively lower risk. METHODS: All patients who underwent Q-SPECT/CT with suspicion of embolism were examined retrospectively. Only patients with low clinical probability and mild-to-moderate course of COVID-19 for PE were included in the study. The patients were evaluated comparatively as those with and without perfusion defects. Patients were divided into laboratory suspicion, clinical suspicion, or clinical and laboratory suspicion. RESULTS: In outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 with low clinical probability for PE, PD without CT abnormality was detected with a rate of 36.6% with Q-SPECT/CT performed for complaints of high D-dimer and/or dyspnea. None of the patients had PD at more proximal level than the segment level. PD with no concomitant CT abnormality was observed with a rate of 56.5% in patients with both clinical and laboratory suspicion.

However, the biological role of ppGalNAc-T4 in breast cancer is still undetermined. In this study, we investigate the effects and mechanism of ppGalNAc-T4 to the breast cancer cell proliferation. From analysis of high throughput RNA sequencing datasets of GEO and ArrayExpress, a positive correlation between ppGalNAc-T4 and the recurrence-free survival was observed in multigroup of human breast cancer datasets. Moreover, transcriptomes analysis using RNA-sequencing in MCF7 cells revealed that cell cycle-related genes induced the effects of ppGalNAc-T4 on breast cancer cell proliferation. Additionally, investigations showed that ppGalNAc-T4 impaired cell proliferation in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cells. Furthermore, our results suggested that ppGalNAc-T4 knockout activated Notch signaling pathway and enhanced cell proliferation.

Recently, multiple publications have suggested that famotidine might be effective in reducing disease severity in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the effects of inpatient, as well as outpatient, use of famotidine and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on admitted COVID-19 patients. Methods: COVID-19 positive patients >18-years-old admitted to our tertiary care center between June and August 2020 were included. Those dismissed from the ED were excluded from the study. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was conducted to determine the effect of famotidine and PPIs on the occurrence of mortality, ICU admission and acute kidney injury (AKI). Patient age, sex, body mass index, and comorbidities (hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD)) were included as covariates. Odds ratios for respective variables were calculated and recorded. Results: 489 patients were included in our study. 43 patients were on PPI therapy on admission. 26 patients were on famotidine on admission. 137 were treated with famotidine while inpatient. On univariate analysis, inpatient famotidine use, age, male sex and DMwere associated with increased mortality (Figure 1Aa). Both inpatient as well as outpatient famotidine use along with male sex were associated with increased ICU admission (Figure 1Ab). Inpatient famotidine use, age, male sex, HTN, DM, CKD and CHF were associated with increased AKI (Figure 1Ac). On multivariate analysis, patient age, male sex and inpatient famotidine were associated with increased mortality (Figure 1Ba). Both inpatient and outpatient famotidine use as well as male sex were associated with increased ICU admission (Figure 1Bb). Inpatient famotidine, male sex, CKD and CHF were associated with increased AKI (Figure 1Bc). PPI use was not associated with changed outcomes in our patient population. Conclusion: While recent publications suggested that famotidine use might be effective in reducing severity of COVID-19 infection, our experience has been to the contrary. It is unclear why the use of famotidine was significantly associated with worse outcomes in our patient population. These findings are consistent with a recent study by Yeramaneni et al. (PMID: 33058865).

DESIGN: Publicly available data were extracted for the top three OFDS Instagram accounts for Australia, United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA) from March to May 2019 and 2020. Food/beverage items from posts were classified as discretionary or from the five food groups (FFG) according to the Australian Dietary Guidelines. Marketing strategies were coded using an existing framework. Posts referring to COVID-19 were coded under four marketing strategies: (i) appropriating frontline workers; (ii) combatting the pandemic; (iii) selling social distancing; and (iv) accelerating digitalisation. RESULTS: From 581 posts, 618 food/beverage items were shown, of which 69 % (427/618) were classified as discretionary. In 2019, the most used marketing strategies were product imagery (unbranded) (137/195, 70 %), links (111/195, 57 %) and sponsorships/partnerships (58/195, 30 %). In 2020, the most used were links (252/386, 68 %), product imagery (unbranded) (179/386, 49 %) and branding elements (175/386, 45 %). The most common COVID-19 marketing strategy was combatting the pandemic (76/123, 62 %) followed by selling social distancing (53/123, 43 %), appropriating frontline workers (34/123, 28 %) and accelerating digitalisation (32/123, 26 %). CONCLUSIONS: Following the COVID-19 pandemic, OFDS adapted their marketing, creating content with the theme of combatting the pandemic.

Immunization of pregnant women against GBS in addition to intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis could prevent disease. Establishing accurate serological markers of protection against IGbsD could enable use of efficient clinical trial designs for vaccine development and licensure, without needing to undertake efficacy trials in prohibitively large number of mother-infant dyads. The association of maternal naturally acquired serotype-specific anti-capsular antibodies (IgG) against serotype-specific IGbsD in their infants has been studied in case-control studies. The statistical models used so far to estimate IGbsD risk from these case-control studies assumed that the antibody concentrations measured sharing the same disease status are sampled from the same population, not allowing for differences between mothers colonised by GBS and mothers also potentially infected (e.g urinary tract infection or chorioamnionitis) by GBS during pregnancy. This distinction is relevant as infants born from infected mothers with occult medical illness may be exposed to GBS prior to the mother developing antibodies measured in maternal or infant sera. METHODS: Unsupervised mixture model averaging (MMA) is proposed and applied here to accurately estimate infant IGbsD risk from case-control study data in presence or absence of antibody concentration subgroups potentially associated to maternal GBS carriage or infection. MMA estimators are compared to non-parametric disease risk estimators in simulation studies and by analysis of two published GBS case-control studies. RESULTS: MMA provides more accurate relative risk estimates under a broad range of data simulation scenarios and more accurate absolute disease risk estimates when the proportion of IGbsD cases with high antibody levels is not ignorable. MMA estimates of the relative and absolute disease risk curves are more amenable to clinical interpretation compared to non-parametric estimates with no detectable overfitting of the data. Antibody concentration thresholds predictive of protection from infant IGbsD estimated by MMA from maternal and infant sera are consistent with non-parametric estimates. CONCLUSIONS: MMA is a flexible and robust method for design, accurate analysis and clinical interpretation of case-control studies estimating relative and absolute IGbsD risk from antibody concentrations measured at or after birth.","output":"Estimation of invasive Group B Streptococcus disease risk in young infants from case-control serological studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preventing pressure ulcers is important in patients undergoing procedures in the park-bench position. We hypothesized that the microclimate around the skin is a significant risk factor for developing pressure ulcers. This research continuously assessed factors of the microclimate in terms of skin temperature and perspiration as well as the interface pressure in order to determine whether the microclimate is an independent risk factor for the development of park-bench position-related pressure ulcers (PBP-PUs). A prospective observational study was conducted among patients undergoing elective surgery in the park-bench position at a general hospital in the metropolitan area of Japan between April and November 2014. Factors of the microclimate, including skin temperature and perspiration, in addition to the interface pressure were continuously measured throughout surgery. Twenty-nine patients were analyzed (mean age 44.4  13.2 years, male 44.8%). Of these 29 patients, seven (24.1%) developed Category I PBP-PUs. The change in skin temperature from baseline to the end of surgery (2.7  0.3 C vs. 1.9  0.8 C) and the average peak pressure (119.1  36.8 mmHg vs. 94.5  23.1 mmHg) were significantly higher in the patients with PBP-PUs than in those without PBP-PUs. There were no significant differences in the amount of perspiration between the two groups. A hierarchical logistic regression analysis showed that the change in skin temperature was significantly related to the development of PBP-PUs (unit = 0.1 C: odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidential interval 1.09-2.33) when adjusted for the average peak pressure and length of surgery. Our results suggest that a change in skin temperature toward a higher value is an independent risk factor for the development of PBP-PUs. Proper intraoperative management of skin temperature may therefore be a promising candidate as a preventive method against PBP-PU development.","output":"Microclimate is an independent risk factor for the development of intraoperatively acquired pressure ulcers in the park-bench position: A prospective observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenctomy (MIPD) is a technically challenging procedure.

A designated task force of the Israeli Association of Occupational Medicine has evaluated the relevant literature and published guidelines concerning medical work restrictions for employees in high-risk occupations during the epidemic of novel COVID-19. METHODS: The study depicts a case series of 17 FFW evaluations performed in Maccabi Health Services occupational clinics using the guidelines formulated by the Israeli Occupational Medicine Association. RESULTS: 17 patients, mainly healthcare workers, whose major health hazards were immunodeficiency, respiratory diseases and pregnancy, were assessed in this case series. We present the essential parameters of these FFW evaluations and discuss decision-making in selected cases.

In addition to the current threat from the COVID-19 pandemic and associated outbreaks on cruise ships, an MCI-ID can also be caused by pathogens such as Influenzavirus or Norovirus. The first step was, to get an overview of processes and resources using the example of the Port of Hamburg, and to show the relating interaction of involved parties. This will serve as a basis for developing an operational strategy and offers the opportunity to optimize current work processes. METHODS A selective literature research using specified key words was performed and existing MCI concepts were received from local authorities. Identified structures and processes were analyzed in a multiple step process and also brought together through discussions in workshops with involved organizations and other experts. Additionally, the distances between the nearest rescue stations and selected hospitals from the Port of Hamburg were analyzed. RESULTS The current available concepts are proven, but an adaptation to an MCI-ID shows opportunities for a further cross-organizational development. The organizational structure of an MCI-ID in the Port of Hamburg was described, including a large number of involved organizations (n = 18). There are 17 involved fire and rescue stations and the port can be reached from these locations within 6 to 35 minutes. Based on their specialist expertise, 14 of the 31 listed clinics were selected. CONCLUSION Based on identified existing structures and the determination of medical resources, an operational concept for an MCI-ID in the port can be adapted and can contribute to enhanced coping with this situation. Subsequently, the derived operational concept will be tested for practical suitability in several exercises within the present project.","output":"A mass casualty incident of infectious diseases at the port of Hamburg: an analysis of organizational structures and emergency concepts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Provide the most recent updates on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment advances in Kawasaki disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Treatment advances in complex, IVIG-refractory cases of Kawasaki disease. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a newly reported inflammatory condition with Kawasaki-like features and an association with the 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19). SUMMARY: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a rare systemic inflammatory disease that predominately affects children less than 5 years of age. Pathogenesis of KD remains unknown; the leading theory is that an unknown stimulus triggers an immune-mediated inflammatory cascade in a genetically susceptible child. Classic KD is a clinical diagnosis based on set criteria and excluding other similar clinical entities. Patients who do not fulfill complete diagnostic criteria for KD are often referred to as atypical (or incomplete) KD. The most feared complication of KD is coronary artery abnormality development, and patients with atypical KD are also at risk. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin has greatly reduced the incidence of coronary lesions in affected children. Several other immune-modulating therapies have recently been utilized in complex or refractory cases.","output":"Kawasaki Disease: an Update"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Face-to-face healthcare, including psychiatric provision, must continue despite reduced interpersonal contact during the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) pandemic. Community-based services might use domiciliary visits, consultations in healthcare settings, or remote consultations. Services might also alter direct contact between clinicians. We examined the effects of appointment types and clinicianCclinician encounters upon infection rates. Design: Computer simulation. Methods: We modelled a COVID-19-like disease in a hypothetical community healthcare team, their patients, and patients' household contacts (family). In one condition, clinicians met patients and briefly met family (e.g., home visit or collateral history). In another, patients attended alone (e.g., clinic visit), segregated from each other. In another, face-to-face contact was eliminated (e.g., videoconferencing). We also varied clinicianCclinician contact; baseline and ongoing external infection rates; whether overt symptoms reduced transmission risk behaviourally (e.g., via personal protective equipment, PPE); and household clustering. Results: Service organisation had minimal effects on whole-population infection under our assumptions but materially affected clinician infection. Appointment type and inter-clinician contact had greater effects at low external infection rates and without a behavioural symptom response. Clustering magnified the effect of appointment type. We discuss infection control and other factors affecting appointment choice and team organisation. Conclusions: Distancing between clinicians can have significant effects on team infection. Loss of clinicians to infection likely has an adverse impact on care, not modelled here. Appointments must account for clinical necessity as well as infection control. Interventions to reduce transmission risk can synergize, arguing for maximal distancing and behavioural measures (e.g., PPE) consistent with safe care.","output":"Simulating a Community Mental Health Service During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Effects of ClinicianCClinician Encounters, ClinicianCPatientCFamily Encounters, Symptom-Triggered Protective Behaviour, and Household Clustering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Abraham Accords, signed in September 2020 have helped shed a light on a new discourse emerging from the Gulf that seeks to challenge some of the old dogmas that have dominated the region in the last few decades.

We investigated the ability of SARS CoV to infect 5-week-old Golden Syrian hamsters. When administered intranasally, SARS CoV replicates to high titers in the lungs and nasal turbinates. Peak replication in the lower respiratory tract was noted on day 2 postinfection (p.i.) and was cleared by day 7 p.i. Low levels of virus were present in the nasal turbinates of a few hamsters at 14 days p.i. Viral replication in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract was accompanied by cellular necrosis early in infection, followed by an inflammatory response coincident with viral clearance, focal consolidation in pulmonary tissue, and eventual pulmonary tissue repair. Despite high levels of virus replication and associated pathology in the respiratory tract, the hamsters showed no evidence of disease. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in sera at day 7 p.i., and mean titers at day 28 p.i. exceeded 1:400. Hamsters challenged with SARS CoV at day 28 p.i. were completely protected from virus replication and accompanying pathology in the respiratory tract. Comparing these data to the mouse model, SARS CoV replicates to a higher titer and for a longer duration in the respiratory tract of hamsters and is accompanied by significant pathology that is absent in mice. Viremia and extrapulmonary spread of SARS CoV to liver and spleen, which are seen in hamsters, were not detected in mice.

METHODS: Eleven GBS cases in four key COVID-19 hotspots are discussed regarding presenting symptoms, response to therapies and cross-reactivity of COVID spike proteins with nerve glycolipids. Emerging cases of COVID-19Ctriggered autoimmune necrotizing myositis (NAM) and encephalopathies are also reviewed in the context of viral invasion, autoimmunity and ongoing immunotherapies. RESULTS: Collective data indicate that in this pandemic any patient presenting with an acute paralytic disease-like GBS, encephalomyelitis or myositis-even without systemic symptoms, may represent the first manifestation of COVID-19. Anosmia, ageusia, other cranial neuropathies and lymphocytopenia are red flags enhancing early diagnostic suspicion. In Miller-Fisher Syndrome, ganglioside antibodies against GD1b, instead of QG1b, were found; because the COVID-19 spike protein also binds to sialic acid-containing glycoproteins for cell-entry and anti-GD1b antibodies typically cause ataxic neuropathy, cross-reactivity between COVID-19Cbearing gangliosides and peripheral nerve glycolipids was addressed. Elevated Creatine Kinase (>10,000) is reported in 10% of COVID-19Cinfected patients; two such patients presented with painful muscle weakness responding to IVIg indicating that COVID-19Ctriggered NAM is an overlooked entity. Cases of acute necrotizing brainstem encephalitis, cranial neuropathies with leptomeningeal enhancement, and tumefactive postgadolinium-enhanced demyelinating lesions are now emerging with the need to explore neuroinvasion and autoimmunity. Concerns for modifications-if any-of chronic immunotherapies with steroids, mycophenolate, azathioprine, IVIg, and anti-B-cell agents were addressed; the role of complement in innate immunity to viral responses and anti-complement therapeutics (i.e. eculizumab) were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging data indicate that COVID-19 can trigger not only GBS but other autoimmune neurological diseases necessitating vigilance for early diagnosis and therapy initiation.

However, the rapidly evolving scientific discipline of animal welfare science, in conjunction with growing societal expectations around the value of individuals, is prompting change in conservation. Despite growing recognition of this approach in terrestrial conservation efforts, limited application of animal welfare science to marine mammals has been observed. To investigate the factors underlying this disparity, we undertook an initial Welfare in the Wild workshop at the 32nd European Cetacean Society conference (La Spezia, Italy) to explore expert opinion on this topic. Secondly, we analysed the English language peer-reviewed literature to assess to what extent marine mammal welfare research is reported. The results of the workshop reveal a range of views about the scientific discipline of animal welfare science, with participants definitions varying depending on their disciplinary expertise. Meanwhile, the extensive literature review spanning 1950 to July 2020 revealed extremely low reporting of research related to welfare in the context of marine mammals, with only 0.96% (n = 299) of all published articles on marine mammal taxa (n = 31,221) featuring the word welfare in either the title, abstract or keywords. This highlighted a need to explore differences and distil common themes. Here we suggest practical solutions to the language, translation and reception issues of this cross-disciplinary collaboration between animal welfare science and marine mammal conservation. ABSTRACT: Integrating welfare principles into conservation strategy is an emerging synthesis that encourages consideration of individual animals quality of life in research, policies and law. However, these principles have gained limited traction in marine compared to terrestrial animal conservation. This manuscript investigates several factors that may be contributing to this disparity. In order to gauge current understanding of animal welfare science principles by marine mammal researchers and other stakeholders, a Welfare in the Wild workshop was convened at the 32nd European Cetacean Society conference (La Spezia, Italy, April 2018). The workshop was attended by 30 participants who completed pre- and post-workshop surveys on animal welfare principles. The survey results highlight a range of different views about exactly what animal welfare science is and how it can be applied to marine mammals. Specifically, participants definitions appeared to vary depending on the type of employment or research they engaged in, indicating a need for an interdisciplinary common language. Secondly, we analysed the peer-reviewed literature in order to ascertain where marine mammal publications exploring welfare were being published. From 1950 to July 2020, a total of 299 articles featured both marine mammal taxa (one or more) and the word welfare in the title, abstract or keywords. This represents just 0.96% of the total peer-reviewed published papers on marine mammal taxa (n = 31,221) during the same period. When examining articles published within Welfare and Ethics (n = 6133) and Aquatic-focused (n = 139,352) journals, just 1.2% (n = 71) and 0.04% (n = 57) of articles, respectively, featured the word welfare when examining marine mammals. With the aim of exploring how explicitly including welfare evaluations in marine mammal research and management can benefit conservation outcomes, we framed our workshop and quantitative literature review findings to provide practical solutions to the language, translation and reception issues of this burgeoning cross-disciplinary collaboration.","output":"Increasing the Awareness of Animal Welfare Science in Marine Mammal Conservation: Addressing Language, Translation and Reception Issues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, genetic mutations in SARS-CoV-2 emerge, and some of them are found more contagious than the previously identified strains, acting as the major mechanism for many large-scale epidemics.

In this study, we explore how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) may affect transmission advantage. A two-strain compartmental epidemic model is proposed and simulated to investigate the biological mechanism of the relationships among different NPIs, the changes in transmissibility of each strain and transmission advantage. Although the NPIs are effective in flattening the epidemic curve, we demonstrate that NPIs probably lead to a decline in transmission advantage, which is likely to occur if the NPIs become intensive. Our findings uncover the mechanistic relationship between NPIs and transmission advantage dynamically, and highlight the important role of NPIs not only in controlling the intensity of epidemics but also in showing or even containing the growth of the proportion of mutated variants.","output":"The non-pharmaceutical interventions may affect the advantage in transmission of mutated variants during epidemics: A conceptual model for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New York City (NYC) experienced a sharp decline in air pollution during the COVID-19 shutdown period (March 15, 2020 to May 15, 2020)  albeit at high social and economic costs.

We present the case of severe EVALI requiring venous-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) and venting blowhole incisions.Case: A 32 year-old-male presented with four days of progressive dyspnea, productive cough and fatigue. He endorsed an active history of vaping cannabinoids and tobacco. On presentation, he was febrile, tachycardic and hypoxic requiring high amounts of supplemental oxygen. Lung exam was significant for diffuse rhonchi, wheezing and diminished breath sounds. Serology was remarkable for mild leukocytosis, procalcitonin 0.22 ng/mL and elevated inflammatory markers. Infectious work-up was negative. Chest radiography demonstrated bilateral multifocal patchy airspace disease. Empiric treatment with azithromycin and ceftriaxone was initiated. Intravenous dexamethasone and five days of remdesivir was started due to high suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, despite negative results. On day 4, the patient rapidly deteriorated, requiring mechanical ventilation. Computed tomography angiography demonstrated pneumomediastinum and bilateral ground glass opacities concerning for EVALI. He subsequently developed bilateral apical pneumothoraces requiring chest tube placement, and refractory subcutaneous emphysema prompting venting blowhole incisions. On day 20, vv-ECMO was initiated due to worsening respiratory status. During this time, he underwent tracheostomy placement. He was decannulated on day 34 of hospitalization and weaned to trach mask, currently awaiting rehabilitation placement.Discussion: EVALI is an emerging pulmonary syndrome with clinical presentation ranging from cough and dyspnea to spontaneous pneumothorax and acute respiratory failure. Patients typically require a high level of care. One study observes a 67% admission rate to intensive care, of that group 8% requiring mechanical ventilation. Numerous investigations have established an association between vitamin E acetate (VEA), an additive in vaping solvents containing tetrahydrocannabinol, and inflammatory alveolar damage. Lipid-laden macrophages have been reported in 89% of patients with suspected EVALI following bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Other studies suggest BAL macrophage increase in a VEA dose-dependent manner. Thoracic imaging typically reveals consolidations with basilar predominance and diffuse ground glass opacities. EVALI remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Given the similarity in presentation between EVALI and infectious/autoimmune pulmonary processes, patients receive empiric antimicrobial therapy, high dose steroids, and supplemental oxygen with improvement. Literature on EVALI and ECMO treatment is limited, with a need for further studies on management to prevent severe consequences. This is a case in which the patient required additional therapies, including both ECMO and venting blowhole incisions.","output":"From fashion trend to life support: A severe case of evali requiring ecmo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for China We speculated that the emigration rate of Wu","output":"Correlation Analysis of the Population Emigration Rate in Wuhan and the Trend of Novel Pneumonia in Hubei Province"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transitioning from in\\\\person to remote learning can present challenges for both the instructional team and the students.

We found that communicating with students and assessing specific needs, such as access to technology, and being flexible with the structure of the course, simplified the transition to remote instruction. We also found that short, pre\\\\recorded videos that introduce subject materials were among the most valuable elements for student learning. We hope that instructors of undergraduate ecology and evolution courses can use these recommendations to help establish inclusive online learning communities that empower students to acquire conceptual knowledge and develop scientific inquiry and literacy skills.","output":"Ten strategies for a successful transition to remote learning: Lessons learned with a flipped course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present Article and previous publications from the Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network clearly indicate the diminishing importance of development assistance for health (DAH) for financing services at the country level, even for disease areas commonly perceived as highly dependent on DAH 1,3,4 The projections to 2030 indicate that DAH will continue to be important in some low-income countries at the end of the SDG period, but this finding is more a consequence of the lack of growth in domestic spending than an effect of increasing DAH Vlad Sokhin/Panos Pictures In the present Article, the authors also present funding estimates for specifically relevant areas for SDG3ie, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and universal health coverage 1 Although these estimates might be useful for a global dialogue around how SDGs are prioritised in DAH, the approach is less relevant for increased understanding of, and improved decision making in, the health sector of countries included in the study [ ]the Article does not take a health systems approach to the data","output":"Understanding health spending for SDG 3"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The essays in this Special Issue respond in part to a call to acknowledge the multiple crises we now face: the global covid-19 virus pandemic;natural disasters caused by climate change and more.

Although prostate cancer antigen (PSA) is widely used in prostate cancer screening, the false positives may result in unnecessary invasive procedures. PSA elevated patients are triaged to further evaluation of free/total PSA ratio (f/t PSA), to find out potential clinically significant PCa before undergoing invasive procedures. Genomic instability, especially chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) were proved much more tumor specific. Here we performed a prospective study to evaluate the diagnostic value of CNV via urine-exfoliated cell DNA analysis in PCa. METHODS: We enrolled 28 PSA elevated patients ( 4 ng/ml), including 16 PCa, 9 benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH) and 3 prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Fresh initial portion urine was collected after hospital admission. Urine exfoliated cell DNA was analyzed by low coverage Whole Genome Sequencing, followed by CNV genotyping by the prostate cancer chromosomal aneuploidy detector (ProCAD). CNVs were quantified in absolute z-score (|Z|). Serum free/total PSA ratio (f/t PSA) was reported altogether. RESULTS: In patients with PCa, the most frequent CNV events were chr3q gain (n = 2), chr8q gain (n = 2), chr2q loss (n = 4), and chr18q loss (n = 3). CNVs were found in 81.2% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 53.7C95.0%) PCa. No CNV was identified in BPH patients. A diagnosis model was established by incorporating all CNVs. At the optimal cutoff of |Z| 2.50, the model reached an AUC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.83C0.99), a sensitivity of 81.2% and a specificity of 100%. The CNV approach significantly outperformed f/t PSA (AUC = 0.62, P = 0.012). Further analyses showed that the CNV positive rate was significantly correlated with tumor grade. CNVs were found in 90.9% (95% CI 57.1C99.5%) high grade tumors and 60.0% (95% CI 17.0C92.7%) low grade tumors. No statistical significance was found for patient age, BMI, disease history and family history. CONCLUSIONS: Urine exfoliated cells harbor enriched CNV features in PCa patients. Urine detection of CNV might be a biomarker for PCa diagnosis, especially in terms of the clinically significant high-grade tumors.

To evaluate the efficacy of combined foliar Se and Zn fertilisation in bread making wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a two-year field experiment was established in southern Spain under semi-arid Mediterranean conditions, by following a split-split-plot design. The study year (2017/2018, 2018/2019) was considered as the main-plot factor, soil Zn application (50 kg Zn ha(?1), nor Zn) as a subplot factor and foliar application (nor Se, 10 g Se ha(?1), 8 kg Zn ha(?1), 10 g Se ha(?1) + 8 kg Zn ha(?1)) as a sub-subplot factor. The best treatment to increase both Zn and Se concentration in both straw, 12.3- and 2.7-fold respectively, and grain, 1.3- and 4.3-fold respectively, was the combined foliar application of Zn and Se. This combined Zn and Se application also increased on average the yield of grain, main product of this crop, by almost 7%.

OBJECTIVE: This work aims to predict the medical needs (hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and respiratory assistance) and survivability of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Portugal. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 38,545 infected individuals during 2020 was used. Predictions of medical needs were performed using state-of-the-art machine learning approaches at various stages of a patient's cycle, namely, at testing (prehospitalization), at posthospitalization, and during postintensive care. A thorough optimization of state-of-the-art predictors was undertaken to assess the ability to anticipate medical needs and infection outcomes using demographic and comorbidity variables, as well as dates associated with symptom onset, testing, and hospitalization. RESULTS: For the target cohort, 75% of hospitalization needs could be identified at the time of testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Over 60% of respiratory needs could be identified at the time of hospitalization. Both predictions had >50% precision.

Here we describe a new class of self-assembling immunostimulatory short duplex RNAs that potently induce production of type I and type III interferon (IFN-I and IFN-III), in a wide range of human cell types. These RNAs require a minimum of 20 base pairs, lack any sequence or structural characteristics of known immunostimulatory RNAs, and instead require a unique conserved sequence motif (sense strand: 5-C, antisense strand: 3-GGG) that mediates end-to-end dimer self-assembly of these RNAs by Hoogsteen G-G base-pairing. The presence of terminal hydroxyl or monophosphate groups, blunt or overhanging ends, or terminal RNA or DNA bases did not affect their ability to induce IFN. Unlike previously described immunostimulatory siRNAs, their activity is independent of TLR7/8, but requires the RIG-I/IRF3 pathway that induces a more restricted antiviral response with a lower proinflammatory signature compared with poly(I:C). Immune stimulation mediated by these duplex RNAs results in broad spectrum inhibition of infections by many respiratory viruses with pandemic potential, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza A, as well as the common cold virus HCoV-NL63 in both cell lines and human Lung Chips that mimic organ-level lung pathophysiology.

The aim of this study is to explore the effects of crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, and safranal on the K+ channels encoded by hERG. The interaction of these components with the rapid delayed rectification of K+ currents (IKr) were studied using the perforated patch recording technique. Crocin and picrocrocin had no significant effects on IKr, but crocetin and safranal inhibited hERG K+ currents in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 36.35 M and 37.86 M, respectively. The maximum inhibitory effects were 37.74  4.14% and 33.74  4.81%, respectively, and the effects were reversible upon washout.

Trauma Informed Practice (TIP) is an evidence-based model which ensures safe and effective services for clients and staff. This study examines health professionals use of TIP, and the motivators, enablers and barriers to implementation in a multidisciplinary setting. METHODS: A mixed methods study with 24 front-line clinicians and managers within a community health setting in Australia. A purpose designed, expert validated TIP checklist was completed, followed by semi-structured focus groups. Survey data was reported using descriptive statistics. Focus group data was digitally recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. RESULTS: Ten key factors were identified motivating, restricting or enabling TIP implementation. Seven were organisational factors including supportive and informed management, flexibility of service models, levels of service demands, resource availability, education opportunities, good client outcomes, and reporting requirements. Philosophical approach, team orientation, and vicarious trauma/stress management were three individual professional factors. Critically, alignment in two ways was necessary for successful implementation, that is: in knowledge and understanding across organisational role levels - clinician, manager and executive; and, in professional philosophy and team orientation of individual clinicians. CONCLUSION: Providing TIP is essential for ensuring optimum client outcomes for trauma survivors and for maintaining workforce wellbeing. Although the increasing uptake to TIP is evident within the health setting, further attention is required to address the tension between service models focused on efficiently servicing whole populations and those attuned to effectively meeting the needs of high risk groups. A complex strategy to unite therapeutic and managerial goals is necessary if client, professional and organisational needs are to be effectively met.","output":"Optimising outcomes for complex trauma survivors: assessing the motivators, barriers and enablers for implementing trauma informed practice within a multidisciplinary health setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with imported highly contagious diseases like viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), pneumonic plague or anthrax require special preventive measures and strict isolation.

Statins were thought to be effective against this novel coronavirus for their anti-inflammatory properties, even if the real effects on COVID patients are still partially unexplored. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 501 adult patients, consecutively admitted to the two COVID-hospitals of Ferrara's territory, and divided them into two groups: ST = patients on statin therapy on admission and NST=patients not on statin therapy on admission. We searched for differences between groups in terms of anamnestic, clinical and laboratory data and then in terms of COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: We found significant differences between groups in terms of age, comorbidities, procalcitonin and CPK serum levels: ST patients were older, more comorbid, with lower procalcitonin and higher CPK serum levels. Male sex was, together with the Charlson Comorbidity Index, an independent predictor of needing intensification of care, while age only was a good predictor of in-hospital and 100-day mortality. Differences were also found in the survival functions between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: After a period of observation of 100 days, ST patients, despite their older age and their greater load of comorbidities, have similar survival functions to NST patients.

Researchers used an online survey instrument completed by 1,211 U.S. respondents to investigate the diverse motivations for making plant purchases. Researchers compared three age cohorts to understand which plant benefits they derived from their plant purchases. Millennials (born 1981 to 1995) derived the greatest social benefit from their plant purchases, followed by educational, physiological, and psychological benefits. Gen Z (born 1996 to 2012) derived more educational and physiological benefits compared to Baby Boomers (born 1946 to 1964). Individuals experiencing a high level of social benefits from plants may have contributed to the extensive use of social media during pandemic isolation, as plants appear to be a common interest or focal point for online social interaction. In other words, plants bought by Millennials (and to a lesser extent by Gen Z) served as an online social connection to others. The youngest age group, Gen Z, experienced the greatest boredom proneness and the most food insecurity. In comparing plant buyers with non-buyers, we found no difference in boredom proneness or shopping anxiety. Plant purchasers experienced greater food security compared to non-plant purchasers and individuals who purchased edible plants or food-producing plants or both a flowering plant and a food-producing plant had greater food security compared to non-plant buyers and individuals who purchased flowering plants.

Viral aetiology is the most common. Among bacterial causes, the main agent is Streptococcus pyogenes or group A -haemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), which causes 5%-30% of the episodes. In the diagnostic process, clinical assessment scales can help clinicians to better predict suspected bacterial aetiology by selecting patients who should undergo a rapid antigen detection test. If these techniques are not performed, an overdiagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis often occurs, resulting in unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics, most of which are broad spectrum. Consequently, management algorithms that include the use of predictive clinical rules and rapid tests have been set up. The aim of the treatment is speeding up symptom resolution, reducing the contagious time span and preventing local suppurative and non-suppurative complications. Penicillin and amoxicillin are the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of pharyngitis. The association of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not indicated as the initial treatment of acute infection. Neither are macrolides indicated as first-line therapy; they should be reserved for patients allergic to penicillin.

This study was carried out to evaluate the role of Mw in the treatment of COVID-19 early in the course of the disease. Method In this retrospective observational study, 117 (84 males, 33 females) COVID-19 patients admitted between July 3, 2020 and Aug 26, 2020 in the covid ward of Fortis Hiranandani hospital, Mumbai, were enrolled. Patients were tested COVID-19 positive on RTPCR and were treated with standard of care treatment along with Mw 0.3 ml intradermal injection per day for 3 consecutive days. Patients were evaluated for live discharge as well as changes in the levels of inflammatory markers. Results Use of Mw was seen to be associated with rapid recovery in 116/117 patients from COVID-19 who were discharged from the hospital within 10 days. A decrease in the levels of CRP and IL6 was observed after the administration of Mw. This decrease was associated with improvement in the patients' condition. The use of Mw was seen to be associated with no systemic side effects.

One crucial component of civilian-military relations is defining the role of the military. This paper evaluates the role of Nigerian military during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola epidemic. METHODS Focus groups and key informant interviews were conducted throughout three states in North East region of Nigeria: Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. Participants were identified through mapping of stakeholder involvement in Nigerian epidemic response. English-translated transcripts of each key informant interview and focus group discussion were then coded and key themes were elucidated and analysed. RESULTS Major themes elucidated include developing inclusive coordination plans between civilian and military entities, facilitating human rights reporting mechanisms and distributing military resources more equitably across geographical catchment areas. The Nigerian Military served numerous functions: 37% (22/59) of respondents indicated 'security/peace' as the military's primary function, while 42% (25/59) cited health services. Variations across geographic settings were also noted: 35% (7/20) of participants in Borno stated the military primarily provided transportation, while 73% (11/15) in Adamawa and 29% (7/24) in Yobe listed health services. CONCLUSIONS Robust civilian-military relations require an appropriately defined role of the military and clear civilian-military communication. Important considerations to contextualise civilian-military relations include military cultural-linguistic understanding, human rights promotion, and community-based needs assessments; such foci can facilitate the military's understanding of community norms and civilian cooperation with military aims. In turn, more robust civilian-military relations can promote overall epidemic response and reduce the global burden of disease.","output":"Civilian perception of the role of the military in Nigeria's 2014 Ebola outbreak and health-related responses in the North East region."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pollution with microplastics has become an environmental concern worldwide.

This study aims to examine the distribution of plastic particles, of all sizes (micro- and small macro-plastics) in four of the major fish species of the lake and in its shoreline sediment. The gastrointestinal tracts analysis showed that 35% of the sampled fishes ingested plastic particles. The median number of particles per fish was 4 (range 1-26). Benthic (Clarias gariepinus) and benthopelagic (Cyprinus carpio and Carassius carassius) fish species were found to contain a significantly higher number of plastic particles in comparison to the planktivorous fish species (Oreochromis niloticus). More fishes ingested plastic particles in the wet compared to the dry season. The maximum plastic size (40 mm fibre) was found in C. carpio. Estimated median mass of plastic particles in fish was 0.07 (0.0002-385.2) mg/kg_ww. Fish and sediment samples close to known potential sources of plastic particles had a higher plastic ingestion frequency (52% of the fish) and higher plastic concentration compared to the other parts of the lake.

It is responsible for the loss of billions of dollars to the world economy, by contaminating different crops such as cotton, groundnut, maize, and chilies, and causing immense effects on the health of humans and animals. More than eighteen different types of aflatoxins have been reported to date, and among them, aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 are the most prevalent and lethal. Early detection of fungal infection plays a key role in the control of aflatoxin contamination. Therefore, different methods, including culture, chromatographic techniques, and molecular assays, are used to determine aflatoxin contamination in crops and food products. Many countries have set a maximum limit of aflatoxin contamination (2C20 ppb) in their food and agriculture commodities for human or animal consumption, and the use of different methods to combat this menace is essential. Fungal infection mostly takes place during the pre- and post-harvest stage of crops, and most of the methods to control aflatoxin are employed for the latter phase. Studies have shown that if correct measures are adopted during the crop development phase, aflatoxin contamination can be reduced by a significant level. Currently, the use of bio-pesticides is the intervention employed in many countries, whereby atoxigenic strains competitively reduce the burden of toxigenic strains in the field, thereby helping to mitigate this problem. This updated review on aflatoxins sheds light on the sources of contamination, and the on occurrence, impact, detection techniques, and management strategies, with a special emphasis on bio-pesticides to control aflatoxins.","output":"Aflatoxin Contamination, Its Impact and Management Strategies: An Updated Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The federal government now has additional powers to override patents for drugs, vaccines and medical equipment as needed to secure critical supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic Amendments to the Patent Act under Canada's COVID-19 Emergency Response Act make it possible for the federal government-or anyone it designates-to make, use and sell patented inventions \\"to the extent necessary to respond to a public health emergency \\" Effectively, the act enables Ottawa to combat price gouging or shortages of any needed product, from vaccines to ventilators, by licensing companies to make generic copies of brand-name products without having to negotiate with patent holders These compulsory licenses would last only a year, and patent holders would receive \\"adequate\\" compensation, to be determined after the fact","output":"Canada can override patents to combat drug, equipment shortages during the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Breast cancers detected at screening need less aggressive treatment compared to breast cancers detected due to symptoms. The evidence on the quality of life associated with screen-detected versus symptomatic breast cancer is sparse. This study aimed to compare quality of life among Norwegian women with symptomatic, screen-detected and interval breast cancer, and women without breast cancer and investigate quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for women with breast cancer from the third to 14th year since diagnosis. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study was focused on women aged 50 and older. A self-reported questionnaire including EQ-5D-5L was sent to 11,500 women. Multivariable median regression was used to analyze the association between quality of life score (visual analogue scale 0C100) and detection mode. Health utility values representing womens health status were extracted from EQ-5D-5L. QALYs were estimated by summing up the health utility values for women stratified by detection mode for each year between the third and the 14th year since breast cancer diagnosis, assuming that all women would survive. RESULTS: Adjusted regression analyses showed that women with screen-detected (n = 1206), interval cancer (n = 1005) and those without breast cancer (n = 1255) reported a higher median quality of life score using women with symptomatic cancer (n = 1021) as reference; 3.7 (95%CI 2.2C5.2), 2.3 (95%CI 0.7C3.8) and 4.8 (95%CI 3.3C6.4), respectively.

We constructed a Protein Signature Pipeline to guide the selection of short peptide sequences to serve as targets for detection and therapeutics. In silico identification of good target peptides that are conserved among strains and unique compared to other species generates a list of peptides. These peptides may be developed in the laboratory as targets of antibody, peptide, and ligand binding for detection assays and therapeutics or as targets for vaccine development. In this paper, we assess how the amount of sequence data affects our ability to identify conserved, unique protein signature candidates. To determine the amount of sequence data required to select good protein signature candidates, we have built a computationally intensive system called the Sequencing Analysis Pipeline (SAP). The SAP performs thousands of Monte Carlo simulations, each calling the Protein Signature Pipeline, to assess how the amount of sequence data for a target organism affects the ability to predict peptide signature candidates. Viral species differ substantially in the number of genomes required to predict protein signature targets. Patterns do not appear based on genome structure. There are more protein than DNA signatures due to greater intraspecific conservation at the protein than at the nucleotide level. We conclude that it is necessary to use the SAP as a dynamic system to assess the need for continued sequencing for each species individually and to update predictions with each additional genome that is sequenced.","output":"System to assess genome sequencing needs for viral protein diagnostics and therapeutics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the use of face masks has become increasingly recommended and even mandatory in community settings. To evaluate the risk of bacterial cross-contamination, this study analyzed the bacterial bioburden of disposable surgical masks and homemade cotton masks, and surveyed the habits and face mask preferences of the Flemish population. Using culture approaches and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we analyzed the microbial community on surgical and/or cotton face masks of 13 healthy volunteers after 4 h of wearing. Cotton and surgical masks contained on average 1.46  10(5) CFU/mask and 1.32  10(4) CFU/mask, respectively. Bacillus, Staphylococcus, and Acinetobacter spp. were mostly cultured from the masks and 43% of these isolates were resistant to ampicillin or erythromycin. Microbial profiling demonstrated a consistent difference between mask types. Cotton masks mainly contained Roseomonas, Paracoccus, and Enhydrobacter taxa and surgical masks Streptococcus and Staphylococcus. After 4 h of mask wearing, the microbiome of the anterior nares and the cheek showed a trend toward an altered beta-diversity. According to dedicated questions in the large-scale Corona survey of the University of Antwerp with almost 25,000 participants, only 21% of responders reported to clean their cotton face mask daily. Laboratory results indicated that the best mask cleaning methods were boiling at 100C, washing at 60C with detergent or ironing with a steam iron. Taken together, this study suggests that a considerable number of bacteria, including pathobionts and antibiotic resistant bacteria, accumulate on surgical and even more on cotton face masks after use. Based on our results, face masks should be properly disposed of or sterilized after intensive use. Clear guidelines for the general population are crucial to reduce the bacteria-related biosafety risk of face masks, and measures such as physical distancing and increased ventilation should not be neglected when promoting face mask use.","output":"Cotton and Surgical Face Masks in Community Settings: Bacterial Contamination and Face Mask Hygiene"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent global COVID-19 public health emergency is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections and can manifest extremely variable clinical symptoms.

In TMPRSS2 gene, we observed a significant difference in the frequency of c.331G>A, c.23G>T, and c.589G>A variant alleles in COVID-19 patients, compared to the corresponding allelic frequency in GnomAD. Genetic variants in these genes could influence the entry of the SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted. Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 admitted to the Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou from January 21st to February 24th 2020 were enrolled. According to the clinical classification, the patients were divided into severe group and critical group. The myocardial injury markers, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), myoglobin (MYO), MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 55 COVID-19 patients were selected, including 15 critical cases and 40 severe cases. The patients with severe and critical COVID-19 were male-dominated (61.8%), the average age was (61.213.0) years old, 83.6% (46 cases) of them had contact history of Hubei, 38.2% (21 cases) of them were complicated with hypertension. There was no significant difference in baseline data between the critical group and the severe group. Myocardial injury markers of critical and severe COVID-19 patients were increased in different proportion, LDH increased in most patients (20 severe cases and 7 critical cases), followed by AST (16 severe cases and 5 critical cases). There was significant difference in the number of patients with elevated CK between severe group and critical group (cases: 1 vs. 4, P = 0.027). Abnormal ECG was found in 39 of 42 patients with ECG examination. Nonspecific change of T wave was the most common. Before and after treatment, 9 of 15 patients with changes of ECG and myocardial injury markers had oxygenation index less than 100 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), and the prominent changes of ECG were heart rate increasing and ST-T change. CONCLUSIONS: The increase of myocardial injury markers and abnormal ECG were not specific to the myocardial injury of severe and critical COVID-19 patients.

A 62-year-old woman, with regular physical activity and no history of respiratory disease or smoking, was hospitalized for moderate ARDS with bilateral pneumonitis. Fourteen days later, she was discharged from the intensive care unit and received respiratory physical therapy. One month later, she experienced exertional dyspnea. A regression of alveolar condensation with persistent sequelae at the pulmonary bases was noted. Three months later, the patient continued daily physical activity with satisfactory tolerance. A reduction in alveolar-capillary transfer, inappropriate hyperventilation upon exercise, and impairment of gas exchanges at maximal effort, suggestive of pulmonary shunt, were demonstrated. At the 6-month evaluation, the patient displayed exertional dyspnea with residual bilateral basal consolidations. Six months later, the dyspnea had ceased. The persistence of bilateral basal interstitial syndrome associated with bronchial dilatation and pleural-based consolidations was noted, as well as a stable impaired alveolar-capillary diffusing capacity. DISCUSSION: Upon discharge from intensive care, pulmonary follow-up should be proposed to ARDS survivors.

Data were obtained from the National Public Procurement Service (SERCOP) database between March 1 and July 31, 2020. A statistical descriptive analysis was conducted to extract relevant measures for commonly purchased products, medical devices, pharmaceutical drugs, and other goods. Among the most frequently purchased products, the greatest amounts were spent on face masks (US$4.5 million), acetaminophen (US$2.2 million), and reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay kits (US$1.8 million). Prices varied greatly, depending on each individual contract and on the number of units purchased; some were exceptionally higher than their market value. Compared with 2019, the mean price of medical examination gloves increased up to 1,307%, acetaminophen 500 mg pills, up to 796%, and oxygen flasks, 30.8%.

E-visits are now reimbursable through Medicare due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The state of evidence regarding e-visits, such as the impact on clinical outcomes and health care delivery, is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To address this gap, we examine how e-visits have impacted clinical outcomes and health care quality, access, utilization, and costs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review; MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched from January 2000 through October 2020 for peer-reviewed studies that assessed e-visits' impacts on clinical and health care delivery outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 1859 papers, 19 met the inclusion criteria. E-visit usage was associated with improved or comparable clinical outcomes, especially for chronic disease management (eg, diabetes care, blood pressure management). The impact on quality of care varied across conditions. Quality of care was equivalent or better for chronic conditions, but variable quality was observed in infection management (eg, appropriate antibiotic prescribing). Similarly, the impact on health care utilization varied across conditions (eg, lower utilization for dermatology but mixed impact in primary care). Health care costs were lower for e-visits than those for in-person visits for a wide range of conditions (eg, dermatology and acute visits). No studies examined the impact of e-visits on health care access. It is difficult to draw firm conclusions about effectiveness or impact on care delivery from the studies that were included because many used observational designs. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the evidence suggests e-visits may provide clinical outcomes that are comparable to those provided by in-person care and reduce health care costs for certain health care conditions. At the same time, there is mixed evidence on health care quality, especially regarding infection management (eg, sinusitis, urinary tract infections, conjunctivitis).

Results: : The clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 at the emergency hospital were varied. A total of 763 patients were included. The most common age was between 40 and 49 years (31.1%), a slight majority were women (51.5%), and most had travelled abroad in the last 14 days (99.1%). Of the 763 patients, 70.9% had no comorbidities. Half of the patients were asymptomatic (49.4%), 46% were mild cases, 4.1% were moderate, and 0.5% severe. The most common symptoms were productive cough (15.7%) and headache (15.3%). Supportive and comorbidity therapy were given which showed excellent clinical outcomes. Conclusions: : The majority of COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, female, middle aged and had recently been overseas. Therapy without antibiotics or antivirals showed positive outcomes in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the COVID-19 Emergency Field Hospital of Bangkalan, Indonesia (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUNDAccurately identifying COVID-19 patients at-risk to deteriorate remains challenging. Tools integrating host-protein expression have proven useful in determining infection etiology and hold potential for prognosticating disease severity. METHODSAdults with COVID-19 were recruited at medical centers in Israel, Germany, and the United States. Severe outcome was defined as intensive care unit admission, non-invasive or invasive ventilation, or death. Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and interferon gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10; also known as CXCL10) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured using an analyzer providing values within 15 minutes. A signature indicating the likelihood of severe outcome was derived generating a score (0-100). Patients were assigned to 4 score bins. RESULTSBetween March and November 2020, 518 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, of whom 394 were eligible, 29% meeting a severe outcome. The signatures area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.81-0.91). Performance was not confounded by age, sex, or comorbidities and superior to IL-6 (AUC 0.77; p = 0.033) and CRP (AUC 0.78; p < 0.001). Likelihood of severe outcome increased significantly (p < 0.001) with higher scores. The signature differentiated patients who further deteriorated after meeting a severe outcome from those who improved (p = 0.004) and projected 14-day survival probabilities (p < 0.001).

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. ANIMALS 32 horses. PROCEDURES Information was retrieved from medical records and through telephone calls on horses that had a hand-sewn or stapled side-to-side jejunocecostomy for treatment of colic, which was performed by or under the supervision of the same surgeon. Kaplan-Meier life table analysis was used to compare survival times and rates between horses that underwent a hand-sewn or stapled side-to-side anastomosis. RESULTS 32 horses met inclusion criteria; 22 underwent a hand-sewn anastomosis, and 10 underwent a stapled anastomosis. Horses in the stapled group had a significantly greater prevalence of postoperative colic and combined postoperative colic and reflux than horses in the hand-sewn group. In the hand-sewn group, repeated celiotomy was performed within the same hospitalization period for 3 of 22 horses; in the stapled group, 4 of 10 horses had repeated celiotomies. Hospital discharge rates (ie, short-term survival rates) were similar between horses in the hand-sewn group (20/22 horses) and those in the stapled group (9/10 horses). Long-term survival rates were similar for both groups, ranging from 5 to 126 months. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Short- and long-term results justify use of jejunocecostomy in horses. Despite similar survival rates between groups, horses that underwent a stapled anastomosis had significantly greater prevalences of postoperative complications than horses that underwent a hand-sewn anastomosis, suggesting that horses were sensitive to minor differences in anastomosis techniques.","output":"Comparison of complications and long-term survival rates following hand-sewn versus stapled side-to-side jejunocecostomy in horses with colic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an illness caused by a novel coronavirus that has rapidly escalated into a global pandemic leading to an urgent medical effort to better characterize this disease biologically, clinically and by imaging.

METHODS Systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted after a thorough search of relevant studies from databases. Trials that have evaluated HCQ for COVID-19 treatment were recruited for statistical analysis with fixed- and random-effect models. RESULTS Nine trials involving 4,112 patients were included in present meta-analysis. It was seen that hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin (HCQ-AZI) combination regimen increased the mortality rate in COVID-19 (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.63-3.36) patients, however, it also showed benefits associated with the viral clearance in patients (OR 27.18, 95% CI 1.29-574.32). HCQ-alone when used as a therapy in COVID-19 did not reveal significant changes in mortality rate, clinical progression, viral clearance and cardiac QT prolongation. Subsequent subgroup analysis showed that HCQ treatment could decrease mortality rate and progression to severe illness in severely-infected COVID-19 patients (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13-0.58). A lower risk of mortality rate was also noted in the stratified group of >14 days follow-up period (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13-0.58) compared to Q14 days follow-up period group that conversely showed an increased mortality rate (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.41-3.10). CONCLUSION Our results indicated that HCQ-AZI combination treatment increased mortality rate in COVID-19, but it also showed benefits associated with viral clearance in patients. HCQ-alone used for treatment has revealed benefits in decreasing the mortality rate among severely-infected COVID-19 group and showed potential to be used for COVID-19 treatment in long-term follow-up period group.

METHODS: Covid-associated Rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis cases with unilateral visual loss, planned for exenteration, underwent orbital and ophthalmological ocular examination. The available radiological sequences, doppler ultrasonography and histopathology findings were correlated with clinical manifestations. RESULTS: The median age was 51 years and the male: female ratio was 3:1. All except one presented with unilateral ophthalmoplegia. The ocular media were hazy in 2 eyes. In 8 eyes, retinal changes were suggestive of occlusion of CRA (6), combined occlusion of CRA and central retinal vein (1), and myopic degeneration with hypertensive retinopathy (1). The contralateral eye showed retinal ischemic changes in one patient. Radiological imaging showed orbital apex involvement in the 10 affected eyes and one contralateral eye. Ipsilateral cavernous sinus thrombosis, diffusion restriction on MRI of optic nerve, internal carotid artery narrowing/thrombosis, and cortical watershed infarcts were seen in 8, 4, 4, and 2 cases, respectively. The blood flow in CRA and ophthalmic artery was absent or reduced in all the 10 affected eyes and in 1 contralateral eye.

While the vaccination has made progress, there has been no study analyzing the federal/union vaccine policy and its effect on vaccination coverage across Indian states. In this context, this study analyses the federal vaccination policy and its effect on interstate variation in vaccine coverage and the correlation of state economy with vaccination coverage. Methods: The study analyses vaccine policy documents, secondary data on vaccination coverage and state gross domestic product (GDP) available in public domain. ANOVA test has been used to assess the effect of vaccine policy on interstate vaccine coverage and correlation-regression analysis has been conducted to assess the type and strength of association between gross state domestic product and vaccination coverage. Results: Interstate variation in vaccination coverage in the first 15 weeks was the least (F=3.5), when vaccine procurement and supply was entirely provided by the union/federal government and vaccination was limited to priority groups. However, with the extension of vaccine policy to other groups and reduction in federal government involvement in vaccine procurement, the interstate variation in vaccination coverage increased significantly (F=10.74) by the end of 30 weeks. The highest interstate variation was observed in the period between 23-30 weeks (F=25.31). State GDP was positively and strongly correlated with state vaccination coverage with a high coefficient of correlation (R=0.94) and high coefficient of determination (Rsqaure= 0.88).

This study aimed to investigate the role of apoptosis in the etiology of lymphopenia in patients with COVID-19. METHODS/SETTING: This multicentered, prospective, and case-control study was conducted with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (+) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients, and an age-gender matched control group. Samples were taken at the time of diagnosis and analyzed via flow cytometry within 24 hours. The participants' demographic data and initial laboratory tests were also recorded. RESULTS: In total, 33 patients with COVID-19 (mean age = 45.4  17.2) and 25 controls (mean age = 43.4  17.4) participated in the study. All patients were identified as having mild (16), moderate (5), or severe (12) disease severity. Both early and late apoptotic cells in B and T lymphocytes were increased in all patients with COVID-19 (p < 0.05). Early apoptotic B and T lymphocytes were also higher in severe cases compared to mild cases (p = 0.026). There was no significant difference between lymphopenia and apoptosis in patients with COVID-19. However, patients with lymphopenia (n = 14) and severe COVID-19 (p = 0.013) had increased early apoptotic T lymphocytes.

However, multicentre studies are lacking to support the understanding of the seroprevalence and kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 epidemic regions. METHOD: A multicentre cross-sectional study of suspected and confirmed patients from 4 epidemic cities in China and a cohort study of consecutive follow-up patients were conducted from 29/01/2020 to 12/03/2020. IgM and IgG antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 were tested by a chemiluminescence assay. Clinical information, including basic demographic data, clinical classification, and time interval from onset to sampling, was collected from each centre. RESULTS: A total of 571 patients were enrolled in the cross-sectional study, including 235 COVID-19 patients and 336 suspected patients, each with 91.9%:2.1% seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and 92.3%:5.4% seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgM.

Historically, though, it has often been palliated poorly at end of life. The aim of this work was to assess whether breathlessness in patients dying from COVID-19 was being managed appropriately. METHODS: A multicentre, retrospective analysis of clinical data was undertaken. Patients who had died of COVID-19 across three acute hospitals over a 2-month period were included. Those already prescribed background opioids and those who died in intensive care were excluded. Data were collected from clinical notes, where available. RESULTS: 71 patients from 18 wards (3 hospitals) were included. The median total dose of opioid and midazolam given in the last 24 hours of life (continuous subcutaneous infusion  'as required' medication) was 33 mg (14-55) and 15 mg (6-26), respectively. 37 patients (52%) were prescribed continuous subcutaneous infusions. There were 426 recorded respiratory rates of at least 25 breaths per minute, for which an opioid or benzodiazepine was given in 113 (27%) of instances.

To date, no assessment of REM OSA phenotyping performance has been conducted for any type of sleep testing technology. The objective of this study was to assess this for polysomnography and peripheral arterial tone-based home sleep apnea testing (PAT HSAT). In a dataset comprising 261 participants, the sensitivity and specificity of the agreement on REM OSA phenotyping was assessed for two independent scorings of polysomnography and a synchronously administered PAT HSAT. The sensitivity and specificity of REM OSA phenotyping were 0.87 and 0.89, respectively, for the polysomnography inter-scorer comparison, and 0.68 and 0.97 for the PAT HSAT on a single-night basis, using the conventional minimum required rapid eye movement sleep time of 30 min. Polysomnography-based REM OSA phenotyping was found to be sensitive and specific even for a single-night testing protocol. Peripheral arterial tone-based REM OSA phenotyping showed a lower sensitivity but a slightly higher specificity compared to polysomnography. In order to increase performance and conclusiveness of peripheral arterial tone-based REM OSA phenotyping, a multi-night protocol of 2-5 nights could be considered. Finally, the minimum required rapid eye movement sleep time could be lowered from the conventional 30 min to 15 min without significantly lowering REM OSA phenotyping sensitivity and specificity, while increasing the level of phenotyping conclusiveness.","output":"Phenotyping REM OSA by means of peripheral arterial tone-based home sleep apnea testing and polysomnography: A critical assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of both methods."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We report a case of post-coronavirus disease (COVID) immune hepatitis occurring in a young male with no pre-existing comorbidities.

A few studies were conducted investigating suicidality amid the first wave of the pandemic in Bangladesh, but none of these studies explored the predictive role of the suicidality-related factors (eg, behavior and health-related variables, COVID-19 risk, fear of COVID-19). Thus, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of suicidality and the predictive models explaining suicidality variance among Bangladeshi young adults during the second wave of the pandemic. METHODS: An online-based cross-sectional survey was conducted during the second wave of the pandemic (between 1 and 13 April 2021; a year after the pandemic's inception in the country). The survey questionnaire collected information on socio-demographics, behavior and health-related variables, COVID-19 risk, fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, and suicidality. A total of 756 data were analyzed (male 59%; mean age 22.24 4.39 years), and hierarchical regression was performed considering suicidality as the dependent variable. A p-value <0.05 was set to be statistically significant with a 95% of confidence interval. RESULTS: About 8.2% reported having at least suicidal thoughts within the pandemic inception to survey time (one-year suicidal ideation). More specifically, 7.40% had only suicidal ideation, whereas 0.10% planned for suicide, 0.70% attempted suicide. None of the socio-demographic variables was significantly associated with suicidality. Taking drugs, performing less physical activity, poor self-reporting health condition, being comorbid, being at higher COVID-19 risk, having fear of COVID-19 infection, and suffering from depression and anxiety were significantly associated with a higher risk of suicidality. However, the final model including all of the studied variables explained a 17.1% (F=8.245, p<0.001) variance in terms of suicidality. CONCLUSION: Although this study reported a lower severity of suicidality than prior Bangladeshi studies conducted during the first wave of the pandemic, a portion of people are still at risk of suicide and they should be given attention.","output":"Suicidality in Bangladeshi Young Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Behavioral Factors, COVID-19 Risk and Fear, and Mental Health Problems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The negative impact of COVID-19 crisis on international trade led to significant unwelcomed consequences for economies all over the world, given the actual scale of globalization and interconnection.

Finally, we compare the evolution of trade in services during the financial and the actual crises. We find that imports of services saw a larger drop than exports. In addition, export of services was less affected than export in goods, while imports of services were more severely affected than the drop in the imports of goods. Travel and tourism was the most affected, while the rest of the most important other sectors show a certain recovery at the end of 2020.

This so-called dysbiosis of the microbiome seems to be involved in immunological responses and may influence outcomes even in individuals who are not as vulnerable as a critically ill ICU population. It is therefore probable that dysbiosis of the microbiome is a consequence of critical illness and may, subsequently, shape an inadequate response to these circumstances. Bronchoscopic studies have revealed that the carina represents the densest site of bacterial DNA along healthy airways, with a tapering density with further bifurcations. This likely reflects the influence of micro-aspiration as the primary route of microbial immigration in healthy adults. Though bacterial DNA density grows extremely sparse at smaller airways, bacterial signal is still consistently detectable in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, likely reflecting the fact that lavage via a wedged bronchoscope samples an enormous surface area of small airways and alveoli. The dogma of lung sterility also violated numerous observations that long predated culture-independent microbiology. The bodys resident microbial consortia (gut and/or respiratory microbiota) affect normal host inflammatory and immune response mechanisms. Disruptions in these host-pathogen interactions have been associated with infection and altered innate immunity.

Age, morbidity and dementia have been associated with adverse outcome. AIMS: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on health status in home-dwelling patients. METHODS: 848 home-dwelling outpatients with dementia contacted from April 27 to 30 and evaluated by a semi-structured interview to evaluate possible health complication due to COVID-19 from February 21 to April 30. Age, sex, education, clinical characteristics (including diagnosis of dementia) and flu vaccination history were obtained from previous medical records. Items regarding change in health status and outcome since the onset of the outbreak were collected. COVID-19 was diagnosed in patients who developed symptoms according to WHO criteria or tested positive at nasal/throat swab if hospitalized. Unplanned hospitalization, institutionalization and mortality were recorded. RESULTS: Patients were 79.7 years old (SD 7.1) and 63.1% were females. Ninety-five (11.2%) patients developed COVID-19-like symptoms. Non COVID-19 and COVID-19 patients differed for frequency of diabetes (18.5% vs. 37.9%, p < 0.001), COPD (7.3% vs. 18.9%, p < 0.001), and previous flu vaccination (56.7% vs. 37.9%, p < 0.001). Diabetes and COPD were positively associated with COVID-19, whereas higher dementia severity and flu vaccination showed an inverse association.

While much research relies upon viruses grown in cultured immortalized cells, human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV-3) evolves in culture. Cultured viruses differ in their properties compared to clinical strains. We present a genome-wide survey of HPIV-3 adaptations to culture using metagenomic next-generation sequencing of matched pairs of clinical samples and primary culture isolates (zero passage virus). Nonsynonymous changes arose during primary viral isolation, almost entirely in the genes encoding the two surface glycoproteinsthe receptor binding protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) or the fusion protein (F). We recovered genomes from 95 HPIV-3 primary culture isolates and 23 HPIV-3 strains directly from clinical samples. HN mutations arising during primary viral isolation resulted in substitutions at HNs dimerization/F-interaction site, a site critical for activation of viral fusion. Alterations in HN dimer interface residues known to favor infection in culture occurred within 4 days (H552 and N556). A novel cluster of residues at a different face of the HN dimer interface emerged (P241 and R242) and imply a role in HPIV-3-mediated fusion. Functional characterization of these culture-associated HN mutations in a clinical isolate background revealed acquisition of the fusogenic phenotype associated with cultured HPIV-3; the HN-F complex showed enhanced fusion and decreased receptor-cleaving activity. These results utilize a method for identifying genome-wide changes associated with brief adaptation to culture to highlight the notion that even brief exposure to immortalized cells may affect key viral properties and underscore the balance of features of the HN-F complex required for fitness by circulating viruses.","output":"Viral Entry Properties Required for Fitness in Humans Are Lost through Rapid Genomic Change during Viral Isolation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Report the results of a participatory approach in Tunisian orthopedic surgery, for the development of a consensus of experts, on the identification of the list of pathologies to always be considered as non-postponable emergencies, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

At higher doses, LPS induces rapid shock (within 10 min), leading to death within 1 h. This type of shock differs from so-called endotoxin shock, in which shock signs and death occur several hours or more later. Here, we found that platelet depletion (by a monoclonal anti-platelet antibody) prevented LPS-induced rapid shock, but increased delayed lethality. In Japan, glycyrrhizin (GL), a compound isolated from licorice, is daily and slowly infused intravenously into chronic hepatitis C patients. A single bolus intravenous injection into mice of GL (200 mg/kg or less) shortly before (or simultaneously with) LPS injection reduced the pulmonary platelet accumulation and the severity of the rapid shock, and prevented death in both the early and later periods. GL itself, at 400 mg/kg, produced no detectable abnormalities in the appearance or activity of mice. Intraperitoneal injection of aspirin or dexamethasone had only marginal effects on LPS-induced platelet responses and lethality. These results suggest that platelets play important roles in the development of both the rapid and delayed types of shock induced by LPS. Although the mechanism by which GL suppresses platelet responses and delayed lethality remains to be clarified, GL might provide a strategy for alleviating the acute respiratory distress syndrome seen in sepsis.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether preterm newborns placed on their left side at birth, compared with those placed on their back, have higher preductal oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 5 min of life. DESIGN/METHODS We randomised infants <32 weeks to be placed on their back or on their left side immediately after birth. Respiratory support was given with a T-piece and face mask with initial fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.3. The FiO2 was increased if SpO2 was <70% at 5 min. RESULTS We enrolled 87 infants, 41 randomised to back and 46 to left side. The groups were well matched for demographic variables. Fourteen (6 back and 8 left side) infants did not receive respiratory support in the first 5 min. The mean (SD) SpO2 was not different between the groups (back 72 (23) % versus left side 71 (24) %, p=0.956). We observed no adverse effects of placing infants on their side and found no differences in secondary outcomes between the groups.

Using the PRISMA guidelines we systematically reviewed studies that compared the gut microbiota in NDD participants (with an age inferior to thirty) to the gut microbiota of controls, regardless of the data analysis methods used. The MEDLINE, Scopus and PsycINFO databases were searched up to September 2018. 31 studies with a total sample size of 3002 ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and 84 ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) participants were included in this systematic review. Independent data extraction and quality assessment were conducted. The quality of the studies was rated from low to high. Population characterization and experimental methods were highly heterogeneous in terms of the data available, selection of criteria, and dysbiosis measurement. A dysbiosis was reported in 28 studies in terms of either diversity, bacterial composition or metabolome dysfunction. Due to heterogeneity, a quantitative synthesis was not applicable. In this paper, we discuss the different biases to understand the complexity of microbiota and neurodevelopmental disorders to provide leads for future cohort studies looking to answer the questions raised by the trillions of microorganisms that inhabit key body niches.","output":"Is there a dysbiosis in individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder compared to controls over the course of development?

Methods: Eight electronic literature databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Wanfang Database, Chinese Biomedical Database) were searched from their inceptions to May 18, 2021, to identify relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The primary outcomes analyzed included the total effectiveness rate and adverse events (ADRs). The secondary outcomes analyzed included the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and 6-min walk test (6MWT). Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess quality of the analyzed RCTs. Stata and OpenBUGS software were used to prior to the systematic review and network meta-analysis. Results: Sixty-one eligible trials involved 5,567 patients and one of the following 15 TCMIs: Shuxuetong, Shenmai, Shenfu, Shengmai, Danshenduofenyansuan, Danhong, Dazhuhongjingtian, Xinmailong, Dengzhanxixin, Gualoupi, Shuxuening, Xuesaitong, Yiqi Fumai, Shenqi Fuzheng, Huangqi. Network meta-analysis revealed that Shuxuetong injection + CT group was superior to CT only in improving the total effectiveness rate [odds ratio (OR): 7.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17C27.41]. Shenmai injection + CT was superior to CT only for LVEF (OR: 8.97, CI: 4.67C13.18), Xinmailong injection + CT was superior to CT only for NT-proBNP (OR: ?317.70, CI: ?331.10C303.10), Shenqi Fuzheng injection + CT was superior to CT only for BNP (OR: ?257.30, CI: ?308.40C242.80); and Danhong injection + CT was superior to CT only for 6MWT (OR: 84.40, CI: 62.62?106.20).

Data are needed to characterize these infections and define correlates of breakthrough and infectivity. METHODS: At the largest medical center in Israel, we identified breakthrough infections by performing extensive evaluations of health care workers who were symptomatic (including mild symptoms) or had known infection exposure. These evaluations included epidemiologic investigations, repeat reverse-transcriptaseCpolymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays, antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic testing (Ag-RDT), serologic assays, and genomic sequencing. Correlates of breakthrough infection were assessed in a caseCcontrol analysis. We matched patients with breakthrough infection who had antibody titers obtained within a week before SARS-CoV-2 detection (peri-infection period) with four to five uninfected controls and used generalized estimating equations to predict the geometric mean titers among cases and controls and the ratio between the titers in the two groups. We also assessed the correlation between neutralizing antibody titers and N gene cycle threshold (Ct) values with respect to infectivity. RESULTS: Among 1497 fully vaccinated health care workers for whom RT-PCR data were available, 39 SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections were documented. Neutralizing antibody titers in case patients during the peri-infection period were lower than those in matched uninfected controls (case-to-control ratio, 0.361; 95% confidence interval, 0.165 to 0.787). Higher peri-infection neutralizing antibody titers were associated with lower infectivity (higher Ct values). Most breakthrough cases were mild or asymptomatic, although 19% had persistent symptoms (>6 weeks). The B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant was found in 85% of samples tested. A total of 74% of case patients had a high viral load (Ct value, <30) at some point during their infection; however, of these patients, only 17 (59%) had a positive result on concurrent Ag-RDT. No secondary infections were documented. CONCLUSIONS: Among fully vaccinated health care workers, the occurrence of breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2 was correlated with neutralizing antibody titers during the peri-infection period.

To study the inhalation of an active form of hydrogen effect to mucosal and system immunity in a rehabilitation program for health workers. Materials and methods. The study involved patients that survived COVID-19 after therapy with inhaled hydrogen for 90 minutes (n=30), and a control group of patients treated according to standard protocol for managing patients that survived COVID-19 during the rehabilitation period (n=30). Biomaterial was carried out in 2 stages: on the first day of the study, before the accepted therapy and on the 10th day of the study. The indicators of humoral and cellular immunity were studied. The levels of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and IgG were investigated using the method of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Phagocytosis was assessed on a Beckman Coulter FC-500 flow cytometer. Statistical data processing was carried out in the GraphPad Prism 7.00 software using nonparametric methods. Results.

These efforts were based on (1) phone diagnosis, dispatch, and transport; and (2) border management checkpoints. METHODS: This is a descriptive study of MDAs role in pandemic response during the pre-exposure period. Medical emergency telephone calls from either individuals or medical sources were identified by a dispatcher as suspected COVID-19 based on symptoms and travel exposure. Data were also collected for travelers approaching the MDA border checkpoint at Ben-Gurion International Airport. RESULTS: The total number of protected transports during this time was 121. Of these, 44 (36.3%) were referred by medical sources, and 77 (63.7%) were identified as suspected COVID-19 by dispatchers. The checkpoint was accessed by 156 travelers: 87 were sent to home-quarantine; 12 were transported to the hospital; 18 were refused entry; and 39 required no further action.

Despite higher basal stress, red blood cells (RBCs) from eligible donors that are heterozygous for beta-thalassemia traits (Thal(+)) possess a differential nitrogen-related metabolism, and cope better with storage stress compared to the control. Nevertheless, not much is known about how storage impacts the proteome of membrane and extracellular vesicles (EVs) in Thal(+). For this purpose, RBC units from twelve Thal(+) donors were studied through proteomics, immunoblotting, electron microscopy, and functional ELISA assays, versus units from sex- and aged-matched controls. Thal(+) RBCs exhibited less irreversible shape modifications. Their membrane proteome was characterized by different levels of structural, lipid raft, transport, chaperoning, redox, and enzyme components. The most prominent findings include the upregulation of myosin proteoforms, arginase-1, heat shock proteins, and protein kinases, but the downregulation of nitrogen-related transporters. The unique membrane proteome was also mirrored, in part, to that of Thal(+) EVs. Network analysis revealed interesting connections of membrane vesiculation with storage and stress hemolysis, along with proteome control modulators of the RBC membrane.

Mobile health (mHealth) app interventions are promising for patients with PTSD, as they can provide easily accessible support, strategies, and information. However, knowledge about mHealth interventions is sparse and primarily based on quantitative studies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to qualitatively explore the experiences of patients with PTSD with regard to using an mHealth app as a stand-alone intervention before commencing psychotherapeutic treatment. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with 14 participants 6 weeks after they received the app. The participants were all referred to PTSD treatment and were waiting to commence psychotherapeutic treatment. During this waiting time, the participants had no contact with the health staff. Interviews were transcribed and were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 3 themes were identifiedthe use of app, being a patient, and the overall evaluation of the app. The use of the app was described with the subtheme of habits, and the theme of being a patient included the subthemes of having negative experiences with the app and being a part of a research project. The use of the app encompassed how psychological factors and technical problems could interfere with the use of the app. The theme of being a patient depicted that the waiting time before starting treatment was long, and a subgroup of patients experienced feeling worse during this time, which they partly attributed to using the app. Several suggestions for change have been described in the overall evaluation of the app. CONCLUSIONS: The findings in this study revealed that emotional arousal influenced the use of the app and that it was difficult for participants to establish a habit of using the app, thus reflecting the importance of supporting habit formation when implementing an mHealth app in mental health care services. This study makes an important contribution to the field of mHealth research, as it revealed that some participants had negative experiences resulting from using the app, thus reflecting the potential harm of having an mHealth app without the support of a clinician.

METHODS: Based on 2017 data from the American Hospital Association survey, Area Health Resource Files and Medicare cost reports, we used logistic regression models to identify predictors of telehealth and eICU capabilities in US hospitals. RESULTS: We found that larger hospitals (OR(telehealth) = 1.013; P < .01) and system members (OR(telehealth) = 1.55; P < .01) (OR(eICU) = 1.65; P < .01) had higher odds of possessing telehealth and eICU capabilities.

These problems have created significant psychological and mental health concerns for frontline healthcare providers. This study aimed to compare the levels of vicarious traumatization between frontline and non-frontline healthcare providers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: All the subjects who met the inclusion criteria were recruited for this comparative cross-sectional study, which was conducted from May to July 2020 in two hospitals in Kelantan, Malaysia. A self-administered questionnaire, namely, the Malay-version Vicarious Traumatization Questionnaire and the Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey were utilized. A descriptive analysis, independent t-test, and analysis of covariance were performed using SPSS Statistics version 26. RESULTS: A total of 160 frontline and 146 non-frontline healthcare providers were recruited. Vicarious traumatization was significantly higher among the non-frontline healthcare providers (estimated marginal mean [95% CI]: 79.7 [75.12, 84.30]) compared to the frontline healthcare providers (estimated marginal mean [95% CI]: 74.3 [68.26, 80.37]) after adjusting for sex, duration of employment, and social support.

Hence, support from various resources, such as colleagues, family, the general public, and the government, may play an essential role in the mental health of healthcare providers.","output":"Vicarious traumatization in healthcare providers in response to COVID-19 pandemic in Kelantan, Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) olfactory dysfunction remains poorly characterized, often limited by self-reported measures. Given the logistical challenges of psychophysical testing, understanding the longitudinal relationship between self-reported and quantitative measures can help accurately identify patients with persistent olfactory dysfunction. This study aimed to longitudinally correlate measured and subjective olfactory function in COVID-19 subjects. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal study evaluating subjective and measured olfaction was conducted on ambulatory COVID-19 subjects. Olfaction scores were obtained using a visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 = anosmia, 10 = normosmia) and the validated 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT). Weekly testing was performed until recovery (BSIT &#8805; 9/12 and/or VAS = 10/10) or study completion. RESULTS: Eighty-six polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive COVID-19 subjects were recruited &#8804;3 days from diagnosis and 52 completed longitudinal testing. Among those with self-reported smell loss at recruitment, similar levels (75.8%) of objective (BSIT &#8805; 9/12) and subjective recovery were obtained using a VAS cutoff &#8805;8, yet only 30.3% reported complete subjective recovery (VAS = 10). Median times to objective and complete subjective olfactory recovery were 12  2.3 and 24  3.5 days, respectively. Although both measures showed chemosensory improvement, the distributions of objective and full subjective olfactory recovery differed significantly (log rank test &#967;2 = 6.46, degrees of freedom [df] = 1, p = 0.011). Overall correlation between BSIT and VAS scores was moderate to strong across longitudinal follow-up (rs = 0.41-0.65). CONCLUSION: Self-reported and psychophysically measured COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction improve at similar levels and are moderately correlated longitudinally, yet there is a significant delay in complete subjective recovery. Psychophysical testing in conjunction with qualitative assessments may be considered for counseling and follow-up of patients with COVID-19 smell loss.","output":"Assessment of patient recognition of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated olfactory loss and recovery: a longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the absence of a cure in the time of a pandemic, social distancing measures seem to be the most effective intervention to slow the spread of disease. Various simulation-based studies have been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of these measures. While those studies unanimously confirm the mitigating effect of social distancing on disease spread, the reported effectiveness varies from 10% to more than 90% reduction in the number of infections. This level of uncertainty is mostly due to the complex dynamics of epidemics and their time-variant parameters. However, real transactional data can reduce uncertainty and provide a less noisy picture of the effectiveness of social distancing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to integrate multiple transactional data sets (GPS mobility data from Google and Apple as well as disease statistics from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) to study the role of social distancing policies in 26 countries and analyze the transmission rate of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic over the course of 5 weeks. METHODS: Relying on the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and official COVID-19 reports, we first calculated the weekly transmission rate (?) of COVID-19 in 26 countries for 5 consecutive weeks. Then, we integrated these data with the Google and Apple mobility data sets for the same time frame and used a machine learning approach to investigate the relationship between the mobility factors and ? values. RESULTS: Gradient boosted trees regression analysis showed that changes in mobility patterns resulting from social distancing policies explain approximately 47% of the variation in the disease transmission rates. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with simulation-based studies, real cross-national transactional data confirms the effectiveness of social distancing interventions in slowing the spread of COVID-19. In addition to providing less noisy and more generalizable support for the idea of social distancing, we provide specific insights for public health policy makers regarding locations that should be given higher priority for enforcing social distancing measures.","output":"No Place Like Home: Cross-National Data Analysis of the Efficacy of Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Compared to individuals without type 2 diabetes mellitus, the relative increase in cardiovascular mortality is much higher in women than in men in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS We evaluated data from 7443 individuals (3792 women, 50.9%), aged 20 to 81 years, from two independent population-based investigations, SHIP-0 and MONICA/KORA S3. We analyzed the longitudinal sex-specific associations of lipoprotein(a) with cardiovascular mortality in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus using Cox regression. RESULTS During a median follow-up of 20.5 years (136,802 person-years), 657 participants (404 men and 253 women) died of cardiovascular causes. Among individuals without type 2 diabetes mellitus, men had a significantly higher risk for cardiovascular mortality compared to women in unadjusted model and after adjustment. On the other hand, in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the risk for cardiovascular mortality was not different between men and women in the unadjusted model and after adjustment for age, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, fasting status and study sample (SHIP-0, MONICA/KORA S3). Further adjustment for lipoprotein(a) concentrations had no impact on the hazard ratio (HR) for cardiovascular mortality comparing men versus women in individuals without type 2 diabetes mellitus [HR: 1.94; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63 to 2.32; p < 0.001]. In individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus, however, further adjustment for lipoprotein(a) led to an increased risk for cardiovascular mortality in men and a decreased risk in women resulting in a statistically significant difference between men and women (HR: 1.53; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.24; p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS Women are described to have a stronger relative increase in cardiovascular mortality than men when comparing individuals with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Nevertheless, the reports on the characteristics of COVID-19 patients and especially on factors related to the severe or fatal outcome of the disease included information on more frequent CVD risk factors and atherosclerotic CVD. This article reviews the evidence on the exposure to CVD risk factors in the Polish adult population and discusses evidence on the associations between CVD risk factors and COVID-19. CVD and CVD risk factors, obesity and diabetes, in particular, are related to the severe course or fatal outcome of COVID-19. High prevalence of CVD risk factors with an increasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes could make the Polish population more sensitive to COVID-19 incidence and put infected persons at higher risk of serious complications and fatal outcome. Likely, the increased number of CVD deaths observed during the pandemic could be explained partially by the high prevalence of CVD risk factors and atherosclerotic CVD, as well as by the direct cardiac complications of COVID-19, short-term higher risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, and possibly by the underuse of lifesaving procedures in acute and chronic CVD.","output":"The burden of cardiovascular disease risk factors: A current problem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe Covid-19 pandemic has presented numerous challenges to the NHS and medical education 1 After a period of several months during the pandemic when no simulation-based education was delivered in our paediatric department, we wished to explore a safe way to reintroduce it We wanted to ensure a multidisciplinary approach and ensure that staff who were shielding could participate With these requirements in mind, we devised a programme of in-situ simulation which was also streamed via Webex, an online meeting platform Summary of WorkBetween May and July 2020 we ran seven low fidelity in-situ simulation sessions based on both Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 related topics The aim was primarily to improve teamwork and communication between staff wearing personal protective equipment, and secondarily to improve clinical knowledge of aerosol-generating procedures and important paediatric emergencies We used a basic manikin with a remote-controlled simulated patient monitor Staff joining the session on Webex could see and hear both the scenario and debrief and were able to ask questions at the end of each session A debrief led by trained staff was held immediately after each scenario Feedback was collected from both participants and observers after every session via a survey and was used to inform subsequent sessions Summary of Results20 nursing staff and 20 medical staff physically participated in scenarios 4/7 sessions were streamed via Webex Of the sessions not streamed, two did not have participant consent and one lacked equipment The number of participants joining each session via Webex ranged from 11 to 26 Across all seven sessions, 100% (27/27) of staff providing feedback thought the faculty, session content, and debriefs were good or excellent 78% (21/27) thought the standard of technology and equipment was good or excellent, 22% (6/27) thought it was average The main issue cited was poor sound quality for Webex participants Communication, team work and clinical knowledge were cited as learning points in all sessions Discussion and ConclusionsIt has been possible to deliver a safe, accessible, multidisciplinary in-situ paediatric simulation programme during the Covid-19 pandemic While feedback was largely positive, it must be noted that the response rate was generally poor, averaging 39% (range 0 C 100%) RecommendationsThe main difficulty encountered was balancing a safe psychological environment, the key determinant of learning in simulation,2 with access to simulation-based education for shielding staff Further research is required on the impact of streaming sessions on learning ReferencesYuen J, Xie F Medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives from UK trainees Postgrad Med J 2020;96:432C33 Rudolph JW, Raemer DB, Simonn R Establishing a safe container for learning in simulation: the role of the presimulation briefing Simul Healthc 2014;9:339C49","output":"PG46 A novel approach to paediatric simulation during the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Notwithstanding the success of conventional field trials for vaccines against COVID-19, human challenge trials (HCTs) that could obtain more information about these and about other vaccines and further strategies against it are about to start in the UK.

For safety reasons, these HCTs will exclude candidate participants of advanced age or with comorbidities that worsen COVID-19, yet a vaccine should (perhaps especially) protect such populations. We turn this clich on its head. The truth is that either an HCT or a field trial has intrinsic generalisability limitations, that an HCT can expedite protection of high-risk participants even without challenging them with the virus, and that an important route to obtaining results generalisable to high-risk groups under either strategy is facilitated by HCTs.","output":"Do coronavirus vaccine challenge trials have a distinctive generalisability problem?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be detected indirectly by measuring the host immune response.

Methods: Sera (n=533) from patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 (n=153) were tested using a high-throughput quantitative IgM and IgG assay that detects antibodies to the spike protein receptor binding domain and nucleocapsid protein. Individual and serial samples covered the time of initial diagnosis, during the disease course, and following recovery. We evaluated antibody kinetics and correlation between magnitude of the response and disease severity. Results: Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 antibody production varied considerably. Among 52 patients with 3 or more serial specimens, 44 (84.6%) and 42 (80.8%) had observed IgM and IgG seroconversion at a median of 8 and 10 days, respectively. Compared to those with milder disease, peak measurements were significantly higher for patients admitted to the intensive care unit for all time intervals between 6 and 20 days for IgM, and all intervals after 5 days for IgG. Conclusions: High sensitivity assays with a robust dynamic range provide a comprehensive picture of host antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.

However, studies focused on Western samples and multivariate analyses of relations between potential risk factors and mental health in this population are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To assess the mental health of Chinese adults bereaved due to COVID-19. To elucidate the associations of demographic and loss-related characteristics with mental health after COVID-19 bereavement. METHODS: Four hundred twenty-two Chinese adults (56% male; Mean age: 32.73 years) recently bereaved due to COVID-19 completed an online survey. Demographic and loss-related characteristics and prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were assessed. RESULTS: Clinically relevant prolonged grief (49%, na?=a?207), posttraumatic stress (22%, na?=a?92), depressive (70%; na?=a?294), and anxiety symptoms (65%; na?=a?272) were reported by a substantial group of participants. In four multiple regressions predicting each mental health indicator, Fs(15,406)a?=a?5.08-7.74, Ps < 0.001, loss-characteristics (i.e., a shorter time since loss, ?sa?=a? -.12-.11, loss of a first-degree relative, ?sa?=a? .18-.37) and subjective loss experiences (i.e., feeling traumatized by the loss, ?sa?=a? .13-.18, or a close and/or conflictual relation with the deceased, ?sa?=a? .12-.23) related most consistently to mental health problems. CONCLUSION: Many Chinese adults bereaved due to COVID-19 experience severe mental health problems.

While often understood as a consequence of self-regulation via AGN feedback, it can also be explained by alternative SMBH accretion models. Here, we expand on previous work by studying the growth of SMBHs with the help of a large suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations (MassiveFIRE) that are part of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. The growth of SMBHs is modelled in post-processing with different black hole accretion models, placements, and merger treatments, and validated by comparing to on-the-fly calculations. Scaling relations predicted by the gravitational torque driven accretion (GTDA) model agree with observations at low redshift without the need for AGN feedback, in contrast to models in which the accretion rate depends strongly on SMBH mass. At high redshift, we find deviations from the local scaling relations in line with previous theoretical results. In particular, SMBHs are under-massive, presumably due to stellar feedback, but start to grow efficiently once their host galaxies reach $M_* \\\\sim 10^{10} M_{\\\\odot}$. We analyse and explain these findings in the context of a simple analytic model. Finally, we show that the predicted scaling relations depend sensitively on the SMBH location and the efficiency of SMBH merging, particularly in low-mass systems. These findings highlight the relevance of understanding the evolution of SMBH-galaxy scaling relations to predict the rate of gravitational wave signals from SMBH mergers across cosmic history.","output":"Black hole -- galaxy scaling relations in FIRE: the importance of black hole location and mergers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The perception of risk affects how people behave during crises.

Here, we studied the pathogenicity of variants of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 in rhesus macaques and compared it to a recent clade B.1 SARS-CoV-2 isolate containing the D614G substitution in the spike protein. The B.1.1.7 VOC behaved similarly to the D614G with respect to clinical disease, virus shedding and virus replication in the respiratory tract. Inoculation with the B.1.351 isolate resulted in lower clinical scores in rhesus macaques that correlated with lower virus titers in the lungs, less severe histologic lung lesions and less viral antigen detected in the lungs.

These domestic regulatory frameworks align to international scientific risk assessment methodologies on a case-by-case basis. Regulatory agencies in 70 countries around the world have conducted in excess of 4400 risk assessments, all reaching the same conclusion: GM crops and foods that have been assessed provide no greater risk to human health or the environment than non-GM crops and foods.

METHODS: We examined retrospective visit and billing data, regardless of payer, from 16 independent pediatric practices that utilize a common electronic medical record platform within an Accountable Care Organization of 252 pediatricians in 71 offices throughout metropolitan Chicago. We categorized visits as Well-Child and Immunization-Only (WC-IO) or Other types and identified visits with a telemedicine billing modifier. Diagnoses for Other visits were tallied and categorized using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification System. We summarized counts of visits and the proportion of visits with a telemedicine billing modifier in one-week epochs for 2020 compared with 2019. RESULTS: There were 102 942 total visits (72 030 WC-IO; 30 912 Other) in 2020 and 144 672 visits (80 578 WC-IO; 64 094 Other) in 2019. WC-IO visits in 2020 were half of 2019 visits at the start of the Illinois Stay-at-Home Order and returned greater than 90% of 2019 visits in 8 weeks.

We have previously shown that local type I interferon response within the central nervous system (CNS) is involved in the protection of mice against tick-borne flavivirus infection. However, the cells responsible for mounting this protective response are not defined. METHODS: Primary astrocytes were isolated from wild-type (WT) and interferon alpha receptor knock out (IFNAR(?/?)) mice and infected with neurotropic flaviviruses. Viral replication and spread, IFN induction and response, and cellular viability were analyzed. Transcriptional levels in primary astrocytes treated with interferon or supernatant from virus-infected cells were analyzed by RNA sequencing and evaluated by different bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: Here, we show that astrocytes control viral replication of different TBEV strains, JEV, WNV, and ZIKV. In contrast to fibroblast, astrocytes mount a rapid interferon response and restrict viral spread. Furthermore, basal expression levels of key interferon-stimulated genes are high in astrocytes compared to mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Bioinformatic analysis of RNA-sequencing data reveals that astrocytes have established a basal antiviral state which contributes to the rapid viral recognition and upregulation of interferons. The most highly upregulated pathways in neighboring cells were linked to type I interferon response and innate immunity. The restriction in viral growth was dependent on interferon signaling, since loss of the interferon receptor, or its blockade in wild-type cells, resulted in high viral replication and virus-induced cytopathic effects. Astrocyte supernatant from TBEV-infected cells can restrict TBEV growth in astrocytes already 6 h post infection, the effect on neurons is highly reinforced, and astrocyte supernatant from 3 h post infection is already protective. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the combination of an intrinsic constitutive antiviral response and the fast induction of type I IFN production by astrocytes play an important role in self-protection of astrocytes and suppression of flavivirus replication in the CNS.

Patients with COVID-19 have chance in suffering a serious damage of respiratory system which then lead to hypoxemia. The harmful of silent hypoxemia is that either the patients are remain untreated or they will not seek any treatment at all though their blood oxygen levels (SpO2 levels) slowly decrease. Especially those who isolated at home. Pulse oximeter is a mini device that evaluate the level of arterial blood saturation. This article gives a short review about the principal application advantage and disadvantage of pulse oximetry in maintaining the COVID-19 patients with hypoxemia. Two basic principles of pulse oximetry that are important: (a) to differentiate the oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) (b) to get the value of SpO2 from arterial compartment blood. How pulse oximeter detects SpO2 is based on the amount of red and IR light absorbed. Pulse oximeter can detect an abnormality of respiratory system in COVID-19 patients that may cannot be detected earlier. Pulse oximeter also helps diagnosing some severe pneumonia cases. It also can be reliable to diagnose an ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndromes) if the devices are found limited (WHO 2020).

METHODS: To identify host proteins that may contribute to the risk of severe COVID-19, we undertook proteome-wide genetic colocalisation tests, and polygenic (pan) and cis-Mendelian randomisation analyses leveraging publicly available protein and COVID-19 datasets. RESULTS: Our analytic approach identified several known targets (e.g. ABO, OAS1), but also nominated new proteins such as soluble Fas (colocalisation probability >0.9, p=1  10(-4)), implicating Fas-mediated apoptosis as a potential target for COVID-19 risk. The polygenic (pan) and cis-Mendelian randomisation analyses showed consistent associations of genetically predicted ABO protein with several COVID-19 phenotypes. The ABO signal is highly pleiotropic, and a look-up of proteins associated with the ABO signal revealed that the strongest association was with soluble CD209. We demonstrated experimentally that CD209 directly interacts with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a mechanism that could explain the ABO association with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our work provides a prioritised list of host targets potentially exploited by SARS-CoV-2 and is a precursor for further research on CD209 and FAS as therapeutically tractable targets for COVID-19.

Then, participants were randomly assigned to four different message conditions: (a) gain messages focused on the positive outcomes associated with doing physical activity at home; (b) non-loss messages focused on the avoided negative outcomes associated with doing physical activity at home; (d) loss messages focused on the negative outcomes associated with not doing physical activity at home; (c) non-gain messages focused on the missed positive outcomes associated with not doing physical activity at home. After reading the messages, participants answered a series of questions regarding their perception of threat and fear, their evaluation of the messages, and their attitude and intention toward exercising at home at Time 2. Using multigroup structural equation modeling, we compared message conditions, and tested whether the effects of the messages on attitude and intention at Time 2 were mediated by message-induced threat, message-induced fear, and message evaluation. Results showed that the perception of the messages as not threatening was the key point to activate a positive evaluation of the recommendation. The highest persuasive effect was observed in the case of the non-loss frame, which did not threaten the receivers, triggered a moderated fear and, in turn, activated a positive evaluation of the recommendation, as well as higher attitude and intention to do home-based physical activity at Time 2.

The rates of removal of the virus HA activity and gp 125 suggested that this polypeptide was an essential part of the virus haemagglutinin. The lack of evidence for any interpeptide disulphide bonds suggested that the loss of these glycoproteins was due to an alteration in their conformation brought about by the cleavage of intrapeptide disulphide bonds.

Sweden's unique strategy for managing COVID-19 involved no national lockdown. Emphasis was instead placed on limiting crowding and asking citizens to practice social distancing measures. AIM: To gain a deeper understanding of how women not infected by SARS-CoV-2 experienced pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. METHODS: This was a qualitative study with a reflective lifeworld approach. Fourteen women that had not contracted COVID-19 and who were pregnant during the first and second wave of the pandemic were interviewed. Data were analysed with a phenomenological reflective lifeworld approach. FINDINGS: The essence of the women's experiences of being pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic was best described as being in the shadow of the unknown, where the COVID-19 pandemic could at times totally overshadow the experience of being pregnant, while at other times, rays of sunlight pierced through the clouds. The experience was characterised by having to deal with the uncertainties caused by the pandemic and feelings of being in an information echo. Women felt socially isolated and had to face maternal check-ups without the support of their partners. There was, however, a strong trust in maternal health-care services despite the lack of information available. CONCLUSION: Being in the shadow of the unknown represents the uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on the experience of pregnancy. Sufficient information, a companion of choice and screening for emotional well-being are important factors in maternity care during pandemics.","output":"Being in the shadow of the unknown - Swedish women's lived experiences of pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic, a phenomenological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Session introduction The Covid 19 pandemic had and continues to have a significant impact on the world of work as we know it.

Children with medical complexity (CMC) require many medical services and are generally prone to infectious complications. Little is known about the impact of the pandemic on families of CMC. Understanding how CMC families experience the COVID-19 pandemic is essential to tailor healthcare services to answer their needs more effectively. OBJECTIVES: We explored parental experience of CMC during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how the complex care program (CCP) answers their new needs. DESIGN/METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted between July 2020 and January 2021 in a tertiary care pediatric university hospital centre. Semi-structured interviews were done with parents of CMC, admitted in the CCP at least 1 year prior to the beginning of the pandemic. The interview guide was co-constructed by physicians and nurses from the CCP. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using NVivo. Data were organized into codes and categories. Thematic content analysis was performed by grouping categories and highlighting emerging themes. RESULTS: Eleven families (14 parents C 4 fathers, including 3 couples) were interviewed. The first wave of the pandemic seemed to have caused important uncertainty and anxiety amongst parents of CMC. Almost all the parents reported cancelling numerous appointments in order to avoid coming to the hospital at all costs. Some parents, worrying specifically about the fragility of their child, stopped working and stayed home to reduce transmission risks. Fear of facing shortages in medications, nutritional supplements and medical equipment for home care was frequently expressed. They did not express worries about the de-confinement periods. The support provided by the CCPs staff was greatly appreciated, namely active problem-solving via phone calls, videoconferences, emails and pictures, leading to fewer hospital visits and less need to seek emergency care. Some reported that more general communication from the CCP (e.g., a weekly information email), would have helped to interpret the overwhelming amount of information from the media. Parents expressed a strong desire to maintain telemedicine services after the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic brought additional worries to parents of CMC enrolled in CCPs, including fear of shortages and virus transmission. Direct communication with the CCP and remote problem-solving were greatly appreciated by families. Improvement to follow-up include finding ways to help interpreting data from the media.","output":"99 Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on children with medical complexity: Parental perspective about the role of a Complex Care program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, many pneumonia cases with unidentified sources appeared in Wuhan, Hubei, China, with clinical symptoms like viral pneumonia Deep sequencing analysis of samples from lower respiratory tract revealed a novel coronavirus, called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Currently there is a rapid global spread World Health Organization declare the disease a pandemic condition The pathologic source of this disease was a new RNA virus from Coronaviridae family, which was named COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 entry starts with the binding of the spike glycoprotein expressed on the viral envelope to ACE2 on the alveolar surface followed by clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 complex SARS-CoV-2 enters the cells through endocytosis process, which is possibly facilitated, via a pH dependent endosomal cysteine protease cathepsins Once inside the cells, SARS-CoV-2 exploits the endogenous transcriptional machinery of alveolar cells to replicate and spread through the entire lung Endosomal acidic pH for SARS-CoV-2 processing and internalization is critical After entering the cells, it possibly activates or hijack many intracellular pathways in favor of its replication In the current opinion article, we will explain the possible involvement of unfolded protein response as a cellular stress response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection","output":"Endoplasmic reticulum as a potential therapeutic target for covid-19 infection management?

Social class is a likely explanation of mortality disparities across and within racial/ethnic groups. This is the first U.S. study of social class and COVID-19 mortality in working age adults. Objectives: To determine the joint effects of social class, race/ethnicity, and gender on the burden of COVID-19 mortality. A secondary objective was to determine whether differences in opportunities for remote work were correlated with COVID-19 death rates for sociodemographic groups. Design: Annual mortality study which used a special government tabulation of 2020 COVID-19 related deaths stratified by decedent social class (educational attainment) and race/ethnicity. Setting: United States in 2020. Participants: COVID-19 decedents aged 25 to 64 years old (n=69,001). Exposures: Social class (working class, some college, college graduate), race/ethnicity (Hispanic, Black, Asian, Indigenous, multiracial, and non-Hispanic white), and gender (women, men). Detailed census data on occupations held by adults in 2020 in each of the 36 sociodemographic groups studied were used to quantify the possibility of remote work for each group. Main Outcomes and Measures: Age-adjusted COVID-19 death rates for 36 sociodemographic groups defined by social class, race/ethnicity, and gender. Disparities were quantified by relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. College graduates were the (low risk) referent group for all relative risk calculations. Results: A higher proportion of Hispanics, Blacks, and Indigenous people were working class in 2020. COVID-19 mortality was five times higher in the working class vs. college graduates (72.2 vs. 14.6 deaths per 100,000, RR=4.94, 95% CI 4.82-5.05). The joint detriments of lower socioeconomic position, Hispanic ethnicity, and male gender resulted in a COVID-19 death rate which was over 27 times higher (178.0 vs. 6.5 deaths/100,000, RR=27.4, 95%CI 25.9-28.9) for working class Hispanic men vs. college graduate white women. In regression modeling, percent employed in never remote jobs explained 72% of the variance in COVID-19 death rates.

The convergence of pandemic resource limitation and clinical demand associated with delirium requires careful risk stratification for targeted prevention efforts. Objectives: To develop an incident delirium predictive model among coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Methods: We applied supervised machine learning to electronic health record data for inpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 at three hospitals to build an incident delirium diagnosis prediction model. We validated this model in three different hospitals. Both hospital cohorts included academic and community settings. Results: Among 2907 patients across 6 hospitals, 488 (16.8%) developed delirium. Applying the predictive model in the external validation cohort of 755 patients, the c-index was 0.75 (0.71-0.79) and the lift in the top quintile was 2.1. At a sensitivity of 80%, the specificity was 56%, negative predictive value 92%, and positive predictive value 30%. Equivalent model performance was observed in subsamples stratified by age, sex, race, need for critical care and care at community vs. academic hospitals. Conclusion: Machine learning applied to electronic health records available at the time of inpatient admission can be used to risk-stratify patients with coronavirus disease 2019 for incident delirium.

The susceptibility to infection of populations in that region has been debated. Outbreaks on the scale of those seen elsewhere would pose substantial challenges. There are reasons for concern that transmission may be high and difficult to control, rapidly exceeding capacity to meet the needs for hospitalization and critical care. MethodsWe obtained data on daily new confirmed cases for all 46 countries from the World Health Organization, and used these to model and visualize growth trajectories using an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. We then estimated doubling times from growth rates estimated from Poisson regression models, and by back counting from the most recent observation. We also calculated the time from 1st to 50th case, and the time from 5th to 100th case. These indicators were compared with the same summary indicators of growth at the same stage of the outbreak in highly affected European countries. ResultsKenya was the only country with clear evidence of exponential growth. Nineteen countries had either reported no cases, were in the first few days of the outbreak, or had reported fewer than 10 cases over a period of two or more weeks. For the remaining 27 countries we identified four growth patterns: slow linear growth, more rapid linear growth, variable growth patterns over the course of the outbreak, and early signs of possible exponential growth. For those in the last three groups, doubling times ranged from 3 to 4 days, times from 1st to 50th case from 12 to 29 days, and from 5th to 100th case from eight to 15 days. These early indicators are comparable to those in European countries that have gone on to have substantial outbreaks, and time to 50th case was shorter suggesting lesser effectiveness of contact-tracing and quarantine in the early phase. ConclusionThe 46 sub-Saharan African countries, home to over one billion people, are at a tipping point with clear potential for the outbreak to follow a similar course as in HIC in the global north. Radical population-level physical distancing measures may be required, but their impact on poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable people and communities need mitigating.

We compared outcomes between treated and untreated patients using propensity-score caliper matching. Results Of 2,307 patients in the dataset, 679 were excluded. Of the remaining 1,645 patients, 263 (16%) died and 311 (18.9%) died or were intubated. Except for hydroxychloroquine and prednisone, patients that were treated with any of the medications were more likely to go through an outcome of death or intubation at baseline. After propensity matching we found an association between treatment with hydroxychloroquine and prednisone and better outcomes (hazard ratios with 95% CI of 0.83 +- 0.06 and 0.85 +- 0.03).

Randomized, controlled trials of these medications in patients with COVID-19 are needed to avoid heavy administration of treatments with no strong evidence to support them.","output":"Observational Study of the Efficiency of Treatments in Patients Hospitalized with Covid-19 in Madrid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) has proven highly efficacious in reducing malaria incidence. However, the continued success of SMC is threatened by the spread of resistance against one of its main preventive ingredients, Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine(SP), operational challenges in delivery, and incomplete adherence to the regimens. Via a simulation study with an individual-based model of malaria dynamics, we provide quantitative evidence to assess long-acting injectables (LAIs) as potential alternatives to SMC. We explored the predicted impact of a range of novel preventive LAIs as a seasonal prevention tool in children aged three months to five years old during late-stage clinical trials and at implementation. LAIs were co-administered with a blood-stage clearing drug once at the beginning of the transmission season. We found the establishment of non-inferiority of LAIs to standard 3 or 4 rounds of SMC with SP-amodiaquine was challenging in clinical trial stages due to high intervention deployment coverage. However, our analysis of implementation settings where the achievable SMC coverage was much lower, LAIs with fewer visits per season are potential suitable replacements to SMC. Suitability as a replacement with higher impact is possible if the duration of protection of LAIs covered the duration of the transmission season. Furthermore, optimizing LAIs coverage and protective efficacy half-life via simulation analysis in settings with an SMC coverage of 60% revealed important trade-offs between protective efficacy decay and deployment coverage. Our analysis additionally highlights that for seasonal deployment for LAIs, it will be necessary to investigate the protective efficacy decay as early as possible during clinical development to ensure a well-informed candidate selection process.","output":"Model-informed target product profiles of long acting-injectables for use as seasonal malaria prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chinas rising ambitions as a global power and US retrenchment as a hegemon has redefined international politics over the past few years.

Objective: To explore how to analyze and interpret the positive results of COVID-19 antibody test in clinical practice. Methods: A total of 8 678 patients simultaneously submitted for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibody and nucleic acid in Peking University International Hospital from March to June 2020 for retrospective analysis were included in the inretrospective analysis. The epidemiological history, clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators(including SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibody and nucleic acid, rheumatoid factor, complement, immunoglobulin). The colloidal gold method was used to detect the SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibody, and the positive check of the antibody was performed by the magnetic particle chemiluminescence method. RT-PCR method was adopted to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. The heterophilic antibody blocking tube(HBT)was used to process the specimens that were positive by the colloidal gold method, and then the test was performed again. Results: (1)Among the 8 678 patient specimens submitted for examination, 8 677 were negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection, of which 25 cases(0.288%)were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody detected by colloidal gold method, SARS-CoV-2 -5 patients(0.058%)with IgG antibody positive, and 0 patients with SARS-CoV-2 IgM and SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at the same time.(2)Thirty patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibody by colloidal gold method had no epidemiological history, and at the same time, the results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test were negative. The possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was ruled out. Among them, 10 patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody were still positive after more than 2 times of dynamic monitoring, and the remaining 20 patients were not clinically active monitored.(3)The false positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody detected by colloidal gold method was 0.288%, and the false positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody was 0.058%. After HBT was used to process the SARS-CoV-2 colloidal gold-positive specimens, among the 25 SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody-positive specimens, except for 1 case which was still positive, the other results became negative;the results of 5 specimens with positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody were still positive.(4)The rheumatoid factor, complement and immunoglobulin levels of 30 SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive patients were within the normal reference range. Conclusion: The SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results may have false positives. The majority of SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody positives are caused by heterophilic antibody interference. Those with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody positive may also have other potentially unknown interference factors. Heterophile antibodies interfere with colloidal gold methods more than chemiluminescence methods. Therefore, non-suspected patients or confirmed patients should not be tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibody to guide clinical practice, and the interference factors of the experiment must be considered.

An ongoing challenge in healthcare is ensuring that up-to-date and high-quality research evidence is implemented in practice. In the context of a global pandemic it is assumed, given the increased pressures on healthcare professionals that this problem has the potential to be exacerbated. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in many health professionals being reassigned to areas outside their usual scope, returning to practice following absence or commencing their career as new entrants in the midst of a major crisis. These professionals are likely to require additional support to assist their confidence and competence.

Historically, HSCT was only offered to patients with SCD who had suffered severe complications;however, given improved HSCT outcomes, it is now reasonable to consider HSCT for most patients with SCD who have an HLA-identical sibling. Thus, HLA typing of all full siblings of patients with SCD should be a clinical priority to ensure patients are aware of and have access to this therapeutic option. The primary objectives of this study are to describe the baseline prevalence of HLA typing among a cohort of hospitalized pediatric patients with SCD and to evaluate whether having had HLA typing is associated with certain characteristics. Secondarily, the study describes the acceptability of HLA typing among patients with a healthy (non-SCD) full sibling who had not already had HLA typing at baseline after dedicated outreach to these families. Methods: Between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 a REDCap database of all hospitalized patients with SCD was prospectively maintained. Patient demographic and clinical information was ed via retrospective chart review. To evaluate socioeconomic status, a neighborhood area deprivation index (ADI) was determined for each patient using their home address and the Neighborhood Atlas website (https://www.neighborhoodatlas.medicine.wisc.edu/). ADI is a validated ranking (0-100) of Census Block Groups, considering income, education, employment, and housing quality. A higher ADI represents greater socioeconomic disadvantage. As part of a clinical outreach initiative, patients' families who had not already had typing at the time of their hospitalization were contacted to determine if the patient has a healthy full sibling and, if applicable, offer sibling HLA typing. This outreach was originally planned to occur in person at the time of hospitalization or clinic follow-up, but due the COVID-19 pandemic it was paused and when resumed conducted mostly via telephone. Results: During the 52-week study period, 291 patients with SCD were hospitalized at the study pediatric institution. Seventy-one patients (24%) had already completed HLA typing at the time of their first hospitalization during the study period. These patients with HLA typing at baseline were significantly more likely to have a diagnosis of sickle cell anemia (HbSS/HbS 0 genotype) and be on disease-modifying therapy (hydroxyurea or chronic transfusion) compared to patients without typing at baseline (Table). Age and sex were not significantly different between patients with and without typing (Table). The group of patients who did not have HLA typing at baseline had a significantly greater ADI (mean 29.7 vs. 24.0, p=.008) and proportion of patients with a high disadvantage ADI score 40 (23% vs. 10%, p=.02), Figure. Of the 220 patients with no history of HLA typing, the sibling status of 187 patients was determined via outreach to these families as of July 2021. Among these 187 patients, 81 (43%) reported having a healthy full sibling. Among these 81 patients with siblings, after being offered family HLA typing, 42 (52%) were interested and referred for HLA typing, 29 (36%) were undecided, and 10 (12%) declined typing. Conclusion: Hospitalized pediatric patients with SCD who had already been HLA typed were more likely to have a severe SCD genotype and be on disease-modifying therapy as expected. Patients who had not had HLA typing were more likely to live in a socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhood. This finding suggests that dedicated outreach to all families regarding HLA typing is needed. Our clinical initiative to offer typing to all hospitalized patients with healthy full siblings was feasible, with a majority of families interested in pursuing HLA typing. Continued work is needed to ensure patients with SCD have equal access to curative therapy regardless of socioeconomic status.

While preeclampsia used to be regarded as a self-limiting maternal condition which resolved with the delivery of the placenta, it is nowadays considered a complex and multifactorial disease that affects the offspring. Unfortunately, the etiology and pathophysiology of this multifaceted disorder remain elusive. Recent findings have confirmed that an altered maternal autonomic function may play a vital role in developing preeclampsia in conjunction with an imbalanced maternal immune system. Additionally, further evidence supports the crucial role of an exacerbated immune response driven by a non-infectious trigger during preeclampsia. Therefore, as a sterile inflammation, the elucidation of the neuroinflammatory mechanisms of preeclampsia warrants obtaining relevant knowledge suitable for translational clinical applications. Heart rate variability (HRV) is an affordable and non-invasive method for indirectly assessing the autonomic nervous system and the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP). Notably, the nonlinear analysis of HRV offers novel indexes to explore the neuroimmune interactions in diverse preclinical and clinical settings of inflammation. Given that the dynamics of HRV is nonlinear in health, we hypothesized that a neuroinflammatory condition in preeclampsia might be associated with changes in nonlinear features of maternal and fetal HRV. Thus, the present review aims to present evidence of the potential changes in maternal-fetal HRV associated with neuroinflammatory modifications in preeclamptic women. We considered that there is still a need for assessing the nonlinear features of maternal and fetal HRV as complementary biomarkers of inflammation in this population in future studies, being a potential route for translational clinical applications.","output":"Nonlinear analysis of heart rhythm in preeclampsia: a route for translational clinical applications in neuroinflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The advent of COVID-19 has been the occasion for a renewed interest in the principles governing triage when the number of critically ill patients exceeds the healthcare infrastructure's capacity in a given location.

The paper examines the arguments for and against this approach from the point of view of natural law theory, especially using the principle of double effect. We conclude that it is inadmissible to withdraw life-saving medical interventions from patients who are still benefiting from them, on the sole grounds that other patients might benefit more.

The high morbidity and mortality at these facilities has been attributed to a combination of a particularly vulnerable population and a lack of resources to mitigate the risk. During the first wave of the pandemic, the federal and state governments received urgent calls for help from LTC and residential care facilities; between March and early June of 2020, policymakers responded with dozens of regulatory and policy changes. In this article, we provide an overview of these responses by first summarizing federal regulatory changes and then reviewing state-level executive orders. The policy and regulatory changes implemented at the federal and state levels can be categorized into the following 4 classes: (1) preventing virus transmission, which includes policies relating to visitation restrictions, personal protective equipment guidance, and testing requirements; (2) expanding facilities' capacities, which includes both the expansion of physical space for isolation purposes and the expansion of workforce to combat COVID-19; (3) relaxing administrative requirements, which includes measures enacted to shift the attention of caretakers and administrators from administrative requirements to residents' care; and (4) reporting COVID-19 data, which includes the reporting of cases and deaths to residents, families, and administrative bodies (such as state health departments). These policies represent a snapshot of the initial efforts to mitigate damage inflicted by the pandemic. Looking ahead, empirical evaluation of the consequences of these policies-including potential unintended effects-is urgently needed. The recent availability of publicly reported COVID-19 LTC data can be used to inform the development of evidence-based regulations, though there are concerns of reporting inaccuracies.

Therefore, the gallic acid (GA) with strong redox activity was chosen to investigate the influence of arsenite [As(III)] oxidation on As immobilization by ferrihydrite. Our results found that the As amount adsorbed on ferrihydrite decreased with the pH rising from 5 to 9 in the presence of GA, and the adsorption amount (28.8a?ga?kg-1) at pH 9 was 45.1% lower than that in the absence of GA. Meanwhile, the As adsorption amounts in treatments of GA addition before As (Fh-GA-As(III)) were significantly lower than that in their corresponding simultaneous addition (Fh-As(III)/GA). The proportions of As(V)/Astotal on ferrihydrite and in equilibrium suspension were increased as the pH increased in the presence of GA, and the highest oxidation efficiency of As(III) by GA at pH 9 was 90.3%, which was mainly due to the contribution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 52.6%) and semiquinone radicals (SQ-, 27.1%). In general, the oxidation and competition adsorption of As by GA inhibited the As immobilization by ferrihydrite, and the oxidation of As(III) by GA was strongly dependent on pH, while H2O2 and SQ- were demonstrated as the main oxidant at pH 9.","output":"The inhibiting effects of organic acids on arsenic immobilization by ferrihydrite: Gallic acid as an example"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current study we investigated the suitability of a novel hyaluronic acid-laminin hydrogel (HAL) as luminal filler and carrier system for co-transplanted cells within a composite chitosan-based nerve graft (CNG) in a rat critical nerve defect model. The HAL was meant to improve the performance of our artificial nerve guides by giving additional structural and molecular support to regrowing axons. We filled hollow CNGs or two-chambered nerve guides with an inserted longitudinal chitosan film (CNG[F]s), with cell-free HAL or cell-free HA or additionally suspended either na?ve Schwann cells (SCs) or fibroblast growth factor 2-overexpressing Schwann cells (FGF2-SCs) within the gels. We subjected female Lewis rats to immediate 15 mm sciatic nerve gap reconstruction and comprehensively compared axonal and functional regeneration parameters with the gold standard autologous nerve graft (ANG) repair. Motor recovery was surveyed by means of electrodiagnostic measurements at 60, 90, and 120 days post-reconstruction. Upon explantation after 120 days, lower limb target muscles were harvested for calculation of muscle-weight ratios. Semi-thin cross-sections of nerve segments distal to the grafts were evaluated histomorphometrically. After 120 days of recovery, only ANG treatment led to full motor recovery. Surprisingly, regeneration outcomes revealed no regeneration-supportive effect of HAL alone and even an impairment of peripheral nerve regeneration when combined with SCs and FGF2-SCs. Furthermore, complementary in vitro studies, conducted to elucidate the reason for this unexpected negative result, revealed that SCs and FGF2-SCs suspended within the hydrogel relatively downregulated gene expression of regeneration-supporting neurotrophic factors. In conclusion, cell-free HAL in its current formulation did not qualify for optimizing regeneration outcome through CNG[F]s. In addition, we demonstrate that our HAL, when used as a carrier system for co-transplanted SCs, changed their gene expression profile and deteriorated the pro-regenerative milieu within the nerve guides.","output":"In Vivo and In Vitro Evaluation of a Novel Hyaluronic Acid-Laminin Hydrogel as Luminal Filler and Carrier System for Genetically Engineered Schwann Cells in Critical Gap Length Tubular Peripheral Nerve Graft in Rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND After being introduced in 1992, laparoscopic adrenalectomy has been accepted as the gold standard today for benign diseases. The need is now being realized for newer innovations to further reduce the trauma of surgical access. We report our experience and outcome of the first case series of single-port access adrenalectomy by using SILS? port. METHODS Between June 2009 and November 2010, 6 patients with adrenal tumors underwent single-port access adrenalectomy via SILS port. The device was placed through a single 3 cm incision. The patients' demographics, adrenal mass characteristics, operative time, conversion rate, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and postoperative pain score were measured. Five patients underwent adrenalectomy by using the retroperitoneal approach and 1 by using the laparoscopic transperitoneal approach. RESULTS Three men and 3 women with mean age 51 years (range, 37-67) underwent single-incision adrenalectomy. The mean tumor size was 3.3 cm (range, 1.5-6). Three of these cases were Conn's syndrome, and the remaining 3 were incidentaloma. No significant complications or conversions to the conventional procedure were recorded. The mean operative time was 121 minutes (range, 70-165). The mean hospital stay was 2.7 days (range, 2-4). No local recurrences or hormonal relapse have been recorded to the present with a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 3-20).

Given the significant demand for nasopharyngeal swabs, a large number of previously untrained and unfamiliar staff are now performing this test. It was noted that there was significant heterogeneity in instructions for performing nasopharyngeal swabs in Canada, in contrast to the guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The objective of this study was to review the instructions provided across Canada and contrast them to those of the CDC and PAHO. METHODS: A standard series of steps for nasopharyngeal swab performance was outlined based on the CDC, PAHO, and New England Journal of Medicine instructions. A comprehensive search was performed in August 2020 to identify nasopharyngeal swab guidelines provided by public health in the provinces and territories of Canada. Regional health authority guidance was also collected. Instructions provided were contrasted against the standardized steps. RESULTS: Instructions were identified for all provinces and territories, and for 81 regional health authorities. From the provincial and territorial guidelines, 10/13 (77%) cleared the nasal passages before swab insertion, 11/13 (85%) tilted the patient's head back slightly, 12/13 (92%) inserted the swab parallel to the palate, but only 3/13 (23%) inserted the swab to at least a depth of two-thirds the distance between the patient's nose and ear. A clear majority (81%) of regional health authority guidelines followed their respective provincial guidelines. For depth of insertion, Quebec provided a pictogram but no distance or technique for estimation. Six provinces and territories - Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Alberta - recommended 4 cm or one-half the distance from nostrils to ear. British Columbia and Manitoba recommended a 7 cm depth of insertion. Nova Scotia recommended one-half to two-thirds the distance from nose to ear. Lastly, Newfoundland, New Brunswick and the Yukon recommended an insertion from nose to the external ear canal.

METHODS Among 856 patients who underwent CAS between January 2007 and July 2015, 214 (25%) patients (mean age 728 years; 154 men) had the procedure via a TR (n=154) or TB (n=60) approach with either Mo.MA proximal protection (n=61) or distal filter protection (n=153). The Mo.MA group (mean age 737 years; 54 men) had significantly more men and more severe stenosis than the filter group (mean age 718 years; 100 men). Stent type and CAS technique were left to operator discretion. Heparin and a dedicated closure device or bivalirudin and manual compression were used in TR and TB accesses, respectively. Technical and procedure success, crossover to femoral artery, 30-day major adverse cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events (MACCE; death, all strokes, and myocardial infarction), vascular complications, and radiation exposure were compared between groups. RESULTS Crossover to a femoral approach was required in 1/61 (1.6%) Mo.MA patient vs 11/153 (7.1%) filter patients mainly due to technical difficulty in engaging the target vessel. Five Mo.MA patients developed acute intolerance to proximal occlusion; 4 were successfully shifted to filter protection. A TR patient was shifted to filter because the Mo.MA system was too short. CAS was technically successful in the remaining 55 (90%) Mo.MA patients and 142 (93%) filter patients. The MACCE rate was 0% in the Mo.MA patients and 2.8% in the filter group (p=0.18). Radiation exposure was similar between groups. Major vascular complications occurred in 1/61 (1.6%) and in 3/153 (1.96%) patients in the Mo.MA and filter groups (p=0.18), respectively, and were confined to the TB approach in the early part of the learning curve. Chronic radial artery occlusion was detected by Doppler ultrasound in 2/30 (6.6%) Mo.MA patients and in 4/124 (3.2%) filter patients by clinical assessment (p=0.25) at 8.17.5-month follow-up. CONCLUSION CAS with proximal protection via a TR or TB approach is a feasible, safe, and effective technique with a low rate of vascular complications.","output":"Carotid Artery Stenting With Proximal Embolic Protection via a Transradial or Transbrachial Approach: Pushing the Boundaries of the Technique While Maintaining Safety and Efficacy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Janus kinases (JAKs) are a family of non-receptor kinases that play a key role in cytokine signaling and their aberrant activities are associated with the pathogenesis of various immune diseases.

The host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and related severe systemic inflammation seems to be the main mechanism contributing to the development of post-COVID depression. Emerging literature suggests anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties of antidepressants in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection [2]. We hypothesized that post-COVID depression, triggered by infection and sustained by systemic inflammation, could particularly benefit from antidepressants. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the efficacy of SSRI in treating post-COVID depression. Methods: We included 58 adults patients who showed depressive episodes in the six months following COVID-19. We excluded patients if they showed: other psychiatric comorbidities, ongoing treatment with antidepressants or neuroleptics, somatic disease and medications known to affect mood. The severity of depression was rated at baseline and after for four weeks from the start of the treatment on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and response was considered when the patients achieved a 50% HDRS reduction after treatment. Statistical analyses to compare group means and frequencies (Student's t-test, Pearson 2 test) were performed. To investigate changes in HDRS scores over time, repeated measures ANOVAs (according to sex, mood disorder history, and antidepressant molecule) were performed. Results: We found that 53 (91%) patients showed a clinical response to antidepressant treatment. Age, sex, mood disorder history, and hospitalization for COVID did not affect the response rate. Patients were treated with sertraline (n=26), citalopram (n=18), paroxetine (n=8), fluvoxamine (n=4), and fluoxetine (n=2). From baseline to follow-up, patients showed a significant decrease over time of HDRS score (F=618.90, p<0.001), irrespectively of sex (0.28, p=0.599), mood disorder history (F=0.04, p=0.834), and drug used (F=1.47, p=0.239). Discussion: Common knowledge highlights that among antidepressant-treated patients, response rates are moderate (40C60%). On the contrary, we observed a rapid response to the first-line antidepressants in more than 90% of patients irrespectively of clinical variables, thus suggesting a higher antidepressant response rate in post-COVID depression. The pathophysiology of post-COVID neuropsychiatric sequelae mainly entails severe systemic inflammation and subsequent neuroinflammation. In this context, we have previously found that one and three months after COVID-19, the severity of depression was predicted by the baseline systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) [3,4]. Furthermore, we found a protective effect of the IL-1 and IL-6 receptor antagonist against post-COVID depression possibly associated with their effect in dampening SII [5]. Mounting evidence suggests that antidepressants may a) decrease markers of inflammation;b) may inhibit acid sphingomyelinase preventing the infection of epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2;c) may prevent the COVID-19 related cytokine storm by stimulating the -1 receptor;d) may exert antiviral effects via lysosomotropic properties;e) may inhibit platelets activation [2]. In conclusion, we hypothesized that post-COVID depression could particularly benefit from antidepressants since this molecules have anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, pass the BBB and accumulate in the CNS, thus preventing the neuro-inflammation triggered by SARS-CoV-2 and associated with post-COVID depression.

Design/methodology/approach: Covariance-based structural equation modeling is used to test the hypothesized relationships by using a survey of 416 employees. Findings: The results of the study indicate that an entrepreneurial attitude significantly and positively contributes to work engagement, although it can divert employee attention regarding the level of commitment. Interestingly, the study findings show that employees will commit to an organization if they have engaged with the company, even if they have a highly entrepreneurial attitude. Practical implications: This studys findings are beneficial in understanding the concept of an entrepreneurial attitude and its impact on an organization. For firms to concurrently promote entrepreneurial characteristics and employee commitment, policy and staff practices must ensure the appropriate level of work engagement.

Search terms used to identify these reports were: \\"multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\\", \\"MIS-C\\", \\"MISC\\", \\"multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults\\", \\"MIS-A\\", \\"MISA\\", \\"paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome\\", and \\"PIMS-TS\\" each with any COVID-19 vaccine type. There were no exclusion criteria (i.e., all ages and languages). Added value of this studyWe conducted integrated surveillance for MIS-C after COVID-19 vaccination using two passive surveillance systems, CDCs MIS-C national surveillance and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), and clinician or health department outreach to CDC, including through Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Project consultations. We investigated reports of potential MIS-C occurring from December 14, 2020, to August 31, 2021, in persons aged 12-20 years any time after receipt of COVID-19 vaccine to identify those that met the CDC MIS-C case definition. Any positive serology test was accepted as meeting the CDC MIS-C case definition, although anti- nucleocapsid antibody is indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while anti-spike protein antibody may be induced either by SARS-CoV-2 infection or by COVID-19 vaccination. We investigated 47 reports and identified 21 persons with MIS-C after receipt of COVID-19 vaccine. Of the 21 persons with MIS-C, median age was 16 years (range 12-20 years), and 13 (62%) were male. Fifteen (71%) had laboratory evidence of past or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test [NAAT], viral antigen, or serology test before or during MIS-C illness evaluation), and 5 (33%) of those 15 had illness onset after their second vaccine dose. Six (29%) of 21 persons had no laboratory evidence of past or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection, and five of those six (83%) had onset of MIS-C after the second vaccine dose. Implications of all the available evidenceDuring the first nine months of the COVID-19 vaccination program in the United States, >21 million persons aged 12 to 20 years received []1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine as of August 31, 2021. This case series describes MIS-C in 21 persons following vaccine receipt during this time period; the majority of persons reported also had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The surveillance has limitations, but our findings suggest that MIS-C as identified in this report following COVID-19 vaccination is rare. In evaluating persons with a clinical presentation consistent with MIS-C after COVID-19 vaccination it is important to consider alternative diagnoses, and anti-nucleocapsid antibody testing may be helpful. Continued surveillance for MIS-C illness after COVID-19 vaccination is warranted, especially as pediatric COVID-19 vaccination expands. Providers are encouraged to report potential MIS-C cases after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS.","output":"Reported Cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Aged 12 to 20 Years in the United States Who Received COVID-19 Vaccine, December 2020 through August 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Self-report, i.e., explicit, measures of affect cannot fully explain the cardiovascular (CV) responses to stressors. Measuring affect beyond self-report, i.e., using implicit measures, could add to our understanding of stress-related CV activity. The Implicit Positive and Negative Affect Test (IPANAT) was administered in two studies to test its ecological validity and relation with CV responses and self-report measures of affect. In Study 1 students (N = 34) viewed four film clips inducing anger, happiness, fear, or no emotion, and completed the IPANAT and the Positive And Negative Affect Scale at baseline and after each clip. Implicit negative affect (INA) was higher and implicit positive affect (IPA) was lower after the anger inducing clip and vice versa after the happiness inducing clip. In Study 2 students performed a stressful math task with (n = 14) or without anger harassment (n = 15) and completed the IPANAT and a Visual Analog Scale as an explicit measure afterwards. Systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were recorded throughout. SBP and DBP were higher and TPR was lower in the harassment condition during the task with a prolonged effect on SBP and DBP during recovery. As expected, explicit negative affect (ENA) was higher and explicit positive affect (EPA) lower after harassment, but ENA and EPA were not related to CV activity. Although neither INA nor IPA differed between the tasks, during both tasks higher INA was related to higher SBP, lower HRV and lower TPR and to slower recovery of DBP after both tasks. Low IPA was related to slower recovery of SBP and DBP after the tasks. Implicit affect was not related to recovery of HR, HRV, and TPR. In conclusion, the IPANAT seems to respond to film clip-induced negative and positive affect and was related to CV activity during and after stressful tasks. These findings support the theory that implicitly measured affect can add to the explanation of prolonged stress-related CV responses that influence CV health.","output":"The Implicit Positive and Negative Affect Test: Validity and Relationship with Cardiovascular Stress-Responses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic created an imperative to re-examine the role of telehealth in oncology. Herein we report trends and demographic disparities in utilization of telehealth and secure messaging (SM;i.e., email via portal/app), before and during the pandemic, at a large integrated healthcare system. Methods: This population-based retrospective cohort study examines utilization of various patient-provider visit types (office, video, telephone) and SM from 1/1/2019- 9/30/2020 at 22 Kaiser Permanente Northern California Hematology and Oncology practices. We explored changes associated with the pandemic (i.e., since 03/2020, when stay home orders were introduced) as well as demographic differences, using Chi-square for categorical and the Mann-Whitney U Test for nonparametric comparisons. Results: During the study period, there were 334,666 visits and 1,161,239 SM sent between patients and providers. Since the pandemic, total monthly average of visits declined only slightly by 4.1%, but monthly average office visits decreased by 80% from 11,001 to 2,170, monthly average video visits increased from 40 to 4,666, and monthly average telephone visits increased by 69% from 5,114 to 8,663. The monthly average SM increased by 26% from 50,788 to 64,315. The trend of increasing telehealth utilization was sustained and stabilized between 07-09/2020. New consultations initially decreased from a mean of 1,995 per month (12.4% of all visits) in 2019, to a minimum of 1,179 (8.6%) by 05/2020, returning to 1,619 (11.7%) by 09/2020. Pandemic era video visits were a significantly higher fraction of all visits (p &lt; 0.01) in: (1) younger patients (Gen Z 48%, Gen Y/Millennials 46%;Gen X 40%;Baby Boomers 34.4%;Pre-Boomers 24.5%);(2) patients with commercial insurance (39%) compared to those with Medicaid (32.7%) or Medicare (28.1%);(3) Primary English speakers (33.7%) compared to those who require an interpreter (24.5%);(4) Asians (35%) and non-Hispanic Whites (33.7%) compared to Blacks (30.1%) and Hispanic Whites (27.5%);(5) married/ domestic partner patients (35%) compared to single/divorced/widowed patients (29.9%);(6) patients with a Charlson comorbidity index 3 (36.2%) compared to &gt; 3 (31.3%);and (7) males (34.6%) compared to females (32.3%). Similar statistically significant SM utilization patterns were also seen. Conclusions: In the pandemic era, utilization of telehealth and SM rapidly increased in all demographic categories, shifting the landscape and resource allocation of hematology/oncology practices in a manner that is feasible and sustained. New consultations decreased early in pandemic with return to pre-pandemic levels by 09/2020. Utilization of video visits and SM significantly differ between various demographic populations with disparities seen by age, insurance plan, English proficiency, race/ethnicity, marital status, comorbidities, and gender.","output":"The future of tele-oncology: Trends and disparities in telehealth and secure message utilization in the COVID-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdowns and stay-at-home orders have partially mitigated the spread of Covid-19. However, en masse mitigation has come with substantial socioeconomic costs. In this paper we demonstrate how individualized policies based on disease status can reduce transmission risk while minimizing impacts on economic outcomes. We design feedback control policies informed by optimal control solutions to modulate interaction rates of individuals based on the epidemic state. We identify personalized interaction rates such that recovered/immune individuals elevate their interactions and susceptible individuals remain at home before returning to pre-lockdown levels. As we show, feedback control policies can yield similar population-wide infection rates to total shutdown but with significantly lower economic costs and with greater robustness to uncertainty compared to optimal control policies. Our analysis shows that test-driven improvements in isolation efficiency of infectious individuals can inform disease-dependent interaction policies that mitigate transmission while enhancing the return of individuals to pre-pandemic economic activity.","output":"Disease-dependent interaction policies to support health and economic outcomes during the COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long COVID-19 may be defined as patients who, four weeks after the diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection, continue to have signs and symptoms not explainable by other causes. The estimated frequency is around 10% and signs and symptoms may last for months. The main long-term manifestations observed in other coronaviruses (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) are very similar to and have clear clinical parallels with SARS-CoV-2: mainly respiratory, musculoskeletal, and neuropsychiatric. The growing number of patients worldwide will have an impact on health systems. Therefore, the main objective of these clinical practice guidelines is to identify patients with signs and symptoms of long COVID-19 in primary care through a protocolized diagnostic process that studies possible etiologies and establishes an accurate differential diagnosis. The guidelines have been developed pragmatically by compiling the few studies published so far on long COVID-19, editorials and expert opinions, press releases, and the authors clinical experience. Patients with long COVID-19 should be managed using structured primary care visits based on the time from diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the current limited evidence, disease management of long COVID-19 signs and symptoms will require a holistic, longitudinal follow up in primary care, multidisciplinary rehabilitation services, and the empowerment of affected patient groups.","output":"Long Covid-19: Proposed Primary Care Clinical Guidelines for Diagnosis and Disease Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies have shown a correlation between elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentrations and the risk of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients.

The sensitivity of the developed lubricant-infused biosensor for immunofluorescence assays in detecting low molecular weight proteins such as IL-6 is facilitated by i) producing a bioink in which the capture antibody is functionalized by an epoxy-based silane for covalent linkage to the fluorosilanized surface and ii) suppressing nonspecific adhesion by patterning the developed bioink into a lubricant-infused coating. The developed biosensor addresses one of the major challenges for biosensing in complex fluids, namely nonspecific adhesion, therefore paving the way for highly sensitive biosensing in complex fluids.","output":"Antibody Micropatterned Lubricant-Infused Biosensors Enable Sub-Picogram Immunofluorescence Detection of Interleukin 6 in Human Whole Plasma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The constituency work of British Members of Parliament (MPs) has long been referred to in political circles as a form of social work This article reports on a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with thirteen MPs The aim of the research was to find out what characterises their constituency work to understand why it apparently bears comparison with social work The article draws on the concepts of proximity and place from the mobilities paradigm to articulate the idea of politics as social work MPs in the study engaged in face-to-face emotional labour in which they formed and sustained empathic relationships with people and places to represent them They practised judgement under uncertainty and risk work, and they were embedded in local organisational networks of risk and trust with local authorities and other agencies The article argues that this analysis of politics as social work provides a deeper understanding of the politics of social work In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic and its severe socio-economic impact, the importance for social work of the concept of emplaced empathy and the need for our reorientation to place is thrown into particularly sharp focus","output":"Politics as Social Work: A Qualitative Study of Emplaced Empathy and Risk Work by British Members of Parliament"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by 2019CnCov/SARS-CoV-2 has become a pandemic with an urgent need for understanding the mechanisms and identifying a treatment. Viral infections including SARS-CoV are associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species, disturbances of Ca(++) caused by unfolded protein response (UPR) mediated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and is due to the exploitation of virus's own protein i.e., viroporins into the host cells. Several clinical trials are on-going including testing Remdesivir (anti-viral), Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine derivatives (anti-malarial drugs) etc. Unfortunately, each drug has specific limitations. Herein, we review the viral protein involvement to activate ER stress transducers (IRE-1, PERK, ATF-6) and their downstream signals; and evaluate combination therapies for COVID-19 mediated ER stress alterations. Melatonin is an immunoregulator, anti-pyretic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and ER stress modulator during viral infections. It enhances protective mechanisms for respiratory tract disorders. Andrographolide, isolated from Andrographis paniculata, has versatile biological activities including immunomodulation and determining SARS-CoV-2 binding site.

This study is a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the protein-coding sequences of seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) to decipher the nucleotide sequence variability and codon usage patterns. It is essential to understand the survival ability of the viruses, their adaptation to hosts, and their evolution. The current analysis revealed a high abundance of the relative dinucleotide (odds ratio), GC and CT pairs in the first and last two codon positions, respectively, as well as a low abundance of the CG pair in the last two positions of the codon, which might be related to the evolution of the viruses. A remarkable level of variability of GC content in the third position of the codon among the seven coronaviruses was observed. Codons with high RSCU values are primarily from the aliphatic and hydroxyl amino acid groups, and codons with low RSCU values belong to the aliphatic, cyclic, positively charged, and sulfur-containing amino acid groups. In order to elucidate the evolutionary processes of the seven coronaviruses, a phylogenetic tree (dendrogram) was constructed based on the RSCU scores of the codons. The severe and mild categories CoVs were positioned in different clades. A comparative phylogenetic study with other coronaviruses depicted that SARS-CoV-2 is close to the CoV isolated from pangolins (Manis javanica, Pangolin-CoV) and cats (Felis catus, SARS(r)-CoV). Further analysis of the effective number of codon (ENC) usage bias showed a relatively higher bias for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV compared to SARS-CoV-2. The ENC plot against GC3 suggested that the mutational bias might have a role in determining the codon usage variation among candidate viruses. A codon adaptability study on a few human host parasites (from different kingdoms), including CoVs, showed a diverse adaptability pattern. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV exhibit relatively lower but similar codon adaptability compared to MERS-CoV.","output":"Comparative analysis of human coronaviruses focusing on nucleotide variability and synonymous codon usage patterns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This study sought to expand the very limited data on Scandinavian paediatric poly-trauma patients by charactering patients from this population admitted to a Danish level-1 trauma centre. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all patients 15 years or younger who were admitted to the trauma centre at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark from January 2000 to May 2014. Injury severity was calculated using the Injury Severity Score (ISS). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to determine significant differences between sexes. RESULTS: A total of 880 children (499 boys and 391 girls) were included. No significant sex-related differences were observed in the numbers admitted during the study period, age at admission or severity of injuries. Overall, 30% of the paediatric patients were admitted in the afternoon (3-6 p.m.). The crude death rate was 2.7% of all admissions. Traffic accidents accounted for 48% of all admissions and two-thirds of all deaths. All non-survivors received ISSs of 16 or higher, and 20% of deaths in this group and 42% of overall deaths occurred within the first 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that in Denmark, children admitted to a trauma centre are most likely to have been injured in traffic accidents and/or in the afternoon.

The Malaysian Ministry of Health had implemented a range of measures, such as the use of masks and social distancing, to reduce the risk of transmission. Traditionally, newborns are evaluated for neonatal jaundice using visual assessment, a capillary heel prick and serum bilirubin (SB) sampling in primary health-care clinics. This approach requires the physical presence of both parents and their newborns in the primary health-care clinics, causing crowding and increasing the risk of COVID-19 infections. To alleviate crowding, we implemented the transcutaneous bilirubin drive-through (DT) service, which is an established, non-invasive, painless and rapid method to determine the bilirubin levels. Throughout the screening, both parents and baby will be confined to their car. A total of 1842 babies were screened in our DT setting from April to July 2020. Of the total babies, 298 (16.1%) required venesection for SB measurement and 85 required admission for phototherapy. None with severe jaundice were missed since the implementation of this service. The average test duration per neonate was less than 5 min, while conventional venous bilirubin laboratory testing required an average of 1.5 h per neonate. The cost of the SB laboratory test and consumables was approximately USD 5 per test, with an estimated cost savings of USD 7720.

Secondly, what is the relative importance of pension funds for the risk management of climate-related financial risk via due diligence compared with risk assessment via disclosure? Fundamentally, the article explains climate-related financial risk as a cultural phenomenon and argues that a discussion on pension fund fiduciary duties must consider disclosure in addition to due diligence.

Views: According to current state of knowledge, numerous SARS-CoV-2 infection-specific and nonspecific risk factors exist for brain damage, which might lead to neuropsychological impairments in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19. The emerging evidence suggests significant behavioral and cognitive deficits in COVID-19 survivors, which are present in the early phase after recovery and persist for several months. Neuropsychological disturbances can potentially include a wide spectrum of disorders, yet deficits of attention, memory, executive functions, language and visuospatial orientation are among most commonly identified. The relationship between cognitive impairment, emotional disturbances and severity of COVID-19 symptoms needs to be submitted to further research. Conclusions: The scientific knowledge resulting from neuropsychological empirical studies during the COVID-19 pandemic allows for a postulate of an urgent evidence-based systematic neuropsychological research to be conducted among COVID-19 survivors. More than anything, the recovered individuals must be provided with adequate neuropsychological help in the form of neuropsychological diagnosis, monitoring and rehabilitation.","output":"Neuropsychological disorders after COVID-19.

Therefore, the identification of lipids and metabolic pathways that are suitable targets for antiviral development is crucial. Using a library of compounds targeting host lipid metabolic factors and testing them for their ability to block pseudorabies virus (PRV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection, we found that U18666A, a specific inhibitor of Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), is highly potent in suppressing the entry of diverse viruses including pseudotyped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). NPC1 deficiency markedly attenuates viral growth by decreasing cholesterol abundance in the plasma membrane, thereby inhibiting the dynamics of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), which are indispensable for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Significantly, exogenous cholesterol can complement the dynamics of CCPs, leading to efficient viral entry and infectivity. Administration of U18666A improves the survival and pathology of PRV- and influenza A virus-infected mice. Thus, our studies demonstrate a unique mechanism by which NPC1 inhibition achieves broad antiviral activity, indicating a potential new therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2, as well as other emerging viruses.","output":"NPC1-regulated dynamic of clathrin-coated pits is essential for viral entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the recent COVID-19 outbreak, several researchers have begun to focus on various difficulties to data mining of social data to study people's reactions to the outbreak.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Cohort study to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 in professionals working in the emergency facilities of five large tertiary hospitals located in Porto Alegre, Southern Brazil (population 1.4 million). Workers were evaluated on July 20-24 (2020), and again after three weeks. At each encounter, clinical data were obtained, and a blood sample was taken by finger pricking for antibody detection (Standard Q COVID-19 IgM/IgG Duo-Biosensor, South Korea). RESULTS Participants (n=1,163) were mostly female (66.6%), and median age was 38 years-old. Close contact with COVID-19 was reported by 82.3%. In the first phase of study, a total of 5.5% (n=64) were found to have antibodies against COVID-19 (26 IgM; 19 IgG; 19 both), including 34.6% (n=27) of workers previously diagnosed with COVID-19 (n=78). After three weeks, seropositivity was 5.6% (17 IgM; 17 IgG; 17 both). IgM and IgG became negative in the second study evaluation for 55.3% and 50.0% of participants who were previously positive for these antibodies, respectively.

METHODS Patients were randomly assigned to intubation with a TT with a cylindrical cuff (group C) or a tapered cuff (group T). Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, O(2) and N(2)O after intubation. TT cuffs were inflated to 20 cm H(2)O; changes in cuff pressure and volume were measured up to 30 min after the start of N(2)O use. Distance between the TT tip and the carina was measured before and after pneumoperitoneum and position change. Frequency of sore throat, dysphagia and hoarseness in the two groups was recorded.

Therefore, we implemented an immunoinformatic approach to design an efficient multi-epitopes vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The designed-vaccine construct consists of several immunodominant epitopes from structural proteins of spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope. These peptides promote cellular and humoral immunity and interferon-gamma responses. Also, these epitopes have a high antigenic capacity and are not likely to cause allergies. To enhance the vaccine immunogenicity, we used three potent adjuvants: Flagellin of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Dublin, a driven peptide from high mobility group box 1 as HP-91, and human beta-defensin 3 protein. The physicochemical and immunological properties of the vaccine structure were evaluated. The tertiary structure of the vaccine protein was predicted and refined by Phyre2 and Galaxi refine and validated using RAMPAGE and ERRAT. Results of ElliPro showed 246 sresidues from vaccine might be conformational B-cell epitopes. Docking of the vaccine with toll-like receptors (TLR) 3, 5, 8, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 approved an appropriate interaction between the vaccine and receptors.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The latest available literature was reviewed until October 30, 2020 from the PubMed database. RESULTS: The literature reports that vitamin D has immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. It reduces the expression of cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-&#945; and INF-?3, regulates the activity of T helper lymphocytes, and other elements of the immune system at the molecular level. The deficiency of this vitamin promotes the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, contributing to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. The severity of the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on comorbidities, the development and course of which may also be affected by vitamin D levels (coagulopathies, pulmonary, cardiological, metabolic diseases). Most of the analyzed research studies from different countries indicated a relationship between insufficient vitamin D levels and a more severe course of COVID-19 and an increase in mortality due to it, especially among the elderly. Researchers agree that further analyzes are necessary concerning both the influence of the vitamin D blood serum levels on the morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 as well as the use of its supplementation in the struggle against SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are reports of possible beneficial interactions of vitamin D with other substances, such as quercetin, estradiol, some microelements, and other vitamins. CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining an adequate level of vitamin D has a positive effect on the functioning of the immune system. At the moment, there is insufficient evidence to establish a clear relationship between vitamin D levels and the severity of COVID-19. It is necessary to conduct further research on a larger study group. The literature does not mention the use of vitamin D as a medication for COVID-19.

Our method is a simple modification to momentum SGD where we leverage an attentional mechanism to assign an individual importance weight to each gradient in the mini-batch. Unlike many existing heuristic-driven methods for tackling data imbalance, our method is grounded in {\\\\it theoretically justified distributionally robust optimization (DRO)}, which is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of an information-regularized DRO problem. The individual-level weight of a sampled data is systematically proportional to the exponential of a scaled loss value of the data, where the scaling factor is interpreted as the regularization parameter in the framework of information-regularized DRO. Compared with existing class-level weighting schemes, our method can capture the diversity between individual examples within each class. Compared with existing individual-level weighting methods using meta-learning that require three backward propagations for computing mini-batch stochastic gradients, our method is more efficient with only one backward propagation at each iteration as in standard deep learning methods. To balance between the learning of feature extraction layers and the learning of the classifier layer, we employ a two-stage method that uses SGD for pretraining followed by ABSGD for learning a robust classifier and finetuning lower layers.

A case-control study was carried out in the 2016 spring calving season. A total of 194 bobby calves, comprising 38 cases (calves that died or were condemned for health or welfare reasons before the point of slaughter) and 156 controls (calves deemed acceptable and presented for slaughter) were included in the study. Case and control calves were selected by veterinarians located at 29 processing premises across New Zealand. Information regarding management of selected calves on-farm, during transport and at the processor was obtained retrospectively via questionnaires administered to supplying farmers, transport operators and processing premises personnel. Associations between management variables and calf mortality (death or condemnation) were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. Factors associated with an increased risk of calf mortality included time in the farm of origins calving season, duration of travel from farm to the processor and processing slaughter schedule (same day or next day). Every additional week into the farms calving season increased the odds of mortality by a factor of 1.2 (95%CI 1.06, 1.35). Similarly, each additional hour of travel time increased the odds of mortality by a factor of 1.45 (95% CI 1.18, 1.76). Risk of mortality was significantly greater for calves processed at premises with a next day slaughter schedule than those processed at premises with a same day slaughter schedule (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.51, 9.67). However, when the data set was limited to those cases that died or were condemned in the yards (i.e. excluding calves that were dead or condemned on arrival) the effect of same day slaughter was not significant. In order to reduce bobby calf mortality and morbidity, transport duration should be kept as short as possible and a same day slaughter schedule applied. While these factors can be regulated, New Zealands pastoral dairy system means that calves will inevitably be transported for slaughter across several months each spring. Although farm management factors did not apparently influence the risk of mortality in this study, the effect of time in farms calving season suggests there may be farm-management related factors that change over the season.

Podcasts were hosted on Buzzsprout and infographics were created using Adobe InDesign. Live webinar participants were invited to participate in several polls during the webinar and were sent a brief survey to complete at the end of the webinar series. Analytics for all educational resources combined demonstrated a 32-day total direct reach of 135,563. Most live webinar participants identified themselves as horse owners and small equine business owners (55%). The majority of live webinar participants indicated the information was useful (99%), and they would utilize the resources they had learned about (80%). Survey respondents said that Facebook, email, and word of mouth were key ways in which they learned about the webinars. The same survey found that the web-platform was an effective method to receive information (85% high satisfaction) and respondents were highly likely to recommend future EH webinars to others (88%). The three infographics had a total Facebook reach of 131,765, the webinars had 3,522 total views, and the three podcasts had 276 total downloads. The rapid response of EH and quick turnaround of products allowed a large online audience to receive vital information for coping with COVID-19. Having the established EH network, already familiar with virtual education, was a big asset in this effort. This can serve as a model for cooperative extension to utilize in future collaborative responses to industry issues.","output":"Extension Horses, Inc. experts act fast to create online resources to assist the horse industry during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the case of a 38 year-old man living with well-controlled HIV on antiretroviral therapy who developed cerebellar symptoms and was admitted to hospital for management of an intraventricular cryptococcoma During his hospital stay he contracted SARS CoV-2 infection within the hospital setting with a fatal outcome","output":"Hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in a person living with HIV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the SARS-CoV-2 variants BA.1 and BA.2 share over 30 non-synonymous substitutions in the spike glycoprotein, they show several unique mutations that were likely acquired after the split between these two major omicron lineages. One of the most intriguing mutations associated with BA.1 is the presence of the inserted tripeptide Glu-Pro-Glu within the N-terminal domain. While the functional implications of this insertion are still unclear, several other SARS-CoV-2 lineages had previously independently acquired similarly short insertions at the very same site, named RIR1. We have previously identified this site, located approximately between codon 212 and codon 216, as a hotspot of insertions, which usually involve small nucleotide sequences including three or four codons. Here we show that similar insertion events have independently occurred at least 13 times in early 2022 within the BA.2 lineage, being occasionally associated with significant community transmission. One of these omicron sublineages, characterized by a Ser-Gly-Arg insertion in position 212, is responsible of over 2% of all SARS-CoV-2 cases recorded in Denmark, as of early April 2022. Molecular surveillance data highlight a slow but steady growth compared with the parental BA.2 lineage in all Danish regions, suggesting that the RIR1 insertion may confer a selective advantage. We report the identification of other currently circulating BA.2 sublineages showing similar insertions, whose spread should be therefore carefully monitored in the upcoming months.","output":"Independent acquisition of short insertions at the RIR1 site in the spike N-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV-2 BA.2 lineage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Withdrawal: Martin Bordewieck and Malte Elson, the impact of inducing troubleshooting strategies via visual aids on performance in a computerized digital network task, Applied Cognitive Psychology 2020, (https://doi.org/10.1002/acp.3731).

Although strength training in children is expected to reduce this differential, a synchronous adaptation in the tendon must be achieved to ensure forces continue to be transmitted to the skeleton with efficiency while minimizing the risk of strain-related tendon injury. We hypothesized that resistance training (RT) would alter tendon mechanical properties in children concomitantly with changes in force production characteristics. Twenty prepubertal children (age 8.9  0.3 yr) were equally divided into control (nontraining) and experimental (training) groups. The training group completed a 10-wk RT intervention consisting of 2-3 sets of 8-15 plantar flexion contractions performed twice weekly on a recumbent calf-raise machine. Achilles tendon properties (cross-sectional area, elongation, stress, strain, stiffness, and Young's modulus), electromechanical delay (EMD; time between the onset of muscle activity and force), rate of force development (RFD; slope of the force-time curve), and rate of electromyographic (EMG) increase (REI; slope of the EMG time curve) were measured before and after RT. Tendon stiffness and Young's modulus increased significantly after RT in the experimental group only (29% and 25%, respectively); all other tendon properties were not significantly altered, although there were mean decreases in both peak tendon strain and strain at a given force level (14% and 24%, respectively; not significant) which may have implications for tendon injury risk and muscle fiber mechanics. A decrease of 13% in EMD was found after RT for the experimental group, which paralleled the increase in tendon stiffness (r = -0.59); however, RFD and REI were unchanged. The present data show that the Achilles tendon adapts to RT in prepubertal children and is paralleled by a change in EMD, although the magnitude of this change did not appear to be sufficient to influence RFD. These findings are of importance within the context of the efficiency and execution of movement.","output":"Effects of resistance training on tendon mechanical properties and rapid force production in prepubertal children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hemagglutinin esterases (HEs), closely related envelope glycoproteins in influenza C and corona- and toroviruses, mediate reversible attachment to O-acetylated sialic acids (Sias). They do so by acting both as lectins and as receptor-destroying enzymes, functions exerted by separate protein domains. HE divergence was accompanied by changes in quaternary structure and in receptor and substrate specificity. The selective forces underlying HE diversity and the molecular basis for Sia specificity are poorly understood. Here we present crystal structures of porcine and bovine torovirus HEs in complex with receptor analogs. Torovirus HEs form homodimers with sialate-O-acetylesterase domains almost identical to corresponding domains in orthomyxo- and coronavirus HEs, but with unique lectin sites. Structure-guided biochemical analysis of the esterase domains revealed that a functionally, but not structurally conserved arginine-Sia carboxylate interaction is critical for the binding and positioning of glycosidically bound Sias in the catalytic pocket. Although essential for efficient de-O-acetylation of Sias, this interaction is not required for catalysis nor does it affect substrate specificity. In fact, the distinct preference of the porcine torovirus enzyme for 9-mono- over 7,9-di-O-acetylated Sias can be explained from a single-residue difference with HEs of more promiscuous specificity. Apparently, esterase and lectin pockets coevolved; also the porcine torovirus HE receptor-binding site seems to have been designed to use 9-mono- and exclude di-O-acetylated Sias, possibly as an adaptation to replication in swine. Our findings shed light on HE evolution and provide fundamental insight into mechanisms of substrate binding, substrate recognition, and receptor selection in this important class of virion proteins.","output":"Structural basis for ligand and substrate recognition by torovirus hemagglutinin esterases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the pandemic COVID-19 restricted normal execution of agricultural extension services and movement of agricultural produce to markets.

In this report, we assessed occurrence and risk factors for short-term AEs following repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with various immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). METHODS: Self-reported daily questionnaires on AEs during the first 7 days after vaccination were obtained of 2259 individuals (2081 patients and 178 controls) participating in an ongoing prospective multicenter cohort study on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with various IMIDs in the Netherlands (T2B-COVID). Relative risks were calculated for potential risk factors associated with clinically relevant AE (rAE), defined as AE lasting longer than 2 days or impacting daily life. RESULTS: In total, 5454 vaccinations were recorded (1737 first, 1992 second and 1478 third vaccinations). Multiple sclerosis, Crohns disease and rheumatoid arthritis were the largest disease groups. rAEs were reported by 57.3% (95% CI 54.8C59.8) of patients after the first vaccination, 61.5% (95% CI 59.2C63.7) after the second vaccination and 58% (95% CI 55.3C60.6) after the third vaccination. At day 7 after the first, second and third vaccination, respectively, 7.6% (95% CI 6.3C9.1), 7.4% (95% CI 6.2C8.7) and 6.8% (95% CI 5.4C8.3) of patients still reported AEs impacting daily life. Hospital admissions and allergic reactions were uncommon (<0.7%). Female sex (aRR 1.43, 95% CI 1.32C1.56), age below 50 (aRR 1.14, 95% CI 1.06C1.23), a preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection (aRR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01C1.29) and having an IMID (aRR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01C1.34) were associated with increased risk of rAEs following a vaccination. Compared to the second vaccination, the first vaccination was associated with a lower risk of rAEs (aRR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84C0.99) while a third vaccination was not associated with increased risk on rAEs (aRR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84C1.02). BNT162b2 vaccines were associated with lower risk on rAEs compared to CX-024414 (aRR 0.86, 95% CI 0.80C0.93). CONCLUSIONS: A third SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was not associated with increased risk of rAEs in IMID patients compared to the second vaccination. Patients with an IMID have a modestly increased risk of rAEs after vaccination when compared to controls. Most AEs are resolved within 7 days; hospital admissions and allergic reactions were uncommon. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NL74974.018.20, Trial ID: NL8900. Registered on 9 September 2020.

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated these changes. Limited evidence exists for experiences of video care in secondary mental health services. We aimed to assess the acceptability of video care in mental health clinical practice during COVID-19. Method Structured questionnaires were developed with the help of patients and clinicians. The patient experience questionnaire was built into video sessions and completed online, using the Attend Anywhere (AA) platform from July 2020 to March 2021. A Trust-wide clinician views and experiences survey was conducted from July 2020 to October 2020. Descriptive analysis was performed using SPSS (version 27.0). Result Of 1,296 patients who completed the online feedback, the majority provided positive feedback for all aspects of video care. Most patients felt their needs were met (90%) and were supported (93%) during the video call. Positive experiences were informed by clinicians communication skills. For future appointments, just over half (51.7%) of patients preferred using video calls, followed by face-to-face (33%). Future video preference was informed by reasons reducing social anxiety and practical aspects such as child/carer needs, physical disability and travel. Of 252 clinicians completing the survey, 161 (64.7%) had used video for remote care delivery. Clinicians also provided positive feedback, with Microsoft-teams as the preferred platform. Most clinicians felt the therapeutic relationship (76.4%) and privacy (78.7%) were maintained using video. While 73% felt there were no safeguarding issues that impacted adversely, 30% felt that care quality was affected, and (69.9%) reported limited visual cues for video calls. Most clinicians (73%) felt confident about clinical decision-making remotely, though there were areas where clinicians felt less confident, such as assessing patients appearance and behaviour. Additionally, compared with face-to-face, video consultations seemed to be effective for social anxiety, but less so for Autism spectrum disorders, and with no perceived difference for depression or self harm. For future, more clinicians preferred face-to-face (40.1%) than video care (36.1%). Conclusion Mental health care delivered remotely via video is experienced positively by patients and clinicians alike. However, clinicians felt that quality of care is impacted, and additional remote clinical skills training may be beneficial. Going forward, there is acceptability for the use of video care in routine mental health practice for certain mental health presentations.","output":"Remotely connected: patient and clinician video care experiences in secondary mental health services during COVID-19, including future preferences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of personal protective equipment (especially face masks) has increased in different communities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess knowledge and performance of Iranian general population in wearing face masks.

The questionnaires were shared by Link (www.porsall.com) in groups and social networks. Data were analyzed using SPSS (Version 24.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 42.84 years (standard deviation: 16.84). The majority had inadequate and low knowledge of masks (69.2%), nearly 30% had moderate (30.1%), and few had adequate and high knowledge of masks. The individuals' knowledge on when to wear a mask was also assessed and the results showed poor and low in 42.2%, 46.9% moderate and high performance in 10.7%. The participants' performance on how to properly wear a mask was also assessed and 12% showed poor, 69.3% showed moderate, and 18.7% showed high performance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial among patients discharged from internal medicine units of an academic health center between June 2019 and March 2020. Block randomization was used to randomize patients to intervention (received access to SAM at discharge) or control (received usual care). Patients were followed for 30 days post-discharge, during which app use was recorded. Pharmacy claims data were used to measure adherence to medication changes made at discharge, and physician billing data were used to identify emergency department visits and hospital readmissions during follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were eligible for inclusion in the study at hospital discharge (23 intervention, 26 control). In the 30 days of post-discharge, 15 (65.2%) intervention patients used the SAM app. During this period, intervention patients adhered to a larger proportion of medication changes (83.7%) than control patients (77.8%), including newly prescribed medications (72.7% vs 61.7%) and dose changes (90.9% vs 81.8%). A smaller proportion of intervention patients (8.7%) were readmitted to hospital during follow-up than control patients (15.4%). CONCLUSION: The high uptake of SAM among intervention patients supports the feasibility of a larger trial. Results also suggest that SAM has the potential to enhance adherence to medication changes and reduce the risk of downstream adverse events. This hypothesis needs to be tested in a larger trial.

In rolling reviews, data are submitted and reviewed as they become available before the full data package is available. This approach is resource intensive but faster than standard review processes and therefor of benefit to society and patient during a health emergency. In this study we analyze the European Medicines Agency (EMA) rolling review process and extract learnings, based on the vaccines and treatments that have been approved to date (November 2021), and formulate three suggestions to be carried forward. Method Data and information on rolling reviews and similar related processes were collected from Health Authority websites across the globe with a focus on the EMA. Literature searches in PubMed? and checking company websites for additional information were conducted to complement and corroborate findings as required. Findings The duration of a rolling review cycle and the number of cycles before a conditional marketing authorization (CMA) differs between different applications. Through the rolling review process, COVID-19 vaccines could be approved in record times ranging from 17 to 36 days. The rolling review process is not limited to vaccines but is applied to promising treatments as well. Implications Our paper demonstrates that rolling reviews could be successfully conducted during a health emergency to meet an unmet medical need, namely the COVID-19 pandemic. Other critical conditions or life-threatening diseases with unmet needs exist and may be suitable to be addressed by a rolling review process to accelerate patient access to life-changing treatments. Indeed, we call for an evaluation of the rolling review process, its use, and efficiency, to capture learnings with the aim to build a novel, lean, and effective expedited review procedure that could be institutionalized and added to the regulatory toolbox.","output":"COVID-19 made the impossible possible - Rolling Reviews from a notion to reality C the EU experience put into a global context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) interferes with the vascular endothelium.

Successful breeding of cats starts with the selection of suitable breeding animals, and care should be taken to avoid inbreeding. Keeping cats in smaller groups reduces stress and facilitates management. CLINICAL CHALLENGES: Breeding cats is challenging in many ways. Group housing is a common scenario, and care should be taken not to have groups that are too large, because of the risk of stress and infectious diseases. Feline pregnancy and parturition both vary in length, which is one reason why it may be challenging to diagnose dystocia. In queens with pyometra, a vaginal discharge may not be evident due to their meticulous cleaning habits.

Stentriever thrombectomy with or without aspiration assistance was the predominant technique used in the 5 randomized controlled trials that demonstrated the superiority of endovascular thrombectomy. Other studies have highlighted the efficacy of a direct aspiration first-pass technique (ADAPT). METHODS To compare the angiographic and clinical outcomes of ADAPT versus stentriever thrombectomy in patients with emergent large vessel occlusions (ELVO) of the anterior intracranial circulation, the records of 134 patients who were treated between June 2012 and October 2015 were reviewed. RESULTS Within this cohort, 117 patients were eligible for evaluation. ADAPT was used in 47 patients, 20 (42.5%) of whom required rescue stentriever thrombectomy, and primary stentriever thrombectomy was performed in 70 patients. Patients in the ADAPT group were slightly younger than those in the stentriever group (63.5 vs 69.4 years; p = 0.04); however, there were no differences in the other baseline clinical or radiographic factors. Procedural time (54.0 vs 77.1 minutes; p < 0.01) and time to a Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) scale score of 2b/3 recanalization (294.3 vs 346.7 minutes; p < 0.01) were significantly lower in patients undergoing ADAPT versus stentriever thrombectomy. The rates of TICI 2b/3 recanalization were similar between the ADAPT and stentriever groups (82.9% vs 71.4%; p = 0.19). There were no differences in the rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or procedural complications. The rates of good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale Score 0-2) at 90 days were similar between the ADAPT and stentriever groups (48.9% vs 41.4%; p = 0.45), even when accounting for the subset of patients in the ADAPT group who required rescue stentriever thrombectomy. CONCLUSIONS The present study demonstrates that ADAPT and primary stentriever thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke due to ELVO are equivalent with respect to the rates of TICI 2b/3 recanalization and 90-day mRS scores. Given the reduced procedural time and time to TICI 2b/3 recanalization with similar functional outcomes, an initial attempt at recanalization with ADAPT may be warranted prior to stentriever thrombectomy.","output":"A direct aspiration first-pass technique vs stentriever thrombectomy in emergent large vessel intracranial occlusions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Standard approaches to cognitive remediation can suffer from limited skill transferability to patients life.

Neither the standard treatment nor the VE program led to improvement in standardized cognitive measures. Participants perceived both programs as enjoyable and beneficial. The refusal rate was higher in the VE program (8.6%) than in the standard treatment (0%). But in general, the VE program was well-accepted by the psychiatric patients and it required minimal involvement of the clinician due to automatic difficulty level adjustment and performance recording.

Fifty-four sarcoidosis patients received an AT (Group Ia: 27 with coaching and Group Ib: 27 without). A historical group of sarcoidosis patients (Group II; n = 41) who did not follow a physical activity program served as controls.

A significant proportion of IBD patients are treated with immunosuppressive medications and their effects on COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes remain of concern to patients and physicians alike. Apart from the clinical outcome, the pandemic may have other psychosocial effects on this vulnerable cohort such as employment stability. The primary aim of this study was to analyze the percentage of COVID-19 patients who tested themselves for COVID-19 and the outcome of those who tested positive. A secondary aim was to assess their employment status. METHODS: This was a multicentre international study whereby IBD patients (>18 years) in clinical remission over the last year, were asked to answer an anonymous questionnaire. Demographic data, type of IBD, current and previous medication, admissions to hospital, were collected. Exclusion criteria included patients with IBD flares requiring corticosteroids in the previous 12 months. RESULTS: 573 patients (CD: 55.5%) from 8 European Centres and Israel participated in the study. The mean patient age was 39.9 years (SD+/- 13.0). 21.6% were current smokers and 48.5% were non-smokers. The rest were ex-smokers. 44.5% (n=255 ) of patients were tested for Covid-19 and 5.1% (n=13) were positive. The majority were treated at home (92.3%) with only one patient requiring hospital admission. This was a 33 year old female smoker with UC (E3 disease activity) on anti-TNF therapy. 66.7% of positive cases were on anti-TNF medication and 22.2% were on thiopurines. None of the positive cases were on dual antiTNF/thiopurine therapy. 7.2% of patients had family members who also tested positive for Covid-19. Almost half of all patients (45.2%) had their job affected during the pandemic and this was more prevalent in the UC cohort (P<0.05). 70% of patients switched to remote work from home and 21.4% became unemployed. The average age of patients becoming unemployed was 39.3years (SD+/- 11.9). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Nearly half of our cohort (45.2%) underwent testing and the majority (92.3%) were treated at home even though two thirds of them were on Anti-TNF medication.

Since its discovery, the virus has spread to over 100 countries and claimed more than 4000 deaths. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various response public health measures. Method The stochastic agent-based model was used to simulate the process of COVID-19 outbreak in scenario I (imported one case) and II (imported four cases) with a series of public health measures, involving the personal protection, isolation-and-quarantine, gathering restriction, and community containment. The virtual community was constructed following the susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered framework. The epidemiological and economic parameters derived from the previous literature and field investigation. The main outcomes included avoided infectors, cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess uncertainty. Findings In scenario I and II, the isolation-and-quarantine averted 1696 and 1990 humans infected respectively at the cost of US$12 428 and US$58 555, both with negative value of ICERs. The joint strategy of personal protection and isolation-and-quarantine could avert one more case than single isolation-and-quarantine with additional cost of US$ 166 871 and US$180 140 respectively. The effectiveness of isolation-and-quarantine decreased as lowering quarantine probability and increasing delay-time. Especially in scenario II, when the quarantine probability was less than 25%, the number of infections raised sharply; when the quarantine delay-time reached six days, more than a quarter of individuals would be infected in the community. The strategy including community containment could protect more lives and was cost-effective, when the number of imported cases was no less than 65, or the delay-time of quarantine was more than five days, or the quarantine probability was below 25%, based on current assumptions. Interpretation The isolation-and-quarantine was the most cost-effective intervention. However, personal protection and isolation-and-quarantine was the optimal strategy averting more infectors than single isolation-and-quarantine. Certain restrictions should be considered, such as more initial imported cases, longer quarantine delay-time and lower quarantine probability.","output":"Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of public health measures to control COVID-19: a modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is one of the fatal pandemic throughout the world. For cellular fusion, its antigenic peptides are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in humans. Therefore, exploration into residual interaction details of CoV2 with MHCs shall be a promising point for instigating the vaccine development. Envelope (E) protein, the smallest outer surface protein from SARS-CoV2 genome was found to possess the highest antigenicity and is therefore used to identify B-cell and T-cell epitopes. Four novel mutations (T55S, V56F, E69R and G70del) were observed in E-protein of SARS-CoV2 after evolutionary analysis. It showed a coila??helix transition in the protein conformation. Antigenic variability of the epitopes was also checked to explore the novel mutations in the epitope region. It was found that the interactions were more when SARS-CoV2 E-protein interacted with MHC-I than with MHC-II through several ionic and H-bonds. Tyr42 and Tyr57 played a predominant role upon interaction with MHC-I. The higher &#916;G values with lesser dissociation constant values also affirm the stronger and spontaneous interaction by SARS-CoV2 proteins with MHCs. On comparison with the consensus E-protein, SARS-CoV2 E-protein showed stronger interaction with the MHCs with lesser solvent accessibility.

Materials and Methods: We collected blood samples of 180 medical staffs from September 22, 2020 to January 26, 2021. The enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) tests were used for evaluation of the presence of IgG antibodies. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire, comprising demographics, occupational, the work area, and personal protection data. Results: Of the 180 HCWs who participated in this study, 44 (24.4%) were seropositive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The percentage of IgG positivity was higher in males than females (P<0.05). Also, there was statistically significant difference between presence of the antibodies and the occupation, location, and infecting family members with Covid -1 (P<0.05).

About one-third of COVID-19 patients experience a thrombotic event, most commonly pulmonary embolism.

METHODS: In this article, we reviewed the publsihed data concerning with thrombosis in COVID-19 and summarized the predisposing factors and the mechanisms behind COVID-19 related thrombosis. RESULTS: Inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 and the consequent hyperviscosity thought to cause endothelial damage and initiate coagulation. Furthermore, inflammation promotes platelet activation and exerts a pathogenic effect on endothelial cells. The presence of anticardiolipin and antiC2-glycoprotein antibodies in some patients with COVID-19 suggests that SARS-CoV-2, like many other viral infections, induces the formation of antiphospholipid antibodies, which provoke hypercoagulability. Thrombophilic mutations, mainly factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20201A mutations, can be a contributing factor in the development of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients, and they are associated with increased disease severity and pulmonary embolism. However, the research concerning with the association of thrombophilic mutations with COVID-19 related thrombosis showed conflict results.

In this retrospective study, we present the changes in the indications for cesarean delivery (CD) and the birth weights of newborns after the lockdown in Wuhan. METHODS: A total of 3,432 pregnant women in the third trimester of their pregnancies who gave birth in our hospital from 23 January 2019 to 24 March 2020 were selected as the observation group, while 7,159 pregnant women who gave birth from 1 January 2019 to 22 January 2020 were selected as the control group; control group was matched using propensity score matching (PSM). A comparative analysis of the two groups was performed with the chi-square test, t test and rank sum test. RESULTS: The difference in the overall rate of CD between the two groups was not statistically significant (p<0.05). Among the indications for CD, CD on maternal request (CDMR) and fetal distress were also significantly more common in the observation group (p<0.05) than the control group. Furthermore, we found that the weight of newborns was significantly heavier in the observation group than in the control group when considering full-term or close-to-full-term births (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results may provide useful information to management practices regarding pregnancy and childbirth after lockdown in other cities or countries, enabling better control of the rate of CD due to CDMR, reducing fetal distress, and controlling newborn weight.

METHODS Twelve cases of laparoscopic duodenectomy for benign duodenal tumors not amenable to endoscopic resection and away from the ampulla performed from 2009 to 2011 at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic information, patient comorbidities, procedural data, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. These data were compared with the data derived from 6 patients who underwent open duodenectomy for benign duodenal tumors. RESULTS Comparison of the laparoscopic to open duodenectomy data demonstrated that the length of stay was similar between the 2 groups (6.1  0.72 vs. 7  2.1, respectively, P>0.05), but the laparoscopic group was associated with a lower combined short-term and long-term complication rate. Statistically significant difference in patients' body mass index (31  10 for the laparoscopic group vs. 22  4 for the open group, P<0.05) was yielded.

HYPOTHESIS: COVID\\\\19 infection may result in cardiovascular manifestations leading to worse clinical outcome. METHODS: Fifty four severe and critical patients with confirmed COVID\\\\19 were enrolled. Risk factors predicting the severity of COVID\\\\19 were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 54 patients (56.1  13.5 years old, 66.7% male) with COVID\\\\19, 39 were diagnosed as severe and 15 as critical cases. The occurrence of diabetes, the level of D\\\\dimer, inflammatory and cardiac markers in critical cases were significantly higher. Troponin I (TnI) elevation occurred in 42.6% of all the severe and critical patients. Three patients experienced hypotension at admission and were all diagnosed as critical cases consequently. Hypotension was found in one severe case and seven critical cases during hospitalization. Sinus tachycardia is the most common type of arrythmia and was observed in 23 severe patients and all the critical patients. Atrioventricular block and ventricular tachycardia were observed in critical patients at end stage while bradycardia and atrial fibrillation were less common. Mild pericardial effusion was observed in one severe case and five critical cases. Three critical cases suffered new onset of heart failure. Hypotension during treatment, severe myocardial injury and pericardial effusion were independent risk factors predicting the critical status of COVID\\\\19 infection. CONCLUSION: This study has systemically observed the impact of COVID\\\\19 on cardiovascular system, including myocardial injury, blood pressure, arrythmia and cardiac function in severe and critical cases.

The impact of ML methods on research and practical applications in the educational sciences is still limited, but continuously grows, as larger and more complex datasets become available through massive open online courses (MOOCs) and large-scale investigations. The educational sciences are at a crucial pivot point, because of the anticipated impact ML methods hold for the field. To provide educational researchers with an elaborate introduction to the topic, we provide an instructional summary of the opportunities and challenges of ML for the educational sciences, show how a look at related disciplines can help learning from their experiences, and argue for a philosophical shift in model evaluation. We demonstrate how the overall quality of data analysis in educational research can benefit from these methods and show how ML can play a decisive role in the validation of empirical models. Specifically, we (1) provide an overview of the types of data suitable for ML and (2) give practical advice for the application of ML methods. In each section, we provide analytical examples and reproducible R code. Also, we provide an extensive Appendix on ML-based applications for education. This instructional summary will help educational scientists and practitioners to prepare for the promises and threats that come with the shift towards digitisation and large-scale assessment in education. Context and implications Rationale for this study In 2020, the worldwide SARS-COV-2 pandemic forced the educational sciences to perform a rapid paradigm shift with classrooms going online around the worlda hardly novel but now strongly catalysed development. In the context of data-driven education, this paper demonstrates that the widespread adoption of machine learning techniques is central for the educational sciences and shows how these methods will become crucial tools in the collection and analysis of data and in concrete educational applications. Helping to leverage the opportunities and to avoid the common pitfalls of machine learning, this paper provides educators with the theoretical, conceptual and practical essentials. Why the new findings matter The process of teaching and learning is complex, multifaceted and dynamic. This paper contributes a seminal resource to highlight the digitisation of the educational sciences by demonstrating how new machine learning methods can be effectively and reliably used in research, education and practical application. Implications for educational researchers and policy makers The progressing digitisation of societies around the globe and the impact of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic have highlighted the vulnerabilities and shortcomings of educational systems. These developments have shown the necessity to provide effective educational processes that can support sometimes overwhelmed teachers to digitally impart knowledge on the plan of many governments and policy makers. Educational scientists, corporate partners and stakeholders can make use of machine learning techniques to develop advanced, scalable educational processes that account for individual needs of learners and that can complement and support existing learning infrastructure. The proper use of machine learning methods can contribute essential applications to the educational sciences, such as (semi-)automated assessments, algorithmic-grading, personalised feedback and adaptive learning approaches. However, these promises are strongly tied to an at least basic understanding of the concepts of machine learning and a degree of data literacy, which has to become the standard in education and the educational sciences. Demonstrating both the promises and the challenges that are inherent to the collection and the analysis of large educational data with machine learning, this paper covers the essential topics that their app ic tion requires and provides easy-to-follow resources and code to facilitate the process of adoption. ? 2021 The Authors.

Here, we randomly assigned participants (N = 97) to either a poignant experience of forecasted economic anxiety or a no-anxiety control condition. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we then examined how source-localized, anxiety-specific neural activation modulated risky decision making and strategic behavior in the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). Previous research demonstrates opposing effects of anxiety on risk-taking, leading to contrasting predictions. On the one hand, activity in the dorsomedial PFC/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula, brain regions linked with anxiety and sensitivity to risk, should mediate the effect of economic anxiety on increased risk-averse decision-making. On the other hand, activation in the ventromedial PFC, a brain region important in emotion regulation and subjective valuation in decision-making, should mediate the effect of economic anxiety on increased risky decision-making. Results revealed evidence related to both predictions. Additionally, anxiety-specific activation in the dmPFC/ACC and the anterior insula were associated with disrupted learning across the task. These results shed light on the neurobiology of antecedent anxiety and risk-taking and provide potential insight into understanding how real-world anxieties can impact decision-making processes.","output":"Neural processes in antecedent anxiety modulate risk-taking behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is thought to be the gold standard treatment for morbid obesity. However, concerns have been raised by investigators in areas where gastric cancer is prevalent regarding the inaccessibility of the excluded stomach to regular surveillance. This study aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility and short-term surgical outcomes of resectional RYGB. METHODS Sixteen consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass with distal gastric resection for the primary purpose of weight loss between January 2011 and December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. The perioperative outcomes and weight loss results of these patients were analyzed. RESULTS All procedures were successfully performed laparoscopically. The mean length of the operation and the mean hospital stay were 170 min (range 110-225) and 4 days (range 2-7), respectively. The prevalence of early postoperative complications reached 18.7% after resectional RYGB, but a severe complication requiring reoperation occurred in only one patient (6.3%). The percent of excess weight loss was 78.9% over a mean follow-up period of 14 months. Obesity-related comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia resolved or improved after surgery in most patients. CONCLUSION Resectional RYGB is technically feasible and can be a viable option in countries with a high risk of gastric cancer, where surgeons are already well trained in laparoscopic gastrectomy.","output":"Laparoscopic resectional gastric bypass: initial experience in morbidly obese Korean patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community based bottom-up design is the foundation of national emergency management system The outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic in early 2020 is a major test of emergency management capability in rural China This paper first describes the necessity of strengthening the emergency management design in rural areas of China Then this paper introduces the fundamental role of emergency management design based on bottom-up for the security of rural areas in China, especially in improving the level of comprehensive disaster reduction at the grassroots level, which plays an important role in improving the emergency management ability of Chinas rural areas Based on the above analysis, this paper takes the COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control of epidemic in rural areas of China as an example, and find out many problems in Chinas rural emergency management system, such as the grass-roots governments emergency needs cannot be met, the existing mode of systematic lack, the lack of psychological intervention and so on Finally, this paper proposes to strengthen the emergency management design in Chinas rural areas from expanding the scope of emergency management subjects, strengthening the systematic design of rural emergency management system and strengthening the psychological intervention in rural areas","output":"Understanding and Strengthening the Emergency Management and Comprehensive Disaster Reduction in Chinas Rural Areas: Lessons from Coping with the COVID-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mobility resilience refers to the ability of individuals to complete their desired travel despite unplanned disruptions to the transportation system. The potential of new on-demand mobility options, such as ridesourcing services, to fill unpredicted gaps in mobility is an underexplored source of adaptive capacity. Applying a natural experiment approach to newly released ridesourcing data, we examine variation in the gap-filling role of on-demand mobility during sudden shocks to a transportation system by analyzing the change in use of ridesourcing during unexpected rail transit service disruptions across the racially and economically diverse city of Chicago. Using a multilevel mixed model, we control not only for the immediate station attributes where the disruption occurs, but also for the broader context of the community area and city quadrant in a three-level structure. Thereby the unobserved variability across neighborhoods can be associated with differences in factors such as transit ridership, or socio-economic status of residents, in addition to controlling for station level effects. Our findings reveal that individuals use ridesourcing as a gap-filling mechanism during rail transit disruptions, but there is strong variation across situational and locational contexts. Specifically, our results show larger increases in transit disruption responsive ridesourcing during weekdays, nonholidays, and more severe disruptions, as well as in community areas that have higher percentages of White residents and transit commuters, and on the more affluent northside of the city. These findings point to new insights with far-reaching implications on how ridesourcing complements existing transport networks by providing added capacity during disruptions but does not appear to bring equitable gap-filling benefits to low-income communities of color that typically have more limited mobility options.","output":"Disparities in ridesourcing demand for mobility resilience: A multilevel analysis of neighborhood effects in Chicago, Illinois"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On December 9, 2021, 2 international passengers arrived in Tianjin Binhai International Airport from Warsaw, Poland via airplane and tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), using nucleic acid tests.

As this technique is more widely used, it is important to maintain well-established practices of the critical view of safety (CVS) dissection and intraoperative cholangiography (IOC). We present our initial experience with SILC using CVS dissection and routine IOC. STUDY DESIGN Fifty-four patients with biliary colic were offered SILC, which was performed through the umbilicus. CVS with photo documentation was attained before clipping and transecting the cystic structures. IOC was done using various needle puncture techniques. Assessment of CVS was carried out by independent surgeon review of operative still photos or videos using a 3-point grading scale: visualization of only 2 ductal structures entering the gallbladder; a clear triangle of Calot; and separation of the base of the gallbladder from the cystic plate. RESULTS SILC was performed in 54 patients (15 male and 39 female). Six patients required 1 supplementary 3- or 5-mm port. Complete IOC was successful in 50 of 54 patients (92.6%). CVS was achieved at the time of operation in all 54 patients. Photo documentation review confirmed 3 of 3 CVS criteria in 32 (64%) patients, 2 of 3 in 12 patients (24%), 1 of 3 in 3 patients (6%), and 0 in 3 patients (6%). CONCLUSIONS As laparoscopic cholecystectomy becomes less invasive, proven safe dissection techniques should be maintained. Dissection to obtain the CVS should be the goal of every patient and IOC can be accomplished in a high percentage of patients. This approach places patient safety considerations foremost in the evolution of minimally invasive cholecystectomy.","output":"Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy: initial experience with critical view of safety dissection and routine intraoperative cholangiography."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: One in five people with gallstones develop symptoms (~ 13 million in the US), yet only a fraction undergo cholecystectomy. The frequency of and factors associated with patients choosing medical management for gallbladder disease are not well understood. The goal of this study was to assess patient decision-making regarding cholecystectomy, experiences with medical management, and interest in a clinical trial comparing cholecystectomy with medical management. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey from January 2020 through May 2020 using Amazons crowdsourcing platform, MTurk. After a brief screening survey to determine gallbladder disease history and cholecystectomy status, eligible users without prior cholecystectomy were invited to complete the full survey for US $2.50. RESULTS: There were 148 responses included in analysis (93.7% of attempted). Participants were 54% female with a mean age of 36.2 (SD 11.3) years. 36% of participants had used medications or supplements to manage their symptoms with 17% using lecithin and 22% using ursodeoxycholic acid (Ursodiol?). 85% attempted lifestyle modifications to manage symptoms. Surgery was recommended for 60% of which 43% reported planning cholecystectomy. Among those recommended operation, most common reasons for pursuing were symptoms (50%) and symptoms interfering with care of family (42%), while most common reasons for not pursuing were risks of surgery/anesthesia (56%), ongoing medical management (50%), and symptom tolerance (38%). 67% reported willingness to participate in a clinical trial comparing medical management to cholecystectomy. CONCLUSION: A significant portion of patients with symptomatic gallbladder disease choose not to undergo cholecystectomy. One of the most common reasons for avoiding surgery was the use of alternative therapies, despite limited evidence to support their use. The lack of prospective comparison of cholecystectomy to medical therapies for the management of gallbladder disease, along with patient interest, support the need for a clinical trial.","output":"Patient decision-making in symptomatic gallbladder disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viral infections constitute a global public health concern. Among prevalent respiratory viruses, two pneumoviruses can be life-threatening in high-risk populations. In young children, they constitute the first cause of hospitalization due to severe lower respiratory tract diseases. A better understanding of their pathogenesis is still needed as there are no approved efficient anti-viral nor vaccine against pneumoviruses. We studied Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) and human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) in single and dual infections in three-dimensional cultures, a highly relevant model to study viral respiratory infections of the airway epithelium. Our investigation showed that HMPV is less pathogenic than RSV in this model. Compared to RSV, HMPV replicated less efficiently, induced a lower immune response, did not block cilia beating, and was more sensitive to IFNs. In dual infections, RSV-infected epithelia were less permissive to HMPV. By neutralizing IFNs in co-infection assays, we partially prevented HMPV inhibition by RSV and significantly increased the number of co-infected cells in the tissue. This suggests that interference in dual infection would be at least partly mediated by the host immune response. In summary, this work provides new insight regarding virus-host and virus-virus interactions of pneumoviruses in the airway epithelium.

Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cornerstone of an effective public health response. However, efforts to test have been hampered by limited reagents, limitations in the availability of swabs used for the collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens, limitations in personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care providers collecting the NPS specimens, and limitations in viral transport media for transporting the specimens. Therefore, more flexible options for screening for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses are critical to inform clinical and public health responses. OBJECTIVE: We aim to document the ability of patients to self-collect sufficient specimens for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection and serology. METHODS: Patient self-collection of samples will be done with observation by a health care provider during a telemedicine session. Participants will be mailed a specimen collection kit, engage in a telehealth session with a provider through a HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996)-compliant video meeting, and collect specimens while being observed by the provider. Providers will record whether they are confident in the suitability of the specimen for laboratory testing that would inform clinical decision making. We will objectively assess the sufficiency of biological material in the mailed-in specimens. RESULTS: The protocol was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB) on March 30, 2020 (Protocol number 371). To date, we have enrolled 159 participants. CONCLUSIONS: Defining a conceptual framework for assessing the sufficiency of patient-collected samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses to infection is critical for facilitating public health responses and providing PPE-sparing options to increase testing. Validation of alternative methods of specimen collection should include objective measures of the sufficiency of specimens for testing. A strong evidence base for diversifying testing modalities will improve tools to guide public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and Antibodies in Diverse Samples: Protocol to Validate the Sufficiency of Provider-Observed, Home-Collected Blood, Saliva, and Oropharyngeal Samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The devastating impact of infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics on health systems could be overwhelming especially when there is an overlap in clinical presentations with other disease conditions. A case in point is the disruptive effect of the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak on health service delivery and its consequences for malaria management in the affected West and Central African countries between 2014 and 2016. This could be the case with the current infectious disease pandemic (COVID-19) the world is experiencing as malaria illness shares many symptoms with COVID-19 illness. Caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19 is reported to have originated from Wuhan city, China in December 2019. COVID-19 was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Practically, all community infrastructure has been activated in affected countries in response to COVID-19. However, the deployment of huge resources in combating COVID-19 pandemic should not be a missed opportunity for the advancement of infectious diseases control including malaria. This calls for conscious and heightened effort to sustain the gains in malaria control. The WHO has emphasized that the response to the COVID-19 pandemic must utilize and strengthen existing infrastructure for addressing malaria and other infectious diseases globally. Leveraging these to maintain malaria control activities in endemic countries could boost and help to sustain the gains in malaria control in accordance with the 2016-2030 Global technical strategy for malaria (GTS) milestones. In addition, it will help to keep the \\"High burden to high impact\\" (HBHI) and other initiatives on track. This article highlights the commonalities of the two diseases, discusses implications and recommendations to support decision making strategies to keep malaria control on track in the COVID-19 pandemic era.","output":"Malaria and COVID-19: commonalities, intersections and implications for sustaining malaria control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research determined the perception toward online education among faculty in a State College in the Philippines This study used a descriptive online survey involving a sample of 27 faculty members Statistical tools employed were descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis test Research findings indicated that the majority of faculty had intermediate computer competency and had no training in online teaching, with only a few having a very stable internet connection Faculty considered online education to result in more academic dishonesty, impersonal and lack feeling compared to face-to-face classes, and difficult to manage in terms of technology Additionally, faculty were undecided if they are in favor of online education The faculty significantly differed whether they are in favor of online education based on age, sex, college, educational attainment, years in teaching, academic rank, level taught, and employment status Faculty of Higher Education Institutions must be provided with continued support and training as they adapt to the new normal in the higher education landscape and as they embrace the instructional challenges brought by the Coronavirus disease 19 pandemic Copyright ? 2020 by authors, all rights reserved Authors agree that this article remains permanently open access under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License 4 0 International License","output":"Faculty perception toward online education in a state college in the Philippines during the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus most commonly presents with respiratory symptoms. While gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations either at presentation or during hospitalization are also common, their impact on clinical outcomes is controversial. Some studies have described worse outcomes in COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms, while others have shown either no association or a protective effect. There is a need for consistent standards to describe GI symptoms in COVID-19 patients and to assess their effect on clinical outcomes, including mortality and disease severity. AIM: To investigate the prevalence of GI symptoms in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and their correlation with disease severity and clinical outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 601 consecutive adult COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization between May 1-15, 2020. GI symptoms were recorded at admission and during hospitalization. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were retrieved. Clinical outcomes included all-cause mortality, disease severity at presentation, need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and need for mechanical ventilation. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify independent predictors of the adverse outcomes. RESULTS: The prevalence of any GI symptom at admission was 27.1% and during hospitalization was 19.8%. The most common symptoms were nausea (98 patients), diarrhea (76 patients), vomiting (73 patients), and epigastric pain or discomfort (69 patients). There was no difference in the mortality between the two groups (6.21% vs 5.5%, P = 0.7). Patients with GI symptoms were more likely to have severe disease at presentation (33.13% vs 22.5%, P < 0.001) and prolonged hospital stay (15 d vs 14 d, P = 0.04). There was no difference in other clinical outcomes, including ICU admission, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, or need for mechanical ventilation. Drugs associated with the development of GI symptoms during hospitalization were ribavirin (diarrhea 26.37% P < 0.001, anorexia 17.58%, P = 0.02), hydroxychloroquine (vomiting 28.52%, P = 0.009) and lopinavir/ritonavir (nausea 32.65% P = 0.049, vomiting 31.47% P = 0.004, and epigastric pain 12.65% P = 0.048). In the multivariate regression analysis, age > 65 years was associated with increased mortality risk [odds ratio (OR) 7.53, confidence interval (CI): 3.09-18.29, P < 0.001], ICU admission (OR: 1.79, CI: 1.13-2.83, P = 0.012), and need for mechanical ventilation (OR: 1.89, CI:1.94-2.99, P = 0.007). Hypertension was an independent risk factor for ICU admission (OR: 1.82, CI:1.17-2.84, P = 0.008) and need for mechanical ventilation (OR: 1.66, CI: 1.05-2.62, P = 0.028). CONCLUSION: Patients with GI symptoms are more likely to have severe disease at presentation; however, mortality and disease progression is not different between the two groups.","output":"Digestive system involvement and clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients: A retrospective cohort study from Qatar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The house gets sick, the house makes us sick, the house heals, the house heals us.

The aim of this study was to thematically investigate what mental health crisis presentations might be diverted from the Emergency department to external crisis hubs in order to reduce the COVID-19 contamination risks. Method All referrals made to the Homerton University Hospital (HUH) mental health liaison service were looked at between 1/3/20-11/6/20 (n = 846), coinciding with the first peak of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Referral data was anonymised and sorted independently into naturally emerging thematic classes by two junior liaison doctors. Cases that did not clearly fit any of the 14 themes generated were further looked into to determine outcome of referral and discussed to try and match to an appropriate class. Result 14 frequent themes for mental health crisis referrals were identified. The distribution of these ranged from most common (suicidality) to neurocognitive presentation and identified shifts in themes over the course of the pandemic peak such as increases of low mood, anxiety and intoxication requiring medical attention over the three month period. Conclusion Although themes for presentations may be identified in acute referrals to mental health liaison services it is problematic determining how these may be parsed safely to crisis hubs without risking overlooking cases that may require medical attention. The most common theme that was identified and remained throughout the first wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic was acute suicidal presentation. The remaining themes would require careful consideration around risk thresholds for what a service may wish to accept in devolving the emergency department liaison and balance these against future risks of repeat COVID-19 waves.","output":"Psychiatric liaison referrals: a thematic analysis during peak COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Vitamin D status is related to risks of influenza and respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D has direct antiviral effects primarily against enveloped viruses, and coronavirus is an enveloped virus. The 2019 coronavirus disease had a high mortality rate and impacted the whole population of the planet, with severe acute respiratory syndrome the principal cause of death. Vitamin D can adequately modulate and regulate the immune and oxidative response to infection with COVID-19. The goal of this systematic review was thus to summarize and decide if there were a link between vitamin D status and COVID-19 infection and prognosis. METHODS: The protocol of this study is documented in the Prospero database and can be accessed with the protocol number CRD42020201283. PubMed and Google Scholar were used for a literature search from August 2020 to September 2020. We restricted the year of publication of reviewed articles to 2019C2020, and the selected language was English. Studies that used secondary data, feedback, or analysis of reviews were removed. To assess the standard of studies included, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) method was used. RESULTS: Of the nine studies reviewed, seven (77.8%) showed that COVID-19 infection, prognosis, and mortality were correlated with vitamin D status. CONCLUSION: Most of the articles reviewed showed that blood vitamin D status can determine the risk of being infected with COVID-19, seriousness of COVID-19, and mortality from COVID-19. Therefore, maintaining appropriate levels of Vitamin D through supplementation or natural methods, eg, sunlight on the skin, is recommended for the public to be able to cope with the pandemic.","output":"Effects of Vitamin D on COVID-19 Infection and Prognosis: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heavy metals occur naturally in very small amounts in living organisms, but exposure to their higher concentrations is hazardous. Heavy metals at hazardous levels are commonly found in foodstuffs of Bangladesh, mainly due to the lack of safety guidelines and poor management of industrial effluents. Several lines of evidence suggest that the level of heavy metals in foodstuffs of Bangladesh is higher than the acceptable limits set by World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization. Literature survey revealed that the sources and transport pathways of heavy metals in the ecosystem and the abundance of heavy metals in the food products of Bangladesh are potential threats to food safety. However, an extensive assessment of the toxicity of heavy metals in food webs is lacking. Although widespread heavy metal contamination in various foodstuffs and environmental matrices have been summarized in some reports, a critical evaluation regarding multi-trophic transfer and the health risk of heavy metal exposure through food chain toxicity in Bangladesh has not been performed. This systematic review critically discussed heavy metal contamination, exposure toxicity, research gaps, existing legislation, and sustainable remediation strategies to enhance Bangladeshs food safety. In particular, this study for the first time explored the potential multi-trophic transfer of heavy metals via food webs in Bangladesh.

Many different genotypes of IBV are recognized which cause different clinical manifestations. According to the antigenic differences, different serotypes of the virus do not cross-protect. Massachusetts serotype induces the best cross-protection against other serotypes. Recently, the IBV QX genotype has been detected in Iran. QX genotype causes permanent damage to the oviduct in layer and breeder flock if it occurs in the early life cycle. In this study, we compared two vaccination program using 793/B type and Massachusetts type vaccine. One-day-old SPF chickens were divided into four groups. Groups 1 and 2 were unvaccinated groups. Group 3 was vaccinated with the H120 vaccine at day 1 and 793/B at day 14 (eye drop), and group 4 was vaccinated with H120+793/B (eye drop) on the first day and 793/B at day 14. Groups 2, 3, and 4 challenged (oculonasal) with QX genotype (10(4) EID50) at day 35. Five days post challenge, the sample were clollected for ciliostasis test, histopathology, and quantitative real-time RT-PCR from trachea, lung, and kidneys. Results showed that two vaccination programs created more than 80% of protection against challenge virus, but no significant difference was recorded between two programs. Based on our results, it can be concluded that vaccination with two mixed vaccines (H120+793/B) on the first day of the life of a chick does not make any difference in comparison to single vaccine (H120) in reducing of pathological damages and viral load. As long as the second vaccination against IB may not be applied properly in farm situation, applying the mixture of 793/B type vaccine with H120 at day 1 (ocular or spray) may help to increase vaccination program efficacy.","output":"Including 793/B type avian infectious bronchitis vaccine in 1-day-old chicken increased the protection against QX genotype"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) are experts in establishing persistent infection in immune-competent humans, in part by successfully evading immune activation through diverse strategies.

A recent fixed-effects meta-analysis found smoking to be associated with disease severity among hospitalized patients, but other studies report an unusually low prevalence of smoking among hospitalized patients. The purpose of this study was to expand the analysis by calculating the prevalence odds ratio (POR) of smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while the association between smoking and disease severity and mortality was examined by random-effects meta-analyses considering the highly heterogeneous study populations. METHODS: The same studies as examined in the previous meta-analysis were analyzed (N = 22, 20 studies from China and 2 from USA). The POR relative to the expected smoking prevalence was calculated using gender and age-adjusted population smoking rates. Random-effects meta-analyses were used for all other associations. RESULTS: A total of 7162 patients were included, with 482 being smokers. The POR was 0.24 (95%CI 0.19-0.30). Unlike the original study, the association between smoking and disease severity was not statistically significant using random-effects meta-analysis (OR 1.40, 95%CI 0.98-1.98). In agreement with the original study, no statistically significant association was found between smoking and mortality (OR 1.86, 95%CI 0.88-3.94). CONCLUSION: An unusually low prevalence of smoking, approximately 1/4th the expected prevalence, was observed among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Any association between smoking and COVID-19 severity cannot be generalized but should refer to the seemingly low proportion of smokers who develop severe COVID-19 that requires hospitalization. Smokers should be advised to quit due to long-term health risks, but pharmaceutical nicotine or other nicotinic cholinergic agonists should be explored as potential therapeutic options, based on a recently presented hypothesis.","output":"Smoking prevalence among hospitalized COVID-19 patients and its association with disease severity and mortality: an expanded re-analysis of a recent publication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction To compare the healthcare utilization in patients who presented with no pseudomeningocele (PSM) following vestibular schwannoma (VS) surgery (nd-PSM), PSM following VS surgery and required surgical repair (s-PSM) and those who presented with PSM and did not require surgical repair (ns-PSM).

We investigated whether this increase is a common feature in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden). MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was based on the Nordic Arthroplasty Register Association (NARA) dataset. 432,168 primary THAs from 1995 to 2009 were included (Denmark: 83,853, Finland 78,106, Norway 88,455, and Sweden 181,754). Adjusted survival analyses were performed using Cox regression models with revision due to infection as the endpoint. The effect of risk factors such as the year of surgery, age, sex, diagnosis, type of prosthesis, and fixation were assessed. RESULTS 2,778 (0.6%) of the primary THAs were revised due to infection. Compared to the period 1995-1999, the relative risk (with 95% CI) of revision due to infection was 1.1 (1.0-1.2) in 2000-2004 and 1.6 (1.4-1.7) in 2005-2009. Adjusted cumulative 5-year revision rates due to infection were 0.46% (0.42-0.50) in 1995-1999, 0.54% (0.50-0.58) in 2000-2004, and 0.71% (0.66-0.76) in 2005-2009. The entire increase in risk of revision due to infection was within 1 year of primary surgery, and most notably in the first 3 months. The risk of revision due to infection increased in all 4 countries. Risk factors for revision due to infection were male sex, hybrid fixation, cement without antibiotics, and THA performed due to inflammatory disease, hip fracture, or femoral head necrosis. None of these risk factors increased in incidence during the study period. INTERPRETATION We found increased relative risk of revision and increased cumulative 5-year revision rates due to infection after primary THA during the period 1995-2009.

However typical TMB determination is performed via next generation sequencing which is problematic due to its high cost, low availability worldwide and operational challenges. The ability to screen patients for TMB determination using alternative methodologies is of interest, particularly in the use of H&E slides which are readily available for most cancer patients. Bio-AI Health has developed a machine learning (ML) classifier model capable of identifying TMB status in patients using H&E slides only. Our automated model is unique in that it uses an enriched signal from samples consisting of tumor region only while generating unique visualizers that provide an insight into the performance and mode of action of the model itself. This visualizer allows the pathologist a unique view into the ML performance therefore eliminating the black box concept and providing a crucial QC step to ensure proper algorithm performance. This test can increase the sensitivity of detection providing significant clinical utility. The dataset for model development was obtained from TCGA cohort and TMB status was calculated using whole exome sequencing data. We further developed automated ML segmentation models to accurately segment the tissue into multiple compartments and filter our all necrotic and non-neoplastic tissue regions. Taking into account only tumor regions, the classifier ML model uses an ensemble approach which integrates the prediction of multiple convolutional network probabilities and achieves an accuracy of 0.76 with a sensitivity of .79 and F1 score of .82 towards the classification of the tissue as TMB high or Low.","output":"Development of a TMB classifier on NSCLC H&E images"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(D,[["render",V]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/2.md","filePath":"drive/2.md"}'),R={name:"drive/2.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[w(P)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
