Studies showed children with OME hear better with bone conducting headsets. During COVID-19 we investigated whether children with deafness secondary OME, without access to audiology or grommet surgery, could be aided with bone conduction kits and the HearGlueEar app. Methods Starting July 2020, during COVID-19, children aged 3-11 years with OME and on a grommet waiting list were invited to a single arm, prospective study. They received the kit, instructions and HearGlueEar app by post. By 3 weeks parents were asked to charge and pair the devices, attend a remote consultation and complete an OMQ-14 questionnaire. Remote follow-up lasted 3 months. Outcomes: ability to use the equipment, complete the questionnaire about child hearing and behaviour before and with the equipment, declining grommet surgery or where deafness resolved, and give opinion about the intervention. Findings: 26 children enrolled. Families used the kit at home and school. Most found remote consultations positive and convenient. OMQ-14 responses were 90% positive. Three families continued with the headset to avoid grommets. Comments were - Other people have said, wow his speech is clearer. - He said over and over again, I can hear everybody, wow, wow, wow. - It is no exaggeration to say this has made an astronomical improvement to his quality of life.- She is getting on really well with the headphones - pairing them with the iPad at home is simply brilliant.

Many components of common fruits and vegetables play well-documented roles as chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agents that suppress tumorigenesis. Anthraquinones are commonly extracted from the Polygonaceae family of plants, e.g., Rheum palmatum and Rheum officinale. Some of the major chemical components of anthraquinone and its derivatives, such as aloe-emodin, danthron, emodin, chrysophanol, physcion, and rhein, have demonstrated potential anticancer properties. This review evaluates the pharmacological effects of emodin, a major component of Aloe vera. In particular, emodin demonstrates anti-neoplastic, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenesis, and toxicological potential for use in pharmacology, both in vitro and in vivo. Emodin demonstrates cytotoxic effects (e.g., cell death) through the arrest of the cell cycle and the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. The overall molecular mechanisms of emodin include cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and the promotion of the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1, glutathione S-transferase P, N-acetyltransferase, and glutathione phase I and II detoxification enzymes while inhibiting angiogenesis, invasion, migration, chemical-induced carcinogen-DNA adduct formation, HER2/neu, CKII kinase, and p34cdc2 kinase in human cancer cells.

This policy may have had an undesirable spill-over effect on HIV-negative women as well. Thus, the aims of this scoping review were to: (a) describe EBF practices in South Africa, (b) determine how EBF has been affected by the WHO HIV infant feeding policies followed since 2006, and (c) assess if the renewed interest in The Code has had any impact on breastfeeding practices in South Africa. METHODS We applied the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines for scoping reviews and reported our work in compliance with the PRISMA Extension (PRISMA-ScR). Twelve databases and platforms were searched. We included all study designs (no language restrictions) from South Africa published between 2006 and 2020. Eligible participants were women in South Africa who delivered a healthy live newborn who was between birth and 24 months of age at the time of study, and with known infant feeding practices. RESULTS A total of 5431 citations were retrieved. Duplicates were removed in EndNote and by Covidence. Of the 1588 unique records processed in Covidence, 179 records met the criteria for full-text screening and 83 were included in the review. It was common for HIV-positive women who initiated breastfeeding to stop doing so prior to 6 months after birth (1-3 months). EBF rates rapidly declined after birth. School and work commitments were also reasons for discontinuation of EBF. HIV-positive women expressed fear of HIV MTCT transmission as a reason for not breastfeeding. CONCLUSION The Review found that while enforcing the most recent WHO HIV infant feeding guidelines and the WHO Code may be necessary to improve breastfeeding outcomes in South Africa, they may not be sufficient because there are additional barriers that impact breastfeeding outcomes. Mixed-methods research, including in-depth interviews with key informants representing different government sectors and civil society is needed to prioritize actions and strategies to improve breastfeeding outcomes in South Africa.","output":"Breastfeeding inequities in South Africa: Can enforcement of the WHO Code help address them? - A systematic scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with human BK polyomavirus, a small double-stranded DNA virus, potentially results in severe complications in immunocompromised patients. Here, we describe the in vivo variability and evolution of the BK polyomavirus by deep sequencing. Our data reveal the highest genomic evolutionary rate described in double-stranded DNA viruses, i.e., 10(?3)C10(?5) substitutions per nucleotide site per year. High mutation rates in viruses allow their escape from immune surveillance and adaptation to new hosts. By combining mutational landscapes across viral genomes with in silico prediction of viral peptides, we demonstrate the presence of significantly more coding substitutions within predicted cognate HLA-C-bound viral peptides than outside. This finding suggests a role for HLA-C in antiviral immunity, perhaps through the action of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors.

METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in 82 COPD patients admitted due to AECOPD. FOT indices were measured and the association between these indices and spirometry, peak inspiratory flow rate, blood inflammatory biomarkers and patient-reported outcomes including assessment of dyspnoea, quality of life, anxiety and depression and frailty at admission and discharge were explored. RESULTS: All patients were able to perform FOT in both sitting and supine position. The prevalence of expiratory flow limitation (EFL) in the upright position was 39% (32 out of 82) and increased to 50% (41 out of 82) in the supine position. EFL (measured by Xrs(5Hz)) and resistance at 5 Hz (Rrs(5Hz)) negatively correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)); those with EFL had lower FEV(1) (0.740.30 versus 0.940.36 L, p = 0.01) and forced vital capacity (1.70.55 versus 2.10.63 L, p = 0.009) and higher body mass index (27 (21C36) versus 23 (19C26) kgm(?2), p = 0.03) compared to those without EFL. During recovery from AECOPD, changes in EFL were observed in association with improvement in breathlessness. CONCLUSION: FOT was easily used to detect EFL during hospitalisation due to AECOPD. The prevalence of EFL increased when patients moved from a seated to a supine position and EFL was negatively correlated with airflow limitation. Improvements in EFL were associated with a reduction in breathlessness. FOT is of potential clinical value by providing a noninvasive, objective and effort-independent technique to measure lung function parameters during AECOPD requiring hospital admission.","output":"The clinical utility of forced oscillation technique during hospitalisation in patients with exacerbation of COPD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The differential diagnosis of acute shortness of breath in a pregnant woman with COVID-19 is broad.

Less is known about long-term outcomes in terms of mortality and readmissions. We provide a detailed account of hospitalised COVID-19 patients until 180 days after their initial hospital admission. Methods: An observational study with claims data from the German Local Health Care Funds of adult patients hospitalised in Germany between Feb 1 and April 30, 2020&nbsp;with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and&nbsp;a related principal diagnosis, for whom follow-up data for 180 days after admission or until death was available.&nbsp;A multivariable logistic regression model identified independent risk factors for 180-day mortality. Findings: Of&nbsp;8679 patients with a median age of 72 years,&nbsp;2161 (249%) died during the index hospitalisation. 30-day mortality was 239% (2073/8679), 90-day 279% (2425/8679), and 180-day 296% (2566/8679). The latter was&nbsp;523% (1472/2817) for patients aged 80 years, 236% (1621/6865) if not ventilated during index hospitalisation but 530% in those ventilated invasively (853/1608). Risk factors for 180-day mortality included coagulopathy, BMI 40 and age, while female sex was a protective factor beyond fewer prevalence of comorbidities. Of 6235 patients discharged alive, 1668 patients were readmitted a total of 2551 times within 180 days, resulting in an overall readmission rate of 268%. Interpretation: 180 day-follow up data of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in a nationwide&nbsp;cohort representing almost one-third of the&nbsp;German population show considerable long-term mortality and readmission rates, especially among patients with coagulopathy, whereas women have a profound and long-lasting better clinical outcome compared to men.

Current testing approaches for this RNA virus focus primarily on diagnosis by RT-qPCR, which is time-consuming, costly, often inaccurate and impractical for general population rollout due to the need for laboratory processing. The latency until the test result arrives with the patient has led to further virus spread. Furthermore, latest antigen rapid tests still require 15 to 30 min processing time and are challenging to handle. Despite increased PCR-test and antigen-test efforts the pandemic has entered the worldwide second stage. Herein, we applied a superfast reagent-free and non-destructive approach of attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy with subsequent chemometric analysis to the interrogation of virus-infected samples. Contrived samples with inactivated gamma-irradiated Covid-19 virus particles at levels down to 1582 copies/ml generated infrared (IR) spectra with good signal-to-noise ratio. Predominant virus spectral peaks are associated with nucleic acid bands, including RNA. At low copy numbers, the presence of virus particle was found to be capable of modifying the IR spectral signature of saliva, again with discriminating wavenumbers primarily associated with RNA. Discrimination was also achievable following ATR-FTIR spectral analysis of swabs immersed in saliva variously spiked with virus. Following on, we nested our test system in a clinical setting wherein participants were recruited to provide demographic details, symptoms, parallel RT-qPCR testing and the acquisition of pharyngeal swabs for ATR-FTIR spectral analysis. Initial categorisation of swab samples into negative versus positive Covid-19 infection was based on symptoms and PCR results. Following training and validation of a genetic algorithm-linear discriminant analysis (GA-LDA) algorithm, a blind sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 89% was achieved. This prompt approach generates results within two minutes and is applicable in areas with increased people traffic that require sudden test results such as airports, events or gate controls.","output":"Ultra-rapid on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection using simple ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and analysis algorithm: high sensitivity and specificity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the hospital management of mother-infant pairs poses to obstetricians and neonatologists previously unmet challenges.

In particular, clinical trials in stroke are vulnerable to the impacts of the pandemic at multiple stages, including design, recruitment, intervention, follow-up, and interpretation of outcomes. A carefully considered approach is required to ensure the appropriate conduct of stroke trials during the pandemic and to maintain patient and participant safety. This has been recently addressed by the International Council for Harmonisation which, in November 2019, released an addendum to the Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials guidelines entitled Estimands and Sensitivity Analysis in Clinical Trials. In this article, we present the International Council for Harmonisation estimand framework for the design and conduct of clinical trials, with a specific focus on its application to stroke clinical trials. This framework aims to align the clinical and scientific objectives of a trial with its design and end points. It also encourages the prospective consideration of potential postrandomization intercurrent events which may occur during a trial and either impact the ability to measure an end point or its interpretation. We describe the different categories of such events and the proposed strategies for dealing with them, specifically focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic as a source of intercurrent events. We also describe potential practical impacts posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on trials, health systems, study groups, and participants, all of which should be carefully reviewed by investigators to ensure an adequate practical and statistical strategy is in place to protect trial integrity. We provide examples of the implementation of the estimand framework within hypothetical stroke trials in intracerebral hemorrhage and stroke recovery.

We combined coarse-grained simulations, protein stability and dynamic fluctuation communication analysis with network-based community analysis to examine structures of the native and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in different functional states. Through distance fluctuations communication analysis, we probed stability and allosteric communication propensities of protein residues in the native and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, providing evidence that the D614G mutation can enhance long-range signaling of the allosteric spike engine. By combining functional dynamics analysis and ensemble-based alanine scanning of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins we found that the D614G mutation can improve stability of the spike protein in both closed and open forms, but shifting thermodynamic preferences towards the open mutant form. Our results revealed that the D614G mutation can promote the increased number of stable communities and allosteric hub centers in the open form by reorganizing and enhancing the stability of the S1-S2 inter-domain interactions and restricting mobility of the S1 regions. This study provides atomistic-based view of allosteric communications in the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, suggesting that the D614G mutation can exert its primary effect through allosterically induced changes on stability and communications in the residue interaction networks.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Nineteen essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation of dried plant material, and their monoterpene profiles were determined. In addition, the exact concentrations of each monoterpene that were found at a significant level were defined. Both essential oils and their monoterpene components were tested for cytotoxic and antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in infected Vero 76 cells. The results showed that the essential oils of four Mentha species, i.e., M. aquatica L. cv. Veronica, M. pulegium L., M. microphylla K.Koch, and M. x villosa Huds., but also Micromeria thymifolia (Scop.) Fritsch and Ziziphora clinopodioides Lam., and five different monoterpenes, i.e., carvacrol, carvone, 1,8-cineol, menthofuran, and pulegone, inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 replication in the infected cells. However, the antiviral activity varied both among essential oils and monoterpenes. Carvone and carvacrol exhibited moderate antiviral activity with IC(50) concentrations of 80.23  6.07 M and 86.55  12.73 M, respectively, while the other monoterpenes were less active (IC(50) > 100.00 M). Structure-activity relations of related monoterpenes showed that the presence of keto and hydroxyl groups is associated with the activity of carvone and carvacrol, respectively. Furthermore, the carvone-rich essential oil of M. x villosa had the greatest activity among all active essential oils (IC(50) 127.00  4.63 ppm) while the other active oils exhibited mild (140 ppm < IC(50) < 200 ppm) to weak antiviral activity (IC(50) > 200 ppm). Both essential oils and monoterpenes showed limited or no cytotoxicity against Vero 76 cells. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the differences in the antiviral activity of essential oils were directly attributed to the antiviral efficacies of their particular single monoterpenes.

Although considerable progress has been made in the field of Trustworthy ML (TwML) in the recent past, much of the current characterization of this progress is qualitative. Consequently, decisions about how to address issues of trustworthiness and future research goals are often left to the interested researcher. In this paper, we present the first quantitative approach to characterize the comprehension of TwML research. We build a co-occurrence network of words using a web-scraped corpus of more than 7,000 peer-reviewed recent ML papers -- consisting of papers both related and unrelated to TwML. We use community detection to obtain semantic clusters of words in this network that can infer relative positions of TwML topics. We propose an innovative fingerprinting algorithm to obtain probabilistic similarity scores for individual words, then combine them to give a paper-level relevance score. The outcomes of our analysis inform a number of interesting insights on advancing the field of TwML research.","output":"An Interpretable Graph-based Mapping of Trustworthy Machine Learning Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a drug indicated in rheumatology for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus for its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties Many countries such as Morocco have recommended the use of HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 infection This medication is responsible for severe acute poisoning Therefore, Hospital laboratories have a fundamental role in affirming the diagnosis and assessing the severity of intoxication by measuring HCQ, carried out in the urine and preferably in whole blood The analytical techniques used are essentially chromatographic Unfortunately, these reference methods for forensic analyzes are difficult to adapt to emergency due to their delay in reporting results","output":"Current Trends in Analytical Methods for the Determination of Hydroxychloroquine and Its Application as Treatment for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the most hectic pandemic of the era, is increasing exponentially and taking thousands of lives worldwide. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of pre-existing comorbidities among COVID-19 patients and their mortality risks with each category of pre-existing comorbidity. Methods: To conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched using pre-specified search strategies. Further searches were conducted using the reference list of the selected studies, renowned preprint servers (eg, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN), and relevant journals' websites. Studies written in the English language included if those were conducted among COVID-19 patients with and without comorbidities and presented survivor vs non-survivor counts or hazard/odds of deaths or survivors with types of pre-existing comorbidities. Comorbidities reported in the selected studies were grouped into eight categories. The pooled likelihoods of deaths in each category were estimated using a fixed or random-effect model, based on the heterogeneity assessment. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot asymmetry and Egger's regression test. Trim and Fill method was used if there any publication bias was found. Results: A total of 41 studies included in this study comprised of 27 670 samples. The most common pre-existing comorbidities in COVID-19 patients were hypertension (39.5%), cardiovascular disease (12.4%), and diabetes (25.2%). The higher likelihood of deaths was found among COVID-19 patients who had pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (odds ratio (OR) = 3.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.86-4.09), immune and metabolic disorders (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 2.03-2.85), respiratory diseases (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.72-2.19), cerebrovascular diseases (OR = 4.12, 95% CI = 3.04-5.58), any types of cancers (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.63-3.03), renal (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 2.60-3.51), and liver diseases (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.50-3.69). Conclusions: This study provides evidence that COVID-19 patients with pre-existing comorbidities had a higher likelihood of death. These findings could potentially help health care providers to sort out the most susceptible COVID-19 patients by comorbidities, take precautionary measures during hospitalization, assess susceptibility to death, and prioritize their treatment, which could potentially reduce the number of fatalities in COVID-19.","output":"Effects of underlying morbidities on the occurrence of deaths in COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Large and giant paraclinoid aneurysms are challenging to treat by either surgical or endovascular means.

In the same year, 47 neonates out of 1000 live births were not surviving in the first 28 days of age in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. Despite the highest burden of neonatal death in the region, specific or the proximate determinants of neonatal death in the neonatal intensive care unit were not well identified. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the determinants of neonatal mortality at neonatal intensive care unit in Dessie Referral Hospital, Northeast Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based unmatched case-control study was conducted on neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of Dessie Referral Hospital, from January 1, 2016, to December 30, 2017. A total of 390 charts (130 cases and 260 controls) were selected by simple random sampling technique. The data were abstracted from the facility-based data abstraction form. A binary logistic regression analysis was fitted to identify the determinants of neonatal mortality. RESULTS: Pregnancy-induced hypertension (AOR = 4.57; 95% CI 1.45C14.43), prolonged rupture of membrane (AOR = 2.04; 95% CI 1.13C3.68), very low birth weight (AOR = 7.00; 95% CI 2.10C23.35), and low birth weight (AOR = 2.12; 95% CI 1.10C4.20) were identified factors. Moreover, respiratory distress syndrome (AOR = 3.61; 95% CI 1.10C12.04), perinatal asphyxia (AOR = 2.27; 95% CI 1.18C4.39), meconium aspiration syndrome (AOR = 2.35; 95% CI 1.12C4.97), and infection (AOR = 2.26; 95% CI 1.34C3.82) were also significantly associated with neonatal death. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy-induced hypertension, prolonged rupture of membrane, low birth weight, respiratory distress syndrome, perinatal asphyxia, meconium aspiration syndrome, and infections were the major determinants of neonatal mortality. Therefore, special attention will be given to small and sick babies. Moreover, early anticipation of complications and management of mothers who had pregnancy-induced hypertension and prolonged rupture of the membrane would save neonates.","output":"Determinants of neonatal mortality at neonatal intensive care unit in Northeast Ethiopia: unmatched case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Children with uncontrolled asthma are less tolerant to exercise due to ventilatory limitation, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), or physical deconditioning. The contribution of these factors in children with controlled mild-to-moderate asthma is unknown. Objective: To explore the underlying mechanisms of reduced exercise capacity in children with controlled mild-to-moderate asthma. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 45 children and adolescents (age 8-18 years) with controlled mild-to-moderate asthma (asthma control test score 21-25) and 61 age-matched healthy controls. All participants completed a physical activity questionnaire and performed spirometry and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET; maximal incremental protocol). Spirometric indices and CPET parameters were compared between the two groups. The effect of EIB (FEV1 decrease >10% post CPET), ventilatory limitation and physical deconditioning on maximum oxygen uptake (O2peak), was assessed by multivariable linear regression. Results: 62.2% of children with asthma and 29.5% of controls (P = 0.002) were categorized as inactive. Reduced exercise capacity (O2peak <80%) was noted in 53.3% of asthmatics and 16.4% of controls (P < 0.001). EIB was documented in 11.1% of participants with asthma. Physical deconditioning was noted in 37.8% of children with asthma and in 14.8% of controls (P = 0.013). Physical deconditioning emerged as the only significant determinant of O2peak, irrespective of asthma diagnosis, body mass index, ventilatory limitation and EIB. Conclusion: Children with controlled mild-to-moderate asthma are less tolerant to strenuous exercise than their healthy peers. The decreased exercise capacity in this population should mainly be attributed to physical deconditioning, while the contribution of ventilatory limitation and EIB is rather small.","output":"Exercise Limitation in Children and Adolescents with Mild-to-Moderate Asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fever in infections correlates with inflammation, macrophage infiltration into the affected organ, macrophage activation, and release of cytokines involved in immune response, hematopoiesis, and homeostatic processes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the canonical cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 together with angiotensin receptor types 1 and 2 and ACE2 are components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Exacerbated production of cytokines, mainly IL-6, points to macrophages as key to understand differential COVID-19 severity. SARS-CoV-2 may modulate macrophage-mediated inflammation events by altering the balance between angiotensin II, which activates angiotensin receptor types 1 and 2, and angiotensin 1-7 and alamandine, which activate MAS proto-oncogene and MAS-related D receptors, respectively. In addition to macrophages, lung cells express RAS components; also, some lung cells are able to produce IL-6.

Traditional courses mainly use lecture\\\\based instruction without providing sufficient opportunities for students to practice and interact with the teacher; therefore, it is difficult to deliver such up\\\\to\\\\date knowledge via traditional instruction, not to mention fostering students' critical thinking. In this study, the Mobile technologyCsupported Decision, Reflection and Exercise (MDRE) model is proposed to address this problem. Moreover, a learning system is developed based on the proposed approach. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a quasi\\\\experiment was conducted in a university with a two\\\\group pretest posttest design to assess participants' learning achievement, critical thinking and learning satisfaction. The participants were two classes of undergraduate students. One class with 37 students was the experimental group learning with the MDRE learning approach, whereas the other class with 37 students was the control group learning with the conventional technology\\\\based learning approach. Analysis of covariance was performed to evaluate the effect of the intervention on the target outcomes. It was found that the experimental group showed better learning achievement, critical thinking and learning satisfaction than the control group. This implies that the MDRE approach has good potential in helping learners think from diverse perspectives and promoting their learning performance and engagement, which is important in higher education aimed at fostering students' competence of acquiring up\\\\to\\\\date knowledge for solving problems.

The advancement of mobile and wireless communication technologies provides opportunities for students to acquire up\\\\to\\\\date information for solving problems. In the conventional technology\\\\enhanced professional learning mode, instructors generally use computers to present learning content and exemplary cases. In such a learning mode, learners have few opportunities to think in depth. : A Mobile technologyCsupported Decision, Reflection and Exercise (MDRE) approach is proposed to guide students to make decisions and think from diverse perspectives via acquiring up\\\\to\\\\date information using a mobile application. An experiment was conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental results showed that the MDRE approach is able to boost students' creative thinking tendency and learning satisfaction as well as promoting their learning achievement. : The MDRE approach has great potential for professional training aiming to foster students' learning achievement, critical thinking and learning satisfaction. It is suggested that researchers and school teachers can apply the MDRE approach to other professional courses, such as nursing training programs and business planning courses.","output":"An MDRE approach to promoting students' learning performances in the era of the pandemic: A quasi\\\\experimental design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ebselen is an organoselenium compound exhibiting hydroperoxide- and peroxynitrite-reducing activity, acting as a glutathione peroxidase and peroxiredoxin enzyme mimetic.

To achieve deep decarbonisation, recent scholarship identifies the crucial role of broad policy mixes that create reinforcing effects between climate and energy policies to trigger technological innovation, restrict polluting activities, promote green growth, and ensure just energy transitions. Drawing on this literature, the article explores the conditions for developing such policy mixes in the US context in three policy phases. How and why have key policy conditions developed differently in the climate- and energy policy fields, and to what effect for decarbonisation policies? The analysis shows that growing political polarisation blocked bipartisan agreement, produced negative policy feedback, and caused instability in the climate policy field, whereas these mechanisms did not dominate the energy policy field. A more bipartisan approach to renewable energy policy allowed long-term experience and positive feedback in energy-policy programmes that helped to trigger technology innovation and subsequent GHG emissions cuts. Different policy conditions within these policy fields discouraged a coupling between them that could have facilitated green-growth policies. The economic shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic may potentially change policy conditions and build a path to deep US decarbonisation in the future, but only if political polarisation on climate change can be overcome.","output":"The United States: conditions for accelerating decarbonisation in a politically divided country"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pada akhir bulan desember 2019 sampai awal januari 2021 ini, di Indonesia masih adanya wabah pandemic COVID-19.

With increased use of these medications, physicians need to become knowledgeable of these drugs' neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions with psychiatric medications. OBJECTIVE: Clarify evidence base regarding the psychiatric side effects and psychiatric drug interactions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. METHODS: A literature review was performed in PubMed from 1950 to 2020 regarding psychiatric topics and targeted pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. RESULTS: First, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may mildly inhibit CYP2D6 metabolism of psychiatric medications, and psychiatric medications that interfere with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity could alter chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels. Second, they may prolong the QT interval, warranting caution with concomitant prescription of other QT prolonging agents. Finally, neuropsychiatric side effects are very uncommon but possible and include a potentially prolonged phenomenon of \\"psychosis after chloroquine.\\" Hydroxychloroquine has less information available about its neuropsychiatric side effects than chloroquine, with psychosis literature limited to several case reports. Weak evidence suggests a possible association of hydroxychloroquine exposure and increased suicidal ideation. It is not clear whether patients with psychiatric illness are more vulnerable to neuropsychiatric sequela of these medications; however, overdose of these medications by suicidal patients has high risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: The risk of neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for coronavirus disease-2019 treatment is not known. Best practice may include suicide risk assessment for patients treated with hydroxychloroquine. However, delirium is expected to be a more likely etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in critically ill patients treated for coronavirus disease-2019, and adjustment disorder is a much more likely etiology of anxiety and depression symptoms than the side effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.","output":"Psychiatric Aspects of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine Treatment in the Wake of Coronavirus Disease-2019: Psychopharmacological Interactions and Neuropsychiatric Sequelae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global public health crisis, causing social and economic disasters in many countries In China, two-consecutive negative results of nucleic acid tests for SARS-CoV-2 from the respiratory samples are required to end the quarantine of COVID-19 patients However, clinicians face a dilemma in case of patients with long-term viral shedding This report described an unusual COVID-19 case who had persistent viral RNA positivity for more than 4 months after initial illness in the presence of low neutralizing antibodies, but without prolonged clinical symptoms Multiple anti-viral drug treatments had no impact and there was no evidence of re-infection When the patient was self-quarantined at home, no infection occurred to the three family members living with her for 15 to 19 days Sputum viral culture in BSL-3 laboratory on the 102 (nd) day after symptom onset was negative From the 129 (th) day on, 8 continuous nucleic acid tests of sputum samples showed negative results The patient was discharged on 137 (th) days since symptom onset In conclusion, viral RNA shedding in the sputum of the COVID-19 patient may last over 4 months As no evidence shows the existence of infectious virus, two-consecutive negative nucleic acid tests may not be the prerequisite for ending quarantine of COVID-19 patients with prolonged viral shedding","output":"An unusual COVID-19 case with over four months of viral shedding in the presence of low neutralizing antibodies: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has led to dramatic societal changes.

The COVID-19 global pandemic has necessitated increased use of telehealth, but one limitation of telehealth is the inability to collect respiratory specimens. We initiated a protocol for at-home collection of oropharyngeal (OP) swabs from children with CF. METHODS: Home respiratory specimen collection was offered during telehealth encounters. Home OP swab kits were sent to participating families via mail with instructions for collection and return. Specimens were returned by overnight shipping or dropped off at a hospital lab for processing and culture. We evaluated demographic data and compared culture results from the home-collected specimen to the most recent specimen collected in clinic. We also tracked the frequency of newly identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: Home OP swab kits were sent to families of 33 children with CF (range 1.5-19 years). OP swab kits were successfully returned from 19 children (range 1.5-19 years). One or more CF pathogens grew from 79% of the specimens. For four individuals, the home collected specimen demonstrated the new growth of P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Home collection of OP swabs for bacterial culture is feasible in children with CF across a range of ages.

However, we do not sufficiently know whether inequalities are related to social characteristics of communities, such as collective engagement. We tested whether neighborhood social cohesion is associated with inequalities in COVID-19 diagnosis rate and the extent the association varies across neighborhood racial composition. We calculated COVID-19 diagnosis rates in Philadelphia, PA, per 10,000 general population across 46 ZIP codes, as of April 2020. Social cohesion measures were from the Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Survey, 2018. We estimated Poisson regressions to quantify associations between social cohesion and COVID-19 diagnosis rate, testing a multiplicative interaction with Black racial composition in the neighborhood, which we operationalize via a binary indicator of ZIP codes above vs. below the city-wide average (41%) Black population. Two social cohesion indicators were significantly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis. Associations varied across Black neighborhood racial composition (p <0.05 for the interaction test). In ZIP codes with &#8805;41% of Black people, higher collective engagement was associated with an 18% higher COVID-19 diagnosis rate (IRR=1.18, 95%CI=1.11, 1.26). In contrast, areas with <41% of Black people, higher engagement was associated with a 26% lower diagnosis rate (IRR=0.74, 95%CI=0.67, 0.82).

Due to the limited detection facilities, especially in developing countries, a large number of suspected cases can only receive common clinical diagnosis rather than more effective detections like Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests or CT scans. This motivates us to develop a quick screening method via common clinical diagnosis results. However, the diagnostic items of different patients may vary greatly, and there is a huge variation in the dimension of the diagnosis data among different suspected patients, it is hard to process these indefinite dimension data via classical classification algorithms. To resolve this problem, we propose an Indefiniteness Elimination Network (IE-Net) to eliminate the influence of the varied dimensions and make predictions about the COVID-19 cases. The IE-Net is in an encoder-decoder framework fashion, and an indefiniteness elimination operation is proposed to transfer the indefinite dimension feature into a fixed dimension feature. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on the public available COVID-19 Clinical Spectrum dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed indefiniteness elimination operation greatly improves the classification performance, the IE-Net achieves 94.80% accuracy, 92.79% recall, 92.97% precision and 94.93% AUC for distinguishing COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 cases with only common clinical diagnose data.

The mini review provides some insights into the role of supine and prone body positions and summarises the latest understanding of the responsible mechanisms. The scope for discussion is outside the neonatal period and entirely based on experimental and clinical experiences related to adults. The human respiratory system is a complex interplay of many different variables. Therefore, this mini review has prioritised previous and ongoing research to find explanations based on three scientific areas: gravity, lung structure and fractal geometry and vascular regulation. It concludes that gravity is one of the variables responsible for ventilation/perfusion matching but in concert with lung structure and fractal geometry, ventilation and regulation of lung vascular tone. Since ventilation distribution does not change between supine and prone positions, the higher expression of nitric oxide in dorsal lung vessels than in ventral vessels is likely to be the most important mechanism behind enhanced oxygenation in the prone position.","output":"Using the prone position could help to combat the development of fast hypoxia in some patients with COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We read with great interest the article by Veraldi et Al. on the relationship between Pityriasis Rosea (PR) and Covid 19 infection (1). In response to the above mentioned article we would like to share our experience on a case of Pityriasis Rosea diagnosed after Covid 19 infection with atypical clinical presentation and low responsiveness to conventional treatments. Pityriasis rosea of Gibert (PR) is an erythematous-papulosquamous dermatosis that frequently occurs in young adults; it is a common self-limiting rash,with a typical duration of 6-8 weeks (2). It usually starts with a herald patch on the trunk and progresses along the langer lines to a generalized rash over the trunk and limbs, giving it a \\"Christmas tree\\" appearance. The diagnosis is usually based on clinical and physical examinations findings (3). The etiopathogenesis of PR is still unknown, but it may be associated with upper respiratory tract infections. (3) Particularly, a viral etiology was proposed since intranuclear and intracytoplasmic virus-like particles were observed through microscopy; the most common viruses linked to PR are human herpesvirus-6 and -7 (HHV-6 and -7) (3-4). It has been recently proposed that a new viral trigger of PR may be the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1,4).

They have garnered great interest regarding their potential benefit to limit COVID-19 infections due to fewer people living, working, visiting, and being admitted to Green House/small NHs, and private rooms and bathrooms, but this assumption has not been tested. If they prove advantageous compared to other NHs, they may constitute an especially promising model as policy makers and providers reinvent NHs post-COVID. Design This cohort study compared rates of COVID-19 infections, COVID-19 admissions/readmissions, and COVID-19 mortality, among Green House/small NHs to rates in other NHs between 1/20/20-7/31/20. Setting and Participants All Green House homes that held a skilled nursing license and received Medicaid or Medicare payment were invited to participate; other small NHs that replicate Green House physical design and operational practices were eligible if they had the same licensure and payer sources. Of 57 organizations, 43 (75%) provided complete data, which included 219 NHs. Comparison NHs (referred to as traditional NHs) were up to five most geographically proximate NHs within 100 miles that had <50 beds and 50 beds for which data were available from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Because Veterans Administration organizations are not required to report to CMS, they were not included. Methods Rates per 1000 resident days were derived for COVID-19 cases and admissions, and per 100 COVID-19 positive cases for mortality. A log-rank test compared rates between Green House/small NHs and traditional NHs with <50 beds and 50 beds. Results Rates of all outcomes were significantly lower in Green House/small NHs than in traditional NHs that had <50 beds and 50 beds (log-rank test p<0.025 for all comparisons). The median (middle value) rates of COVID-19 cases per 1000 resident days were 0 in both Green House/small NHs and NHs <50 beds, while they were 0.06 in NHs 50 beds; in terms of COVID-19 mortality, the median rates per 100 positive residents were 0 (GH/small NHs), 10 (<50 beds), and 12.5 (50 beds). Differences were most marked in the highest quartile: 25% of Green House/small NHs had COVID-19 case rates per 1000 resident days higher than 0.08, with the corresponding figures for other NHs being 0.15 (<50 beds) and 0.74 (50 beds). Conclusions and Implications COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates are less in Green House/small NHs than rates in traditional NHs with <50 and 50-beds, especially among the higher and extreme values.

This report provides an overview of the interventions implemented at Montefiore and provides preliminary insights on the utilization and value of these ongoing services. OUTCOMES: The interventions instituted at Montefiore included psychoeducational resources, a phone support line, Staff Support Centers (SSCs), a clinical treatment program, team support sessions, peer support outreach, mental health and wellness programs, and clergy support. The most heavily used service during the pandemic were the SSCs, and the least used service was the clergy support. INSIGHTS: With institutional encouragement and the collective efforts of more than 150 mental health professionals and other staff, it was possible to set up durable mental health supports with multiple points of access. Although many services were available to both clinical and nonclinical staff, outreach was primarily to clinical staff. Additional efforts in the future are needed to more fully reach nonclinical frontline workers.

It must be noted that the evidence in humans is preliminary and limited by the small sample size. More studies in large-scale populations are needed to confirm if it raises the risk of sequelae in humans. In addition, we strongly support the application of dexamethasone as a pharmaceutical therapy in pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 before a better therapy is developed.

This study investigated how these restrictive measures have impacted sleep quality, timing, and psychological difficulties in school-age children and their mothers during the lockdown. METHODS: In an online survey, 299 mothers reported their sleep habits, experience of time, and psychological difficulties as well as those of their children (6-10 years old) during and, retrospectively, before the lockdown. RESULTS: During the lockdown, children showed a marked delay in sleep timing-that is, later bedtime and rise time-and a mild worsening in sleep quality. They were less prone to respect daily routines or to keep track of the passage of time. They showed increased emotional, conduct, and hyperactive symptoms, and the increase in these psychological difficulties was predicted by the change in sleep quality, boredom, and mothers' psychological difficulties. In addition, mothers showed a delayed sleep timing and worsening of sleep quality during the lockdown, in varying degrees depending on their working conditions. Mothers who kept working regularly outside their homes during lockdown reported more regular sleep patterns, whereas mothers who stopped working showed more emotional symptoms and relevant changes in their perception of time. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, given the evidence of the adverse behavioral and psychological impact of home confinement and social restrictions, effective measures needed to be in place to mitigate long-term effects on children and their mothers, especially those who have had to stop working during lockdown.","output":"Sleep and Psychological Difficulties in Italian School-Age Children During COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The comorbidities and clinical signs of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have been reported mainly as descriptive statistics, rather than quantitative analysis even in very large investigations The aim of this study was to identify specific patients' characteristics that may modulate the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A pooled analysis was performed on high-quality epidemiological studies to quantify the prevalence (%) of comorbidities and clinical signs in hospitalized COVID-19 patients Pooled data were used to calculate the relative risk (RR) of specific comorbidities by matching the frequency of comorbidities in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with those of general population RESULTS: The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular diseases The RR of COVID-19 hospitalization was significantly (P&lt;0 05) reduced in patients with asthma (0 86, 0 77-0 97) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (0 46, 0 40-0 52) The most frequent clinical signs were fever and cough CONCLUSION: The clinical signs of hospitalized COVID-19 patients are similar to those of other infective diseases Patients with asthma or COPD were at lower risk of hospitalization This paradoxical evidence could be related with the protective effect of inhaled corticosteroids that are administered worldwide to most asthmatic and COPD patients","output":"Reduced risk of COVID-19 hospitalization in asthmatic and COPD patients: a benefit of inhaled corticosteroids?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this manuscript, we highlight the virtual Future Ready Lab as one example of an innovative internship concept designed to increase the quantity of meaningful paid internship experiences available for students to participate in, prepare for further education, and be able to compete in the 21st Century workforce.

The consequences for global mental health due to COVID-19 are likely to be significant and may have a long-term impact on the global burden of disease. Besides physical vulnerability, pregnant women are at increased risk of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder due to the consequences of social distancing. It can result in altered healthcare routines, less support from the family and friends, and in some cases, partners not being allowed to be present during prenatal visits, labour and delivery. Higher than expected, rates of perinatal anxiety and depression have been already reported during the pandemic. Pregnant women may also feel insecure and worried about the effects of COVID-19 on their unborn child if they get infected during pregnancy. Today, young urban women are used to using internet services frequently and efficiently. Therefore, providing mental health support to pregnant women via internet may be effective in ameliorating their anxiety/depression, reducing the risk of serious mental health disorders, and lead to improved maternal and perinatal outcomes. OVERARCHING AIM: Our aim is to explore the effectiveness of a web-based psychosocial peer-to-peer support intervention in reducing the risk and severity of perinatal mental health disorders and preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women living in metropolitan urban settings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We plan to conduct a multicentre prospective randomised controlled trial, Mental health of Urban Mothers trial. Pregnant women living in large metropolitan cities will be recruited using internet-based application through non-profit organisations websites. The women who consent will be randomised to receive a web-based peer-to-peer support intervention or usual care. Data will be analysed to identify the effects of intervention on Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score and Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 scores as well as pregnancy outcomes. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on maternal stress will be assesed using Impact Event Scale-R. Any differences in outcomes between cities will be addressed in subgroup analyses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study will be conducted according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice and will follow the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol has been approved by the ethical review board of Chinese University of Hong Kong (IRB number 2019-8170) and Shanghai Center for Womens and Childrens Health (international review board (IRB) number 2020-F001-12).

Early hearing detection, intervention, and monitoring are important in mitigating the impact of permanent childhood hearing loss. Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a leading cause of hearing loss. The purpose of this review was to synthesize the evidence on the association between CMV infection and permanent childhood hearing loss. DESIGN We performed a systematic review and examined scientific literature from the following databases: MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid MEDLINE(R), Embase, and CINAHL. The primary outcome was permanent bilateral or unilateral hearing loss with congenital onset or onset during childhood (birth to 18 years). The secondary outcome was progressive hearing loss. We included studies reporting data on CMV infection. Randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, nonrandomized comparative and noncomparative studies, and case series were considered. Data were extracted and the quality of individual studies was assessed with the Qualitative Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies (McMaster University). The quality and strength of the evidence were graded using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). A narrative synthesis was completed. RESULTS Sixty-five articles were included in the review. Prevalence of hearing loss at birth was over 33% among symptomatic CMV-infected newborns and less than 15% in asymptomatic infections. This difference in prevalence was maintained during childhood with more than 40% prevalence reported for symptomatic and less than 30% for asymptomatic CMV. Late-onset and progressive hearing loss appear to be characteristic of congenital CMV infections. Definitions of hearing loss, degree of loss, and reporting of laterality varied across studies. All degrees and both bilateral and unilateral loss were reported, regardless of symptomatic and asymptomatic status at birth, and no conclusions about the characteristics of hearing loss could be drawn. Various patterns of hearing loss were reported including stable, progressive, and fluctuating, and improvement in hearing (sometimes to normal hearing) was documented. These changes were reported in children with symptomatic/asymptomatic congenital CMV infection, presenting with congenital/early onset/late-onset hearing loss and in children treated and untreated with antiviral medication. CONCLUSIONS Symptomatic and asymptomatic congenital CMV infection should be considered a risk factor for hearing loss at birth and during childhood and for progressive hearing loss. Therefore, CMV should be included as a risk factor in screening and surveillance programs and be taken into account in clinical follow-up of children with hearing loss.","output":"Cytomegalovirus-A Risk Factor for Childhood Hearing Loss: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interferon\\\\inducible transmembrane proteins 1, 2 and 3 (IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3) have recently been identified as potent antiviral effectors that function to suppress the entry of a broad range of enveloped viruses and modulate cellular tropism independent of viral receptor expression.

Novel coronavirus called COVID-19 is a newly emerged virus that appeared in many countries of the world, but the actual source of the virus is not yet known. The outbreak has caused pandemic with 26,622,706 confirmed infections and 874,708 reported deaths worldwide till August 31, 2020, with 17,717,911 recovered cases. Currently, there exist no vaccines officially approved for the prevention or management of the disease, but alternative drugs meant for HIV, HBV, malaria and some other flus are used to treat this virus. In the present paper, a fractional-order epidemic model with two different operators called the classical Caputo operator and the AtanganaCBaleanuCCaputo operator for the transmission of COVID-19 epidemic is proposed and analyzed. The reproduction number [Formula: see text] is obtained for the prediction and persistence of the disease. The dynamic behavior of the equilibria is studied by using fractional RouthCHurwitz stability criterion and fractional La Salle invariant principle. Special attention is given to the global dynamics of the equilibria. Moreover, the fitting of parameters through least squares curve fitting technique is performed, and the average absolute relative error between COVID-19 actual cases and the models solution for the infectious class is tried to be reduced and the best fitted values of the relevant parameters are achieved. The numerical solution of the proposed COVID-19 fractional-order model under the Caputo operator is obtained by using generalized AdamsCBashforthCMoulton method, whereas for the AtanganaCBaleanuCCaputo operator, we have used a new numerical scheme. Also, the treatment compartment is included in the population which determines the impact of alternative drugs applied for treating the infected individuals.

Quite unexpectedly, hospitals and health care workers became facilitators of disease diffusion. This experience has demonstrated the need for a comprehensive disease control strategy. AIMS The aims are threefold. First, to examine the subtle and changing spatial characteristics of SARS during the short but critical period of its rapid spread in the Greater Toronto Area. Second, to make salient three paradoxes, and their associated dilemmas, faced by nurses and other health care professionals challenged with caring for the sick and containing the rapid spread of the disease. Third, to propose some ways of approaching these dilemmas, as well as some broader preventative and mitigating strategies. METHODS The crosscutting concepts of 'clinical uncertainty' and 'flow of human contacts' are used to explain disease transmission characteristics and urban spatial diffusion and to guide the particular strategies developed. Evidence for the paper comes from public health records, governmental and non-governmental health statements and the initial epidemiological research on SARS. Direct insights are also gained from recent first-hand experiences of Toronto's health care system during the crisis. DISCUSSION The concepts of clinical uncertainty and the flow of human contacts provide in-depth insights that complement the findings of large-scale epidemiological studies, and help operationalize their general calls for enhanced control measures. The comprehensive disease control strategy proposed includes the creation of a hospital infrastructure specific to the containment of biological threats; an advisory coalition of disease control specialists; the development of a biological threat-and-containment simulation laboratory and three specific programmes in patient safety, risk assessment and community mobilization. CONCLUSION It is argued that containment alone, while a necessary and urgent priority, cannot be seen as an end in itself and might better be understood as one possible trajectory within a comprehensive problem-solving strategy. The experiences in Toronto may offer insights to other cities and countries that currently lack such strategies and hence may be vulnerable to similar outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases.","output":"The urban geography of SARS: paradoxes and dilemmas in Toronto's health care."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the scientific community has been focusing on combating novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic, we also want to draw your attention to this Special Issue of Vaccines entitled Influenza Virus and Vaccine Development [ ]","output":"Research Updates for Influenza Virus and Vaccine Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) enter cells via two distinct pathways: the endosomal pathway using cathepsins to activate spike protein and the cell-surface or early endosome pathway using extracellular proteases such as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2).

Thus, patients where ischemia leads to tissue loss should be a major concern. METHODS: The months of March to June 2019 and 2020 were compared to each other at 4 Denver area hospitals. Reduction in overall ED visits and an increase in patient refusal for emergency transport were clear in the data collected. During this period in 2019, 49 MI and 90 stroke patients were admitted. In 2020 this was 40 and 90 respectively. All were matched for age and gender. For MI patients ejection fraction and door to EKG and intervention times were measured. For stroke patients last known well time, time to evaluation, and modified Rankin scores were measured. RESULTS: 254 (8.12%) patients refused emergency services transportation before the pandemic compared to 479 (18.35%) during the pandemic (p-value <0.001, chi square test). In the MI cohort, no significant difference was detected in measured ejection fraction (48% vs 49% p-value = 0.682). Additionally, no significant difference was detected between door to EKG time or door to MI intervention time. During the pandemic 8 (22%) expired with an MI prior to discharge, compared to 2 (4%) before the pandemic. The stroke cohort Door to Evaluation Time, Time since last well known, and modified Rankin scores were all found to have insignificant differences. DISCUSSION: ED volume was significantly lower during the early stages of the pandemic. During this time however only death from cardiac events increased, in spite of similar ejection fractions at discharge. The cause of this remains unclear as ejection fraction similarities make it less attributable to loss of tissue than to other factors.

METHODS This was a retrospective review of SLN data (anatomical location, count and laterality) in patients with early-stage cervical cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IA1 with lymphovascular space invasion to stage IIA) using intraoperative gamma probe and blue dye. The preoperative single-photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography was used to detect laterality, number of the SLNs, and rare locations. Patients were treated between January 2005 to January 2015 at the West Kent Gynaecological Oncology Centre, Maidstone Hospital, Maidstone, United Kingdom. RESULTS A total of 132 women were investigated. The most common SLN location was the external iliac (38.6%) followed by obturator (25.3%) and internal iliac (23.6%) regions. A small percentage was identified in presacral (1.4%) and para-aortic regions (0.7%). Older age (P = 0.01) and an elevated body mass index (P = 0.03) were associated with decreased SLN count by preoperative single-photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography, and only age affected SLN count by gamma probe (P = 0.01). Initial surgery, large loop excision of the transformation zone, or cone biopsy of the cervix had no effect on SLN count. There was no difference observed in bilateral detection with respect to surgical approach (open: n = 48/laparoscopic: n = 84). However, older age was independently associated with a decrease in bilateral SLN detection (P = 0.003). In these patients who underwent unilateral full pelvic lymphadenectomy, all the nonsentinel nodes were negative. CONCLUSIONS The majority of SLNs were located in the external iliac, obturator, and internal iliac regions. Both older age and an elevated body mass index were associated with a reduced SLN count. Unilateral detection of SLN was independently associated with older age, which may be due to sclerosis in the lymphatic vessels or reduced perfusion in the pelvis in these women. If no SLN is detected on one side, the consensus is to perform a full pelvic lymphadenectomy on that side of the pelvis.","output":"Location of Sentinel Lymph Node in Cervical Carcinoma and Factors Associated With Unilateral Detection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We previously introduced PCPS (Proteasome Cleavage Prediction Server), a web-based tool to predict proteasome cleavage sites using n-grams. Here, we evaluated the ability of PCPS immunoproteasome cleavage model to discriminate CD8+ T cell epitopes. RESULTS: We first assembled an epitope dataset consisting of 844 unique virus-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes and their source proteins. We then analyzed cleavage predictions by PCPS immunoproteasome cleavage model on this dataset and compared them with those provided by a related method implemented by NetChop web server. PCPS was clearly superior to NetChop in term of sensitivity (0.89 vs. 0.79) but somewhat inferior with regard to specificity (0.55 vs. 0.60). Judging by the Mathew's Correlation Coefficient, PCPS predictions were overall superior to those provided by NetChop (0.46 vs. 0.39). We next analyzed the power of C-terminal cleavage predictions provided by the same PCPS model to discriminate CD8+ T cell epitopes, finding that they could be discriminated from random peptides with an accuracy of 0.74. Following these results, we tuned the PCPS web server to predict CD8+ T cell epitopes and predicted the entire SARS-CoV-2 epitope space.

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes several proteins that are essential for multiplication and pathogenesis. The main protease (Mpro or 3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a central role in its pathogenesis and thus is considered as an attractive drug target for the drug design and development of small-molecule inhibitors. We have employed an extensive structure-based high-throughput virtual screening to discover potential natural compounds from the ZINC database which could inhibit the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. Initially, the hits were selected on the basis of their physicochemical and drug-like properties. Subsequently, the PAINS filter, estimation of binding affinities using molecular docking, and interaction analyses were performed to find safe and potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We have identified ZINC02123811 (1-(3-(2,5,9-trimethyl-7-oxo-3-phenyl-7H-furo[3,2-g]chromen-6-yl)propanoyl)piperidine-4-carboxamide), a natural compound bearing appreciable affinity, efficiency, and specificity towards the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The identified compound showed a set of drug-like properties and preferentially binds to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to evaluate the conformational dynamics, stability and interaction mechanism of Mpro with ZINC02123811. MD simulation results indicated that Mpro with ZINC02123811 forms a stable complex throughout the trajectory of 100 ns.

Ultrasound is sensitive to pleural and subpleural abnormalities, which suggests a great potential diagnostic role given the predilection for COVID-19 in peripheral subpleural regions.This paper reviews the current evidence and discusses the problems with specificity and scoring.","output":"Point of care lung ultrasound in COVID-19: hype or hope?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Understanding the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is urgently required given its policy implications in relation to the reopening of schools and intergenerational contacts. METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of studies that investigated the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We synthesized evidence for four categories: 1) studies reporting documented cases of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by infected children; 2) studies presenting indirect evidence on the potential of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) children; 3) studies reporting cluster outbreaks of COVID-19 in schools; 4) studies estimating the proportions of children infected by SARS-CoV-2, and reported results narratively. RESULTS: A total of 16 unique studies were included for narrative synthesis. There is limited evidence detailing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected children. We found two studies that reported a 3-month-old whose parents developed symptomatic COVID-19 seven days after caring for the infant and two children who may have contracted COVID-19 from the initial cases at a school in New South Wales. In addition, we identified six studies presenting indirect evidence on the potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission by children, three of which found prolonged virus shedding in stools. There is little data on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools. We identified only two studies reporting outbreaks of COVID-19 in school settings and one case report of a child attending classes but not infecting any other pupils or staff. Lastly, we identified six studies estimating the proportion of children infected; data from population-based studies in Iceland, Italy, South Korea, Netherlands, California and a hospital-based study in the UK suggest children may be less likely to be infected. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results from population-based and school-based studies suggest that children may be less frequently infected or infect others, however current evidence is limited. Prolonged faecal shedding observed in studies highlights the potentially increased risk of faeco-oral transmission in children. Further seroprevalence studies (powered adequately for the paediatric population) are urgently required to establish whether children are in fact less likely to be infected compared to adults. NOTE: We plan to update this rapid review as new data becomes available.

This paper aims at analysing primarily the current situations of Bangladesh and predicting infections and deaths for moderated term intervals by a proposed projection technique called Infection Trajectory-Pathway Strategy (ITPS) and for short term intervals prediction for total infections, deaths along with total number of severe patients and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients by polynomial regression modeling approach. Since April 7, Bangladesh has started to face critical situations as the number of infections has accelerated very fast in the following days. However, the fatality rate decreases considerably from 15.7 on April 1 to 4.9 on April 14, which is still high among the south asian countries. Of the 1012 cases reported on April 14, almost 70\\\\% are the male, 42\\\\% are from the capital Dhaka.

METHODS: Anticipating a surge in patients requiring testing, Beaumont Health implemented curbside testing, operated by a multidisciplinary team of health care workers, including physicians, advanced practice providers, residents, nurses, technicians, and registration staff. We report on the following outcomes over a period of 26 days (March 12, 2020, to April 6, 2020): time to medical decision, time spent documenting electronic medical records, overall screening time, and emergency center return evaluations. RESULTS: In total, 2782 patients received curbside services. A nasopharyngeal swab was performed on 1176 patients (41%), out of whom 348 (29.6%) tested positive. The median time for the entire process (from registration to discharge) was 28 minutes (IQR 17-44). The median time to final medical decision was 15 minutes (IQR 8-27).

The fragility of these achievements has been shown, however, by the resurgence of measles since 2016. We describe trends in routine measles vaccine coverage at national and district level, SIA performance and demographic changes in the three regions with the highest measles burden. FINDINGS: WHO-UNICEF estimates of immunization coverage show that global coverage of the first dose of measles vaccine has stabilized at 85% from 2015 to 19. In 2000, 17 countries in the WHO African and Eastern Mediterranean regions had measles vaccine coverage below 50%, and although all increased coverage by 2019, at a median of 60%, it remained far below levels needed for elimination. Geospatial estimates show many low coverage districts across Africa and much of the Eastern Mediterranean and southeast Asian regions. A large proportion of children unvaccinated for MCV live in conflict-affected areas with remote rural areas and some urban areas also at risk. Countries with low RI coverage use SIAs frequently, yet the ideal timing and target age range for SIAs vary within countries, and the impact of SIAs has often been mitigated by delays or disruptions. SIAs have not been sufficient to achieve or sustain measles elimination in the countries with weakest routine systems. Demographic changes also affect measles transmission, and their variation between and within countries should be incorporated into strategic planning. CONCLUSIONS: Rebuilding services after the COVID-19 pandemic provides a need and an opportunity to increase community engagement in planning and monitoring services. A broader suite of interventions is needed beyond SIAs. Improved methods for tracking coverage at the individual and community level are needed together with enhanced surveillance.

In particular, an important condition for ?home? use of drugs is the speed of action, the absence of severe side effects, low toxicity, good compatibility with other drugs and a wide therapeutic applicability. Ibuprofen meets these basic requirements, and therefore belongs to the most commonly used molecules in pediatric practice. The question of home use of drugs based on this molecule by parents to lower the temperature in children with acute respiratory diseases remains controversial, because there is an opinion regarding the negative effect of lowering the temperature on the patient's immune response. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the question was generally raised about the negative effect of lowering the temperature with ibuprofen on the prognosis of the disease, caused by the Sars-Cov-2 virus. It is the issues of assessing the benefit-risk ratio for the ibuprofen molecule that this literature review is devoted to. Long-term widespread use experience, numerous studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyzes prove the safety, efficacy and good tolerability of Ibuprofen compared to other medications, including OTC analgesics. Current research suggests that its use may go beyond the usual management of pain and fever in common clinical situations in children. Ibuprofen is not only safe for children at standard dosages, but it is also much safer during accidental or deliberate overdose compared to other analgesics that can lead to fatal consequences if misused.

Of five healthy-volunteer experimental pain studies, two found increased pain, two found decreased pain and one found reduced pain bothersomeness with cannabinoid administration; three demonstrated that cannabinoid co-administration may increase opioid abuse liability. Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found no evidence of opioid-sparing effects of cannabinoids in acute pain. Meta-analysis of four RCTs in patients with cancer pain found no effect of cannabinoid administration on opioid dose (mean difference -3.8 mg, 95% CI -10.97, 3.37) or percentage change in pain scores (mean difference 1.84, 95% CI -2.05, 5.72); five studies found more adverse events with cannabinoids compared with placebo (risk ratio 1.13, 95% CI 1.03, 1.24). Of five controlled chronic non-cancer pain trials; one low-quality study with no control arm, and one single-dose study reported reduced pain scores with cannabinoids. Three RCTs found no treatment effect of dronabinol. Meta-analyses of observational studies found 39% reported opioid cessation (95% CI 0.15, 0.64, I2 95.5%, eight studies), and 85% reported reduction (95% CI 0.64, 0.99, I2 92.8%, seven studies). In summary, preclinical and observational studies demonstrate the potential opioid-sparing effects of cannabinoids in the context of analgesia, in contrast to higher-quality RCTs that did not provide evidence of opioid-sparing effects.","output":"Opioid-sparing effect of cannabinoids for analgesia: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical and clinical studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Summary: In recent months, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread globally, with the United States now reporting the highest number of cases of any country in the world Currently, there are few treatment options available to lessen the health impact of the disease and no vaccines or other prophylactic treatments to curb the spread of the virus [ ] This report answers frequently asked questions about current efforts related to research and development of medical countermeasures, their regulation, and related policy issues Although several efforts are underway, medical product research, development, and approval is a difficult and high-risk endeavor that takes years in typical circumstances In response to COVID-19, this process has been expedited, including through several federal programs and mechanisms covered in this report However, expedited medical product development can carry certain risks, such as a more limited safety profile for new products upon approval COVID-19 (Disease);Vaccines;Health--Testing","output":"Development and Regulation of Medical Countermeasures for COVID-19 (Vaccines, Diagnostics, and Treatments): Frequently Asked Questions [June 25, 2020]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage worldwide, Taiwan has achieved outstanding performance in controlling the spread of the outbreak domestically, earning global appreciation Nurses on the frontlines deserve much of the credit for the ongoing success in fighting against this outbreak in Taiwan Taiwan's success to date is grounded in proactive preparedness and deployment by the government and effective teamwork among government agencies, medical institutions, enterprises, and the public Comprehensive containment strategies and preparedness have allowed nurses to effectively perform their duties and combat the pandemic Nurses safeguard the public's health a myriad of ways, including implementing quarantine measures at air and seaports, conducting fever screenings, delivering inpatient isolation treatments, performing case contact tracing, providing community care services, and operating special chartered-flight services The Taiwan Nurses Association (TWNA) provides vital lead in this pandemic response, advocating for the safety, health and wellbeing of nurses;highlighting the contributions and value of nurses;and enhancing the professional image and status of nurses Furthermore, through its global platform, TWNA shares with peer organizations worldwide the content and efficacy of actions taken by the national government, the contributions of healthcare workers, and the support and encouragement received from the public in COVID-19 containment to demonstrate values of Taiwan and nursing","output":"[The Key Role of Taiwanese Nurses in Combating COVID-19 Pandemic]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted persons with HIV interfering with critical health services for HIV prevention, treatment, and care.

METHODS Phosphorus and magnesium serum concentrations of 130 elite track and field athletes (65 males and 65 females, age range 20-30 years) from the National Athletics Sports Medicine Center database in Thessaloniki, Greece were measured. RESULTS Abnormal results were found in 61 (47%) athletes (32 men and 29 women). In male athletes, serum phosphate was higher than normal in 18% and decreased in 1.5%, whereas serum magnesium concentration was higher in 26%, and lower in 3%. Regarding female athletes, higher serum phosphate and magnesium levels were detected in 26% and 17% respectively, whereas decreased serum magnesium was found in 3%. The most common alterations were higher serum phosphate (29/61, 47%) and magnesium concentrations (28/61, 46%). Abnormalities of serum phosphorus and magnesium concentrations were detected in almost half of the athletes. Hyperphosphataemia and hypermagnesaemia were the most common abnormalities. CONCLUSION The reference intervals used for general population cannot be used for athletes. Given the lack of pathological manifestations, the physiopathological significance of these findings is uncertain.

We sought to compare the efficacy and procedural outcomes in creating an AVF percutaneously using Ellipsys (Avenu Medical) or WavelinQ (Becton Dickinson Medical) with surgery in all patients with kidney failure requiring a permanent AVF for dialysis. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING & STUDY POPULATIONS: All patients requiring a permanent AVF for dialysis. SELECTION CRITERIA FOR STUDIES: We included studies that compared either the Ellipsys device or WavelinQ directly with surgery to create an AVF for long-term dialysis. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently reviewed the studies and extracted the data. Conflicts were resolved with a discussion and approval from the senior author. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Fixed-effects or random-effects models were used to pool the fixed sizes and 95% CIs based on the level of heterogeneity. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference observed between surgical AVF and endovascular AVF when comparing the primary outcomes of procedural success (OR = 1.44; 95% CI, 0.35, 5.88; P = 0.61; I(2) = 0%), complications (OR = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.06, 1.46; P = 0.13; I(2) = 69%), and the secondary outcomes of interest that included follow-up time (mean difference [MD] = ?17.71; 95% CI, ?189.53, 154.12; P = 0.84; I(2) = 94%), failure rate (OR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.21, 5.13; P = 0.97; I(2) = 85%), and time to 2-needle cannulation (MD = ?5.40; 95% CI, ?38.88, 28.08; P = 0.75; I(2) = 0%). However, a statistically significant difference was seen among the 2 groups for procedural time (MD = ?54.25; 95% CI, ?59.78, ?48.71; P < 0.001; I(2) = 98%), number of interventions needed to maintain patency (OR = 1.73; 95% CI, 1.22, 2.45; P < 0.01; I(2) = 94%), and primary patency rate (OR = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.23,0.52; P < 0.001; I(2) = 0%).

It is commonly believed that adaptive immunity drives clearance of viral infections and, thus, dysfunction or viral evasion of adaptive immunity is required for a virus to persist. Type I interferons (IFNs) play pleiotropic roles in the antiviral response, including through innate control of viral replication. Murine norovirus (MNoV) replicates in dendritic cells (DCs) and type I IFN signaling in DCs is important for early control of MNoV replication. We show here that the non-persistent MNoV strain CW3 persists systemically when CD11c positive DCs are unable to respond to type I IFN. Persistence in this setting is associated with increased early viral titers, maintenance of DC numbers, increased expression of DC activation markers and an increase in CD8 T cell and antibody responses. Furthermore, CD8 T cell function is maintained during the persistent phase of infection and adaptive immune cells from persistently infected mice are functional when transferred to Rag1 (-/-) recipients. Finally, increased early replication and persistence are also observed in mixed bone marrow chimeras where only half of the CD11c positive DCs are unable to respond to type I IFN. These findings demonstrate that increased early viral replication due to a cell-intrinsic innate immune deficiency is sufficient for persistence and a functional adaptive immune response is not sufficient for viral clearance.","output":"Type I Interferon Receptor Deficiency in Dendritic Cells Facilitates Systemic Murine Norovirus Persistence Despite Enhanced Adaptive Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The utilization and impact of various ratios of transfusions for pediatric trauma patients (PTPs) receiving a massive transfusion (MT) are unknown. Therefore, we sought to determine the risk for mortality in PTPs receiving an MT of  6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) within 24 h. We compared PRBC: plasma ratio of > 2:1 (Unbalanced Ratios, UR) versus  2:1 (Balanced Ratios, BR), hypothesizing decreased risk of mortality with BR. METHODS: The Trauma Quality Improvement Program was queried (2014C2016) for PTPs receiving a MT. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine risk of mortality. RESULTS: From 239 PTPs receiving an MT, 98 (41%) received an UR, whereas 141 (59%) received a BR. The median ratios, respectively, were 2.7:1 and 1.2:1. Compared to BR patients, UR patients had no differences in injury severity score (ISS), hypotension on admission, and intensive care unit stay (all p > 0.05). The mortality rates for BR and UR were similar (46.1% vs. 52.0%, p = 0.366). Controlling for age, ISS, and severe head injury, UR demonstrated similar risk of mortality compared to BR (p = 0.276). Additionally,  4:1 ratio versus  2:1 showed no difference in associated risk of mortality (p = 0.489). CONCLUSION: In contrast to adult studies, this study demonstrated that MT ratios of > 2:1 and even  4:1 were associated with similar mortality compared to BR for PTPs. These results suggest pediatric MT resuscitation may not require strict BR as has been shown beneficial in adult trauma patients. Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate the optimal ratio for PTP MT resuscitation.

This study aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 patients had characteristic ECG findings in the acute period. METHODS A total of 124 patients were divided into two groups as those diagnosed with COVID-19 and controls. The ECGs of these patients were evaluated in terms of rate, rhythm, presence of ST changes, PR interval, QRS width, QTc and QT interval, and presence of right and left bundle branch blocks. RESULTS On the ECG, the median heart rate of the COVID-19 patients was 104/min (IQR: 99-114), and there was a significant difference compared to the control group (P<0.001). The median PR interval was 157/ms, the QRS width was 86  9/ms in the COVID-19 patients, with no significant difference compared to the controls (P = 0.161 and P = 0.631, respectively). The median QT interval of the COVID-19 patients was normal (400/ms), but a significant difference was detected compared to the controls (P = 0.005). The QTc, ST change, AF, and presence of right and left bundle branch blocks were not significantly different between the two groups.

COVID-19 has taken the lives of more than 2.1 million people worldwide (23), with a global mortality rate of 2.2% (23). Current COVID-19 treatment options include supportive respiratory care, parenteral corticosteroids, and Remdesivir. Although COVID-19 is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with comorbidities, the vulnerability, clinical course, optimal management, and prognosis of COVID-19 infection in patients with organ transplants has not been well described in the literature (9, 13). The treatment of COVID-19 differs, based on the organ(s) transplanted (6). Preliminary data suggested that liver transplant patients with COVID-19 did not have higher mortality rates than untransplanted COVID-19 patients (2). Table 1 depicts a compiled list of current published data on COVID-19 liver transplant patients. Most of these studies included both recent and old liver transplant patients. No distinction was made for early liver transplant patients who contract COVID-19 within their post-transplant hospitalization course. This potential differentiation needs to be further explored (14). Here, we report two patients who underwent liver transplantation who acquired COVID-19 during their post-transplant recovery period in the hospital. Case Descriptions Two patients who underwent liver transplant and contracted COVID-19 in the early post-transplant period. Treated with hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone, tocilizumab and convalescent plasma. Description of their hospital course, including treatment and recovery. Conclusions The management of post-liver transplant patients with COVID\\\\19 infection is complicated. Strict exposure precaution practice following organ transplantation is highly recommended. Widespread vaccination will help with prevention, but there will continue to be patients who contract COVID-19. Therefore, continued research into appropriate treatments is still relevant and critical. A temporary dose reduction of immunosuppression and continued administration of low-dose methylprednisolone, remdesivir, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent plasma might be helpful in the management and recovery of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in post-liver transplant patients.

However, the interaction of these viruses with host cells and the regulation of post-transcriptional genes remains unclear. In this study, we detected and analyzed the comparative transcriptome profiling of SARS-CoV-2, panH1N1 (A/California/07/2009), and H7N9 (A/Shanghai/1/2013) infected cells. The results showed that the commonly upregulated genes among the three groups were mainly involved in autophagy, pertussis, and tuberculosis, which indicated that autophagy plays an important role in viral pathogenicity. There are three groups of commonly downregulated genes involved in metabolic pathways. Notably, unlike panH1N1 and H7N9, SARS-CoV-2 infection can inhibit the m-TOR pathway and activate the p53 signaling pathway, which may be responsible for unique autophagy induction and cell apoptosis. Particularly, upregulated expression of IRF1 was found in SARS-CoV-2, panH1N1, and H7N9 infection.

Mortality was higher in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. In COVID-19, females had lower hemoglobin concentration than males and a higher prevalence of moderate/severe anemia (25% versus 13%, p = 0.032). In most cases, anemia was mild and due to inflammation, sometimes associated with iron and/or vitamin deficiencies. Determinants of hemoglobin concentration included: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum cholinesterase, ferritin and protein concentrations and number of chronic diseases affecting each patient. Hemoglobin concentration was not related to overall survival that was, on the contrary, influenced by red blood cell distribution width, age, lactate dehydrogenase and the ratio of arterial partial oxygen pressure to inspired oxygen fraction.

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the study results. Statistical analysis was performed for comparison of subgroups by physician specialty, city of practice (metro/non-metro), and zone of practice (north/south/east/west). Level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: In all, 780 physicians completed the survey. Of these, 3.97, 53.08, and 42.95% had high, medium, and low level of awareness about influenza/influenza vaccination, respectively. Statistically significant (p < 0.05) between-group differences were found by physician specialty and zone of practice. In terms of attitude toward vaccination of high-risk group subjects, only 0.9% physicians were extremely concerned, while the majority (92.56%) were quite concerned and 6.54% were a little concerned, with no reported significant differences between different subgroups. With regard to practice patterns, 82.82% of physicians offered influenza vaccines to their patients, 32.69% vaccinated 10C25% of patients per month, and 38.85% required and offered the vaccine to their office staff. Physicians' reasons for not prescribing influenza vaccines to patients included fear of side effects (16.54%), cost (15.64%), lack of awareness about availability (15.38%), absence of belief that it is beneficial (14.36%), history of side effects (13.46%), and patients' fear of needles (11.28%).

HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C genotypes of n = 111 deceased patients with COVID-19 (Moscow, Russia) and n = 428 volunteers were identified with next-generation sequencing. Deceased patients were split into two groups according to age at the time of death: n = 26 adult patients aged below 60 and n = 85 elderly patients over 60. With the use of HLA class I genotypes, we developed a risk score (RS) which was associated with the ability to present severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) peptides by the HLA class I molecule set of an individual. The resulting RS was significantly higher in the group of deceased adults compared to elderly adults [p = 0.00348, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC = 0.68)]. In particular, presence of HLA-A(*)01:01 allele was associated with high risk, while HLA-A(*)02:01 and HLA-A(*)03:01 mainly contributed to low risk. The analysis of patients with homozygosity strongly highlighted these results: homozygosity by HLA-A(*)01:01 accompanied early deaths, while only one HLA-A(*)02:01 homozygote died before 60 years of age.

We evaluated antibody binding, avidity maturation, and SARS-CoV-2 VOCs/VOIs virus-neutralizing capacity of convalescent plasma compared with different lots of SAB-185 and individual Tc bovine sera sequentially obtained after each vaccination against Alpha, Epsilon, Iota, Gamma, Beta, Kappa, and Delta variants. In contrast to convalescent plasma, sera and SAB-185 derived from hyperimmunized Tc bovines demonstrated higher antibody avidity and more potent cross-neutralizing activity of VOCs/VOIs. Thus, SAB-185 is a potential promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants.","output":"Increased Antibody Avidity and Cross-Neutralization of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Variants by Hyperimmunized Transchromosomic BovineCDerived Human Immunoglobulins for Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ConspectusSince the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization for two mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, mRNA-based technology has attracted broad attention from the scientific community to investors. When delivered intracellularly, mRNA has the ability to produce various therapeutic proteins, enabling the treatment of a variety of illnesses, including but not limited to infectious diseases, cancers, and genetic diseases. Accordingly, mRNA holds significant therapeutic potential and provides a promising means to target historically hard-to-treat diseases. Current clinical efforts harnessing mRNA-based technology are focused on vaccination, cancer immunotherapy, protein replacement therapy, and genome editing. The clinical translation of mRNA-based technology has been made possible by leveraging nanoparticle delivery methods. However, the application of mRNA for therapeutic purposes is still challenged by the need for specific, efficient, and safe delivery systems.This Account highlights key advances in designing and developing combinatorial synthetic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with distinct chemical structures and properties for in vitro and in vivo intracellular mRNA delivery. LNPs represent the most advanced nonviral nanoparticle delivery systems that have been extensively investigated for nucleic acid delivery. The aforementioned COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and one LNP-based small interfering RNA (siRNA) drug (ONPATTRO) have received clinical approval from the FDA, highlighting the success of synthetic ionizable lipids for in vivo nucleic acid delivery. In this Account, we first summarize the research efforts from our group on the development of bioreducible and biodegradable LNPs by leveraging the combinatorial chemistry strategy, such as the Michael addition reaction, which allows us to easily generate a large set of lipidoids with diverse chemical structures. Next, we discuss the utilization of a library screening strategy to identify optimal LNPs for targeted mRNA delivery and showcase the applications of the optimized LNPs in cell engineering and genome editing. Finally, we outline key challenges to the clinical translation of mRNA-based therapies and propose an outlook for future directions of the chemical design and optimization of LNPs to improve the safety and specificity of mRNA drugs. We hope this Account provides insight into the rational design of LNPs for facilitating the development of mRNA therapeutics, a transformative technology that promises to revolutionize future medicine.","output":"Developing Biodegradable Lipid Nanoparticles for Intracellular mRNA Delivery and Genome Editing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ovid Embase is an important database in systematic searches for health and medical topics.

For many this created a marked shift in design of assessments in an attempt to counteract the lack of invigilation of examinations conducted online.

This review considers the implications of transitioning to online assessment providing practical strategies for achieving authentic assessment of students online, while ensuring standards and accountability against professional accrediting body requirements. The case study presented demonstrates that an online multiple choice assessment provides similar rigor in assessment to invigilated examination of the same concepts in human physiology. Online assessment has the added benefit of enabling rapid and specific feedback to large cohorts of students on their personal performance, allowing students to target their weaker areas for remediation. This has implications for improving both pedagogy and efficiency in assessment of large cohorts where the default is often to assess basic recall knowledge in a multiple choice assessment.

The bacteriophage Phi6 is an enveloped viral surrogate commonly used to study viability. To investigate how viability changes during the evaporation of droplets on polypropylene, we conducted experiments using a fixed initial Phi6 concentration while systematically varying the culture concentration and composition (by amendment with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.08 wt % BSA, or 0.5 wt % SDS). The results were consistent with the well-founded relative humidity (RH) effect on virus viability; however, the measured viability change was greater than that previously reported for droplets containing either inorganic salts or proteins alone, and the protein effects diverged in 1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). We attribute this discrepancy to changes in virus distribution during droplet evaporation that arise due to the variable solute drying patterns (i.e., the \\"coffee-ring\\" effect) that are a function of the droplet biochemical composition. To test this hypothesis, we used surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) imaging and three types of gold nanoparticles (pH nanoprobe, positively charged (AuNPs(+)), and negatively charged (AuNPs(-))) as physical surrogates for Phi6 and determined that lower DMEM concentrations, as well as lower protein concentrations, suppressed the coffee-ring effect. This result was observed irrespective of particle surface charge. The trends in the coffee-ring effect correlate well with the measured changes in virus infectivity.

Chinese herbal injections (CHIs) have been widely used in China as a novel and promising treatment option for sepsis. Therefore, this study assessed and ranked the effectiveness of CHIs to provide more sights for the selection of sepsis treatment. Method: Eight databases were searched from their inception up to September 1, 2021. The methodological quality of included study was evaluated by the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. Then Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed by OpenBUGS 3.2.3 and STATA 14.0 software. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) probability values were applied to rank the examined treatments. Publication bias was reflected by a funnel plot. Results: A total of 50 eligible randomized controlled trials involving 3,394 participants were identified for this analysis. Five CHIs including Shenfu injection, Shenmai injection, Shengmai injection, Shenqifuzheng injection, and Huangqi injection were included. The results of the NMA and sensitivity analysis showed that Shenqifuzheng (MD = ?4.48, 95% CI = ?5.59 to ?3.24), Shenmai (MD = ?3.38, 95% CI = ?4.38 to ?2.39), Shenfu (MD = ?2.38, 95% CI = ?3.03 to ?1.70) and Shengmai (MD = ?1.90, 95% CI = ?3.47 to ?0.31) combined with Western medicine (WM) had a superior effect in improving the APACHE II score.

International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission.

Lastly, it uses a battery of probabilistic folding algorithms that incorporate all positive covariation into one structure. The method, named CaCoFold (Cascade variation/covariation Constrained Folding algorithm), predicts a nested structure guided by a maximal subset of positive basepairs, and recursively incorporates all remaining positive basepairs into alternative helices. The alternative helices can be compatible with the nested structure such as pseudoknots, or overlapping such as competing structures, base triplets, or other 3D non-antiparallel interactions. We present evidence that CaCoFold predictions are consistent with structures modeled from crystallography.","output":"RNA structure prediction using positive and negative evolutionary information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recently, COVID-19 infection has become a public health concern. On March 12th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced it as a global pandemic. Early diagnosis of atypical cases of COVID-19 infection is critical in reducing the transmission and controlling the present pandemic. In the present report, we described a patient with the chief complaints of dyspnea and dry cough referred to the oncology center at Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran, with the differential diagnosis of lung cancer who was diagnosed and treated for COVID-19 infection in follow up. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old patient complained of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea from two weeks ago. The patient had been referred to this center with the differential diagnosis of lung cancer due to the massive pleural effusion in the initial chest CT scan. Dyspnea was the patient's main complaint at the time of admission in this center and the oxygen saturation was 84%. In the new chest CT scan, similar findings were observed. Due to the severe respiratory distress, a chest tube was placed in the chest cavity to remove the pleural effusion fluid on day one. The patient's felt relieved immediately after the procedure; however, the oxygen saturation did not rise above 85% despite the oxygen therapy. The cytology of pleural fluid was negative for malignant cells. On day 2, the lymphopenia and high level of CRP suggested the COVID-19 infection. Therefore, a control chest CT scan was conducted and the test for COVID-19 was performed. The CT report indicated the clear pattern of COVID-19's lung involvement in the absence of pleural effusion. Thus, the treatment for COVID-19 was immediately initiated. On day 4, the test reported positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Currently, it is important to bear in mind the COVID-19 infection in evaluating patients with respiratory symptoms. This report indicated how misleading the presentation of a chest CT scan could be in clinical judgment. Therefore, we recommend ruling out the COVID-19 infection in all the patients with any pattern of lung involvement to avoid missing the potential cases of this vicious infection.","output":"Pleural Effusion as a Sign of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Critically ill COVID-19 patients seem hypermetabolic and difficult to feed enterally, due to gastro-intestinal (GI) symptoms such as high gastric residual volumes (GRV) and diarrhea. Our aim was to describe the association of nutritional intake and GI symptoms during first 14 days of ICU admission. METHODS: Observational study including critically ill adult COVID-19 patients. Data on nutritional intake [enteral nutrition (EN) or parenteral nutrition] and GI symptoms were collected during 14 days after ICU admission. Target energy and protein feeding goals were calculated conform ESPEN guidelines. GI symptoms included GRV (ml/d), vomiting, abdominal distension, and faeces (ml/d). High GRV's were classified as 2 times 150 ml/d and diarrhea as Bristol stool chart 6. GI symptoms were defined as mild if at least one symptom occurred and as moderate when 2 symptoms occurred. Acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) grades of III were classified as GI dysfunction and grades of IV were considered as GI failure with severe impact on distant organs. Linear mixed model analysis was performed to explore the development of nutritional intake and GI symptoms over time at day (D) 0, 4, 10, and 14. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty patients were included [75% male; median age 64 years (IQR 54C70)]. BMI upon admission was 28 kg/m(2) (IQR 25C33), of which 43% obese (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)). Most patients received EN during admission (98% D4; 96% D10-14). Mean energy goals increased from 87% at D4 to 93% D10-14 and protein goals (g/kg) were increasingly achieved during admission (84% D4; 93% D10-14). Presence of moderate GI symptoms decreased (10% D0; 6% D4-10; 5% D14), reversely mild GI symptoms increased. Occurrence of GI dysfunction fluctuated (1% D0; 18% D4; 12% D10; 8% D14) and none of patients developed grade IV GI failure. Development of high GRV fluctuated (5% D0; 23% D4; 14% D10; 8% D14) and occurrence of diarrhea slightly increased during admission (5% D0; 22% D4; 25% D10; 27% D14). Linear mixed models showed only an association between AGI grades III and lower protein intake at day 10 (p = 0.020). CONCLUSION: Occurrence of GI symptoms was limited and seems no major barrier for EN in our group of critically COVID-19 patients. Nutritional intake was just below requirements during the first 14 days of ICU admission. The effect on nutritional status remains to be studied.","output":"Nutritional intake and gastro-intestinal symptoms in critically ill COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Health Care workers (HCW) are an important group affected by this pandemic and COVID-19 has presented substantial challenges for health professionals and health systems in many countries.

With its global impact, COVID-19 has become a major concern of people almost everywhere, and therefore there are a large number of tweets coming out from every corner of the world, about COVID-19 related topics. In this work, we try to analyze the tweets and detect the trending topics and major concerns of people on Twitter, which can enable us to better understand the situation, and devise better planning. More specifically we propose a model based on the universal sentence encoder to detect the main topics of Tweets in recent months. We used universal sentence encoder in order to derive the semantic representation and the similarity of tweets. We then used the sentence similarity and their embeddings, and feed them to K-means clustering algorithm to group similar tweets (in semantic sense). After that, the cluster summary is obtained using a text summarization algorithm based on deep learning, which can uncover the underlying topics of each cluster. Through experimental results, we show that our model can detect very informative topics, by processing a large number of tweets on sentence level (which can preserve the overall meaning of the tweets). Since this framework has no restriction on specific data distribution, it can be used to detect trending topics from any other social media and any other context rather than COVID-19. Experimental results show superiority of our proposed approach to other baselines, including TF-IDF, and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).","output":"Covid-Transformer: Detecting COVID-19 Trending Topics on Twitter Using Universal Sentence Encoder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter focuses on the men behind the scenes; those who make matches and promote events and those who prepare their boxers to fight in them.

Implementation of hypofractionation, however, has moved at a slow pace.

This predictive task is challenging due to the novelty of the virus, limited data, and dynamic political and societal responses. We embed a Bayesian time series model and a random forest algorithm within an epidemiological compartmental model for empirically grounded COVID-19 predictions. The Bayesian case model fits a location-specific curve to the velocity (first derivative) of the log transformed cumulative case count, borrowing strength across geographic locations and incorporating prior information to obtain a posterior distribution for case trajectories. The compartmental model uses this distribution and predicts deaths using a random forest algorithm trained on COVID-19 data and population-level characteristics, yielding daily projections and interval estimates for cases and deaths in U.S. states. We evaluated the model by training it on progressively longer periods of the pandemic and computing its predictive accuracy over 21-day forecasts. The substantial variation in predicted trajectories and associated uncertainty between states is illustrated by comparing three unique locations: New York, Colorado, and West Virginia.

The primary purpose of the study was to compare operative outcomes in the two study groups. Assessment and comparison of functional outcomes in terms of quality of life between groups was also performed. METHODS Prospective data on 130 consecutive patients who underwent randomized SI or CL sleeve gastrectomy were collected between January 2009 to December 2014. Preoperative parameters, outcomes, post-operative functional results and quality of life, according to the short-form SF-36 questionnaire, were evaluated and compared between groups. RESULTS 65 patients underwent conventional laparoscopic (CL) and 65 single incision (SI) sleeve gastrectomy. Operative time, post-operative pain, in-hospital stay, and complications were similar in the two groups. No difference emerged with respect to passage of flatus and resumption of oral intake (p = NS). Cosmetic results were excellent in SI patients with higher satisfaction rates.

Since some patients on contact or droplet precautions require QT-prolonging medications, monitoring the QT interval may become imperative to prevent fatal arrhythmias. To limit the exposure of staff to patients during and even after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and judiciously use personal protective equipment (PPE), it is important to find alternatives to frequent 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG). The objective of this study was to compare QT intervals measured on telemetry to those measured on 12-lead ECG to determine whether telemetry QT interval measurements could be used in place of 12-lead measurements. Methods Simultaneous telemetry recordings via a Philips telemetry monitoring system (Philips Healthcare, Eindhoven, Netherlands) and 12-lead ECGs were obtained from 50 patients. Patients were from cardiac telemetry and cardiac intensive care units. QT interval from the telemetry system was compared to the QT interval on the 12-lead ECG. QT intervals on two telemetry strips were uninterpretable as the termination of the T-wave could not be defined appropriately; therefore, these patients were excluded. Results In 33 of 48 patients (69%), QT intervals from the telemetry studies matched the QT intervals measured by 12-lead ECG. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between telemetry QT and 12-lead ECG QT was 0.887 (95% CI: 0.809-0.934; p<0.001). In 15 of 48 patients (31%), the QT intervals measured from telemetry were different from those measured by 12-lead ECG. These patients either had an abnormal rhythm, conduction abnormalities, or repolarization abnormalities at baseline. Conclusion Telemetry is a suitable alternative for measuring QT intervals in the majority of patients. However, those with baseline ECG abnormalities should have serial 12-lead ECGs.

Identification of this subgroup of patients was crucial for early aggressive intervention to improve survival. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether computer tomography (CT) - derived measurements of body composition such as myosteatosis indicating fat deposition inside the muscles could be used to predict the risk of transition to severe illness in patients with initial diagnosis of mild COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection presenting initially as having the mild common-subtype illness were retrospectively recruited between January 21, 2020 and February 19, 2020. CT-derived body composition measurements were obtained from the initial chest CT images at the level of the twelfth thoracic vertebra (T12) and were used to build models to predict the risk of transition. A myosteatosis nomogram was constructed using multivariate logistic regression incorporating both clinical variables and myosteatosis measurements. The performance of the prediction models was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve including the area under the curve (AUC). The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by discrimination, calibration curve, and decision curve. RESULTS: A total of 234 patients were included in this study. Thirty-one of the enrolled patients transitioned to severe illness. Myosteatosis measurements including SM-RA (skeletal muscle radiation attenuation) and SMFI (skeletal muscle fat index) score fitted with SMFI, age and gender, were significantly associated with risk of transition for both the training and validation cohorts (P < 0.01). The nomogram combining the SM-RA, SMFI score and clinical model improved prediction for the transition risk with an AUC of 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75 to 0.95] for the training cohort and 0.84 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.97] for the validation cohort, as compared to the nomogram of the clinical model with AUC of 0.75 and 0.74 for the training and validation cohorts respectively.

Enhanced computed tomography was performed every 6 months. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Follow-up was censored at 60 months. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS For the 956 HCC tumours, the complete ablation rate with MESS was 98.83% (510/516). During a median of 34 months (IQR, 23-52 months) of follow-up, 171 patients died and 4 were lost to follow-up (15, 30, 38 and 42 months). The cumulative incidence of local tumour progression at 1, 3 and 5 years was 0.39%, 4.96% and 6.66%, respectively, and the 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival was 99.42%, 83.97% and 68.42%, respectively. Tumour size >30 mm was the only parameter that was predictive of local tumour progression (p < .0001). Risk factors associated with overall survival included prothrombin time >14 s, serum AFP levels >200 ng/mL and tumour abutting vessel diameter <5 mm. The complication rate was 1.74%. CONCLUSION MESS RFA is a safe and effective method for HCC treatment. This approach results in a high local progression-free survival for HCC tumours that meet the Milan criteria.","output":"Radiofrequency ablation using a multiple-electrode switching system for hepatocellular carcinoma within the Milan criteria: long-term results."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over 5 million people around the world have tested positive for the beta coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 as of May 29, 2020, a third of which are in the United States alone. These infections are associated with the development of a disease known as COVID-19, which is characterized by several symptoms, including persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, loss of taste or smell, and gastrointestinal distress. COVID-19 has been characterized by elevated mortality (over 100 thousand people have already died in the US alone), mostly due to thromboinflammatory complications that impair lung perfusion and systemic oxygenation in the most severe cases. While the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been associated with the severity of the disease, little is known about the impact of IL-6 levels on the proteome of COVID-19 patients. The present study provides the first proteomics analysis of sera from COVID-19 patients, stratified by circulating levels of IL-6, and correlated to markers of inflammation and renal function. As a function of IL-6 levels, we identified significant dysregulation in serum levels of various coagulation factors, accompanied by increased levels of antifibrinolytic components, including several serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs). These were accompanied by up-regulation of the complement cascade and antimicrobial enzymes, especially in subjects with the highest levels of IL-6, which is consistent with an exacerbation of the acute phase response in these subjects. Although our results are observational, they highlight a clear increase in the levels of inhibitory components of the fibrinolytic cascade in severe COVID-19 disease, providing potential clues related to the etiology of coagulopathic complications in COVID-19 and paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions, such as the use of pro-fibrinolytic agents.

The primary outcome was the time to first adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) (composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) through 12 months. Results: Due to slower than projected enrollment and fewer than projected primary outcome events, enrollment was stopped before the 900 planned participants were accrued. From 3 May 2016 to 16 April 2020, a total of 545 patients from 113 sites across 12 countries were randomized. Baseline characteristics were balanced between study groups. The median age was 73 years, 49.8% had localized prostate cancer; 26.3% had locally advanced disease and 20.4% had metastatic disease. MACE occurred in 15 (5.5%) patients assigned to degarelix and 11 (4.1%) assigned to leuprolide (hazard ratio [HR] 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-2.79; p=0.53). Conclusions: PRONOUNCE is the first, international, randomized clinical trial to prospectively compare the cardiovascular safety of a GnRH antagonist and a GnRH agonist in patients with prostate cancer. The study was terminated prematurely due to smaller than planned number of participants and events and no difference in MACE at 1 year between patients assigned to degarelix or leuprolide was observed.

The RNA solution extracted from nasopharyngeal swab samples of confirmed COVID-19 patients were used and subjected to cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification, sequencing, and analysis of the FCS region. The sequence data from GISAID were also retrieved for further genome analysis. This study included 52 FCS region sequences. Several mutations were identified in the FCS region, i.e., D614G, Q675H, Q677H, S680P, and silent mutation in 235.57 C > T. The most important mutation in the FCS region is D614G. This finding indicated the G614 variant was circulating from May 2020 in those two provinces. Eventually, the G614 variant totally replaced the D614 variant from September 2020. All Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates during this study and those deposited in GISAID showed the formation of five clade clusters from the FCS region, in which the D614 variant is in one specific cluster, and the G614 variant is dispersed into four clusters.

On the basis of the structureCactivity relationships that we have explored, this study aims to incorporate carbamoyl groups to the alcoholic hydroxyl groups of silibinin to improve its capability in selectively suppressing AR-positive prostate cancer cell proliferation together with water solubility. To this end, a feasible approach was developed to regioselectively introduce a carbamoyl group to the secondary alcoholic hydroxyl group at C-3 without causing the undesired oxidation at C2CC3, providing an avenue for achieving 3-O-carbamoyl-5,7,20-O-trimethylsilybins. The application of the synthetic method can be extended to the synthesis of 3-O-carbamoyl-3,4,5,7-O-tetramethyltaxifolins. The antiproliferative potency of 5,7,20-O-trimethylsilybin and its nine 3-carbamoyl derivatives were assessed in an AR-positive LNCaP prostate cancer cell line and two AR-null prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and DU145). Our preliminary bioassay data imply that 5,7,20-O-trimethylsilybin and four 3-O-carbamoyl-5,7,20-O-trimethylsilybins emerge as very promising lead compounds due to the fact that they can selectively suppress AR-positive LNCaP cell proliferation.

So far, chemotherapy has not been totally effective for treatment of the disease. The immunomodulation and tissue repairing capability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), ease of isolation, detection and in-vitro culture, have encouraged the biologists to use MSCs for cell therapy in different infections such as cutaneous leishmaniasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 6-8 week BALB/c mice were infected with L. major and divided into four groups and treated with MSCs, Glucantime, Glucantime + MSCs and PBS. The regression of the lesions, potency of macrophages for phagocytosis, proliferation of immune cells against Leishmania soluble antigen, reduction of spleen parasite burden and healing of the lesions were evaluated on days 10, 20 and 30 of treatment. RESULT: The results indicated that the mice intralesionally injected with MSCs showed a significant regression in the lesions produced by L. major by day 30. Proliferation of the splenocytes stimulated with SLA (Soluble Leishmania Antigen) in-vitro in MSC treated mice on day 20 was significantly higher than those of the other groups. The potency of phagocytosis in macrophages of the mice treated with MSCs was significantly higher by day 30 and healing of the lesions in this group of mice showed more progress in histopathological examinations.

In humans, over prescription of antimicrobials, which is presumably higher during COVID, has been identified as the major source of selection for antimicrobial resistant bacteria; however, use of antimicrobials in food and companion animals, fish, and vegetables, and the environmental resistance gene pool, also play important roles. The possibilities of unnecessary use of antibiotics as prophylaxis during and after COVID in livestock and companion animals exist in low-and middle-income countries. A considerable loss in gross domestic product (GDP) is also projected in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to AMR by the year 2050, which is further going to be reduced due to economic slowdown in the post-COVID period. Veterinary hospitals dedicated to pets have cropped up, especially in urban areas of LMICs where use of antimicrobials has also been increased substantially. The inevitable preventive habit built up during COVID with the frequent use of hand sanitizer might trigger AMR due to the presence of cross-resistance with disinfectants. In LMICs, due to the rising demand for animal protein, industrial food animal production (IFAP) is slowly replacing the small-scale backyard farming system. The lack of stringent regulations and monitoring increased the non-therapeutic use of antimicrobials in industrial farms where the persistence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria has been associated with several factors other than antimicrobial use, such as co-resistance, cross-resistance, bacterial fitness, mixing of new and old animals, and vectors or reservoirs of bacterial infection.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use has also declined. We aimed to quantify the potential effect of COVID-19 on HIV incidence and HIV-related mortality among US MSM. METHODS: We used a calibrated, deterministic, compartmental HIV transmission model for MSM in Baltimore (MD, USA) and available data on COVID-19-related disruptions to HIV services to predict effects of reductions in sexual partners (0%, 25%, 50%), condom use (5%), HIV testing (20%), viral suppression (10%), PrEP initiations (72%), PrEP adherence (9%), and antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiations (50%). In our main analysis, we modelled disruptions due to COVID-19 starting Jan 1, 2020, and lasting 6 months. We estimated the median change in cumulative new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths among MSM over 1 and 5 years, compared with a base case scenario without COVID-19-related disruptions. FINDINGS: A 25% reduction in sexual partners for 6 months among MSM in Baltimore, without HIV service changes, could reduce new HIV infections by median 122% (95% credible interval 117 to 128) over 1 year and median 30% (26 to 34) over 5 years. In the absence of changes in sexual behaviour, the 6-month estimated reductions in condom use, HIV testing, viral suppression, PrEP initiations, PrEP adherence, and ART initiations combined are predicted to increase new HIV infections by median 105% (58 to 165) over 1 year, and by median 35% (21 to 54) over 5 years. Disruptions to ART initiations and viral suppression are estimated to substantially increase HIV-related deaths (ART initiations by median 17% [08 to 32], viral suppression by median 95% [52 to 159]) over 1 year, with smaller proportional increases over 5 years. The other individual disruptions (to HIV testing, PrEP and condom use, PrEP initiation, and partner numbers) were estimated to have little effect on HIV-related deaths (<1% change over 1 or 5 years). A 25% reduction in sexual partnerships is estimated to offset the effect of the combined service disruptions on new HIV infections (change over 1 year: median -39% [-74 to 10]; over 5 years: median 00% [-09 to 14]), but not on HIV deaths (change over 1 year: 110% [62 to 177]; over 5 years: 26% [15 to 43]). INTERPRETATION: Maintaining access to ART and adherence support is of the utmost importance to maintain viral suppression and minimise excess HIV-related mortality due to COVID-19 restrictions in the USA, even if disruptions to services are accompanied by reductions in sexual partnerships.

The methodology used is compiling the various reports to provide general overview as how Covid-19 has fuelled existing inequalities and providing overview of the situation the women-owned SMEs are facing in this challenging time of pandemic. Findings: The results from the study suggest that the inequalities in various areas have increased such as inequality between and within different countries, employment sector inequalities, gender inequalities, educational inequalities, age-related inequalities and all these has created a wider gap between the barriers faced by men and women across the globe. The women-owned SMEs has found to have the higher challenges in Vietnam as compared to men-owned SMEs. Implications & Recommendations: The current literature identified the increasing inequalities of women in various countries and particular in SMEs in Vietnam. There are several studies conducted in developed countries to determine the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs, but there is dearth of studies conducted in Vietnam, especially to study the effect of Covid-19 on the women entrepreneurs. It is important to conduct this kind of study in Vietnam on women SMEs to study the impact of Covid-19 to understand the barriers the women might have faced and how the government can provide the appropriate support to women entrepreneurs in the future which further can help in empowering the women in Vietnam and helping the economy to grow.

Nucleic acids are important biological cues that encode information about organismal identity and clinically relevant phenotypes such as drug resistance. We recently developed a strategy to design nucleic acid-responsive materials using the CRISPR-associated nuclease Cas12a as a user-programmable sensor and material actuator. This approach improves on the sensitivity of current DNA-responsive materials while enabling their rapid repurposing toward new sequence targets. Here, we provide a comprehensive resource for the design, synthesis and actuation of CRISPR-responsive hydrogels. First, we provide guidelines for the synthesis of Cas12a guide RNAs (gRNAs) for in vitro applications. We then outline methods for the synthesis of both polyethylene glycol-DNA (PEG-DNA) and polyacrylamide-DNA (PA-DNA) hydrogels, as well as their controlled degradation using Cas12a for the release of cargos, including small molecules, enzymes, nanoparticles and living cells within hours. Finally, we detail the design and assembly of microfluidic paper-based devices that use Cas12a-sensitive hydrogels to convert DNA inputs into a variety of visual and electronic readouts for use in diagnostics. Following the initial validation of the gRNA and Cas12a components (1 d), the synthesis and testing of either PEG-DNA or PA-DNA hydrogels require 3-4 d of laboratory time.

It was first reported on in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China and within three months spread as a pandemic around the whole globe. Here, we study macro-epidemiological patterns along the time course of the COVID-19 pandemic. We compute the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths for countries worldwide and for counties in the US and show that both distributions follow a truncated power-law over five orders of magnitude. We are able to explain the origin of this scaling behavior as a dual-scale process: the large-scale spread of the virus between countries and the small-scale accumulation of case numbers within each country. Assuming exponential growth on both scales, the critical exponent of the power-law is determined by the ratio of large-scale to small-scale growth rates. We confirm this theory in numerical simulations in a simple meta-population model, describing the epidemic spread in a network of interconnected countries. Our theory gives a mechanistic explanation why most COVID-19 cases occurred within a few epicenters, at least in the initial phase of the outbreak.

We evaluated a novel computer-based functional skills assessment and training (CFSAT) program, which includes simulations of everyday tasks (e.g., money and medication management). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The sample included noncognitively impaired (NC) older adults (n = 51) and cognitively impaired (CI) older adults (n = 43), who ranged in age from 60 to 86 years (M = 73.12; SD = 6.06), were primarily female (90%), and ethnically diverse (23% Hispanic, 51% African American). Participants (stratified by cognitive status) were randomized to 1 of the 2 conditions training alone (CFSAT) or CFSAT with computerized cognitive training and trained up to 24 training sessions. Task performance, using measures of completion time and efficiency (accuracy/completion time), was evaluated at baseline, the final training session, and immediately posttraining with an alternate form of the CFSAT assessment. RESULTS: Both NC and CI participants demonstrated significant performance improvements across all tasks following training (all ps < .001). The CI participants demonstrated reduced training gains compared to the NC participants (all ps < .001). Training gains did not vary as a function of training conditions. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings suggest that CFSAT is an efficacious program for assessing and training everyday task performance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A sample size of n = 700 was recruited in the study. The study included DPs from all over the world. A randomized selection of samples was done through dental groups present on social networks. An online survey was conducted in April 2020, using the Google Form software to provide questions and collect and elaborate answers. Data were analyzed using the statistical software STATA and presented in terms of percentages. RESULTS About 78% of the study participants perceived a very high risk of COVID-19 contamination in dental settings. Nearly 80% of the study participants were willing to be subjected to rapid tests and the same could be performed on patients visiting their dental clinics, which could prevent the spread of the disease. About 55% of the participants had reported that additional costs for the rapid tests should be borne by the governments. CONCLUSION The results of the present survey report that DPs do not feel safe and perceive a high risk of COVID-19 contagion and prevention of the disease could be done by performing rapid tests on dentists, dental staff, and patients visiting the dental clinics irrespective of age and gender of the participants.

As sex and age influence the autonomic function associated with BP regulation our study compared BP measurements in supine and sitting positions for men and women of different ages. METHODS: We included 91 men and 118 women (&#8805;18 years) without severe diseases. Hypertension was not an exclusion criterion because it is common in older persons. Mean left brachial BP and heart rate were determined by a digital sphygmomanometer in supine position as well as in sitting position before and after hand force measurement. RESULTS: In a supine position women had slightly lower diastolic BP values than men. After sitting up, the diastolic BP increased in nearly all subjects. This increase was greater in women older than 50 years than for aged-matched men. In contrast to diastolic BP the systolic BP increased after sitting up in only two thirds of the subjects. Especially in women younger than 50 years the systolic BP often did not increase but decreased in response to postural change. The pulse pressure was mostly reduced after sitting up. This reduction was more pronounced in women than men independent of age and physical effort (i.e. hand force measurement). The sitting position also caused an increased heart rate, which was independent of sex and age. CONCLUSION: Postural changes in the systolic and diastolic BP simultaneously depend on sex and age that needs to be considered for BP measurements in supine and sitting body positions.","output":"Gleichzeitiger Einfluss von Geschlecht und Alter auf den Blutdruckunterschied zwischen liegender und sitzender K?rperhaltung./ Simultaneous influence of sex and age on blood pressure difference between supine and sitting body positions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Toxicity and side effects of long-term use of opioids are well studied, but little information exists regarding electrophysiological disturbances of opium consumption While natural opium has been regarded safe to a great extent among traditional communities, concerns are emerging owing to the available evidence of QT prolongation that have been exposed during recent outcome surveillance of patients under opioid use Potential QT prolonging interactions would raise a higher level of such concern in opium users during COVID pandemic and warrant attention Materials and methods: This study was designed to detect the prevalence of QTc prolongation among opium users and nonusers Two groups were compared with regard to gender, age, and median QTc interval Normal and prolonged QTc intervals of user group were compared with respect to age, sex, dose of opium consumption, and duration of opium consumption Results: 123 opium users and 39 controls were investigated Median QTc interval in opium user and non-user group was 460 vs 386 milliseconds, respectively (p value &lt; 0 001) In all, 59 3%, (95% CI: 50 51C67 62%) of cases and none of non-user had prolonged QTc interval (p value &lt; 0 001) There was no significance between normal and prolonged QTc intervals with respect to dose and duration of opium use Conclusion: This study indicated that opium consumption is associated with QTc prolongation This prolongation does not relate to dose and duration of opium use Further study is propounded to assess the clinical significance of these results and to determine risk rating of opium compared to other opioids in this regard","output":"Opium-associated qt interval prolongation: A cross-sectional comparative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Amongst COVID19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in 40-60% with 10-30% requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) During any ICU surge situation, an increase in the total number of patients that will require RRT should be expected as the number of ICU patients increases This surge in RRT needs can quickly exhaust RRT machine availability During the pandemic, hospitals developed RRT surge contingency plans to maximize the number of patients who can receive RRT on a given day This may involve mixing modalities of therapy to include using CRRT machines to provide prolonged intermittent RRT (PIRRT) in a shift-based model However, implementing a machine allocation system to deploy RRT machines in the most efficient manner is a vexing challenge Automated strategies for machine allocation could aid staff in quickly developing daily RRT operational plans METHODS: Efficient routing of CRRT machines is analogous to an optimization routing problem, traditionally formulated with multiple vehicles picking up varying loads at each stop We reformulate the problem with CRRT machines as vehicles and patient needs as varying loads, with a maximum load of 24 patient-hours per day per machine, including transition time between patients RESULTS: Our solution, designed to be run daily, was written in Python 3 6 In conjunction with the primary team, nephrologists determine RRT durations based on patient need (6-12 hours vs 24 hours), generating a list of needs in the upcoming 24h period on a shared server If there is more RRT demand than capacity, nephrologists will be asked to reallocate required hours Next, we process CRRT machine locations with patient needs and locations The distance matrix preferentially routes machines between patients within units, then between closeby units, with preference given towards patients and units of similar COVID status to support cohorting The system then generates a sequence of patients that each machine should serve within minutes CONCLUSIONS: We report this as the first known implementation of automated scheduling for optimizing CRRT machine utilization given scarcity constraints from COVIDrelated surges Further characterization is necessary to quantify workload benefit and machine utilization","output":"Using artificial intelligence to optimize RRT machine allocation during COVID-19-related RRT surge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has dominated the attention of health care systems globally since January 2020. Various health disciplines including physical therapists are still exploring the best way to manage this new disease. The role and involvement of physical therapists in the management of COVID-19 are not yet well defined and are limited in many hospitals. This article reports a physical therapy service specially commissioned by the Health Commission of Sichuan Province to manage COVID-19 during patients' stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu in China. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were classified into 4 categories under a directive from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Patients in the \\"severe\\" and \\"critical\\" categories were admitted to the ICU irrespective whether mechanical ventilation was required. Between January 31, 2020, and March 8, 2020, a cohort of 16 patients was admitted to the ICU at the Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu. The median (minimum to maximum) hospital and ICU stays for these patients were 27 (11-46) and 15 (6-38) days, respectively. Medical management included antiviral, immunoregulation and supportive treatment of associated comorbidities. Physical therapist interventions included body positioning, airway clearance techniques, oscillatory positive end-expiratory pressure, inspiratory muscle training, and mobility exercises. All patients had at least 1 comorbidity. Three of the 16 patients required mechanical ventilation and were excluded for outcome measures that required understanding of verbal instructions. In the remaining 13 patients, respiratory outcomes-including the Borg Dyspnea Scale, peak expiratory flow rate, Pao2/Fio2 ratio, maximal inspiratory pressure, strength outcomes, Medical Research Council Sum Score, and functional outcomes (including the Physical Function in Intensive Care Test score, De Morton Mobility Index, and Modified Barthel Index)-were measured on the first day the patient received the physical therapist intervention and at discharge. RESULTS: At discharge from the ICU, while most outcome measures were near normal for the majority of the patients, 61% and 31% of these patients had peak expiratory flow rate and maximal inspiratory pressure below 80% of the predicted value and 46% had De Morton Mobility Index values below the normative value. CONCLUSION: The respiratory and physical functions of some patients remained poor at ICU discharge, suggesting that long-term rehabilitation may be required for these patients.

It becomes more appealing in the micro-scale context, especially where the surface forces become predominant. In addition, the deformations happening at the very local level are often coupled, and therefore providing multi-axis force sensing capabilities to microgripper becomes an important necessity. The manufacturing of a multi-axis instrumented microgripper comprises several levels of complexity, especially when it comes to the single wafer fabrication of a sensing and actuation mechanism. To address these requirements, in this work, an instrumented two-axis force sensing tool is proposed, which can then be integrated with the appropriate actuators for microgripping. Indeed, based on the task, the gripper design and shape requirements may differ. To cover wide needs, a versatile manufacturing strategy comprising of the separate fabrication of the passive and sensing parts was especially investigated. At the microscale, signal processing brings additional challenges, especially when we are dealing with multi-axis sensing. Therefore, a proper device, with efficient and appropriate systems and signal processing integration, is highly important. To keep these requirements in consideration, a dedicated clean-room based micro-fabrication of the devices and corresponding electronics to effectively process the signals are presented in this work. The fabricated sensing part can be assembled with wide varieties of passive parts to have different sensing tools as well as grippers. This force sensing tool is based upon the piezoresistive principle, and is experimentally demonstrated with a sensing capability up to 9 mN along the two axes with a resolution of 20 N. The experimental results validate the measurement error within 1%.

However, planning at a national, state, or local level to address the particular medical resource needs of children for mass critical care has yet to occur in any coordinated way. This paper presents the consensus opinion of the Task Force regarding supplies and equipment that would be required during a pediatric mass critical care crisis. METHODS In May 2008, the Task Force for Mass Critical Care published guidance on provision of mass critical care to adults. Acknowledging that the critical care needs of children during disasters were unaddressed by this effort, a 17-member Steering Committee, assembled by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education with guidance from members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, convened in April 2009 to determine priority topic areas for pediatric emergency mass critical care recommendations.Steering Committee members established subcommittees by topic area and performed literature reviews of MEDLINE and Ovid databases. The Steering Committee produced draft outlines through consensus-based study of the literature and convened October 6-7, 2009, in New York, NY, to review and revise each outline. Eight draft documents were subsequently developed from the revised outlines as well as through searches of MEDLINE updated through March 2010.The Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force, composed of 36 experts from diverse public health, medical, and disaster response fields, convened in Atlanta, GA, on March 29-30, 2010.

TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS The Task Force endorsed the view that supplies and equipment must be available for a tripling of capacity above the usual peak pediatric intensive care unit capacity for at least 10 days. The recommended size-specific pediatric mass critical care equipment stockpile for two types of patients is presented in terms of equipment needs per ten mass critical care beds, which would serve 26 patients over a 10-day period. Specific recommendations are made regarding ventilator capacity, including the potential use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Other recommendations include inventories for disposable medical equipment, medications, and staffing levels.","output":"Supplies and equipment for pediatric emergency mass critical care."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant ramifications for provider well-being. During these unprecedented and challenging times, one institution's Department of Surgery put in place several important initiatives for promoting the well-being of trainees as they were redeployed to provide care to COVID-19 patients. In this article, the authors describe these initiatives, which fall into 3 broad categories: redeploying faculty and trainees, ensuring provider safety, and promoting trainee wellness.The redeployment initiatives are the following: reframing the team mindset, creating a culture of grace and forgiveness, establishing a multidisciplinary wellness committee, promoting centralized leadership, providing clear communication, coordinating between departments and programs, implementing phased restructuring of the department's services, establishing scheduling flexibility and redundancy, adhering to training regulations, designating a trainee ombudsperson, assessing physical health risks for high-risk individuals, and planning for structured deimplementation.Initiatives specific to promoting provider safety are appointing a trainee safety advocate, guaranteeing personal protective equipment and relevant information about these materials, providing guidance regarding safe practices at home, and offering alternative housing options when necessary.Finally, the initiatives put in place to directly promote trainee wellness are establishing an environment of psychological safety, providing mental health resources, maintaining the educational missions, solidifying a sense of community by showing appreciation, being attentive to childcare, and using social media to promote community morale.The initiatives to carry out the department's strategy presented in this article, which were well received by both faculty and trainee members of the authors' community, may be employed in other departments and even outside the context of COVID-19. The authors hope that colleagues at other institutions and departments, independent of specialty, will find the initiatives described here helpful during, and perhaps after, the pandemic as they develop their own institution-specific strategies to promote trainee wellness.","output":"Trainee Wellness and Safety in the Context of COVID-19: The Experience of One Institution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: During the first peak of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, the Preventive Medicine Department and the Occupational Health Department at Hospital Clinic de Barcelona (HCB), a large Spanish referral hospital, developed an innovative comprehensive SARS\\\\CoV2 Surveillance and Control System (CoSy\\\\19) in order to preserve patients' and health care workers' (HCWs) safety.

METHODS: Position errors combining 0-, 2-, and 4-mm errors in the left-right (LR), anterior-posterior (AP), and superior-inferior (SI) directions in the delivery of 40 GO patient radiotherapy plans to a human head phantom were simulated and EPID transmission fluence maps were acquired. Dose difference () and structural similarity (SSIM) maps were calculated to quantify changes in the fluence maps. Three types of machine learning (ML) models that utilize radiomics features of the  maps (ML 1 models), features of the SSIM maps (ML 2 models), and features of both  and SSIM maps (ML 3 models) as inputs were used to perform three types of position error classification, namely a binary classification of the isocenter error (type 1), three binary classifications of LR, SI, and AP direction errors (type 2), and an eight-element classification of the combined LR, SI, and AP direction errors (type 3). Convolutional neural network (CNN) was also used to classify position errors using the  and SSIM maps as input. RESULTS: The best-performing ML 1 model was XGBoost, which achieved accuracies of 0.889, 0.755, 0.778, 0.833, and 0.532 in the type 1, type 2-LR, type 2-AP, type 2-SI, and type 3 classification, respectively.

The main purpose of this study was to verify whether the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a reduction in the hospital admission rate to the vascular surgeries of southern Sardinia and an increase in major amputations rate in patients suffering from CLI. METHODS: In our retrospective multicenter study, data of patients were analyzed using two different time frames for comparison: the year before Italian lockdown (P1) and the first year of pandemic (P2). Primary outcome was the rate of CLI-related hospitalization in the two period. Secondary outcomes were medical treatment, revascularization, and primary amputation rates. RESULTS: A total of 137 and 140 patients were admitted for CLI in the study centers during P1 and P2 respectively, with a comparable monthly hospitalization rate in the two periods (IRR 0.98;CI: 0.77-1.25;P=0.86). The median age was 76 years in P1 and 71 years in P2 (P=0.09);the two cohorts were comparable for demographical characteristics and risk factors.

However, the safety profile of the vaccines in this population is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To report real-world safety data of the COVID-19 vaccines in persons with rare neuroimmunological diseases. METHODS: An anonymous survey was distributed to patients recruited on social media. Participants answered general demographic and disease-related questions, and specific questions about their experiences with the COVID-19 vaccines. RESULTS: 438 participants completed the questionnaire. The median age was 51 (range 18C82 years); 366 were female (83.6%); 102 (23.3%) had associated comorbidities, and 354 (80.1%) were treated with immunotherapies. 242 participants (55.3%) reported a diagnosis of NMOSD; 99 (22.6%) had MOGAD; 79 (18%) had transverse myelitis. 239 participants (66.2%) were younger than 55 years of age. 138 participants (31.5%) reported earlyadverse events. Of these, 93 (67.4%) were < 55 years old, and 45 (32.6%) were > 55 years old (p=0.0086).

METHODS We identified 131 patients who underwent MIILE combined with thoracoscopy and laparoscopy. These patients were compared with 248 patients who underwent OILE between January 2012 and December 2013. RESULTS MIILE and OILE produced similar post-operative hospital mortality (MIILE 2.3 versus OILE 2%; P = 1.000). The MIILE approach was associated with a significant decrease in the time until chest drain removal (MIILE 9.07  5.075 days versus OILE 11.26  6.989 days; P = 0.002) and post-operative length of stay (MIILE 10.89  4.976 days versus OILE 12.83  6.921 days; P = 0.002).

Although transcriptomics is an effective tool to predict protein levels, protein abundances are also extensively affected by post-transcriptional and post-translational regulations. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics to study the comprehensive mRNA and protein expression changes during fruit development and ripening in watermelon, a non-climacteric fruit. A total of 6,226 proteins were quantified, and the large number of quantitative proteins is comparable to proteomic studies in model organisms such as Oryza sativa L. and Arabidopsis. Base on our proteome methodology, integrative analysis of the transcriptome and proteome showed that the mRNA and protein levels were poorly correlated, and the correlation coefficients decreased during fruit ripening. Proteomic results showed that proteins involved in alternative splicing and the ubiquitin proteasome pathway were dynamically expressed during ripening. Furthermore, the spliceosome and proteasome were significantly enriched by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, suggesting that post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms might play important roles in regulation of fruit ripening-associated genes expression, which might account for the poor correlation between mRNAs and proteins during fruit ripening.

We present our preliminary experience and clinical data utilizing Onyx as an embolization agent in the treatment of these lesions with proximal parent artery preservation. METHODS 7 consecutive ruptured peripheral PICA aneurysms, in 7 patients, were treated with superselective Onyx embolization at our institutions. According to the anatomical classification of Lister et al, these aneurysms were located in the lateral medullary segment (n=1), tonsillomedullary segment (n=1), and the telovelotonsillary segment (n=5) of the PICA. Technical feasibility, procedure related complications, angiographic results, follow-up diagnostic imaging, and clinical outcome were evaluated. RESULTS In all cases, endovascular treatment was successful, with complete occlusion of the aneurysm with proximal parent artery preservation at the final postprocedural angiogram. Procedure related complications were not observed. One patient with a poor clinical condition at admission died during the initial hospital stay due to extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage.

Accordingly, an oncolytic tropism for infecting GSCs was demonstrated in a murine tumor model. Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV is enveloped by two proteins, prM and E. The pME expression plasmid along with the HIV-1 vector pNL Luc AM generated prME pseudotyped viral particles. Four different prME envelopes, Z1 to Z4, were cloned, and the corresponding pseudotypes, Z1- to Z4-HIVluc, produced by this two-plasmid system, were tested for entry efficiency using Vero-B4 cells. The most efficient pseudotype, Z1-HIVluc, also infected glioma-derived cell lines U87 and 86HG39.

Activation of the transcription factor STAT3 was recently linked to CRT resistance in other gastrointestinal cancers such as rectal and esophageal cancers, but its role in PDAC needs to be clarified. Protein expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 was determined in PDAC cell lines and connected to transcriptional activity measured by dual-luciferase reporter gene assays. Inhibition of STAT3 signaling was achieved by RNAi or the small-molecule inhibitor napabucasin. We observed a positive correlation between STAT3 signaling activity and CRT resistance. Importantly, genetical and pharmacological perturbation of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway resulted in CRT sensitization specifically in those cell lines, in which STAT3 activity was augmented by IL-6.

The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of olfactory loss in an outpatient population who presented to a coronavirus testing center during a 2-week period and to evaluate the diagnostic value of the symptom \\"sudden smell loss\\" for screening procedures. METHODS: In this cross-sectional controlled cohort study, 500 patients who presented with symptoms of a common cold to a corona testing center and fulfilled corona testing criteria completed a standardized diagnostic questionnaire which included the patients' main symptoms, time course, and an additional self-assessment of the patients' current smell, taste function, and nasal breathing compared to the level before the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: Out of the 500 patients, 69 presented with olfactory loss. Twenty-two of them subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Only 12 out of the patients without olfactory loss tested positive, resulting in a frequency of 64.7% for the symptom \\"sudden smell loss\\" in COVID-19 patients. Compared to COVID-19 patients without smell loss, they were significantly younger and less severely affected. Changes in nasal airflow were significantly more pronounced in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with olfactory complaints compared to the patients with smell loss who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. By excluding patients with a blocked nose, the symptom \\"sudden smell loss\\" can be attested a high specificity (97%) and a sensitivity of 65% with a positive predictive value of 63% and negative predictive value of 97% for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Considering the high frequency of smell loss in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, acute olfactory impairment should be recognized as an early symptom of the disease and should be tested for on a regular basis. In contrast to other acute viral smell impairment, COVID-19-associated smell loss seems to be only rarely accompanied by a severely blocked nose.","output":"Predictive Value of Sudden Olfactory Loss in the Diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This communication summarizes the presentations given at the 1st international conference of the World Society for Virology (WSV) held virtually during 16C18 June 2021, under the theme of tackling global viral epidemics.

The initial diagnosis of SARS was based on clinical and epidemiological criteria. During the outbreak, molecular and serologic tests for the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) became available. However, without a \\"gold standard,\\" it was impossible to determine the usefulness of these tests. We describe how these tests were used during the first phase of the SARS outbreak in Toronto and offer some recommendations that may be useful if SARS returns. METHODS We examined the results of all diagnostic laboratory tests used in 117 patients admitted to hospitals in Toronto who met the Health Canada criteria for suspect or probable SARS. Focusing on tests for SARS-CoV, we attempted to determine the optimal specimen types and timing of specimen collection. RESULTS Diagnostic test results for SARS-CoV were available for 110 of the 117 patients. SARS-CoV was detected by means of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in at least one specimen in 59 (54.1%) of 109 patients. Serologic test results of convalescent samples were positive in 50 (96.2%) of 52 patients for whom paired serum samples were collected during the acute and convalescent phases of the illness. Of the 110 patients, 78 (70.9%) had specimens that tested positive by means of RT-PCR, serologic testing or both methods. The proportion of RT-PCR test results that were positive was similar between patients who met the criteria for suspect SARS (50.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 38.4%-63.2%) and those who met the criteria for probable SARS (58.0%, 95% CI 44.2%-70.7%). SARS-CoV was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs in 33 (32.4%) of 102 patients, in stool specimens in 19 (63.3%) of 30 patients, and in specimens from the lower respiratory tract in 10 (58.8%) of 17 patients. INTERPRETATION These findings suggest that the rapid diagnostic tests in use at the time of the initial outbreak lack sufficient sensitivity to be used clinically to rule out SARS. As tests for SARS-CoV continue to be optimized, evaluation of the clinical presentation and elucidation of a contact history must remain the cornerstone of SARS diagnosis. In patients with SARS, specimens taken from the lower respiratory tract and stool samples test positive by means of RT-PCR more often than do samples taken from other areas.","output":"Interpretation of diagnostic laboratory tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome: the Toronto experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has triggered myriad efforts to dissect and understand the structure and dynamics of this complex pathogen. The Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has received special attention as it is the means by which the virus enters the human host cells. The N-terminal domain (NTD) is one of the targeted regions of the Spike protein for therapeutics and neutralizing antibodies against COVID-19. Though its function is not well-understood, the NTD is reported to acquire mutations and deletions that can accelerate the evolutionary adaptation of the virus driving antibody escape. Cellular processes are known to be regulated by complex interactions at the molecular level, which can be characterized by means of a graph representation facilitating the identification of key residues and critical communication pathways within the molecular complex. From extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the entire Spike for the wild-type and the dominant variant, we derive a weighted graph representation of the protein in two dominant conformations of the receptor-binding-domain; all-down and one-up. We implement graph theory techniques to characterize the relevance of specific residues at facilitating roles of communication and control, while uncovering key implications for fitness and adaptation. We find that many of the reported high-frequency mutations tend to occur away from the critical residues highlighted by our graph theory analysis, implying that these mutations tend to avoid targeting residues that are most critical for protein allosteric communication. We propose that these critical residues could be candidate targets for novel antibody therapeutics. In addition, our analysis provides quantitative insights of the critical role of the NTD and furin cleavage site and their wide-reaching influence over the protein at large. Many of our conclusions are supported by empirical evidence while others point the way towards crucial simulation-guided experiments.","output":"Network analysis outlines strengths and weaknesses of emerging SARS-CoV-2 Spike variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Culture Shock adalah kondisi seseorang merasa takut dan khawatir yang berlebihan ketika berada di lingkungan baru yang tidak terbiasa oleh dirinya.

In spite of early warning signals from the World Health Organization, countries struggled to shape their policy responses and countermeasures for curtailing the spread of the virus while also minimising the damage that any restrictions would inflict on the health and well-being of society at large. While some countries have adopted strict regulations and extraordinary measures after declaring states of exception and national emergencies, others have relied upon expert recommendations and individual responsibility. Sweden is viewed as having adopted one of the latter type of approaches in that it places the responsibility for social distancing upon the individual. Is this an instance of a failed securitisation process, or rather a sensible constitutional and political response to a severe security event? This article presents an in-depth analysis of the Swedish strategy for coping with Covid-19, arguing that this case illustrates that security management in a democratic state should direct greater attention to rule following in accordance with a logic of appropriateness rather than the rule breaking envisaged by securitisation theory.","output":"The Swedish Covid-19 strategy and voluntary compliance: Failed securitisation or constitutional security management?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Surgical and respirator masks are worn to reduce the risk of droplet and airborne transmission of viral respiratory disease. As a result of the novel coronavirus (COVID\\\\19) pandemic, mask wearing has been designated mandatory for healthcare professionals working in UK hospitals for the foreseeable future. It is thus timely to consider the long\\\\term implications of mask wearing on communication within healthcare settings, from both a patient and a clinician perspective. AIMS: The primary objective is to identify research evidence that corresponds to the mask\\\\wearing experiences of healthcare professionals working on the ground. By drawing together a summary of the literature illustrating the potential challenges associated with mask wearing, it is possible to make an application to various clinical cohorts and to formulate a set of preliminary, evidence\\\\based support strategies. The paper additionally explores the role for the Speech and Language Therapist (SLT) in supporting communication in the context of mask wearing. METHODS & PROCEDURES: Through a scoping review of the relevant literature, this paper reflects holistically on the prospective challenges associated with mask wearing across a variety of healthcare settings and patient populations. The subsequent conclusions have been used to inform the proposed clinical guidelines for safe and effective practice. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: There is a current research gap with regards to mask wearing in non\\\\medical and non\\\\clinical healthcare workers, and the impact this may have on both a professional and a personal basis. In the absence of preliminary data, the development of associated communication support strategies is hindered. This paper draws upon a variety of clinically conceivable issues faced by healthcare professionals, outlines important practical and ethical considerations, and proposes evidence\\\\based solutions to some of the challenges identified. Future research is required to gather evidence with regards to actual clinical experiences of mask wearing to substantiate hypotheses. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: Although undoubtedly essential in protecting the health of staff and patients, there are numerous logistical, physiological, psychological, social and economic complications associated with the wearing of masks. The ability of healthcare staff to successfully communicate with patients and with colleagues is jeopardized, which may adversely affect the efficiency, effectiveness, equitability and, most notably, safety of therapeutic intervention. The SLT has a distinct role in facilitating communication in order to safeguard the provision, accessibility and efficacy of services. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT: Existing research explores the impact of mask wearing on medical doctors, surgeons and dentists, and upon the corresponding patient cohorts. Little is known about how mask wearing may affect Allied Health Professionals and their ability to deliver therapeutic interventions safely and effectively. With mandatory face covering potentially a long\\\\term requirement for UK healthcare staff, it is both timely and relevant to consider the consequences of mask wearing on communication across acute and community settings. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE: This paper identifies a range of prospective key issues associated with mask wearing across a variety of clinical and non\\\\clinical populations, with application specifically to vulnerable patient cohorts. Through evidence synthesis, this paper provides a summary of fundamental issues supported by relevant literature, and draws upon these in order to propose a preliminary set of evidence\\\\based clinical guidelines setting out potential solutions to the challenges faced. This review additionally assists in quantifying the role of the SLT within these extraordinary circumstances, with the aim of prompting unified practice, building upon professional guidance and increasing skill recognition. WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WORK? In addition to their role in facilitating the development of individualised communication strategies for patients, SLTs should actively seek to provide widely accessible multidisciplinary education opportunities focusing on supporting communication; with specific reference to mask wearing and the associated communicative challenges. At a commissioning and managerial level, leaders within healthcare should acknowledge mask wearing as just one of the complexities associated with frontline working in the context of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, and aim to support their workforce by delivering resources and protocols which maximize and promote staff safety, efficiency, resilience and well\\\\being in concurrence with positive patient outcomes.","output":"I'm smiling back at you: Exploring the impact of mask wearing on communication in healthcare"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Timely detection leading to the implementation of reno-protective measures reduces the progression of diabetic kidney disease.

This study aimed to assess the seroepidemiological associations of antibodies to EBV with SjS. METHODS: A seroepidemiological study containing 119 patients with SjS and 65 healthy controls was first performed, in which the associations of SjS with four commonly studied EBV antibodies including IgM-anti-viral capsid antigen (anti-VCA) antibody, IgG-anti-VCA antibody, IgG-anti-early antigen (anti-EA) antibody, and IgG-anti-EBV nuclear antigen 1 (anti-EBNA1) antibody were evaluated. A systematic review and meta-analysis of eligible seroepidemiological studies was also carried out, and data syntheses were performed using random-effect meta-analysis. RESULTS: In the case-control study, the patients with SjS had both a significantly higher prevalence of IgG-anti-EA antibody positivity (31.9% vs. 3.1%, P < 0.001) and high titers of IgG-anti-EA antibody (P < 0.001) than healthy controls. The titer of IgG-anti-VCA antibody was significantly increased in the patients with SjS compared with healthy controls (P < 0.001). IgG-anti-EA antibody seropositive patients with SjS had lower levels of both C3 (P = 0.002) and C4 (P = 0.02), and the titer of IgG-anti-EA antibody was inversely related to the levels of both C3 (r = -0.31, P < 0.001) and C4 (r = -0.20, P = 0.03). A total of 14 eligible studies on the serological associations between EBV infection and SjS were finally included into the meta-analysis, which suggested obvious associations of SjS with IgM-anti-VCA antibody [Odds ratio (OR) = 5.77, 95%CI 1.73C19.25, P = 0.004] and IgG-anti-EA antibody (OR = 9.97, 95%CI 4.58-21.67, P < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study provide strong serological evidence for the association between EBV infection and SjS. SjS has obvious associations with IgM-anti-VCA antibody and IgG-anti-EA antibody. IgG-anti-EA antibody is linked to low levels of C3 and C4 in the patients with SjS, the significance of which needs to be addressed in further studies.","output":"Serological Evidence for the Association Between Epstein-Barr Virus Infection and Sj?grens Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid 19 virus epidemic, which is the greatest danger of the 21st century, has significantly affected the way of life in the world. Scientists do their best to prevent the epidemic. They emphasize that the trio of mask, distance and cleaning will be sufficient. The epidemic, which emerged in China and negatively affected almost all countries in the world in almost every field, has also adversely affected the field of education. The education and training process in schools was suspended temporarily. Due to reasons such as the epidemic could not be stopped and prevented, starting from March 2020, some countries decided to continue their education in distance education environments in order to prevent children and young people from being harmed in their education and training processes. With the rapid transition to the distance education process, almost the entire education process has entered the digitalization process. The biggest share behind the management of the process called \\"emergency distance education\\" belongs to teachers. Teachers also use digital media in this process. They changed the way of communication with the students, their teaching methods, and the materials they used.

The infection density was 1.3 and 8.1 cases per 100,000 patient-days between 2005 and 2012 and 2013 and 2020, respectively (P < 0.05). During an outbreak investigation, a specific lineage of E. anophelis strains was identified by the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis. To evaluate the evolution of the specific E. anophelis lineage, whole-genome sequencing was performed, and unique genomic features (GRs) were determined by comparative genomic analysis. The specific E. anophelis lineage was novel compared to worldwide strains ever reported by cg-MLST phylogenic and whole-genome comparative analysis. Multiplex PCR using primers designed from unique GRs were performed for prevalence screening among isolates from the CCH and nationwide isolates from the Taiwan surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance (TSAR) Program. The proportion of the specific E. anophelis lineage increased from 7.9% (3/38) during 2005-2012 to 89.2% (223/250) during 2013-2020 (P < 0.05). Although E. anophelis usually confers resistance to multiple antibiotics with limited therapeutic options, the E. anophelis strains in the specific lineage had higher ciprofloxacin resistance (100% [226/226] versus 27.4% [17/62], P < 0.05) and was associated with a higher 14-day mortality rates (33.2% [37/226] versus 16.1% [10/62], P < 0.05) than other strains at CCH. A similarly increasing trend was also found in the national TSAR program during 2002-2018 (p for trend <0.05). We concluded that a novel lineage of E. anophelis strains has emerged dominantly in Taiwan. The genomic features are important for further investigations of epidemiology, resistance, virulence, and appropriate treatment. IMPORTANCE Elizabethkingia anophelis is an emerging multidrug resistant pathogen caused several global outbreaks recently. E. anophelis was frequently misidentified as E. meningoseptica in the past by conventional culture methods; therefore, the prevalence was often underestimated. Through revised identification, an increasing trend of E. anophelis infection was noted in a tertiary hospital and a dominant lineage of strains was recognized by genotyping. To our best knowledge, the dominant lineage of E. anophelis is novel in comparison to other worldwide strains by whole-genome comparative analysis and several unique genomic regions were found. The whole-genome sequencing data also demonstrated multiple putative virulence factors and genes associated with multidrug resistance. In our study, we identified a specially evolved E. anophelis in Taiwan with increasing nationwide dominance. This study will assist in further epidemiology surveillance and developing corresponsive infection control policies to restrain it potential of global dissemination.","output":"The Evolutionary Trend and Genomic Features of an Emerging Lineage of Elizabethkingia anophelis Strains in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY OBJECTIVE To investigate adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in terms of body perception, self-esteem, and comorbid psychiatric diseases by comparing them with their healthy peers.

The incidence of the pathology increases with growing age after 65 years. Conventional surgical aortic valve replacement through median sternotomy has been the gold standard of patient care for symptomatic aortic valve stenosis. However, as the risk profile of patients worsens, other therapeutic strategies have been introduced in an attempt to maintain the excellent results obtained by the established surgical treatment. One of these approaches is represented by transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Although the outcomes of high-risk patients undergoing treatment for symptomatic aortic valve stenosis have improved with transcatheter aortic valve replacement, many patients with this condition remain candidates for surgical aortic valve replacement. In order to reduce the surgical trauma in patients who are candidates for surgical aortic valve replacement, minimally invasive approaches have garnered interest during the past decade. Since the introduction of right anterior thoracotomy for aortic valve replacement in 1993, right anterior mini-thoracotomy and upper hemi-sternotomy have become the predominant incisional approaches among cardiac surgeons performing minimal access aortic valve replacement. Beside the location of the incision, the arterial cannulation site represents the second major landmark of minimal access techniques for aortic valve replacement. The two most frequently used arterial cannulation sites include central aortic and peripheral femoral approaches. With the purpose of reducing surgical trauma in these patients, we have opted for a right anterior mini-thoracotomy approach with a central aortic cannulation site.

RESULTS: The estimated pharmacokinetic parameters were maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) 0.9086 g/ml, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) 347.74 gmin/ml, and time to reach C(max) (T(max)) 64.69 min for berberine and C(max) = 0.9843 g/ml, AUC= 450.64 gmin/ml, T(max) = 56.86 min for magnolol, respectively. Furthermore, integrated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis showed that the highest plasma concentration, inhibition rate and interferon- (IFN-) secretion of HH first increased and then weakened over time, reaching their peaks at 60 min. The plasma concentration of HH is directly related to the anti-influenza virus effect. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that berberine and magnolol are the main active ingredients of HH related to its anti-influenza virus effect, which is related to the improvement of IFN- secretion.","output":"Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Huanglian-Houpo Decoction Based on Berberine Hydrochloride and Magnolol Against H1N1 Influenza Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the major drawback of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Conversion to Roux-en-Y bypass is recommended but might not be suitable for all patients. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients who underwent laparoscopic hiatal repair and gastropexy for intractable GERD after LSG between 2015 and 2017. Data on upper gastrointestinal (GI) study findings and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use was collected. The GERD-health-related quality of life (GERD-HRQL) questionnaire assessed patient symptoms. Perioperative outcomes, GERD symptoms, and medication details were analyzed. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients were included. Mean interval from the initial LSG to revision surgery was 40.8 months (range, 6-108). Mean body mass index before LSG was 34 kg/m2, whereas that before revision surgery was 25.7 kg/m2. Mean revision surgery time was 126 min, whereas the mean length of stay was 3.6 days. No major surgical complication occurred. The mean GERD-HRQL score before revision surgery was 24.3 and decreased to 12.3 at 1 month after surgery. Mean GERD-HRQL scores at 6, 12, and 24 months after revision surgery were 16.8, 17.4, and 18.9, respectively. All patients required daily proton pump inhibitor pre-operatively; only 26% could discontinue them postoperatively. Of the 28 patients, 14 (50.0%) were satisfied with the surgery, 8 (28.6%) had a neutral attitude, and 6 (21.4%) were dissatisfied. Three (11.1%) patients agreed to undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. CONCLUSION Hiatal repair with gastropexy is an acceptable treatment option for GERD after LSG but not very effective because of partial remission of symptoms.","output":"Revision of Sleeve Gastrectomy with Hiatal Repair with Gastropexy for Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ramifications of COVID-19 on the re-structuring of healthcare are widespread, including delivery of surgical services across all specialties including plastic surgery. Redeployment of personnel and cessation of elective services are commonplace. However, there is a continued need for both emergency and oncological surgery. A national review of practice was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, to assess impact on services, staffing and training. METHODS: Key aspects of current plastic surgery practice in the United Kingdom were examined in this cross-sectional study; operating capacity, location of theatre lists (national health service or outsourced private institutions), differences across sub-specialties, change in anaesthesia practices, staffing, redeployment, on-call provision and impact on training. RESULTS: Three-hundred and forty-four plastic surgeons in the United Kingdom provided practice data across 51 units. Theatre capacity and outpatient services were markedly reduced. Outsourcing of operating lists to private institutions was widely utilised. Increased use of local anaesthetic hand procedures, the prioritisation of shorter operations with reduced microsurgery in both head and neck/lower limb and almost complete cessation of breast reconstruction was noted, together with marked regional variations. Re-deployment occurred at all staffing levels, whilst telemedicine played a critical role in both patient management and training. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has enforced unprecedented changes to surgical care delivery and training, as identified by examination of plastic surgery nationally in the United Kingdom. Novel means to support continued elective and emergency services including oncology have been identified. Lessons learned will allow phased return of services and improved preparation for the future.","output":"COVID-19 and plastic surgery: lessons from a national specialty review in the United Kingdom: COVID-19 and plastic surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis (TB) still causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This disease is hallmarked by persistent oxidative stress and systemic inflammation.

In a recent phase II randomized clinical trial (RIPENACTB study), use of NAC as adjunct therapy during the first two months of anti-TB treatment was safe. Whether adjunct NAC therapy of patients with TB-HIV coinfection in the context of anti-TB treatment could directly affect pro-oxidation and systemic inflammation has not been yet formally demonstrated. To test this hypothesis, we leveraged existing data and biospecimens from the RIPENACTB trial to measure a number of surrogate markers of oxidative stress and of immune activation in peripheral blood of the participants at pre-treatment and at the day 60 of anti-TB treatment. Upon initiation of therapy, we found that the group of patients undertaking NAC exhibited significant increase in GSH levels and in total antioxidant status while displaying substantial reduction in lipid peroxidation compared to the control group. Only small changes in plasma concentrations of cytokines were noted.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the predictive power of the decrease in LA strain in AF population and hypothesize that the difference in LA strain between reference values could be used in a stratified way for prognostication. METHODS: Echocardiography examination was performed using the GE system. The standard score of LA strain (ZLA) was calculated, and patients were classified into five groups: Z0 (0 to -1), Z-1 (-1 to -2), Z-2 (-2 to -3), Z-3, (-3 to -4), and Z-4 (&#8804;-4). The clinical end point was an ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Among 1,364 subjects with AF (71.4  12.1 years; 55.6%, men), 105 encountered ischemic strokes during a mean follow-up duration of 3.1  1.6 years. No patients in the Z0 and Z-1 groups encountered ischemic stroke. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed higher rates of stroke in worse ZLA groups.

Methods: : This study was a cross-sectional survey conducted among vaccine-eligible and vaccinated individuals in Malaysia between May and July 2021. A self-administered 27-item questionnaire was developed and validated before distributing it through an online medium. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed using SPSS version 22. Results: : A total of 428 respondents completed the survey. More than half of the respondents (71.1%) were 18 to 45 years old, and 66.4% were females. A vast majority (98.6%) of the respondents had registered for the National COVID-19 Vaccination Program. A total of 20 participants (4.7%) expressed their concerns about either registering or receiving the COVID-19 vaccination, and the most reported concern was the uncertainty of vaccine safety.

HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C genotypes of n = 111 deceased patients with COVID-19 (Moscow, Russia) and n = 428 volunteers were identified with targeted next-generation sequencing. Deceased patients were splitted into two groups according to age at death: n = 26 adult patients with age at death below 60 completed years (inclusively) and n = 85 elderly patients over 60. With the use of HLA class I genotypes we developed a risk score which is associated with the ability to present SARS-CoV-2 peptides by an individual's HLA class I molecule set. The resulting risk score was significantly higher in the group of deceased adults compared to elderly adults (p = 0.00348, AUC ROC = 0.68). In particular, presence of HLA-A*01:01 allele was associated with high risk, while HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*03:01 mainly contributed to the low risk group. The analysis of homozygous patients highlighted the results even stronger: homozygosity by HLA-A*01:01 mainly accompanied early deaths, while only one HLA-A*02:01 homozygote died before 60.

Lack of medical infrastructure and distant testing laboratories is another challenge faced by the countries, which result in a delayed testing report leading to delay in medical treatmentsuch critical problems arising in the fight against COVID-19 highlight the need for improving the efficiency of supply chains. Recently used for commercial purposes, drone technology has already proved its utility in inventory and logistics management. Therefore, we argue that drones could be a viable option to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the supply chains working for humanitarian aid to combat COVID-19. Specifically, the focus is on food, administrative, and healthcare supply chains that are the core to combat the pandemic. Moreover, in this article, we highlight various present and future application areas for drone technology, which could pave the way for future research and industry applications.","output":"Aerial Bots in the Supply Chain: A New Ally to Combat COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Upper airway granulomas are commonly encountered benign masses and are a result of pronounced tissue reactivity to localized respiratory mucosal trauma. The mechanism of injury to respiratory epithelium is most commonly iatrogenic and associated with intubation or indwelling tracheostomy. Case Report. A 40-year-old obese female with a history of multiple intubations, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type II, and history of tracheal stenosis presented with sudden onset respiratory distress requiring intubation at an outside hospital. Direct laryngoscopy revealed a rapidly forming transglottic tissue mass, measuring 5.0  2.2  0.8 cm. The following case represents an unusual exception to our experience with granulomas given its rapidity of onset and migration of tissue around the endotracheal tube. Discussion. Laryngeal erythema and granulation formation are expected postintubation findings in most patients; however, the large size of granuloma tissue and rapid onset of symptoms in this case make it remarkable. Our patient had multiple risk factors for postintubation stenosis: female sex, poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and multiple prior intubations for periods lasting longer than forty-eight hours.

Case presentation : A late preterm female was delivered by Cesarean section to COVID-19 mother who was diagnosed after presenting with a dry cough, nasal congestion, headache, and sore throat in the context of direct contact with other confirmed patients. The infants clinical examination was reassuring throughout the hospital stay. COVID-19 was not detected by RT-PCR tests performed on the amniotic fluid and on two samples of the newborns nasopharyngeal swabs indicating no vertical transmission of the virus. After 10 days of hospital stay and following two negative consecutive RT-PCR assays on the mothers nasopharyngeal swabs, both the mother and the infant were discharged home in stable clinical conditions. Conclusion: Vertical transmission is not likely among the routes of COVID-19 transmission.

Stakeholders leverage multiple strategies to address the challenge. Mobile technology is pervasive and presents an opportunity to reach young people with critical sexual reproductive health and family planning messages. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this research study are to understand how mobile health (mHealth) is used for family planning, understand phone use habits among young people in Sierra Leone, and recommend strategies for mobile-enabled dissemination of family planning information at scale. METHODS: This formative research study was conducted using a systematic literature review and focus group discussions (FGDs). The literature survey assessed similar but existing interventions through a systematic search of 6 scholarly databases. Cross-sections of young people of both sexes and their support groups were engaged in 9 FGDs in an urban and a rural district in Sierra Leone. The FGD data were qualitatively analyzed using MAXQDA software (VERBI Software GmbH) to determine appropriate technology channels, content, and format for different user segments. RESULTS: Our systematic search results were categorized using Grading of Recommended Assessment and Evaluation (GRADE) into communication channels, audiovisual messaging format, purpose of the intervention, and message direction. The majority of reviewed articles report on SMS-based interventions. At the same time, most intervention purposes are for awareness and as helpful resources. Our survey did not find documented use of custom mHealth apps for family planning information dissemination. From the FGDs, more young people in Sierra Leone own basic mobile phones than those that have feature capablilities or are smartphone. Young people with smartphones use them mostly for WhatsApp and Facebook. Young people widely subscribe to the social mediaConly internet bundle, with the cost ranging from 1000 leones (US $0.11) to 1500 leones (US $0.16) daily. Pupils in both districts top-up their voice call and SMS credit every day between 1000 leones (US $0.11) and 5000 leones (US $0.52). CONCLUSIONS: mHealth has facilitated family planning information dissemination for demand creation around the world. Despite the widespread use of social and new media, SMS is the scalable channel to reach literate and semiliterate young people. We have cataloged mHealth for contraceptive research to show SMS followed by call center as widely used channels. Jingles are popular for audiovisual message formats, mostly delivered as either push or pull only message directions (not both).

The study was focused on changes in two types of motivation: autonomous motivation- finding importance in the task of staying at home, and controlled motivation- staying at home because of felt pressure or choicelessness, as autonomous motivation predicts effective behavior change better than controlled motivation, especially long-term. Predictions grounded in self-determination theory (SDT) tested whether three motivating aspects of messages to stay at home from governmental and public health agencies, physicians, the news, and family and friends predicted changes in these motivations across time. Perceiving messages to stay at home as controlling predicted increases in controlled motivation and decreases in autonomous motivation over two months. Conversely, perceiving messages to stay at home as autonomy supportive predicted increases in autonomous motivation over two months. Results for mandated orders to stay at home were intriguing: they related to increases in both controlled and autonomous motivations over time. Exploratory analyses revealed that increases in autonomous motivation over time predicted actual time spent at home reported at Wave 2, whereas increases in controlled motivation did not relate.

Methods: ALS patients presenting to clinic completed PROMs that included (1) the self-entry ALSFRS-R, (2) the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC Scale), and (3) a question about falls. PROM data were compared to one another and to the traditional ALSFRS-R collected by trained evaluators in clinic (\\"standard ALSFRS-R\\"). Results: Over the data collection period, 449 ALS patients completed at least one of the three PROMs. Self-entry vs. standard ALSFRS-R total scores (n = 183) had high agreement (intraclass correlation (ICC)=0.81, 95% CI = 0.67, 0.88). Self-entry ALSFRS-R total scores were significantly higher than standard ALSFRS-R total scores (2.3 points, p < 0.001). In a subset of participants who contributed data at two timepoints, the average ALSFRS-R decline was not significantly different between methods (n = 49). ABC scores correlated highly with self-entry and standard ALSFRS-R Gross Motor subdomain scores (Pearson's r = 0.72, p < 0.001 and Pearson's r = 0.76, p < 0.001, respectively; n = 130).

In this process, the collision of fundamental rights emerges as a crucial challenge for decision-making. Policy Options and Implications: This policy review analyzes selected articles by the PubMed searcher about extreme measures taken in several countries during precedent pandemics and the current pandemic, and selects hard decisions relating to the exceptional measures taken by judicial departments in Brazil, connecting them to the \\"collision of fundamental rights and law principles.\\" The collision of rights and principles imposed on decision makers a duty to provide balanced rights, and to adopt the enforcement of some rights prioritization. Ethical concerns were also verified in this field involving rights limitations. During a pandemic, the importance of extreme measures to protect health rights and healthcare systems is instrumental for focused, fast, and correct decision making to avoid loss of life and the collapse of healthcare systems. The main goals of this research are to discuss the implications and guidelines for public health decision making, the indispensable ethical and legal aspects for safeguarding health systems and the lives of people, and the respect of the Justice principle and of fundamental health and dignity rights. We conclude that COVID-19 justifies the prioritization of collective and individual health access rights. Acceptable standards of fundamental rights restrictions are established at the constitutional and international levels and must be enforced by rules and governmental action, to ensure fast and accurate decision making during a pandemic. Freedom rights exercises must be linked to solidarity for the realization of social welfare, for the health rights of all individuals and for health systems to function well during a pandemic. Actionable Recommendations: All individuals are free and equal, therefore social exclusion is prohibited. Institutions must consider social inequalities when discussing public health measures and be guided by ethical standards, by law principles, and rules recognized by constitutional and international law for the benefit of all during a health pandemic.

The aim of this study was to investigate Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates based on B cell epitopes by targeting the conserved regions in the spike glycoprotein to trigger increased multi-variant virus neutralization and memory response for the development of vaccine seed candidates. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein gene sequences originating from Indonesia were compared with Wuhan (China), the United Kingdom, South Africa, India, the United States, and Brazil isolates obtained from the NCBI and GISAID databases. The recognition of antigens was carried out directly using B cells through the B cell receptor (BCR). An indirect B cell activation by Cluster of Differentiation (CD)4+ T cells and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II was predicted through the binding with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) based on IC (50 )value. In addition, vaccine allergenicity and toxicity were investigated. During the molecular complex examination, the 3D peptide structure was investigated and the lowest amount of energy formed when the vaccine candidate peptide bound to BCR and MHC-II was calculated. Results: As a result, the spike glycoprotein sequences of Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates had conserved regions which were very similar to reference countries such as China, the United Kingdom, South Africa, India, the United States, and Brazil.

AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY Based on these observations, speculations raised the concerns that ACEIs/ARBs users would be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and would be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease and death. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis of the association between prior use of ACEIs and ARBs and mortality due to COVID-19 disease. DATA SOURCES A comprehensive search of several databases from November 2019 to June 18, 2020 was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, and Scopus. Medrxiv.org was also searched for unpublished data. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES Nine studies with a total of 18,833 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 met our eligibility criteria. Prior use of ACEIs and/or ARBs was associated with reduced mortality among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, with a pooled adjusted relative risk (aRR) from 6 studies of 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.42-0.94) (I = 65%). Three studies reported separately on ACEIs or ARBs and their association with survival among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, with a pooled adjusted relative risk of 0.78, 95% CI (0.58-1.04) (I = 0%) and 0.97, 95% CI (0.73-1.30) (I = 0%) respectively. The results of sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main analysis.

OBJECTIVES: To understand the response of and challenges faced by palliative care services during the COVID-19 pandemic, and identify associated factors. METHODS: We surveyed palliative care and hospice services, contacted via relevant organizations. Multivariable logistic regression identified associations with challenges. Content analysis explored free text responses. RESULTS: A total of 458 services responded; 277 UK, 85 rest of Europe, 95 rest of the world; 81% cared for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, 77% had staff with suspected or confirmed COVID-19; 48% reported shortages of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), 40% staff shortages, 24% medicines shortages, 14% shortages of other equipment. Services provided direct care and education in symptom management and communication; 91% changed how they worked. Care often shifted to increased community and hospital care, with fewer admissions to inpatient palliative care units. Factors associated with increased odds of PPE shortages were: charity rather than public management (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.81-5.20), inpatient palliative care unit rather than other settings (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.46-3.75).

Lung transplant patients are vulnerable to various forms of allograft injury, whether from acute rejection (AR) (encompassing acute cellular rejection [ACR] and antibody-mediated rejection [AMR]), chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), or infection (INFXN). Previous research indicates that donor-derived cell-free DNA (-cfDNA) is a promising noninvasive biomarker for the detection of AR and allograft injury. Our aim was to validate a clinical plasma -cfDNA assay for detection of AR and other allograft injury and to confirm and expand on -cfDNA and allograft injury associations observed in previous studies. METHODS. We measured -cfDNA fraction using a novel single-nucleotide polymorphism-based assay in prospectively collected plasma samples paired with clinical-pathologic diagnoses. -cfDNA fraction was compared across clinical-pathologic cohorts: stable, ACR, AMR, isolated lymphocytic bronchiolitis, CLAD/neutrophilic-responsive allograft dysfunction (NRAD), and INFXN. Performance characteristics were calculated for AR and combined allograft injury (AR + CLAD/NRAD + INFXN) versus the stable cohort. RESULTS. The study included 195 samples from 103 patients. Median -cfDNA fraction was significantly higher for ACR (1.43%, interquartile range [IQR]: 0.67%C2.32%, P = 5  10(?6)), AMR (2.50%, IQR: 2.06%C3.79%, P = 2  10(?5)), INFXN (0.74%, IQR: 0.46%C1.38%, P = 0.02), and CLAD/NRAD (1.60%, IQR: 0.57%C2.60%, P = 1.4  10(?4)) versus the stable cohort. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for AR versus stable was 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-0.98). Using a 1% -cfDNA fraction threshold, sensitivity for AR was 89.1% (95% CI: 76.2%-100.0%), specificity 82.9% (95% CI: 73.3%-92.4%), positive predictive value, 51.9% (95% CI: 37.5%-66.3%), and negative predictive value, 97.3% (95% CI: 94.3%-100%).

Maternal antibodies represent the main shield of neonate mammals for most of the infections. Two recombinant antigens (SA35 and SA40), portions of two C. parvum proteins, were tested for their ability to induce immune responses in adult mice and for protection on neonate BALB/c mice born from females immunised by mucosal delivery of both peptides. METHODS: Adult BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally immunised with SA35 and SA40, separately or mixed, and their immune response was characterised. Furthermore, BALB/c pregnant mice were immunised by mucosal delivery with an SA35/40 mix, before and during pregnancy. Soon after birth, their offspring were infected with two doses (1  10(5) and 5  10(3)) of C. parvum oocysts and the parasitic burden was determined at 5 and 9 days post-infection. RESULTS: Intraperitoneal immunisation with SA35 and SA40 induced specific IgG and IgG1 in serum, specific IgA in the intestinal mucosa, increase of CD3+/CD4+ and CD30+ cells in splenocytes, which produced IFN-. Neonates born from immunised mice and infected with 1  10(5) oocysts showed a significant reduction of oocysts and intestinal forms (23 and 42%, respectively).

Because of the rising antimicrobial resistance rates and adverse effects of childhood antibiotic use on the developing microbiome, rational prescribing of antibiotics for CAP is important. This review summarizes and critically reflects on the available evidence for the epidemiology, etiology and antimicrobial management of childhood CAP. Larger prospective studies on antimicrobial management derive mostly from low- or middle-income countries as they have the highest burden of CAP. Optimal antimicrobial management depends on the etiology, age, local vaccination policies and resistance patterns. As long as non-rapid surrogate markers are used to distinguish viral- from bacterial pneumonia, the management is probably suboptimal. For a young child with signs of non-severe pneumonia (with or without wheezing), watchful waiting is recommended because of probable viral etiology. For children with more severe CAP with fever, a five-day oral amoxicillin course would be the first choice therapy and dosage will depend on local resistance rates. There is no clear evidence yet for superiority of a macrolide-based regimen for all ages. For cases with CAP requiring hospitalization, several studies have shown that narrow-spectrum IV beta-lactam therapy is as effective as a broad-spectrum cephalosporin therapy. For most severe disease, broad-spectrum therapy with or without a macrolide is suggested.

Those caring for critically ill patients are especially susceptible due to high patient mortality, long hours, and regular encounters with trauma and ethical issues. Interventions to prevent burnout in this population are needed. Preliminary studies suggest debriefing sessions may reduce burnout. This study aims to assess whether participation in regular debriefing can prevent burnout in intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in two large academic medical centers. Two hundred ICU clinicians will be recruited with target enrollment of 100 physicians and 100 non-physicians (nurses, pharmacists, therapists). Participants must have worked in the ICU for the equivalent of at least 1 full time work week in the preceding 4 weeks. Enrolled subjects will be randomized to virtually attend biweekly debriefing sessions facilitated by a psychotherapist for 3 months or to a control arm without sessions. Our debriefs are modeled after Death Cafs, which are informal discussions focusing on death, dying, loss, grief, and illness. These sessions allow for reflection on distressing events and offer community and collaboration among hospital employees outside of work. The primary outcome is clinician burnout as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Score. Secondary outcomes include depression and anxiety, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), respectively. Questionnaires will be administered prior to the intervention, at 1 month, at 3 months, and at 6 months after enrollment. These values will be compared between groups temporally. Qualitative feedback will also be collected and analyzed. DISCUSSION: With ICU clinician burnout rates exceeding 50%, Death Caf debriefing sessions may prove to be an effective tool to avert this debilitating syndrome. With COVID-19 limiting social interactions and overloading ICUs worldwide, the virtual administration of the Death Caf for ICU clinicians provides an innovative strategy to potentially mitigate burnout in this vulnerable population.

The molecular characteristics of the virus that predict better or worse outcome are largely still being discovered. Methods: We downloaded 155,958 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from GISAID and evaluated whether variants improved prediction of reported severity beyond age and region. We also evaluated specific variants to determine the magnitude of association with severity and the frequency of these variants among the genomes. Results: Logistic regression models that included viral genomic variants outperformed other models (AUC=0.91 as compared with 0.68 for age and gender alone; p<0.001). Among individual variants, we found 17 single nucleotide variants in SARS-CoV-2 have more than two-fold greater odds of being associated with higher severity and 67 variants associated with []0.5 times the odds of severity. The median frequency of associated variants was 0.15% (interquartile range 0.09%-0.45%). Altogether 85% of genomes had at least one variant associated with patient outcome. Conclusion: Numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants have two-fold or greater association with odds of mild or severe outcome and collectively, these variants are common.

Clinical presentation suggests rapid viral dissemination to the central nervous system leading frequently to severe symptoms including viral meningitis. Here, we provide a comprehensive expression landscape of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins across human postmortem nasal and olfactory tissue. Sagittal sections through the human nose complemented with immunolabelling of respective cell types represent different anatomically defined regions including olfactory epithelium, respiratory epithelium of the nasal conchae and the paranasal sinuses along with the hardly accessible human olfactory bulb. ACE2 can be detected in the olfactory epithelium as well as in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal septum, the nasal conchae, and the paranasal sinuses. ACE2 is located in the sustentacular cells and in the glandular cells in the olfactory epithelium as well as in the basal cells, glandular cells, and epithelial cells of the respiratory epithelium. Intriguingly, ACE2 is not expressed in mature or immature olfactory receptor neurons and basal cells in the olfactory epithelium. Similarly, ACE2 is not localized in the olfactory receptor neurons albeit the olfactory bulb is positive. Vice versa, TMPRSS2 can also be detected in the sustentacular cells and the glandular cells of the olfactory epithelium.

Moreover, there have been limited evaluations to date of the impact of these sociodemographic factors on the use of telephone versus video visits. Such assessments are crucial to identify, understand, and address differences in care delivery across patient populations, particularly those that could affect access to or quality of care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine changes in ambulatory visit volume and type (ie, in-person vs virtual and telephone vs video visits) by patient sociodemographics during the COVID-19 pandemic at one urban academic medical center. METHODS: We compared volumes and patient sociodemographics (age, sex, race, insurance) for visits during the first 11 weeks following the COVID-19 national emergency declaration (March 15 to May 31, 2020) to visits in the corresponding weeks in 2019. Additionally, for visits during the COVID-19 study period, we examined differences in visit type (ie, in-person versus virtual, and telephone versus video visits) by sociodemographics using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Total visit volumes in the COVID-19 study period comprised 51.4% of the corresponding weeks in 2019 (n=80,081 vs n=155,884 visits). Although patient sociodemographics between the COVID-19 study period in 2020 and the corresponding weeks in 2019 were similar, 60.5% (n=48,475) of the visits were virtual, compared to 0% in 2019. Of the virtual visits, 61.2% (n=29,661) were video based, and 38.8% (n=18,814) were telephone based. In the COVID-19 study period, virtual (vs in-person) visits were more likely among patients with race categorized as other (vs White) and patients with Medicare (vs commercial) insurance and less likely for men, patients aged 0-17 years, 65-74 years, or &#8805;75 years (compared to patients aged 18-45 years), and patients with Medicaid insurance or insurance categorized as other. Among virtual visits, compared to telephone visits, video visits were more likely to be adopted by patients aged 0-17 years (vs 18-45 years), but less likely for all other age groups, men, Black (vs White) patients, and patients with Medicare or Medicaid (vs commercial) insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual visits comprised the majority of ambulatory visits during the COVID-19 study period, of which a majority were by video.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresSymptomatic COVID-19 cases confirmed by real time RT-PCR and hospitalization within 28 days of symptom onset of confirmed COVID-19 case. ResultsOverall, 49.8% of children tested were seropositive over the course of the study. There were also 207 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases, 12 (6.4%) of which were severe enough to require hospitalization. Incidence of COVID-19 was highest among children aged <2 years--16.1 per 100 person-years (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 12.5, 20.5)--approximately three times that of children in any other age group assessed. Additionally, 41 (19.8%) symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 episodes were re-infections, with younger children slightly more protected against symptomatic reinfection. Among children aged 6-59 months, protection was 61% (Rate Ratio [RR]:0.39, 95% CI:0.2,0.8), while protection among children aged 5-9 and 10-14 years was 64% (RR:0.36,0.2,0.7), and 49% (RR:0.51,0.3-0.9), respectively.

Cumulative number of tests, incidence, hospitalizations and deaths per 100,000 inhabitants were analysed for the five Danish regions and for all of Denmark. The cumulative number of tested and incidence of COVID-19 per 100,000 was compared for the two municipalities, Lolland and Gentofte. A sensitivity analysis of the COVID-19 indicators on a regional level was performed using number of tested as the denominator. Results: The Capital Region ranked highest on all analysed COVID-19 indicators with 10,849 tested, 365 cases, 63 hospitalized and 18 deaths per 100,000 by 2 June 2020. The three regions in western Denmark all had low levels, while Region Zealand ranked second highest. Despite general low health status in Lolland municipality, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was consistently below that of Gentofte. Sensitivity analysis showed that the Capital Region had the highest number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 tested, but Region Zealand had a higher number of hospitalized and similar number of deaths per 100,000 tested as the Capital Region over time. Conclusion: COVID-19 had affected eastern Denmark, especially the Capital Region, considerably more than western Denmark.

We propose an alternative modeling method wherein interpretation is only provided to the relative positions of opinions vis-\\\\\`a-vis each other. This method is then considered in a similar setting as the discrete-time Altafini model (an extension of the well-known DeGroot model), but with more general influence weights. Even in a linear framework, the model can describe, in the long run, polarization, dynamics with a periodic pattern, and (modulus) consensus formation. In addition, in our alternative approach key characteristics of the opinion dynamic can be derived from real-valued square matrices of influence weights, which immediately allows one to transfer matrix theory insights to the field of opinion formation dynamics under more relaxed conditions than in the DeGroot or discrete-time Altafini models. A few specific themes are covered: (i) We demonstrate how stable patterns in relative opinion dynamics are identified which are hidden when opinions are considered in an absolute opinion framework. (ii) For the two-agent case, we provide an exhaustive closed-form description of the relative opinion model's dynamic in the long run. (iii) We explore group dynamics analytically, in particular providing a non-trivial condition under which a subgroup's asymptotic behavior carries over to the entire population.","output":"A relative approach to opinion formation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A personal narrative is presented which explores the author's experience as specialist community public health nursing (SCPHN) student training in public health in Great Britain during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic","output":"Voice of a Student Special"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Confirmed SARS-CoV-2-caused disease (COVID-19) cases have reached 275.65 million worldwide.

Then, we evaluated the pathological, immunological changes and sequelae in the major organs. Finally, we reviewed the immunological memory after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. The binding of SARS-Cov-2 to ACE2 receptor results in reduced ACE2 protein levels, which may lead to elevated susceptibility to inflammation, cell death, organ failure, and potentially severe illness. These damages increase the risk of health problems over a long period, which result in many complications. The complications in multiple organs lead to the increased risk of long-term health problems that require additional attention.

METHODS: Public Health England conducts invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in England. IPD trends during 2000/01-2019/20 were analysed and cases between during February-June 2020 were linked with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess risk factors for death. RESULTS: IPD incidence in 2019/20 (7.6/100,000; n=3,964) was 30% (IRR 0.70, 95%CI, 0.18-2.67) lower compared to 2018/19 (10.9/100,000; n=5,666) with large reductions observed across all age-groups during March-June 2020. The serotypes responsible for IPD during 2019/20 were similar to previous years. There were 160,886 SARS-CoV-2 and 1,137 IPD cases during February-June 2020, including 40 IPD/COVID-19 (0.025% [95%sCI, 0.018-0.034] of SARS-CoV-2 infections; 3.5% [95%CI, 2.5-4.8] of IPD cases), 21 with COVID-19 diagnosed 3-27 days after IPD and 27 who developed COVID-19 28 days after IPD. Case-fatality rates (CFR) were 63.2% (25/40), 47.6% (10/21) and 33.3% (9/27), respectively (p<0.001). In addition to an independent association with increasing age and pneumococcal serotype group, CFR was 7.8-fold (95% CI, 3.8-15.8) higher in those with IPD/COVID-19 co-infection and 3.9-fold (95% CI, 1.4-10.7) higher in patients who developed COVID-19 3-27 days after IPD compared to patients with IPD only. CONCLUSIONS: Large declines in IPD were observed following COVID-19 lockdown in England. IPD/COVID-19 confections were rare but associated with high CFR, mainly in older adults. The rarity, age distribution and serotype distribution of IPD/SARS-CoV-2 coinfections does not support wider extension of pneumococcal vaccination.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Invasive Pneumococcal Disease and Risk of Pneumococcal Coinfection with SARS-CoV-2: prospective national cohort study, England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its global health and socioeconomic aftereffects, the enduring state of crisis is increasingly impacting the coping capacity of the populations.

RESULTS: The Impact of Event Scale (IES-R) and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-21 items (DASS-21) were used to screen for post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and stress. The prevalence of PTSD was 41.6% and was associated with severe or extremely severe stress (27.8%), anxiety (31.4%), and depression (39.0%). All disorders were strongly correlated with one another. The risk of developing PTSD was independently associated with residence in high COVID-19 prevalence region (OR = 2.25, p = 0.004), poor (OR = 3.98, p = 0.002), or moderate (OR = 1.63, p = 0.048) self-assessed overall physical health, psychiatric comorbidity (OR = 1.87, p = 0.036), number of COVID-19-like symptoms (OR = 1.94, p = 0.039), and severe COVID-19 morbidity in the acquaintances (OR = 1.54, p = 0.026).

OBJECTIVE: We adapted a neighborhood-wide analysis study (NWAS) design to systematically examine associations between neighborhood characteristics and COVID-19 incidence among different age groups. METHODS: The number of daily cumulative cases of COVID-19 by zip code area in Illinois has been made publicly available by the Illinois Department of Public Health. The number of COVID-19 cases was reported for eight age groups (under 20, 20C29, 30C39, 40C49, 50C59, 60C69, 70C79, and 80+). We reviewed this data published from May 23 through June 17, 2020 with complete data for all eight age groups and linked the data to neighborhood characteristics measured by the American Community Survey (ACS). Geographic age-specific cumulative incidence (cases per 1000 people) of COVID-19 was calculated by dividing the number of daily cumulative cases by the population of the same age group at each zip code area. The association between individual characteristics and COVID-19 incidence was examined using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: At the zip code level, neighborhood socioeconomic status was a more important risk factor of COVID-19 incidence in children and working-age adults than in seniors. Social demographics and housing conditions were important risk factors of COVID-19 incidence in older age groups. We additionally observed significant associations between transportation-related variables and COVID-19 incidences in multiple age groups.

Thus, we developed and delivered an e-learning training course to professional caregivers on using a web-based tool for psychosocial interventions for people with dementia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of an e-learning course in combination with a web-based tool in addressing neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was used in Tokyo, Japan. The e-learning course was delivered three times to professional caregivers between July and December 2020. Caregivers who completed the course assessed the level of neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with dementia using the total score from the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) via a web-based tool. The primary outcome measures were the number of caregivers who implemented follow-up NPI evaluations by March 2021 and the change in NPI scores from baseline to their most recent follow-up evaluations. As a control group, information was also obtained from professional caregivers who completed a face-to-face training course using the same web-based tool between July 2019 and March 2020. RESULTS: A total of 268 caregivers completed the e-learning course in 2020. Of the 268 caregivers, 56 (20.9%) underwent follow-up evaluations with 63 persons with dementia. The average NPI score was significantly reduced from baseline (mean 20.4, SD 16.2) to the most recent follow-up evaluations (mean 14.3, SD 13.4). The effect size was assumed to be medium (Cohen d(rm [repeated measures])=0.40). The control group consisted of 252 caregivers who completed a face-to-face training course. Of the 252 caregivers, 114 (45.2%) underwent follow-up evaluations. Compared to the control group, caregivers who completed the e-learning course were significantly less likely to implement follow-up evaluations ((2)(1)=52.0, P<.001). The change in NPI scores did not differ according to the type of training course (baseline-adjusted difference=C0.61, P=.69). CONCLUSIONS: The replacement of face-to-face training with e-learning may have provided professionals with an opportunity to participate in the dementia behavior analysis and support enhancement (DEMBASE) program who may not have participated in the program otherwise. Although the program showed equal efficacy in terms of the two training courses, the feasibility was suboptimal with lower implementation levels for those receiving e-learning training. Thus, further strategies should be developed to improve feasibility by providing motivational triggers for implementation and technical support for care professionals.

We devised a proteomic screen to examine the influence of SLiM sequence context on protein-protein interactions. Focusing on the EVH1 domain of human ENAH, an actin regulator that is highly expressed in invasive cancers, we screened 36-residue proteome-derived peptides and discovered new interaction partners of ENAH and diverse mechanisms by which context influences binding. A pocket on the ENAH EVH1 domain that has diverged from other Ena/VASP paralogs recognizes extended SLiMs and favors motif-flanking proline residues. Many high-affinity ENAH binders that contain two proline-rich SLiMs use a noncanonical site on the EVH1 domain for binding and display a thermodynamic signature consistent with the two-motif chain engaging a single domain. We also found that photoreceptor cilium actin regulator (PCARE) uses an extended 23-residue region to obtain a higher affinity than any known ENAH EVH1-binding motif. Our screen provides a way to uncover the effects of proteomic context on motif-mediated binding, revealing diverse mechanisms of control over EVH1 interactions and establishing that SLiMs cant be fully understood outside of their native context.","output":"Native proline-rich motifs exploit sequence context to target actin-remodeling Ena/VASP protein ENAH"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Book reviewed in this article: Feline medicine Consultations in Feline Internal Medicine:J.

Here, we compared the immune responses and protection effects in vaccination of mice with Ad-UMAS by five vaccination routes including intramuscular (i.m.), intravenous (i.v.), subcutaneous (s.c.), intraoral (i.o.), and intranasal (i.n.). Much higher levels of T. gondii-specific IgG and IgA antibodies were detected in the sera of the intraoral and intranasal vaccination groups on day 49 compared with controls (p < 0.05).

The present study was designed to augment the cardiogenic potential of cardiac c-Kit+ cells through class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition and evaluate their therapeutic potency in the chronic heart failure (CHF) animal model. Myocardial infarction (MI) was created by coronary artery occlusion in rats. c-Kit+ cells were treated with mocetinostat (MOCE), a specific class I HDAC inhibitor. At 3 weeks after MI, CHF animals were retrogradely infused with untreated (control) or MOCE-treated c-Kit+ cells (MOCE/c-Kit+ cells) and evaluated at 3 weeks after cell infusion. We found that class I HDAC inhibition in c-Kit+ cells elevated the level of acetylated histone H3 (AcH3) and increased AcH3 levels in the promoter regions of pluripotent and cardiac-specific genes. Epigenetic changes were accompanied by increased expression of cardiac-specific markers. Transplantation of CHF rats with either control or MOCE/c-Kit+ cells resulted in an improvement in cardiac function, retardation of CHF remodeling made evident by increased vascularization and scar size, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy reduction. Compared with CHF infused with control cells, infusion of MOCE/c-Kit+ cells resulted in a further reduction in left ventricle end-diastolic pressure and total collagen and an increase in interleukin-6 expression. The low engraftment of infused cells suggests that paracrine effects might account for the beneficial effects of c-Kit+ cells in CHF. In conclusion, selective inhibition of class I HDACs induced expression of cardiac markers in c-Kit+ cells and partially augmented the efficacy of these cells for CHF repair.

Public debates question its impact ompared with reliance on individual responsibility. We aim at understanding how rationally chosen self-protective behavior impacts the spread of the epidemics. We want to, first, assess the value of lockdown compared to a counterfactual that incorporates self-protection efforts under unknown disease prevalence; and second, assess how individual behavior modify the epidemic dynamics when mandatory policies are relaxed. We couple an SLIAR model, that includes asymptomatic transmission, with utility maximization: Individuals trade off economic and wellbeing costs from physical distancing with a lower infection risk. Effort depends on risk aversion, perceptions, and the value of contacts. In a Nash equilibrium, individual uncoordinated efforts yield average contact intensity, which drives epidemic transmission. Equilibrium effort differs markedly from constant, stochastic or proportional contacts reduction. It adjusts to reported cases in a way that creates a slightly decreasing plateau in epidemic prevalence. Calibration on French data shows that the number of deaths with no lockdown but equilibrium efforts is only 1/6 to 1/10 of the number predicted with business-as-usual. However, lockdown saves at least 50% more lives than individual efforts alone. Prolonged weaker restrictions prevent an exponential rebound. Public policies post-lockdown have a limited impact as they partly crowd out individual efforts. Compulsory mask wearing helps resume activity but has no impact on the epidemic.

Both comic and video were favorably reviewed, but a higher proportion of respondents rated the video more positively than the comic for likability (P < 0.01), comprehensibility (P < 0.05), and increasing understanding (P < 0.05). Patients' knowledge of some concussion symptoms emphasized in the comic increased after reading (emotional changes, P = 0.02; vomiting, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients showed increased concussion knowledge using the favorably endorsed comic-based discharge instructions. Using comic-based supplemental discharge tools may optimize concussion education for adolescents.","output":"The Feasibility of Using Comic-Based Concussion Discharge Instructions: Gauging Likeability and Knowledge Improvement Among Adolescents and Parents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Twenty percent of women referred to colposcopy have a type 3 transformation zone-where colposcopic assessment for high-grade dysplasia (CIN2+) is not possible. This study examines the effectiveness of HPV biomarkers and genotyping in combination with techniques that sample an endocervical TZ. METHODS A prospective diagnostic accuracy study. Women booked for large-loop excision (LLETZ) with squamous dyskaryosis, high-risk HPV and a TZ3 were recruited. Immediately prior to LLETZ samples were collected for p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology, HPV genotyping and H&E, p16- and Ki-67-stained endocervical curettings. RESULTS In women with low-grade screening (n = 64), 35.9% had CIN2+; dual-stained cytology had the greatest effect on the PPV of routine screening (76.1% vs 35.9%) and perfectly predicted the absence of CIN2+. In women with a high-grade screening result (n = 37); 75.6% had CIN2+ and dual-stained curettings improved the PPV (96.5 vs 75.6%). CONCLUSIONS With high-grade screening and a TZ3, LLETZ appears safest as three quarters have CIN2+ . Women with low-grade screening and a TZ3 have a twofold increased risk of CIN2+ when compared to women where the TZ is visible. The use of dual-stained cytology may help identify those women who can be safely offered surveillance and those who require treatment.","output":"The use of biomarkers and HPV genotyping to improve diagnostic accuracy in women with a transformation zone type 3."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as a pandemic in March 2020, and more than 117 million people worldwide have been confirmed to have been infected. Scientists, medical professionals, and other stakeholders are racing against time to find and develop effective medicines for COVID-19. However, no drug with high efficacy to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection has been approved. With the increasing popularity of gene therapy, scientists have explored the utilization of small RNAs such as microRNAs as therapeutics. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs with high affinity for the 3-UTRs of targeted messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Interactions between host cells and viral genomes may induce the upregulation or downregulation of various miRNAs. Therefore, understanding the expression patterns of these miRNAs and their functions will provide insights into potential miRNA-based therapies.

Although CanSino is currently approved for use in 10 Latin American, Asian, and European countries, little information is available about its vaccine effectiveness (VE). MethodsWe evaluated CanSino VE within a childcare worker cohort that included 1,408 childcare facilities. Participants were followed during March-December 2021 and tested through SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR or rapid antigen test if they developed any symptom compatible with COVID-19. Vaccination status was obtained through worker registries. VE was calculated as 100% x (1-hazard ratio for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated vs. unvaccinated participants), using an Andersen-Gill model adjusted for age, sex, state, and local viral circulation. ResultsThe cohort included 43,925 persons who were mostly (96%) female with a median age of 32 years; 37,646 (86%) were vaccinated with CanSino. During March-December 2021, 2,250 (5%) participants had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of whom 25 were hospitalized and 6 died. Adjusted VE was 20% (95% CI = 10-29%) against illness, 76% (42-90%) against hospitalization, and 94% (66-99%) against death. VE against illness declined from 48% (95% CI = 33-61) after 14-60 days following full vaccination to 20% (95% CI = 9-31) after 61-120 days. ConclusionsCanSino vaccine was effective at preventing COVID-19 illness and highly effective at preventing hospitalization and death. It will be useful to further evaluate duration of protection and assess the value of booster doses to prevent COVID-19 and severe outcomes. SummaryWe evaluated CanSino (Adv5-nCoV) COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness during March-December 2021 using a childcare worker cohort that included 43,925 participants across Mexico.

DESIGN We conducted a systematic review of early published, peer-reviewed, original research where researchers presented data from adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients regarding their presenting signs, symptoms and definitive survival outcomes. DATA SOURCES We searched the databases PubMed, CINAHL and Scopus for relevant articles published between 1 January 2020 - 18 May 2020. REVIEW METHODS We extracted data from each study and synthesized data across primary sources using a literature matrix table to provide a global impression of this rapidly growing body of literature RESULTS: We retrieved 97 mainly descriptive observational studies. SARS-CoV-2 is efficiently transmitted between humans, particularly those in close contact. Symptomatic COVID-19 patients can present with a broad array of nonspecific symptoms. Fever and cough are the most commonly reported symptoms; some patients have atypical presentations. In patients with respiratory decompensation, disease progression can be rapid. Some patients experience mild symptoms that are self-limited; others experience organ failure and death. Risk factors for poor outcomes include older age, chronic medical conditions, male gender, obesity and presenting with signs of declining respiratory status. CONCLUSION Nurses can mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and sequelae of COVID-19 with prompt and capable responses.

METHODS: This is a two-wave prospective study among Dutch adolescents using data collected up to one year before the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 224) and 5C8 weeks after the first introduction of lockdown measures (n = 158). Mental well-being was assessed by three indicators: life satisfaction, internalizing symptoms, and psychosomatic health. General linear model repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to assess whether mental well-being has changed and if this differed by sex. Univariate linear regressions were used to assess associations between COVID-19Crelated concerns and a change in mental well-being. RESULTS: Life satisfaction decreased ((2)(p) = .079, p < .001), but no change in internalizing symptoms was observed ((2)(p) = .014, p = .14), and psychosomatic health increased ((2)(p) = .194, p < .001) after the introduction of lockdown measures.

An up-to-date understanding of this examination is critical for programs to develop an appropriate curriculum and for individuals to identify learning resources. This study presents an updated analysis of the basic science section of the OITE from 2014 to 2019. METHODS: All questions from the OITE from 2014 to 2019 were reviewed. Each question from the basic science section was categorized by topic and taxonomy. The use of radiographic images or other clinical media was recorded. The reference section was analyzed for bibliometric factors. Pearson chi-square tests were used as appropriate for statistical comparison. RESULTS: In total, 185 of 1,600 questions in the basic science section were used over the 6-year study period (11.6%). The proportion of basic science questions ranged from 10.7% to 12.0% from year to year. The most frequently tested topics were cellular and molecular biology (23.8%), physiology/pathophysiology (16.8%), and pharmacology (10.8%). There was an increase in the number of biostatistics questions from 2017 to 2019 compared with the number from 2014 to 2016 (P = 0.02). The most common taxonomic category was knowledge recall (89.7%). A total of 383 references were cited from 122 sources.

This virus is spread by coughing or sneezing and can infect other persons by on contacting mucous membranes. SARS-Cov-2 most frequent serious manifestation is pneumonia. Chest computed tomography in COVID-19 patients usually shows ground-glass opacities that may be accompanied by consolidation lesions. Early diagnosis of the disease and rapid isolation of the patient is of great importance. So far, confirmation of COVID-19 infection is made by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal or respiratory specimens. Recent research reported that the sensitivity of computed tomography in diagnosing COVID-19 is 98% while RT-PCR sensitivity is 71%. Herein, we compare the sensitivity of both chest CT and RT-PCR in diagnosing COVID-19 at initial patient presentation through a meta-analysis study. MAIN BODY: Using MEDLINE database a systematic literature search was conducted to identify relevant published studies within from November 2019 to April 2020. Only articles with full text were examined to determine eligibility and extract data by two reviewers. It was decided to include studies mentioning sensitivity of chest CT scan and sensitivity of RT-PCR and both done at the same time. RESULTS: Potentially relevant 15,300 studies were identified in our search in MEDLINE whose titles were quickly reviewed. Potentially eligible studies missing any of the forementioned inclusion criteria were excluded. This process left 7 eligible articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were thus included in the meta-analysis and used for further analyses.

Few comprehensive analyses of the sources and uses of funds are available. This results in inadequate information on which to base investment decisions because not all sources allow equal latitude to explore hypotheses having scientific or clinical importance and creates a barrier to judging the value of research to society. OBJECTIVE To quantify funding trends from 1994 to 2004 of basic, translational, and clinical biomedical research by principal sponsors based in the United States. DESIGN Publicly available data were compiled for the federal, state, and local governments; foundations; charities; universities; and industry. Proprietary (by subscription but openly available) databases were used to supplement public sources. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Total actual research spending, growth rates, and type of research with inflation adjustment. RESULTS Biomedical research funding increased from 37.1 billion dollars in 1994 to 94.3 billion dollars in 2003 and doubled when adjusted for inflation. Principal research sponsors in 2003 were industry (57%) and the National Institutes of Health (28%). Relative proportions from all public and private sources did not change. Industry sponsorship of clinical trials increased from 4.0 dollars to 14.2 billion dollars (in real terms) while federal proportions devoted to basic and applied research were unchanged. The United States spent an estimated 5.6% of its total health expenditures on biomedical research, more than any other country, but less than 0.1% for health services research. From an economic perspective, biotechnology and medical device companies were most productive, as measured by new diagnostic and therapeutic devices per dollar of research and development cost. Productivity declined for new pharmaceuticals. CONCLUSIONS Enhancing research productivity and evaluation of benefit are pressing challenges, requiring (1) more effective translation of basic scientific knowledge to clinical application; (2) critical appraisal of rapidly moving scientific areas to guide investment where clinical need is greatest, not only where commercial opportunity is currently perceived; and (3) more specific information about sources and uses of research funds than is generally available to allow informed investment decisions.

The purpose of this study is to characterize the CT findings of 30 children from mainland China who had laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Although recent American College of Radiology recommendations assert that CT should not be used as a screening or diagnostic tool for patients with suspected COVID-19, radiologists should be familiar with the imaging appearance of this disease to identify its presence in patients undergoing CT for other reasons. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We retrospectively reviewed the CT findings and clinical symptoms of 30 pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were seen at six centers in China from January 23, 2020, to February 8, 2020. Patient age ranged from 10 months to 18 years. Patients older than 18 years of age or those without chest CT examinations were excluded. Two cardiothoracic radiologists and a cardiothoracic imaging fellow characterized and scored the extent of lung involvement. Cohen kappa coefficient was used to calculate interobserver agreement between the readers. RESULTS. Among children, CT findings were often negative (77%). Positive CT findings seen in children included ground-glass opacities with a peripheral lung distribution, a crazy paving pattern, and the halo and reverse halo signs. There was a correlation between increasing age and increasing severity of findings, consistent with reported symptomatology in children.

Susceptibility breakpoints for carbapenems and Enterobacterales were revised in response to the rise in resistance and the potential for standard doses of carbapenems to provide the necessary antibiotic exposure and to accurately identify rates of carbapenem resistance. Objectives: This review sought to identify real-world implications associated with lack of testing and reporting current carbapenem breakpoints and potential barriers that may impede implementation of these strategies. Methods: A literature review was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar electronic databases. Results: The failure to adopt revised breakpoints incurs negative clinical outcomes and carries increased cost implications. However, there were several impediments highlighted which are barriers for laboratories to implement breakpoint updates.

Although it has not been widely used in outpatient neurosurgery settings, the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has necessitated a broader adoption. Our goal is to show the level of patient satisfaction with their telemedicine care. METHODS: We prospectively studied consecutive telemedicine patients who scheduled outpatient neurosurgery visits from May 15 to June 8, 2020. Patients were seen by the surgeon via real-time video conferencing using Google Meet, and then completed a telemedicine satisfaction survey. Our primary outcome was telemedicine satisfaction scores. We compared satisfaction scores between new and established patients and between patients within and outside of a 15-mile radius of the nearest clinic location. Sensitivity analyses were performed to account for the nonrespondents. Descriptive and univariate analyses were performed. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Five-hundred and ninety patients completed a telemedicine visit during the study period. One patient from out of state was excluded. Three-hundred and ten patients (52.6%) responded. The average age was 60.9  13.60 years; 59% were female, 20.6% were new patients; the average distance to the clinic was 28.03  36.09 km (17.42  22.43 miles).

The Vaccination Guidelines Group gathered scientific and demographic data during visits to Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, by discussion with national key opinion leaders, visiting veterinary practices and review of the scientific literature. A questionnaire survey was completed by 1390 veterinarians in five Latin American countries and the Vaccination Guidelines Group delivered continuing education at seven events attended by over 3500 veterinarians. The Vaccination Guidelines Group recognised numerous challenges in Latin America, for example: (1) lack of national oversight of the veterinary profession, (2) extraordinary growth in private veterinary schools of undetermined quality, (3) socioeconomic constraints on client engagement with preventive health care, (4) high regional prevalence of some key infectious diseases (e.g. feline leukaemia virus infection, canine visceral leishmaniosis), (5) almost complete lack of minimal antigen vaccine products as available in other markets, (6) relative lack of vaccine products with extended duration of immunity as available in other markets, (7) availability of vaccine products withdrawn from other markets (e.g. Giardia vaccine) or unique to Latin America (e.g. some Leishmania vaccines), (8) accessibility of vaccines directly by pet owners or breeders such that vaccination is not delivered under veterinary supervision, (9) limited availability of continuing education in veterinary vaccinology and lack of compulsion for continuing professional development and (10) limited peer\\\\reviewed published scientific data on small companion animal infectious diseases (with the exception of leishmaniosis) and lack of support for such academic research. In this document, the Vaccination Guidelines Group summarises the findings of this project and assesses in evidence\\\\based fashion the scientific literature pertaining to companion animal vaccine\\\\preventable diseases in Latin America. The Vaccination Guidelines Group makes some recommendations on undergraduate and postgraduate education and academic research. Recognising that current product availability in Latin America does not permit veterinarians in these countries to vaccinate according to the global World Small Animal Veterinary Association guidelines, the Vaccination Guidelines Group makes a series of pragmatic recommendations as to what might be currently achievable, and a series of aspirational recommendations as to what might be desirable for the future. The concept of vaccine husbandry is addressed via some simple guidelines for the management of vaccine products in the practice. Finally, the Vaccination Guidelines Group emphasises the global trend towards delivery of vaccination as one part of an annual health check or health care plan that reviews holistically the preventive health care needs of the individual pet animal. Latin American practitioners should transition towards these important new practices that are now well embedded in more developed veterinary markets. The document also includes 70 frequently asked questions and their answers; these were posed to the Vaccination Guidelines Group during our continuing education events and small group discussions and should address many of the issues surrounding delivery of vaccination in the Latin American countries.

Methods This cross-sectional study on DHCPs was carried out at five dental teaching hospitals/colleges in four provinces of Saudi Arabia from October to December 2020. A 35-item valid and reliable questionnaire was used to assess the concerns, perceived impact, and preparedness of DHCPs in the COVID-19 pandemic. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to compare parameters between the clinical and non-clinical staff. Results A total of 320 DHCPs participated in this study with proportion of clinical staff (57.5%) surpassing the non-clinical staff (42.5%). The clinical DHCPs felt greater odds of falling ill with COVID-19 than non-clinical workers (OR, 2.61) and willing to look for another job (OR, 3.50). The higher proportion in both groups was worried that people close to them would be at higher exposure risk (96.3%) however, slightly more clinical DHCPs were concerned for their children than a non-clinical worker (OR, 3.57). The clinical DHCPs have greater odds of worrying that people would avoid them and their family members because of their job (OR, 2.75). A higher proportion in both groups (75.0%, 63.2%) felt that they would feel stress at work. More non-clinical DHCPs (94.1%) had received training for infection control than clinical (94.1% vs 63.0%: OR 0.10). Similarly, more DHCPs in the nonclinical group received adequate personal protective equipment training (88.2%;OR, 0.48).

RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 66  14 years and 15 (71.4%) patients were men. Sixteen (76.2%) patients had chronic medical illnesses. Twelve (57.1%) patients were overweight. Decreased lymphocyte proportions were observed in 17 (81.0%) patients on admission.

This introduction will offer context by outlining some of the most pressing contemporary issues relating to gender inequality and the film industry. It will establish the urgency of having more women in key creative roles with the power to change our stories and storytelling; establish the absence of women as a pressing cultural issue; review the data on womens position in the industry, in front of and behind the camera; identify issues regarding inequality of funding; highlight the importance of increasing the numbers of women in production roles as an employment equality issue; and evaluate the effectiveness of a number of positive action measures. The changing social and political landscape within which gender equality demands have surfaced and circulated will be explored. The work of activist groups and individuals has also emerged as a force to be reckoned with and their contribution, through lobbying, advocacy and other means of maintaining public awareness, will be assessed here. It will be suggested that an acknowledgement and assessment of power relations is crucial to understanding womens continuing subordination in the industry, with power being understood as a struggle over interests and conscious and unconscious exclusionary practices. The introduction will also outline the debates that follow in each of the chapters. It will critically review the rate and pace of change; compare and contrast policies and practices that are emerging to address the issues and assess patterns of continuity and change. Chapters are underpinned by a feminist analysis of an industry that has sidelined womens contribution, providing a coherence to the collection.

It asks whether the person-level predictors of Covid-19 that are identified in reports by Public Health England and by the Office of National Statistics also hold at a neighbourhood scale, remaining evident in the differences between neighbours. In examining this, the paper focuses on localised differences in the number of deaths, putting forward an innovative method of analysis that looks at the differences between places that share a border. Specifically, a difference across spatial boundaries method is employed to consider whether a higher number of deaths in one neighbourhood, when compared to its neighbours, is related to other differences between those contiguous locations. It is also used to map localised 'hot spots' and to look for spatial variation in the regression coefficients. The results are compared to those for a later period, April 18 - May 31. The findings show that despite some spatial diffusion of the disease, a greater number of deaths continues to be associated with Asian and Black ethnic groups, socio-economic disadvantage, very large households (likely indicative of residential overcrowding), and fewer from younger age groups. The analysis adds to the evidence showing that age, wealth/deprivation, and ethnicity are key risk factors associated with higher mortality rates from Covid-19.","output":"Exploring the neighbourhood-level correlates of Covid-19 deaths in London using a difference across spatial boundaries method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We read with great interest the article COVID\\\\19: what if the brain had a role in causing the deaths? by Tassorelli and co\\\\workers, in which the authors generate and summarize hypotheses how SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 may enter the peripheral and central nervous system and cause life\\\\threatening complications [1].

Using subcellular live imaging within brain tissue, we show that microtubules in the apical process uniformly emanate for the pericentrosomal region, while microtubules in the basal fiber display a mixed polarity, reminiscent of the mammalian dendrite. We identify acentrosomal microtubule organizing centers localized in varicosities of the basal fiber. CAMSAP family members accumulate in these varicosities, where they control microtubule growth. Double knockdown of CAMSAP1 and 2 leads to a destabilization of the entire basal process. Finally, using live imaging of human fetal cortex, we reveal that this organization is conserved in basal radial glial cells, a related progenitor cell population associated with human brain size expansion.","output":"CAMSAPs organize an acentrosomal microtubule network from basal varicosities in radial glial cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute systemic diseases, such as severe infections, can lead to electrolyte and acid-base alterations.

Levels of electrolytes, base excess, pH, serum osmolality, and hematocrit, the first 2 weeks of hospitalization, were collected daily from the laboratory database and clinical data from patients medical records. We found that hyponatremia was present in 57% of the patients at admission and 2% in hypernatremia. However, within 2 weeks of hospitalization 42% of the patients developed hypernatremia, more frequently in critically ill patients. Lower levels of sodium and potassium during admission were associated with the need for mechanical ventilation. Decreased pH at admission was associated with both death and the need for mechanical ventilation. Hypernatremia in the ICU was combined with rising base excess and a higher pH. In the group without intensive care, potassium levels were significantly lower in the patients with severe hypernatremia. Presence of hypernatremia during the first 2 weeks of hospitalization was associated with 3.942 (95% CI 2.269C6.851) times higher odds of death.

SETTING: Eight Intensive Care Units (ICUs) from 6 hospitals in the Canary Islands (Spain). PATIENTS: COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. INTERVENTIONS: Determination of serum nitrate levels at ICU admission. MAIN VARIABLE OF INTEREST: Mortality at 30 days. RESULTS: Non-surviving (n=11) compared to surviving patients (n=42) showed higher APACHE-II (p<0.001) and SOFA scores (p=0.004), and higher serum nitrate levels (p=0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed serum nitrate levels to be associated to 30-day mortality after controlling for SOFA (OR=1.021; 95%CI=1.006-1.036; p=0.01) or APACHE-II (OR=1.023; 95%CI=1.006-1.041; p=0.01).

Early data from COVID-19 patients as well as previous studies from severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and other respiratory disorders show that the extent of lung fibrosis is associated with a higher mortality, prolonged ventilator dependence, and poorer long-term health prognosis. Current treatments to halt or reverse lung fibrosis are limited; thus, the rapid development of effective antifibrotic therapies is a major global medical need that will continue far beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic. Reproducible fibrosis screening assays with high signal-to-noise ratios and disease-relevant readouts such as extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition (the hallmark of fibrosis) are integral to any antifibrotic therapeutic development. Therefore, we have established an automated high-throughput and high-content primary screening assay measuring transforming growth factor-?

This assay combines longitudinal live cell imaging with multiparametric high-content analysis of ECM deposition. Using this assay, we have screened a library of 2743 small molecules representing approved drugs and late-stage clinical candidates. Confirmed hits were subsequently profiled through a suite of secondary lung fibroblast phenotypic screening assays quantifying cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. In silico target prediction and pathway network analysis were applied to the confirmed hits.

METHODS: A multi-center cross-sectional survey was conducted at Regensburg University Medical Center and ten teaching hospitals in South-East Germany from July 28(th) to October 15(th) 2021. RESULTS: Of 2662 participants, 2309 (91.8%) were fully vaccinated without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sick leave after first/second vaccination occurred in 239 (10.4%) and 539 (23.3%) participants. In multivariable logistic regression, the adjusted odds ratio for sick leave after first/second vaccination compared to BNT162b2 was 2.26/3.72 for mRNA-1237 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28-4.01/1.99-6.96) and 27.82/0.48 for ChAdOx1-S (95% CI 19.12-40.48/0.24-0.96). The actual median sick leave was one day (interquartile range (IQR) 0-2) after any vaccination. 251 participants (9.4%) reported a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection (median sick leave 14 days, IQR 10-21), 353 (13.3%) were quarantined at least once (median quarantine leave 14 days, IQR 10-14).

The mean age was 63.4 years, and 58.9% were men. The prevalence of myocardial injury was 37.2%. Sixty-five patients (13.2%) died during hospitalization, of which 49 (9.9%) had myocardial injury. Patients with myocardial injury were more likely to require mechanical ventilation (31.1% vs. 12.1%, p < 0.001) and inotropic support (2.7% vs. 0.0%, p < 0.01). They had higher mortality (26.8% vs. 5.2%, p < 0.001), shock (11.5% vs. 1.0%, p < 0.00), cardiac arrest (15.3% vs. 2.9%, p < 0.001), heart failure (7.1% vs. 0.3%, p < 0.001), stroke (2.7% vs. 0.3%, p=0.019), and significantly longer length of hospitalization (23.7 vs. 13.6 days, p < 0.001) than patients without myocardial injury. Four myocardial injury patients were diagnosed with ST-elevation or non-ST elevation MI. CONCLUSION Myocardial injury was frequent amongst hospitalized COVID-19 patients in British Columbia, and was associated with worse clinical outcomes and increased length of hospital stay.","output":"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND OUTCOMES OF COVID-19 PATIENTS WITH MYOCARDIAL INJURY: ONE-YEAR EXPERIENCE IN VANCOUVER, CANADA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review explores potential sources of weight bias and stigma during the COVID-19 pandemic, including quarantine-15 messages and discussion of obesity in media and public health campaigns. We examine evidence of the effects of weight bias on well-being during the pandemic and highlight unanswered questions to be addressed in future research. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies that have investigated weight change during stay-at-home orders have yielded mixed findings and relied predominantly on self-reported retrospective recall, thus providing weak evidence of a widespread quarantine-15 effect. No studies to date have evaluated the effects on weight stigma and health of obesity-focused COVID-19 media and public health messages. Individuals with a history of experiencing weight bias may be more vulnerable to binge eating and psychological distress during the pandemic.

Despite the advancement of research targeting pandemic containment measures, more strategies are still needed to alleviate the burden caused by this novel disease. In particular, optimal nutrition was proposed as a possible mitigating factor in the context of COVID-19. Indeed, the light is shed on balanced diets, such as the Mediterranean diet, which present the finest nutritional quality to support the immune system and other physiologic functions. In contrast, less varied diets that lack the needed nutrients and favor inflammation have been correlated with adverse health effects, including a hindered immune response, such as the western diet. Methods: This observational case control study aimed at exploring the possible associations between the different dietary patterns present among a sample of the Lebanese population and the COVID-19 occurrence and outcomes. An online survey collected information about the sociodemographic characteristics, health status, lifestyle, and dietary habits through the Mediterranean diet questionnaire and a semi-quantitative fod frequency questionnaire, and the COVID-19 infection and its burden. The sample consisted of 399 respondents divided into the case and control groups (37.6 and 62.4%, respectively) on the basis of the presence or absence of a COVID-19 infection history. Results: The participants in the case and control groups had average adherence to the Mediterranean diet and their dietary intake was closer to the western diet. However, the cases had a lower mean of the MedDiet score (p = 0.009). Food groups consumption analysis showed that this significant difference within the overall similar dietary patterns was due to a higher consumption of poultry and a trend toward decreased consumption of olive oil and increased read meat and alcohol intake among the cases. Additionally, gender influenced the levels of different foods' consumption. Nonetheless, the dietary intake did not impact the COVID-19 burden. Conclusion: It is recommended to adopt healthy food choices within the different dietary patterns for a better protection against COVID-19. These findings should be validated in larger-scale studies.","output":"Inverse Association Between the Mediterranean Diet and COVID-19 Risk in Lebanon: A Case-Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Value-of-information analysis (VOI) is a decision-theoretic approach that is used to inform reimbursement decisions, optimise trial design and set research priorities.

A broad inflammatory signature was observed, implicating activation of various immune and nonhematopoietic cell subsets.

It is characterized by infiltration of diverse inflammatory cells and thickening of pulmonary septum along with oxidative stress to airway epithelial cells. STAT6 is a nuclear transcription factor that plays a crucial role in orchestrating the immune response, but its function in tissue inflammatory injury has not been comprehensively studied. Here, we demonstrated that STAT6 activation can protect against particle-induced lung inflammatory injury by resisting oxidative stress. Specifically, genetic ablation of STAT6 was observed to worsen particle-induced lung injury mainly by disrupting the lungs' antioxidant capacity, as reflected by the downregulation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, an increase in malondialdehyde levels, and a decrease in glutathione levels. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) has been previously proved to positively regulate Nrf2 signals. In this study, silencing VDR expression in human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells consistently suppressed autophagy-mediated activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, thereby aggravating particle-induced cell damage. Mechanically, STAT6 activation promoted the nuclear translocation of VDR, which increased the transcription of autophagy-related genes and induced Nrf2 signals, and silencing VDR abolished these effects. Our research provides important insights into the role of STAT6 in oxidative damage and reveals its potential underlying mechanism. This information not only deepens the appreciation of STAT6 but also opens new avenues for the discovery of therapies for inflammatory respiratory system disorders.","output":"STAT6/VDR Axis Mitigates Lung Inflammatory Injury by Promoting Nrf2 Signaling Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to evaluate whether vaccination with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) prevents the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by influenza (influenza-associated CAP, IA-CAP) or other respiratory viruses in the elderly. METHODS: This analysis was part of the Community-Acquired Pneumonia immunization Trial in Adults (CAPiTA); a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 84 496 immunocompetent individuals aged 65 years. CAP was defined by clinical and radiological criteria, and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from all individuals referred to a sentinel centre with a clinical suspicion of pneumonia. Presence of influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 and 4, human adeno-, boca-, corona-, metapneumo-, rhino- and respiratory syncytial viruses was determined by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Of 3209 episodes of suspected pneumonia, viral aetiology was tested in 2917 and proportions with influenza virus, human metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus were 4.6%, 2.5% and 3.1%, respectively.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative interviews with community-based patients living with dementia and their carers during early months (May-August 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted remotely by telephone or video call with 30 patients living with dementia and 31 carers. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three main themes were derived relating to: 1) proactive care at the onset of COVID-19 restrictions, 2) avoidance of healthcare settings and services, and 3) difficulties with remote healthcare encounters. People living with dementia and their carers felt check-up calls were reassuring but limited in scope and content. Some avoided healthcare services, wishing to minimise COVID-19 risk, reduce NHS burden, or encountering technological barriers. Difficulties in remote consultations included lack of prompts to remember problems, dealing with new emerging problems, rescheduling/missed calls, and inclusion of the person with dementia's voice. CONCLUSION: While remote consultations could be effective, pro-active calls could be more structured around needs, and consideration should be given to replace non-verbal prompts to describe problems, particularly for new health concerns.

While low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), are particularly affected, evidence based on epidemiological studies from LMICs is both limited and heterogeneous. While nationally, Portugal has a relatively low level of air pollution, many major cities face with substantial air pollution problems.

Viral load, host innate-immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and comorbidities have a direct impact on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients and determine the diverse disease trajectories. The initial SARS-CoV-2 penetrance and replication in the host causes death of infected cells, determining the viral response. SARS-CoV-2 replication in the host triggers the activation of host antiviral immune mechanisms, determining the inflammatory response. While a healthy immune response is essential to eliminate infected cells and prevent spread of the virus, a dysfunctional immune response can result in a cytokine storm and hyperinflammation, contributing to disease progression. Current therapies for COVID-19 target the virus and/or the host immune system and may be complicated in their efficacy by comorbidities. Here we review the evidence for use of two classes of anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of COVID-19. We consider the clinical evidence regarding the timing and efficacy of their use, their potential limitations, current recommendations and the prospect of future studies by these and related therapies.","output":"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and glucocorticoids in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Altered motor control and proprioceptive deficits are associated with kinematics dysfunctions and may cause alterations in subacromial space (SAS) that could lead to shoulder pathologies. Dimensions of the subacromial space, as well as interventions aimed at its normal restitution, can be explored by ultrasound (US). OBJECTIVE To describe the effect of two shoulder girdle motor control exercises with cognitive training strategies on SAS dimensions, measured with US. METHODS Cognitive movement control strategies, with visual and haptic feedback were applied on 21 healthy participants. SAS dimensions were measured through in vivo variations of acromiohumeral (AHD) and coracohumeral distances (CHD) using US. RESULTS Our results show that as exercise repetitions are performed, an increasing trend in both measures can be observed, being wider for AHD (i.e. humeral head descent exercise) than CHD (i.e. scapular retraction exercise).

These models explain the pathogenesis of IgAN caused by the production of aberrant IgA, but it is believed further predisposing factors are present, including immunological, genetic, environmental, or nutritional factors that can influence the pathogenesis and that could be useful for development of precision nephrology and personalized therapy. Newly, the role of IL-6 in pathogenesis is becoming increasingly important. It is essential for glomerular immunoglobulin A deposition and the development of renal pathology in Cd37-deficient mice, even if the reason why levels of IL-6 are elevated in IgAN patients is not well understood. One attainable hypothesis on high levels of IL-6 in IgAN comes out from our recent whole genome DNA methylation screening in IgAN patients, that identified, among others, a hypermethylated region comprising Vault RNA 2-1 (VTRNA2-1), a non-coding RNA also known as precursor of miR-886 (pre-mi-RNA). Consistently, the VTRNA2-1 expression was found down-regulated in IgAN patients. Here we confirm that VTRNA2-1 is low expressed in IgAN subjects compared to HS and we found that also in transplanted IgAN patients (TP-IgAN), compared to non IgAN transplanted patients (TP), the VTRNA2-1 transcript was expressed at level very low. We found that in IgAN patients with downregulated VTRNA2-1, PKR is overactivated, coherently with the role of the VTRNA2-1 that binds to PKR and inhibits its phosphorylation. The loss of the VTRNA2-1 natural restrain causes, in turn, the activation of CREB by PKR. We found CREB, a classical cAMP-inducible CRE-binding factor interacting with a region of the IL-6 promoter and leading to IL-6 production, overactivated both in IgAN and in TP-IgAN patients. Effectively, in the same patients, we found elevated levels of IL-6 correlating with CREB and PKR phosphorylation. Since PKR is normally activated by bacterial and viral RNA we hypothesized that these microrganisms can further activate the PKR/CREB/IL-6 pathway leading to an excess of IL-6 production, explaining both the high levels of IL-6, both infection involvement in the disease, both cases of IgAN associated with COVID-19 infection and with COVID-19 RNA-vaccination, and recent data showing microbiota involvment in IgAN. Effectively, we found that Effectively, we sfound that both the RNA poly(I:C) and the COVID-19 RNA-vaccine stimulation significantly increase the IL-6 levels in IgAN patient PBMCs. The PKR/CREB/IL-6 pathway may be very important also in the setting of renal transplantation. We found that this pathway is upregulated also in IgAN transplanted patients. Recent studies showed that the cumulative risk of IgA nephropathy recurrence increases after transplant and is associated with a 3.7-fold greater risk of graft loss. Finally, we showed that the IL-6 secretion can be reduced by the PKR inhibitor imoxin. In conclusion, the discovery of the upregulated VTRNA2-1/PKR/CREB/IL-6 pathway in IgAN patients may provide novel approach to treat the disease and may be useful for development of precision nephrology and personalized therapy, possibly by checking the VTRNA2-1 methylation level in IgAN patients.","output":"Elevated Levels of IL-6 in IgA Nephropathy patients are induced by an Epigenetically-Driven Mechanism Triggered by Viral and Bacterial RNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seroepidemiology and genomics are valuable tools to investigate the transmission of COVID-19. We utilized qRT-PCR, serum antibody immunoassays, and whole genome sequencing to examine the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections in North East (NE) region of India during the first and second pandemic waves (June 2020 to September 2021). qRT-PCR analysis was performed on a selected population from NE India during June 2020 to July 2021, and metadata were collected for the region. Seroprevalence and neutralizing antibody immunoassays were studied on selected individuals (n=2026) at three time points (August 2020, February 2021 and June 2021), as well as in a cohort (n=35) for a year (August 2020 to August 2021). SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 914 qRT-PCR positive samples (June 2020 to September 2021) were sequenced and assembled, and those obtained from the sequence databases were analyzed. Test positivity rates in first and second waves were 6.34% and 6.64% in the state of Assam, respectively, and a similar pattern was observed in other NE states. Seropositivity in August 2020, February 2021, and June 2021 were 10.63%, 40.3% and 46.33% respectively, and neutralizing antibody prevalence were 90.91%, 52.14%, and 69.30% respectively. The cohort group showed the presence of stable neutralizing antibody throughout the year. Normal variants dominated the first wave, while the variant of concerns (VOCs) B.1.617.2 and AY-sublineages dominated the second wave, and identified mostly among vaccinated individuals. All eight states of NE India reported numerous incidences of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, especially B.1.617.2 and AY sublineages, and their prevalence co-related well with high TPR and seropositivity rate in the region. High infection and seroprevalence of COVID-19 in NE India during the second wave was associated with the emergence of VOCs.

Aim and Objective: This study aimed to conduct a prospective analysis on different factors associated with the severity and outcome of the COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in a 100-bedded hospital of West Nepal for 3 months, with the total number of hospitalized patients 78. Demographic data, pre-existing comorbidities, ABO blood group, high-resolution computed tomography (CT) severity score, and outcomes of the respondents were recorded and analyzed statistically using Chi-square, binomial regression test, and significance level was considered P<0.05 at 95% confidence intervals. Results: Although the improvement rate was higher among males (84.0%) than females (75.0%), no significant association was observed between sex of the patient and treatment outcomes. Similarly, no significant association was observed in between age and ABO blood grouping of patients and treatment outcome. Furthermore, the chance of improvement is about 6 times higher (OR-6.214, 95% CI: 1.452-26.599;P=0.014) among patients with single comorbidity compared with patients with two or more comorbidities. Moreover, the chance of improvement is 8 times higher (OR-8, 95% CI: 2.034-31.461;P=0.001) in patients with CT severity score 1-15 compared with patients with CT severity score 16-25.

Consults to all divisions within general surgery were included. RESULTS: Total surgical consult volume decreased by 43% in the post-COVID-19 period, with a significant reduction in the median daily consult volume from 14 to 8 (P < .0001). Changes in consult volume by patient location, chief complaint, and surgical division were variable, in aggregate reflecting a disproportionate decrease among less acute surgical complaints. The percentage of consults resulting in surgical intervention remained equal in the 2 periods (31% vs 28%, odds ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.61-1.21, P = .38) with most but not all operation types decreasing in frequency.

This study determined the minimum threshold of eccentric gaze in a videoconferencing setup above which subjects are perceived as not making direct eye contact by the majority of untrained observers. METHODS Image captures were made of four subjects successively fixating at small increments eccentric to a video camera, both vertically and horizontally ranging from 0.9 degrees to 19 degrees of eccentricity. The images were embedded in separate Powerpoint files for each subject. Each file was assessed by seven graders who indicated whether or not they felt the subject was looking directly at them in each slide. RESULTS The threshold for which 75% of the graders could detect that the subject was not looking at them ranged from only 2.7 degrees for horizontal eccentricity to 5.4 degrees for vertical eccentricity.

This dual use might delay cessation and increase toxicant exposure. We aimed to test the efficacy of a self-help intervention designed to help dual users to quit smoking. METHODS: In this three-arm randomised controlled trial we recruited individuals in the USA using Facebook and multimedia advertisements. Included participants were 18 years or older, smoked at least weekly in the preceding year, and vaped at least weekly in the preceding month. We used computer generated randomisation with balanced-permuted blocks (block size 10, with 2C4-4 ratio) to allocate participants to assessment only (ASSESS group), generic smoking cessation self-help booklets (GENERIC group), or booklets targeting dual users (eTARGET group). Individuals in the generic or targeted intervention groups received monthly cessation materials for 18 months, with assessments every 3 months for 24 months. The main outcome was self-reported 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence at each assessment point. All randomly allocated participants were included in primary analyses using generalised estimating equations for each of 20 datasets created by multiple imputation. Analysis of the (2)s produced an F test. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02416011, and is now closed. FINDINGS: Between July 12, 2016, and June 30, 2017, we randomly assigned 2896 dual users (575 to assessment, 1154 to generic intervention, and 1167 to targeted self-help). 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence increased from 14% at 3 months to 42% at 24 months (F(7,5417)=671, p<00001) in the overall sample. Targeted self-help resulted in higher smoking abstinence than did assessment alone throughout the treatment period (F(1,9738)=1020, p=00014 [=0017]). The generic intervention group had abstinence rates between those of the assessment and targeted groups, but did not significantly differ from either when adjusted for multiple comparisons (GENERIC vs eTARGET F(1,11025)=179, p=018 [=005]; GENERIC vs ASSESS F(1,6767)=429, p=0039 [=0025]).

This disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that was identified in Chinese patients having severe pneumonia and flu-like symptoms. COVID-19 is a contagious disease that spreads rapidly via droplet particles arising through sneezing and coughing action of an infected person. The reports of asymptomatic carriers changed the scenario of symptom based-diagnosis in COVID-19 and intensified the need for proper diagnosis of the majority of the population to combat the rapid transmission of virus. The diagnosis of positive cases is necessary to ensure prompt care to affected people and also to curb further spread of infection in the population. Collecting samples at the right time and from the exact anatomical site is crucial for proper molecular diagnosis. After the complete genome sequence was available, China formulated RT-PCR as a primary diagnostic procedure for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Many in-house and commercial diagnostic kits have been developed or are under development that have a potential to lower the burden of diagnosis on the primary diagnostic techniques like RT-PCR. Serological based diagnosis is another broad category of testing that can detect different serum antibodies like IgG, IgM, and IgA in an infected patient. PCR-based diagnostic procedures that are commonly used for pathogen detection need sophisticated machines and assistance of a technical expert. Despite their reliable accuracy, they are not cost-effective tests, which a common man can afford, so it becomes imperative to look for other diagnostic approaches, which could be cost effective, rapid, and sensitive with consistent accuracy. To make such diagnostics available to the common man, many techniques can be exploited among, which are Point of Care (POC), also known as bed side testing, which is developing as a portable and promising tool in pathogen diagnosis. Other lateral flow assay (LFA)-based techniques like SHERLOCK, CRISPR-Cas12a (AIOD-CRISPR), and FNCAS9 editor-limited uniform detection assay (FELUDA), etc. have shown promising results in rapid detection of pathogens.

It has been speculated that use of pioglitazone might increase such risk. The aim of our brief commentary is to review the safety of pioglitazone in people with T2DM and mild/moderate COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed database using specific keywords related to our aims till May 15, 2020. Full text of relevant articles published in English language were retrieved and reviewed. RESULTS: Medications, including pioglitazone, that upregulate tissue expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), might have a dual role in COVID-19; on the one hand they might increase risk of infection as SARS-CoV2 uses ACE2 as a coreceptor to enter alveolar cells, but on the other hand, by reducing angiotensin II levels, they can protect against acute lung injury. There is no evidence to date that pioglitazone upregulates ACE2 in the alveolar cells; rather, there is evidence from animal studies of upregulation of ACE2 in insulin sensitive tissues, which might have a protective effect on lung injury. Moreover by moderating the exaggerated host proinflammatory response, pioglitazone can potentially reduce SARS-CoV-2 driven hyperinflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Pioglitazone has more potential for benefit than harm, and can be continued in people with T2DM and mild/moderate COVID-19, unless there are specific contraindications for its use.

In 2020, more excisions were performed by consultants (42.9% v 21.5%, pa?=a?0.002) with a lower proportion of excisions with a close margin (27.7% v 17.8%, pa?=a?0.096) and an involved margin (3.1% v 1.8%, pa?=a?0.62). Five of these patients had their further management altered due to service constraints at this time The resource constraints secondary to the pandemic have yielded beneficial service adaptations with the incorporation of a more efficient model for the NMSC service. The sustainability of this model and its impact on training will require further examination when non-urgent and benign elective workload is slowly reinstated and plastic surgery trainees return to their original posts.","output":"Non-melanoma skin cancer activity during the COVID-19 pandemic- A single UK tertiary centre experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Economic growth and natural resources commodity prices are the variables greatly influenced by events such as the Gulf war, the Asian financial crisis, the global financial crisis, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic.

In view of these, docking studies were employed to study the interaction between the spikes of the virus and ABA or BBA using Molecular Graphic Laboratory (MGL) tools and AutoDock Vina application. The binding of the ABA and BBA with the spike of the virus could inhibit its reproduction or provide sufficient time for the immune system to recognize the virus and hence, produce suitable antibodies. In addition, the pKa of ABA, BBA and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were calculated using HF/6-311G (d,p) method and then they were compared with the experimental pKa of HCQ.

The mechanisms that determine the age-dependent susceptibility remain largely unclear. Here, we found that the paucity of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells together with immaturity of the immune system was related to the susceptibility of neonatal mice to EV71 infection. iNKT cells were crucial antiviral effector cells to protect young mice from EV71 infection before their adaptive immune systems were fully mature. EV71 infection led to activation of iNKT cells depending on signaling through TLR3 but not other TLRs. Surprisingly, iNKT cell activation during EV71 infection required TLR3 signaling in macrophages, but not in dendritic cells (DCs). Mechanistically, interleukin (IL)-12 and endogenous CD1d-restricted antigens were both required for full activation of iNKT cells. Furthermore, CD1d-deficiency led to dramatically increased viral loads in central nervous system and more severe disease in EV71-infected mice. Altogether, our results suggest that iNKT cells may be involved in controlling EV71 infection in children when their adaptive immune systems are not fully developed, and also imply that iNKT cells might be an intervention target for treating EV71-infected patients.","output":"TLR3 Signaling in Macrophages Is Indispensable for the Protective Immunity of Invariant Natural Killer T Cells against Enterovirus 71 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Smart home and telemonitoring technologies have often been suggested to assist health care workers in supporting older people to age in place. However, there is limited research examining diverse information needs of different groups of health care workers and their access to appropriate information technologies. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the issues associated with using technologies that connect older people to their health care providers to support aging in place and enhance older people's health and well-being. METHODS Seven focus group discussions were conducted comprising 44 health care professionals who provided clinic-based or in-home services to community-dwelling older people. Participants were asked about their information needs and how technology could help them support older people to age in place. The recordings of the sessions were transcribed and thematically analyzed. RESULTS The perspectives varied between the respondents who worked in primary care clinics and those who worked in community-based services. Three overarching themes were identified. The first theme was \\"access to technology and systems,\\" which examined the different levels of technology in use and the problems that various groups of health care professionals had in accessing information about their patients. Primary care professionals had access to good internal information systems but they experienced poor integration with other health care providers. The community-based teams had poor access to technology. The second theme was \\"collecting and sharing of information,\\" which focused on how technology might be used to provide them with more information about their patients. Primary care teams were interested in telemonitoring for specific clinical indicators but they wanted the information to be preprocessed. Community-based teams were more concerned about gaining information on the patients' social environment. The third theme was that all respondents identified similar \\"barriers to uptake\\": cost and funding issues, usability of systems by older people, and information security and privacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS The participants perceived the potential benefits of technologies, but they were concerned that the information they received should be preprocessed and integrated with current information systems and tailored to the older people's unique and changing situations. Several management and governance issues were identified, which needed to be resolved to enable the widespread integration of these technologies into the health care system. The disconnected nature of the current information architecture means that there is no clear way for sensor data from telemonitoring and smart home devices to be integrated with other patient information. Furthermore, cost, privacy, security, and usability barriers also need to be resolved. This study highlights the importance and the complexity of management and governance of systems to collect and disseminate such information.

Three to four weeks after the onset of symptoms, three commercial ELISAs and an in-house immunofluorescence test demonstrated antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. An in-house neutralisation test also demonstrated neutralising antibodies. INTERPRETATION: The in-house assays and one commercial assay gave congruent results, which were also consistent with the initial PCR and/or clinical evaluation, indicating prior infection in three of the five family members. The other commercial assays indicated possible infection in a fourth family member, but this result was likely due to cross-reactivity.

Hence, trust is a necessary condition for human-robot collaboration (HRC). However, and despite its crucial role, it is still largely unknown how trust emerges, develops, and supports human relationship to technological systems. In the following paper we review the literature on trust, human-robot interaction, HRC, and human interaction at large. Early models of trust suggest that it is a trade-off between benevolence and competence; while studies of human to human interaction emphasize the role of shared behavior and mutual knowledge in the gradual building of trust. We go on to introduce a model of trust as an agent' best explanation for reliable sensory exchange with an extended motor plant or partner. This model is based on the cognitive neuroscience of active inference and suggests that, in the context of HRC, trust can be casted in terms of virtual control over an artificial agent. Interactive feedback is a necessary condition to the extension of the trustor's perception-action cycle. This model has important implications for understanding human-robot interaction and collaboration-as it allows the traditional determinants of human trust, such as the benevolence and competence attributed to the trustee, to be defined in terms of hierarchical active inference, while vulnerability can be described in terms of information exchange and empowerment. Furthermore, this model emphasizes the role of user feedback during HRC and suggests that boredom and surprise may be used in personalized interactions as markers for under and over-reliance on the system. The description of trust as a sense of virtual control offers a crucial step toward grounding human factors in cognitive neuroscience and improving the design of human-centered technology. Furthermore, we examine the role of shared behavior in the genesis of trust, especially in the context of dyadic collaboration, suggesting important consequences for the acceptability and design of human-robot collaborative systems.","output":"Trust as Extended Control: Human-Machine Interactions as Active Inference"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of the factors that determine behavioral intention of expatiates living in Taiwan to send surgical masks to their native country following the Covid-19 outbreak. To achieve this, the study builds a research model by extending Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) with Knowledge-Attitude-Behavior (KAB) and Risk perception conceptions, incorporating Covid-19 related factors such as knowledge, fear, and risk perception and situational factors such as perceived mask scarcity. An online questionnaire was administered with 83 respondents participating. A partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis was used to evaluate the collected data. We found that no significant relationship between both Covid-19 risk perception, and fear and expatiates' attitudes to send surgical masks back home. Results further reveal that Covid-19 knowledge is the only factor that significantly influence expatriates' attitudes, which in turn impact their on the intention to send surgical masks to their native countries. Perceived mask scarcity found to positively moderate relationship between attitude and intention. This study contributes to the growing body of literature and research focused on the Covid-19 pandemic, and offers some implications for future research on the correlations between knowledge and scarcity in the context of the theory of reasoned action.

We also evaluated, in fully vaccinated (BNT162b2 or AZD1222) individuals, if the time (< 6 or  6 months) elapsed since the last shot was received was associated with the risk of severe illness. Study design A retrospective cohort study was conducted in Mexico. Methods Data from 409,493 were analyzed and risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed through generalized linear models. Results We documented a total of 3,513 COVID-19 pneumonia cases (69.5 per 100,000 person-days). In multiple analysis, a protective effect was observed in vaccinated adults (RR = 0.996, 95% CI 0.995-0.997). Male gender, increasing age, and smoking were associated with a greater risk of pneumonia. Individuals with chronic comorbidities (pulmonary obstructive disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, kidney disease, and immunosuppression) were also at higher risk.

Thus far, there is limited information available on the etiology, clinical outcomes, and management options for cardiovascular complications caused by COVID-19. This review focuses on literature published in year 2020 on the virus-induced cardiovascular damage with intention to better understand pathophysiology of this process, its impact on clinical outcomes, and available therapies. Literature review shows that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) acts through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors and causes cardiac injury by direct damage to the cardiomyocytes, systemic inflammation, fibrosis, interferon and cytokine-mediated immune response, coronary plaque destabilization, and hypoxia. Comorbidities, especially underling heart disease, make patients more predisposed to severe cardiovascular damage. COVID-19 patients who develop myocardial injury have a higher mortality rate compared to those who do not. During the pandemic, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) should remain the standard of care for patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). On the other hand, in order to limit healthcare worker exposure, patients with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) should be managed with stabilization strategies if hemodynamically stable. Monitoring hospitalized COVID-19 patients with high sensitivity troponin can help screen for severe complications and detect them early. Use of multiple investigational drugs with uncertain cardiac safety profiles in COVID-19 patients requires continuous cardiac monitoring. Notch signaling pathway therapy along with anti-viral agents, interleukin-6 inhibitors, and convalescent serum are possible treatment options to better control the inflammatory state that drives the cardiac damage.","output":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-Induced Cardiovascular Syndrome: Etiology, Outcomes, and Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents experimental results that illustrate the unsteady characteristics of gas dispersion around a complex-shaped high-rise building for different incident wind directions.

We quantify trends in stroke code calls and treatments at 3 Connecticut hospitals during the local emergence of COVID-19 and examine patient characteristics and stroke process measures at a Comprehensive Stroke Center (CSC) before and during the pandemic. METHODS: Stroke code activity was analyzed from January 1 to April 28, 2020, and corresponding dates in 2019. Piecewise linear regression and spline models identified when stroke codes in 2020 began to decline and when they fell below 2019 levels. Patient-level data were analyzed in February versus March and April 2020 at the CSC to identify differences in patient characteristics during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 822 stroke codes were activated at 3 hospitals from January 1 to April 28, 2020. The number of stroke codes/wk decreased by 12.8/wk from February 18 to March 16 (P=0.0360) with nadir of 39.6% of expected stroke codes called from March 10 to 16 (30% decrease in total stroke codes during the pandemic weeks in 2020 versus 2019). There was no commensurate increase in within-network telestroke utilization.

Despite varying inclusion criteria and time intervals from onset to revascularization overall increases of good functional outcome between 55% and 81% were reported. However, only a minority of screened patients (approximately 1%) were eligible for intra-arterial (IA) therapy. METHODS An investigator-initiated, single-centre, prospective and blinded end-point analysis was performed of 3123 consecutive patients with acute ischaemic stroke presenting between February 2010 and December 2014. RESULTS One hundred and fifty-four patients [4.9%, age (years) mean (SD), median (interquartile range) 71.2 (14), 74.7 (65.9-81.4)] met the inclusion criteria of sparse early ischaemic signs on initial standard cranial computed tomography (CT) (ASPECT score 7), large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation on CT angiography and start of treatment within 6 h of onset of symptoms. After consensual interdisciplinary treatment decisions 130 patients (4.2%) received IA treatment - in the majority stent-assisted thrombectomy in combination with intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator - and 24 patients (0.7%) standard IV thrombolysis. On 3 months' follow-up an overall significant improvement of disability (P = 0.05) as measured by the modified Rankin Scale was shown in favour of the IA treatment group.

Stool transplantation (faecal microbiota transplantation - FMT) is a widely accepted, potentially life-saving, cost-effective medical intervention for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), which has an acceptable safety profile if performed with an appropriate professional background. FMT can significantly reduce hospitalization time and the number of patient visits. National donor and stool banks with high-standard quality management systems were established in certain countries for supporting the procedures. In other regions, including Hungary, patient access is not uniform due to the lack of clear legal regulations, standardized technology or financial reimbursement. It has been expected for a long time to replace the heterogenous techniques, occasionally utilizing household equipment with a technology providing improved patient safety and fulfilling international and recently published local FMT guidelines. The emergence of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is a very powerful argument in favour of urgently reconsidering the quality management and technological background of FMT procedures. SARS-CoV-2 is a major threat to the vulnerable patients suffering from CDI and also impose risks for the recipient and healthcare personnel involved in carrying out the transplantation. New FMT guidelines were implemented at the University of Debrecen to address these professional and public challenges, to provide wide patient access and to guarantee the highest achievable patient safety. Relevant elements of this new protocol are presented, focusing on a systemic quality management approach, on the operation of a frozen stool bank and on a modified donor screening algorithm taking the risks of COVID-19 into consideration.

Quantities of viral fragments of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater are related to numbers of clinical cases of COVID-19 reported within the corresponding sewershed. Variants of Concern (VOCs) have been detected in wastewater by use of reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) or sequencing. A multiplex RT-qPCR assay to detect and estimate the prevalence of multiple VOCs, including Omicron/Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, in wastewater RNA extracts was developed and validated. The probe-based multiplex assay, named \\"N200\\" focuses on amino acids 199-202, a region of the N gene that contains several mutations that are associated with variants of SARS- CoV-2 within a single amplicon. Each of the probes in the N200 assay are specific to the targeted mutations and worked equally well in single- and multi-plex modes. To estimate prevalence of each VOC, the abundance of the targeted mutation was compared with a non- mutated region within the same amplified region. The N200 assay was applied to monitor frequencies of VOCs in wastewater extracts from six sewersheds in Ontario, Canada collected between December 1, 2021, and January 4, 2022. Using the N200 assay, the replacement of the Delta variant along with the introduction and rapid dominance of the Omicron variant were monitored in near real-time, as they occurred nearly simultaneously at all six locations. The N200 assay is robust and efficient for wastewater surveillance can be adopted into VOC monitoring programs or replace more laborious assays currently being used to monitor SARS- CoV-2 and its VOCs.","output":"Multiplex RT-qPCR assay (N200) to detect and estimate prevalence of multiple SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern in wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Electrical load forecasting has a fundamental role in the decision-making process of energy system operators. When many users are connected to the grid, high-performance forecasting models are required, posing several problems associated with the availability of historical energy consumption data for each end-user and training, deploying and maintaining a model for each user. Moreover, introducing new end-users to an existing network poses problems relating to their forecasting model. Global models, trained on all available data, are emerging as the best solution in several contexts, because they show higher generalization performance, being able to leverage the patterns that are similar across different time series. In this work, the lodging/residential electricity 1-h-ahead load forecasting of multiple time series for smart grid applications is addressed using global models, suggesting the effectiveness of such an approach also in the energy context. Results obtained on a subset of the Great Energy Predictor III dataset with several global models are compared to results obtained with local models based on the same methods, showing that global models can perform similarly to the local ones, while presenting simpler deployment and maintainability. In this work, the forecasting of a new time series, representing a new end-user introduced in the pre-existing network, is also approached under specific assumptions, by using a global model trained using data related to the existing end-users. Results reveal that the forecasting model pre-trained on data related to other end-users allows the attainment of good forecasting performance also for new end-users.","output":"Global vs. Local Models for Short-Term Electricity Demand Prediction in a Residential/Lodging Scenario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is a replication-deficient poxvirus, attenuated in chick embryo fibroblast primary cells.

Based on similarities in genome organization and protein expression, the arteriviruses have recently been grouped together with the coronaviruses and toroviruses in the newly established order Nidovirales. Previously, we reported the construction of pEDI, a full-length cDNA copy of EAV DI-b, a natural defective interfering (DI) RNA of 5.6 kb (R. Molenkamp et al., J. Virol. 74:3156-3165, 2000). EDI RNA consists of three noncontiguous parts of the EAV genome fused in frame with respect to the replicase gene. As a result, EDI RNA contains a truncated replicase open reading frame (EDI-ORF) and encodes a truncated replicase polyprotein. Since some coronavirus DI RNAs require the presence of an ORF for their efficient propagation, we have analyzed the importance of the EDI-ORF in EDI RNA replication. The EDI-ORF was disrupted at different positions by the introduction of frameshift mutations. These were found either to block DI RNA replication completely or to be removed within one virus passage, probably due to homologous recombination with the helper virus genome. Using recombination assays based on EDI RNA and full-length EAV genomes containing specific mutations, the rates of homologous RNA recombination in the 3'- and 5'-proximal regions of the EAV genome were studied. Remarkably, the recombination frequency in the 5'-proximal region was found to be approximately 100-fold lower than that in the 3'-proximal part of the genome.","output":"Efficient homologous RNA recombination and requirement for an open reading frame during replication of equine arteritis virus defective interfering RNAs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesWe used linked individual-level data from national registries to compare the risk of severe outcomes among unvaccinated COVID-19 cases <18 years between waves of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants in Norway. MethodsOur outcomes were hospitalisation with acute COVID-19 or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). We calculated adjusted risk ratios (aRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable log-binomial regression, adjusting for variant wave, demographic characteristics and underlying comorbidities. ResultsWe included 10,538 Alpha (21 hospitalised with acute COVID-19, 7 MIS-C), 42,362 Delta (28 acute COVID-19, 14 MIS-C) and 82,907 Omicron wave cases (48 acute COVID-19, 7 MIS-C). The risk of hospitalisation with acute COVID-19 in cases <1 year was lower in the Delta (aRR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.16-0.89) and Omicron wave (aRR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.20-0.81), compared to the Alpha wave. We found no difference in the risk for this outcome for Omicron compared to Delta in any age group. The risk of MIS-C was lower in the Omicron wave compared to the Alpha (aRR: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.03-0.27) and Delta wave (aRR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.10-0.63).

Although enormous efforts have been made, there is still no effective treatment against the new virus. Herein, a TiO(2) supported single-atom nanozyme containing atomically dispersed Ag atoms (Ag-TiO(2) SAN) is designed to serve as a highly efficient antiviral nanomaterial. Compared with troditional nano-TiO(2) and Ag, Ag-TiO(2) SAN exhibits higher adsorption (99.65%) of SARS-CoV2 pseudovirus. This adsorption ability is due to the interaction between SAN and receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike 1 protein of SARS-CoV2. Theoretical calculation and experimental evidience indicate that the Ag atoms of SAN strongly bind to cysteine and asparagine, which are the most abundant amino acids on the surface of spike 1 RBD. After binding to the virus, the SAN/virus complex is typically phagocytosed by macrophages and colocalized with lysosomes. Interestingly, Ag-TiO(2) SAN possesses high peroxidase-like activity responsible for reactive oxygen species production under acid conditions. The highly acidic microenvironment of lysosomes could favor oxygen reduction reaction process to eliminate the virus. With hACE2 transgenic mice, Ag-TiO(2) SAN showed efficient anti-SARS-CoV2 pseudovirus activity.

So, on one hand, we have to fulfill our requirements by using resources in an optimized manner, and on the other hand, we are currently in a pandemic for which social distancing is the key to prevent ourselves from the COVID-19 virus. We all travel by bus, train, metros, and other public transports, and we all have faced the problem of overcrowding in public transport once in our life especially during any festive season when there is a lot of rush among people to go from their workplace to their hometown. The problem of overcrowding is very common in developing countries like India where the population is relatively higher than the number of seats in public transports. For instance, if we look at the Delhi metro in which it is almost impossible to travel during the festive season. However, its a regular problem, but the crowd becomes more when any festive season approaches. And due to such rush, people tend to just get inside the metro without even searching for a relatively less crowded or vacant seat/compartment, resulting in an unusual pattern of density seen across the metro, somewhere empty and somewhere highly crowded that even no place to stand. And now due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the situation worsens, on one hand, we are bound to travel in-crowd for work and on the other hand, we have to maintain social distancing for COVID prevention. So it becomes almost impossible to travel through such public transport. To solve such problems we are proposing a solution, that is, a system that takes care of the public places/transports by scanning and informing passengers where they can move to find a seat or less crowded.

In the present retrospective case-control study, the potential therapeutic effect of recombinant human interleukin-2 (rIL-2) in patients with severe COVID-19 was demonstrated. A total of 59 patients with severe COVID-19 were admitted to the Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College (Wuhan, China) between 29th January 2020 and 29th February 2020 and were included in the present study. In total, 20 patients received subcutaneous injection of rIL-2 (1 million IU per day) for 7-10 days in addition to regular treatment and were classified as the rIL-2 group. Furthermore, 20 of the 39 patients receiving regular treatment, without the intervention of rIL-2, were matched as the control group. Patients in these two groups were subjected to propensity score matching in terms of clinical characteristics such as age, sex, symptoms, signs, laboratory data and comorbidities. Changes in the lymphocyte count, as well as IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, were analyzed at the time of admission and discharge and any differences between the rIL-2 and non-rIL-2 groups were determined.

METHODS: An electronic search of PubMed, Embase, Medline, MedRxiv, CNKI, and the Chinese Medical Journal Full Text Database following PRISMA guidelines was performed through April 18, 2020. Search terms included COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, pregnant women, infants, and vertical transmission. RESULTS: A total of 230 women with COVID-19 (154 deliveries, 66 ongoing pregnancies, and 10 abortions) and 156 newborns from 20 eligible studies were included in this systematic review. A total of 34.62% of the pregnant patients had obstetric complications, and 59.05% of patients displayed fever. Lymphopenia was observed in 40.71% of patients. A total of 5.19% of women received mechanical ventilation. Seven women were critically ill. One mother and two newborns died. A total of 24.74% of newborns were premature. Five newborns throat swab tests of SARS-CoV-2 were positive, all of which were delivered by cesarean section. For eight newborns with negative throat swab tests, three had both elevated IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Nucleic acid tests of vaginal secretions, breast milk, amniotic fluid, placental blood, and placental tissues were negative. CONCLUSION: Most pregnant patients were mildly ill. The mortality of pregnant women with COVID-19 was lower than that of overall COVID-19 patients. Cesarean section was more common than vaginal delivery for pregnant women with COVID-19. Premature delivery was the main adverse event for newborns. The vertical transmission rate calculated by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests was 3.91%. Serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 should be tested more frequently, and multiple samples should be included in pathogenic testing.","output":"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 and the risk of vertical transmission: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The relative contributions of asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have not been clearly measured although control measures may differ in response to the risk of spread posed by different types of cases. METHODS: We collected detailed information on transmission events and symptom status based on laboratory-confirmed patient data and contact tracing data from four provinces and one municipality in China. We estimated the variation in risk of transmission over time, and the severity of secondary infections, by symptomatic status of the infector. RESULTS: There were 393 symptomatic index cases with 3136 close contacts and 185 asymptomatic index cases with 1078 close contacts included into the study. The secondary attack rate among close contacts of symptomatic and asymptomatic index cases were 4.1% (128/3136) and 1.1% (12/1078), respectively, corresponding to a higher transmission risk from symptomatic cases than from asymptomatic cases (OR: 3.79, 95% CI: 2.06, 6.95). Approximately 25% (32/128) and 50% (6/12) of the infected close contacts were asymptomatic from symptomatic and asymptomatic index cases, respectively, while more than one third (38%) of the infections in the close contacts of symptomatic cases were attributable to exposure to the index cases before symptom onset. Infected contacts of asymptomatic index cases were more likely to be asymptomatic and less likely to be severe. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission play an important role in spreading infection, although asymptomatic cases pose a lower risk of transmission than symptomatic cases. Early case detection and effective test-and-trace measures are important to reduce transmission.","output":"Assessing asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic created a severe psychosocial and medical shock all over the world. For more than a year, humanity struggled with adjusting to different measures that governments imposed on the population worldwide. Educational systems all over the world were forced to comply with the new conditions of activity. In this context, different reactions emerged, and skills were used and developed. The coronavirus pandemic was and still is a stressful worldwide event that disrupted, among numerous other things, the everyday life of professional activities and the manner of their deployment. This study aims to investigate the relationship between variables like: analytical reasoning, text comprehension, detail perception, conscientiousness, emotional stability and autonomy. A sample of 327 students from Ovidius University of Constanta, aged between 19 and 50 years, were assessed using Cognitrom Assessment System. Results show that: (1) there is a positive correlation between analytical reasoning, text comprehension and detail perception;(2) analytical reasoning positively correlates with conscientiousness and emotional stability;(3) text comprehension correlates with emotional stability;and (4) detail perception has no significant correlation with any of the studied personality traits. Results are interpreted and discussed in the end of the article, in relationship with the use of these intellectual skills and personality traits in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, especially by certain population categories which had to use the online environment for their regular professional activities.

This study aimed: a) to explore perceived stress among undergraduate nursing students in Portugal and Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak;and b) to analyze several COVID-19 related factors and psychological issues that may be associated with perceived stress. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a convenience sample of Portuguese and Spanish undergraduate nursing students (n=1075). The data gathered included demographic information, questions about COVID-19 related factors, and psychological issues. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression with a degree of significance at p<0.05. High perceived stress scores were found in 558 participants (51.9%). Students with high perceived stress most likely had a COVID-19 diagnosis in their household;their household income had been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic;experienced difficulty falling asleep or sleeping all night;consumed junk food in excess;neglected their appearance;felt headaches, stomach aches, and back pain;and lacked the patience or desire to exercise. Additionally, high perceived stress was negatively associated with life satisfaction. The results provide evidence that infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, may significantly influence mental health.

Methods We selected a panel of 14 expert endoscopists. We identified 41 common indications for advanced endoscopic procedures from the ASGE Appropriate Use of GI Endoscopy guidelines. Using a modified Delphi method, we first achieved consensus on patient-important outcome for each procedural indication. Panelists prioritized consensus patient-important outcome when categorizing each indication into one of the following 3 procedural time periods: (1) time-sensitive emergent (schedule within 1 week), (2) time-sensitive urgent (schedule within 1 to 8 weeks), and (3) non-time sensitive (defer for >8 weeks and then reassess the timing). Three anonymous rounds of voting were allowed before attempts at consensus were abandoned. Results All 14 invited experts agreed to participate in the study. The prespecified consensus threshold of 51% was achieved for assigning patient-important outcome/s to each advanced endoscopy indication. The prespecified consensus threshold of 66.7% was achieved for 40 out of 41 advanced endoscopy indications in stratifying them into 1 of 3 procedural time periods. For 12 out of 41 indications 100% consensus, and for 20 out of 41 indications 75% to 99% consensus was achieved. Conclusions By using a Modified Delphi method that prioritized patient-important outcomes, we developed consensus recommendations on procedural timing for common indications for advanced endoscopy. These recommendations and the structured decision framework provided by our study can inform decision-making as endoscopy services are reopened.","output":"Triaging advanced GI endoscopy procedures during the COVID-19 Pandemic: consensus recommendations using the Delphi method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose To delineate the learning curve (LC) for laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) performed by residents according to seniority in training. Methods Between October 2015 and November 2016, 150 patients underwent LA by three residents (in their first, second, and third year of training) under supervision. The patients were non-randomly assigned to each resident. The data were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively from prospectively collected database. The perioperative outcomes were compared between the three residents including operation time, complication, conversion, and so on. The LCs were evaluated by the moving average method and cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) for operation time and surgical completion. Results Baseline characteristics and perioperative outcomes were similar except for age and location of the appendix among the three groups. Operation time was not different among the three residents (43.9, 45.3, and 48.4 min for A, B, and C, respectively). The moving average method for operation time showed a decreasing tendency for all residents. CUSUM for operation time showed that the peak points occurred at the 24th, 18th, and 31st cases for resident A, B, and C, respectively. In terms of surgical failure, residents A, B, and C reached steady states after the 35th, 11th, and 16th cases, respectively. Perforation of the appendix base was the only risk factor for surgical failure. Conclusion The LC for LA by residents was 11-35 cases according to multidimensional statistical analyses.

OBJECTIVE: We attempt to better understand the relationship of QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients in this study. METHODS: This is a retrospective, hospital-based, observational study. All patients with normal baseline QTc interval who were hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection at two hospitals in Ohio, USA were included in this study. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients had QTc prolongation, and 210 patients continued to have normal QTc during hospitalization. The baseline QTc intervals were comparable in the two groups. Patients with QTc prolongation were older (mean age 67 vs. 60, P 0.003), more likely to have underlying cardiovascular disease (48% versus 26%, P 0.001), ischemic heart disease (29% versus 17%, P 0.026), congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (16% versus 8%, P 0.042), chronic kidney disease (23% versus 10%, P 0.005), and end-stage renal disease (12% versus 1%, P < 0.001). Patients with QTc prolongation were more likely to have received hydroxychloroquine (75% versus 59%, P 0.018), azithromycin (18% vs. 14%, P 0.034), a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (29% vs 7%, P < 0.001), more than 1 QT prolonging agents (59% vs. 32%, P < 0.001). Patients who were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) were less likely to develop QTc prolongation (11% versus 26%, P 0.014). QTc prolongation was not associated with increased ventricular arrhythmias or mortality. CONCLUSION: Older age, ESRD, underlying cardiovascular disease, potential virus mediated cardiac injury, and drugs like hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin, contribute to QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients. The role of ACEi in preventing QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients needs to be studied further.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and QTc prolongation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developmental research during COVID-19 suggests that pandemic-related disruptions in family relationships are associated with children's mental health. Most of this research has focused on 1 child per family, thereby obfuscating patterns that are differentially operative at the family-wide (i.e., between-family) versus child-specific (i.e., within-family) levels of analysis. Thus, the current study evaluates multilevel, longitudinal associations between COVID-19 disruption, family relationships, and caregiver/child mental health using a sibling comparison methodology. Caregivers (N = 549 families with 1098 children between 5 and 18 years old) were recruited from the Prolific research panel (73% White-European; 68% female; 76% United Kingdom, 19% U.S.A.; median 2019 income $50,000-$74,999). Caregiver reports of COVID-19 disruption, psychological distress, family functioning, parenting, and child mental health (for 2 children per family) were provided during May (time 1) and July (time 2) 2020. A Bayesian multilevel path analysis with random effects revealed: (a) families were experiencing difficulties across domains when COVID-19 disruption was high; (b) COVID-19 disruption corresponded to greater sibling differences in mental health; and (c) the sibling with poorer mental health received lower quality parenting over time, especially in families who reported higher levels of differential parenting. Findings suggest that understanding children's mental health difficulties during COVID-19 requires a family system lens due to the multiple ways these consequences permeate across the family unit. Comprehensive interventions for children's mental health during this time will likely require an examination of caregiver, sibling, and whole-family dynamics in the context of evidence-based telehealth practice.

In this regard, molecular characterization of the viral strains circulating in the region is of utmost importance for a strategic approach to control the disease. Thus, in the present study, diarrheic fecal samples from piglets of Tripura and Assam were evaluated for genotypic characterization of VP7 and VP4 gene of the virus. The samples positive for group A rotavirus were subjected to G and P type determination by nested- multiplex RT PCR as well as nucleotide sequencing of VP7 and VP4 gene. Nested- multiplex RT PCR revealed the presence of porcine group A rotavirus in the genotypic combination of G1P[6], G3P[6], G8P[6] and G4P[6] in the two states of North East India. Nucleotide sequencing of VP7 and VP4 genes however, revealed emergence of an unusual genotypic combination G26P[13]. VP7 and VP4 nucleotide and its deduced amino acid sequences when compared with global isolates, showed that the present strains shared closest similarity to the porcine rotavirus strain TJ4-1from Japan and hp140 from Eastern India. Identification of a novel genotype G26P[13] in the RVA infected pig population of Tripura and Assam, suggested presence of a greater diversity in rotavirus strains in the region. Thus, it evokes the need for continuous monitoring to assess and consider the strain variability in the design of a suitable vaccine candidate against the virus.

Although coronaviruses typically infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, the virus RNA can be detected in plasma. The risk of transmitting coronavirus via transfusion of blood products remains. As more asymptomatic infections are identified in COVID-19 cases, blood safety has become particularly important. Methylene blue (MB) photochemical technology has been proven to inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses with high efficiency and safety. The present study aimed to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 inactivation effects of MB in plasma. METHODS: The SARS-CoV-2 virus strain was isolated from Zhejiang University. The live virus was harvested from cultured VERO-E6 cells, and mixed with MB in plasma. The MB final concentrations were 0, 1, 2, and 4 M. The \\"BX-1 AIDS treatment instrument\\" was used at room temperature, the illumination adjusted to 55,000  0.5 million Lux, and the plasma was irradiated for 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mins using light at a single wavelength of 630 nm. Virus load changes were measured using quantitative reverse transcription- PCR. RESULTS: BX-1 could effectively eliminate SARS-CoV-2 within 2 mins in plasma, and the virus titer declined to 4.5 log10 TCID50 (median tissue culture infectious dose)/mL. CONCLUSION: BX-1 is based on MB photochemical technology, which was designed to inactivate HIV-1 virus in plasma. It was proven to be safe and reliable in clinical trials of HIV treatment. In this study, we showed that BX-1 could also be applied to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. During the current outbreak, this technique it has great potential for ensuring the safety of blood transfusions, for plasma transfusion therapy in recovering patients, and for preparing inactivated vaccines.","output":"Methylene blue photochemical treatment as a reliable SARS-CoV-2 plasma virus inactivation method for blood safety and convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Document: \\"Public services have been at the frontline of the response to coronavirus While some have been able to draw on well-understood command structures, experience of responding to emergencies and extensive plans, many have struggled This report - produced in partnership by the Institute for Government and the Chartered Institute for Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) - assesses the preparedness and resilience of nine key public services in the years running up to March 2020 to assess how fit they were to tackle the pandemic It then offers our recommendations on practical and relatively cheap steps the government could take now to ensure that public services are in a better position to respond to future shocks \\"","output":"How Fit Were Public Services for Coronavirus?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has been particularly challenging for nursing home staff and residents.

A large number of patients affected by the SARS-Cov-2 virus worldwide undergo recovery of symptoms in about one month. Among these patients, the healing process is still under observation, with some patients in need of careful clinical monitoring. While the radiological findings have been shown to regress almost completely, little knowledge is available at the moment about other complications in the lung and in other organs. We then investigated the lung perfusion conditions in patients affected by COVID- 19 during recovery. Method. We retrospectively studied 20 patients, from 14 to 60 days after resolution of the COVID-19 symptoms, using chest CT. In a subgroup of 5 patients contrasted CT was used. Beside normal radiological evaluation of lung tissue, perfusion conditions were evaluated by digital image processing in the lung volume automatically segmented. Results. Pulmonary lung evaluation showed that COVID-19 pneumonia almost completely regressed, with mild focal areas affected by fibrous stripes. In patients that reported dyspnea, lung CT showed complete resolution of interstitial changes. Quantification of lung perfusion condition by contrasted CT, showed that dyspnea in 3 patients was associated with areas of hypoperfusion, while in 2 patients not reporting dyspnea perfusion conditions were comparable to normal controls. Conclusions. Although we obtained preliminary data, this is the first report on quantitative evaluation of hypoperfused lung tissue detected in recovering COVID-19 patients.

In support, recent research reveals that parents' COVID-19 related stressors predicted elevated potential for child abuse (Katz and Fallon, 2021). OBJECTIVE: We explored the harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses' parental burnout, child abuse, and child neglect, as mediated by compassion fatigue (i.e., a combination of job burnout and secondary traumatic stress). PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Participants were 244 nurses (M age = 32.4; 87% female) who were parents of young children (age 12 or under) recruited via chain referral sampling. METHODS: Participants completed an anonymous survey assessing the extent to which they care for COVID-19 patients, are exposed to patients suffering and dying from COVID-19, and have lost family income due to COVID-19. We also measured their compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, substance abuse, spouse conflict, parental burnout, child abuse, and child neglect. RESULTS: As hypothesized, direct care of COVID-19 patients, exposure to patient death and suffering due to COVID-19, and family income loss due to COVID-19 predicted greater compassion fatigue, which in turn, predicted greater parental burnout, child abuse, child neglect, spouse conflict, and substance abuse, (IEs  0.06, all ps < 0.05).

We tested these hypotheses in a large US sample of adults assessed once before and twice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multilevel analyses indicated that people reported feeling younger with the emergence of COVID-19. We further tested demographic, health, and psychosocial predictors of changes in subjective age.

In one study, daily administration of this drug for 2 wk decreased food intake (FI) and body weight gain (delta BW) in obese, but not lean, conventionally housed 5-wk-old female Zucker rats. We recently found that 2-wk administration of RU-486 attenuated delta BW in lean but not obese 12-wk-old male Zucker rats without affecting FI. To examine the actions of RU-486 and its effects on FI and delta BW in young (5 wk old) specific-pathogen-free (SPF) male and female Zucker rats, RU-486 was administered at 30 mg.kg-1.day-1 subcutaneously for 14 days. RU-486 did not affect FI in obese or lean male or female rats. RU-486 increased adrenal weight (P < 0.05) overall and in lean female rats and modestly decreased inguinal fat weight overall and in obese female rats (P < 0.01), suggesting some antiglucocorticoid activity in these animals. However, RU-486 also decreased thymus weight by 18-31% (P < 0.0001), increased plasma glucose by 10-16 mg/dl (P < 0.002), and increased plasma insulin by 47% in obese male rats (P < 0.028), demonstrating glucocorticoid agonist actions for the drug. Plasma corticosterone (B) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were elevated in vehicle-treated obese female and male rats by 150-360% (P < 0.0025) and 32-38% (P < 0.05), respectively, compared with lean rats. RU-486 treatment lowered the elevated plasma B and ACTH levels in obese female and male rats (both P < 0.02 vs. vehicle), a glucocorticoid agonist effect. We conclude that in young SPF Zucker rats 1) RU-486 administration does not alter FI or delta BW, 2) RU-486 has predominately glucocorticoid agonist actions in several tissues, 3) obese animals have increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity (plasma B and ACTH), and 4) RU-486 administration suppresses the HPA axis in obese rats.","output":"Predominately glucocorticoid agonist actions of RU-486 in young specific-pathogen-free Zucker rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple neurological complications have been associated with the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to investigate the PMI rates according to various definitions, their clinically relevant association with all-cause mortality at 10 years, and their impact on composite endpoints at 5 years in the SYNTAXES (Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery Extended Survival) trial. METHODS PMI was classified as a myocardial infarction occurring within 48 h of the procedure according to definitions of the SYNTAX (TAXUS Drug-Eluting Stent Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for the Treatment of Narrowed Arteries), ISCHEMIA (International Study Of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical And Invasive Approaches), and EXCEL (Evaluation of XIENCE versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization) trials; the Fourth Universal Definition of MI; and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI). Of the 1,800 patients enrolled, 1,652 with creatine kinase and/or creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) post-procedure were included. The association between PMI and mortality was analyzed by Cox regression. RESULTS PMI rates according to the SYNTAX and Fourth Universal Definition of MI, both of which required CK-MB elevation and electrocardiographic evidence of permanent myocardial damage, were 2.7% and 3.0%, respectively, in the PCI arm versus 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively, in the CABG arm. PMI rates according to the SCAI or EXCEL definition were higher in the PCI (5.7%) and CABG (16.5%) arms. PMIs according to the SYNTAX and Fourth Universal Definition of MI were more strongly associated with mortality than EXCEL and SCAI PMIs defined by isolated enzyme elevation when CK-MB was more than 10 times ULN. The impact of these \\"enzyme-driven events\\" on time-to-event curves and the composite endpoints was greater in the surgical cohort. PMIs after PCI were associated with 10-year mortality regardless of definition, whereas their impact on mortality after CABG was limited to 1 year.

This article explores the emerging reconfiguration of the certainty about what is authentic or the truth, and of the un/certainty of the fake and fakery as alternative or complementary sites of truth(s). It argues that we are now faced with a complex and layered contestation over who gets to define the truth and the fake, and under what terms. This conversation is deeply insurrectional for it invites the whole world, centres and margins alike, to confront how political, cultural, economic and social values and structures of knowledge production are implicated in the making and unmaking of the authentic, of truth as well as of the fake.","output":"Covid-19, Knowledge Production and the (Un)Making of Truths and Fakes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic in pediatric oncology units has had a major effect on health care providers globally.

Country-specific research reveals a general reduction in mental and physical well-being, due to measures undertaken to stop the spread of COVID-19 disease. However, research is yet to examine the impact of the pandemic on global psychological distress and its effects upon vulnerable groups. Exploration of the factors that potentially mediate the relationship between stress and mental health during this period is needed, to assist in undertaking concrete measures to mitigate psychological distress and support vulnerable groups. Therefore, this study examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological distress globally, and identified factors that may exacerbate decline in mental health. N = 1653 participants (mean age 42.90  13.63 years; 30.3% males) from 63 countries responded to the survey. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire and State Trait Anxiety Inventory, respectively. Other measures included the Perceived Stress Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale and the Brief Resilient Coping Scale. Globally, consistently high levels of stress, anxiety, depression and poor sleep were observed regardless of number of COVID-19 cases. Over 70% of the respondents had greater than moderate levels of stress, with 59% meeting the criteria for clinically significant anxiety and 39% reporting moderate depressive symptoms. People with a prior mental health diagnosis experienced greater psychological distress. Poor sleep, lower levels of resilience, younger age and loneliness significantly mediated the links between stress and depression, and stress and anxiety. Age-based differences revealed that younger age-groups were more vulnerable to stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Results show that these vulnerable individuals need more support. Age-specific interventions for modifiable factors that mediate the psychological distress need to urgently deployed to address the global mental health pandemic.","output":"Younger people are more vulnerable to stress, anxiety and depression during COVID-19 pandemic: A global cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To study the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Henan Province.

Objective This paper develops a model that compares the years of life lost (YLL) due to COVID-19 and the potential YLL due to the socioeconomic consequences of its containment. Methods It improves on existing estimates by conceptually disentangling YLL due to COVID-19 and socioeconomic status. By reconciling the normative life table approach with socioeconomic differences in life expectancy, it accounts for the fact that people with low socioeconomic status are hit particularly hard by the pandemic. The model also draws on estimates of socioeconomic differences in life expectancy to ascertain potential YLL due to income loss, school closures, and extreme poverty. Results Tentative results suggest that if only one-tenth of the current socioeconomic damage becomes permanent in the future, it may carry a higher YLL burden than COVID-19 in the more likely pandemic scenarios. The model further suggests that the socioeconomic harm outweighs the disease burden due to COVID-19 more quickly in poorer and more unequal societies. Most urgently, the substantial increase in extreme poverty needs immediate attention. Avoiding a relatively minor number of 4 million unemployed, 1 million extremely poor, and 2 million students with a higher learning loss may save a similar amount of life years as saving 1 million people from dying from COVID-19. Conclusions Primarily, the results illustrate the urgent need for redistributive policy interventions and global solidarity. In addition, the potentially high YLL burden from income and learning losses raises the burden of proof for the efficacy and necessity of school and business closures in the containment of the pandemic, especially where social safety nets are underdeveloped.","output":"Modeling Years of Life Lost Due to COVID-19, Socioeconomic Status, and Nonpharmaceutical Interventions: Development of a Prediction Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"News coverage plays a significant role in the tourism industry. 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has severely affected the tourism-related businesses and has been featured in Chinese news coverage.

How the complexity and fragmentation of this supply chain shape or reshape the decisions and courses of action as well as risk aversions of its actors (stakeholders) is the question we address in reviewing recent literature presented at the 2021 AEA-ASSA economics convention.* In doing so, we identify key aspects or dimensions of the supply chain that remain unexplored or under-explored in the empirical literature.Approach: All original research relevant to the pharmaceutical supply chain were selected from the AEA-ASSA convention panel sessions. Empirical evidence was thematically identified, and the theoretical and practical implications of findings on firm and stakeholder decision-making were analyzed. FINDINGS Stakeholder choices and risks in the action steps or stages of the supply chain are conditioned or framed by variables that are less prominent and seldom documented in the empirical literature. These include firm ownership and marketing, the provider's IT system, pricing and discounts negotiated by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), health insurance coverage, employer plan sponsorship, and hassle costs of drug prescribing and monitoring. On the other hand, prominent or well-documented policy initiatives, like international reference pricing and renationalization or \\"decoupling\\" from global value chains, can have unintended effects on supply chain actors and end-users, such as reverse redistribution. The continuing and changing multi-dimensional character of the supply chain adds to its complexity and fragmentation. CONCLUSIONS Organizational, operational, and value-adding measures to overhaul the drug supply chain and make it perform better have been proposed in the surveyed literature and elsewhere. Yet, aspects of the supply chain that bear a direct impact on firm short-term financial success typically assume precedence in evaluations of performance and effectiveness.

Restraint in the prone position has been shown to alter respiratory and cardiac physiology, although this is thought not to be to the degree that would cause asphyxia in a healthy, adult individual. This comprehensive review identifies and summarizes the current scientific literature on prone position and restraint, including experiments that assess physiology on individuals restrained in a prone position. Some of these experimental approaches have attempted to replicate situations in which prone restraint would be used. Overall, most findings revealed that individuals subjected to physical prone restraint experienced a decrease in ventilation and/or cardiac output (CO) in prone restraint. Metabolic acidosis is noted with increased physical activity, in restraint-associated cardiac arrest and simulated encounters. A decrease in ventilation and CO can significantly worsen acidosis and hemodynamics. Given these findings, deaths associated with prone physical restraint are not the direct result of asphyxia but are due to cardiac arrest secondary to metabolic acidosis compounded by inadequate ventilation and reduced CO. As such, the cause of death in these circumstances would be more aptly referred to as \\"prone restraint cardiac arrest\\" as opposed to \\"restraint asphyxia\\" or \\"positional asphyxia.\\"","output":"Prone restraint cardiac arrest: A comprehensive review of the scientific literature and an explanation of the physiology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses are change-prone entities often used as models to study evolutionary mechanisms.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on LT recipients compared to general population in the Campania region. In this prospective double-centre study, we enrolled all consecutive adult LT recipients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infection. Data were collected at diagnosis of COVID-19 and during follow-up and compared with the regional population. Thirty LT recipients (3.28%) developed SARS-CoV-2-infection (76.66% male, median age 62.61 years). Sixteen (53.33%) were symptomatic. Common symptoms were fever, cough, fatigue, and anosmia. Twenty-five (83.33%) were outpatients, 5 (16.66%) required hospitalization (6.66% admitted to Intensive Care Unit, 6.62% developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and 6.66% died). Immunosuppressors were in 3 (10%) patients. Incidence rate of COVID-19 was similar between LT patients and general population (3.28% vs 4.37%, p = 0.142) with higher rate of symptoms in LT patients (53.33% vs 15.87%, p < 0.000). At univariate analysis, hospitalization and case fatality rates were higher in LT patients compared to general population (16.66% vs 4.54%, p = 0.001; and 6.66% vs 1.76%, p = 0.041, respectively). At multivariable logistic regression analysis, LT patients with COVID-19 were more frequently symptomatic (OR 5.447 [95% CI 2.437C12.177], p < 0.000), whereas hospitalization and death for COVID-19 were not significatively associated with LT condition (p = 0.724 and p = 0.462, respectively) and were comparable with general population.

No study has investigated whether this results in safer care. OBJECTIVE: To compare the frequency of medication errors when administering an intravenous medicine using the current National Health Service Injectable Medicines Guide (IMG) versus an IMG version revised with user-testing. METHOD: Single-blind, randomised parallel group in situ simulation. Participants were on-duty nurses/midwives who regularly prepared intravenous medicines. Using a training manikin in their clinical area, participants administered a voriconazole infusion, a high-risk medicine requiring several steps to prepare. They were randomised to use current IMG guidelines or IMG guidelines revised with user-testing. Direct observation was used to time the simulation and identify errors. Participant confidence was measured using a validated instrument. The primary outcome was the percentage of simulations with at least one moderate-severe IMG-related error, with error severity classified by an expert panel. RESULTS: In total, 133 participants were randomised to current guidelines and 140 to user-tested guidelines. Fewer moderate-severe IMG-related errors occurred with the user-tested guidelines (n=68, 49%) compared with current guidelines (n=79, 59%), but this difference was not statistically significant (risk ratio: 0.82; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.02). Significantly more simulations were completed without any IMG-related errors with the user-tested guidelines (n=67, 48%) compared with current guidelines (n=26, 20%) (risk ratio: 2.46; 95% CI 1.68 to 3.60). Median simulation completion time was 1.6 min (95% CI 0.2 to 3.0) less with the user-tested guidelines. Participants who used user-tested guidelines reported greater confidence.

We aimed to evaluate the gender influence in the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) countries in the first stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis employing the FacebookCCOVID-19 Symptom Survey developed by the University of Maryland. We categorized gender as men, women, and non-binary. The outcomes were the presence of anxiety or depressive symptoms, measured with two adapted questions extracted from the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). We used generalized linear models from the Poisson family, considering the survey's complex sampling. We calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and explored interactions with gender using the adjusted Wald test. RESULTS: We included 1,338,320 adults from LAC countries; 48.0, 50.6, and 1.4% were men, women, and non-binary participants, respectively. The overall prevalence of anxiety or depressive symptoms was 44.8 and 46.6%, respectively. We found interactions between gender and the rest of the independent variables. In the non-binary group, the association between age and anxiety symptomatology was lost after an age of 55 years. Furthermore, whereas living in a town was associated with a lower prevalence of anxiety and depression symptomatology in men and women, this did not happen among non-binary individuals. Compliance with physical distancing was associated with a lower prevalence of anxiety and depression symptomatology among women (anxiety: PRa = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.97C0.99; p < 0.001, depression: PRa = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.95C0.97; p < 0.001) and only anxiety in non-binary participants (anxiety: PRa = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.88C0.98; p = 0.005).

In India, most of the patients belong to rural areas and hence were unable to come for a follow-up visit. Hence, we reached out to patients on oral anticoagulation using telemedicine with aim of communicating with the patient concerning drug compliance, titration of dose of anticoagulation, health education, and identification of high-risk patients needing referral to the nearest health facility/our institute. This study was conducted at the Hero DMC heart institute (a tertiary care center for cardiac diseases). The study design is cross-sectional and involves a comparison of the pre-COVID-19 phase with the COVID-19 phase. We asked a five-component (Likert scale) questionnaire from patients for satisfaction after the consult. All symptoms, need for hospitalization and clinical events were recorded. The events were compared in both groups. RESULTS: We contacted 628 patients through telemedicine and 600 patients gave consent for participation in the study. For comparison, we analyzed data of 614 patients in the pre-COVID-19 phase. The mean age during the pre-COVID-19 phase was 55.27 + 17.09 years and the COVID-19 phase was 56.97 + 15.09 years with males more than females in both groups. There was no significant difference in the number of patients on oral anticoagulants and novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC). However, there were higher number of patients on antiplatelets in the pre-COVID phase (p value0.01). 37% in the pre-COVID-19 phase and 40.31 % in the COVID-19 phase were noted to have out of target range INR (International normalized ratio). There was no difference in the number of bleeding or thromboembolic events seen. Patient response as assessed by a questionnaire (Likert scale) showed that >75% of patients were satisfied. CONCLUSION: Through telemedicine, we were able to approach our patients on oral anticoagulation and achieved titration of anti-coagulation, and health education similar to pre-COVID-19 times.

In this study, we propose a joint classification and regression method to determine whether the patient would develop severe symptoms in the later time formulated as a classification task, and if yes, the conversion time will be predicted formulated as a classification task. To do this, the proposed method takes into account 1) the weight for each sample to reduce the outliers influence and explore the problem of imbalance classification, and 2) the weight for each feature via a sparsity regularization term to remove the redundant features of the high-dimensional data and learn the shared information across two tasks, i.e., the classification and the regression. To our knowledge, this study is the first work to jointly predict the disease progression and the conversion time, which could help clinicians to deal with the potential severe cases in time or even save the patients lives. Experimental analysis was conducted on a real data set from two hospitals with 408 chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Results show that our method achieves the best classification (e.g., 85.91% of accuracy) and regression (e.g., 0.462 of the correlation coefficient) performance, compared to all comparison methods. Moreover, our proposed method yields 76.97% of accuracy for predicting the severe cases, 0.524 of the correlation coefficient, and 0.55 days difference for the conversion time.","output":"Joint prediction and time estimation of COVID-19 developing severe symptoms using chest CT scan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review article summarizes the current projects and perspectives of rheumatological healthcare research in the program area epidemiology of the German Rheumatism Research Center.

Although academia is taking an active role in evaluating digital sensing products, academic contributions to advancing the safe, effective, ethical, and equitable use of digital clinical measures are poorly characterized. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review to characterize the nature of academic research on digital clinical measures and to compare and contrast the types of sensors used and the sources of funding support for specific subareas of this research. METHODS: We conducted a PubMed search using a range of search terms to retrieve peer-reviewed articles reporting US-led academic research on digital clinical measures between January 2019 and February 2021. We screened each publication against specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. We then identified and categorized research studies based on the types of academic research, sensors used, and funding sources. Finally, we compared and contrasted the funding support for these specific subareas of research and sensor types. RESULTS: The search retrieved 4240 articles of interest. Following the screening, 295 articles remained for data extraction and categorization. The top five research subareas included operations research (research analysis; n=225, 76%), analytical validation (n=173, 59%), usability and utility (data visualization; n=123, 42%), verification (n=93, 32%), and clinical validation (n=83, 28%). The three most underrepresented areas of research into digital clinical measures were ethics (n=0, 0%), security (n=1, 0.5%), and data rights and governance (n=1, 0.5%). Movement and activity trackers were the most commonly studied sensor type, and physiological (mechanical) sensors were the least frequently studied. We found that government agencies are providing the most funding for research on digital clinical measures (n=192, 65%), followed by independent foundations (n=109, 37%) and industries (n=56, 19%), with the remaining 12% (n=36) of these studies completely unfunded. CONCLUSIONS: Specific subareas of academic research related to digital clinical measures are not keeping pace with the rapid expansion and adoption of digital sensing products.

During the pandemic orthopaedic specialist registrars were redeployed to \\"frontline\\" specialties occupying non-surgical roles. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopaedic training in the UK is unknown. This paper sought to examine the role of orthopaedic trainees during the COVID-19 and the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on postgraduate orthopaedic education. Methods: A 42-point questionnaire was designed, validated, and disseminated via e-mail and an instant-messaging platform. Results: A total of 101 orthopaedic trainees, representing the four nations (Wales, England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland), completed the questionnaire. Overall, 23.1% (23/101) of trainees were redeployed to non-surgical roles. Of these, 73% (17/23) were redeployed to intensive treatment units (ITUs), 13% (3/23) to A/E, and 13%(3/23%) to general medicine. Of the trainees redeployed to ITU 100%, (17/17) received formal induction. Non-deployed or returning trainees had a significant reduction in sessions.

With this study, we aimed to understand the effect of nationwide restrictions on medical education in Qatar, the models of education adopted during this period and perceptions of participants to the same. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study utilizing an online questionnaire distributed via convenience sampling between AprilCOctober 2020. Study participants were faculty and trainees in governmental undergraduate and postgraduate medical education institutes. Two sets of questionnaires were designed for each group. They were asked a series of questions to assess pre- and post-COVID pandemic educational practices, their preferred teaching methods, and their familiarity with electronic teaching platforms. Faculty respondents were asked about their perceived barriers to delivery of medical education during the pandemic and their agreement on a 5-point Likert scale on specific elements. Trainees were asked a series of multiple-choice questions to characterize their pre- and post-COVID pandemic educational experiences. Both groups were asked open-ended questions to provide qualitative insights into their answers. Data were analysed using STATA software version 12.0. RESULTS: Majority of trainees (58.5%) responded that the pandemic has adversely affected medical education at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Trainees (58.5%) and faculty (35.7%) reported an increased reliance on e-learning. Trainees preferred face-to-face education, while faculty preferred a combination of models of education delivery (33.5% versus 37.1%, p = 0.38). Although 52.5% of the faculty had no previous experience of delivering education through e-learning modalities, 58.9% however felt confident in using e-learning software. CONCLUSIONS: Faculty and trainees agree that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the provision of medical education and training in Qatar, with an increased dependence on e-learning. As trainees prefer face-to-face models of education, we may have to consider restructuring of medical curricula in order to ensure that optimum learning is achieved via e-learning, while at the same time enhancing our use, knowledge and understanding of the e -learning methods.

The study was partly community based and partly open to the public. Participants were invited to complete the survey using Google forms via social media (Facebook, WhatsApp). The survey was also distributed 54 times at the request of interested persons via e-mail. Total 1,043 questionnaires were assessed for eligibility and 41 were excluded (13 because of the age under 18, and 28 due to refusal to participate: non-response after sending questionnaire via e-mail). Finally 1,001 questionnaires were included to the study and statistical analysis was performed on the basis of the 1,001 responses. The questionnaire consisted of three parts: a sociodemographic survey, a questionnaire assessing the knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 and the General Health Questionnaire-28. Participants also determined their attitude toward being vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. The questionnaire was completed by a total of 1,001 participants: 243 people declared that they will not get vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Majority of people declaring the willingness to vaccinate were representatives of medical professions, suffering from chronic diseases, with higher values on the total GHQ-28 scale and the subscales: anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction and somatic dysfunction. Loss of income, difficult access to health care, recognizing the restrictions as excessive and knowledge about COVID-19 were found as significant positive determinants of the reluctance to vaccinate. Greater readiness to vaccinate can be associated with greater certainty about its effectiveness and a hypothetical collectivist attitude. Experiencing anxiety and psychopathological symptoms are risk factors for infection, but can also be conducive to reliance on information about vaccination presented in the media. Reluctance to vaccinate may result from greater awareness of the complexity of the disease, and thus less faith in the effectiveness of vaccines.","output":"Does Mental Health Affect the Decision to Vaccinate Against SARS-CoV-2?

We aimed to examine the relation between methodological quality of model development studies and their performance at external validation. METHODS: We systematically searched for externally validated multivariable prediction models that predict functional outcome following moderate or severe traumatic brain injury. Risk of bias and applicability of development studies was assessed with the Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). Each model was rated for its presentation with sufficient detail to be used in practice. Model performance was described in terms of discrimination (AUC), and calibration. Delta AUC (dAUC) was calculated to quantify the percentage change in discrimination between development and validation for all models. Generalized estimation equations (GEE) were used to examine the relation between methodological quality and dAUC while controlling for clustering. RESULTS: We included 54 publications, presenting ten development studies of 18 prediction models, and 52 external validation studies, including 245 unique validations. Two development studies (four models) were found to have low risk of bias (RoB). The other eight publications (14 models) showed high or unclear RoB. The median dAUC was positive in low RoB models (dAUC 8%, [IQR ? 4% to 21%]) and negative in high RoB models (dAUC ? 18%, [IQR ? 43% to 2%]). The GEE showed a larger average negative change in discrimination for high RoB models (? 32% (95% CI: ? 48 to ? 15) and unclear RoB models (? 13% (95% CI: ? 16 to ? 10)) compared to that seen in low RoB models. CONCLUSION: Lower methodological quality at model development associates with poorer model performance at external validation.

In addition, Blacks differed significantly from Whites in their assessment of COVID-19's threat to public health and the economy, the adequacy of government responses to COVID-19, and the appropriateness of behavioral changes to mitigate COVID-19's spread. Although in many cases these views of COVID-19 were also associated with political ideology, this association was significantly stronger for Whites than Blacks.

The measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have brought various restrictions both in social life and in areas such as education, economy and health. Due to the pandemic and subsequent restrictions, students continuing to higher education are likely to experience some psychological problems such as anxiety and depression. Therefore, studies regarding the anxiety levels of students should be carried out. In line with this need, the aim of the study is to adapt the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) into Turkish in the context of higher education. The sample consisted of 513 undergraduate and graduate students. The data collection tools were the CAS and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The results of the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the factor structure of the original scale and yielded an excellent fit for all the indices. The original factor structure of the CAS was also confirmed, and the scores significantly correlated with gender, state-anxiety and health status of the participants. The scores obtained from the adapted scale were found highly reliable and valid. The increase in the spread of COVID-19, especially after the mutations of the virus have emerged, indicates that its psychological and behavioral consequences and effects might last longer. To this end, the study has valuable implications for higher education policy makers, university administrators and teaching staff.","output":"Adaptation of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale in Turkish for the Higher Education Context: A Validity and Reliability Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article provides an overview of the current situation in Greece regarding digital archaeological data stewardship.

Even so, fragmentation and variation would be the proper terms to describe the status of the stewardship of digital archaeological data in Greece. Our review shows that there is substantial effort directed towards digital archaeological data stewardship and accessibility by all stakeholders within the archaeological sector. Finally, we add a few thoughts and suggestions, and indicate the need to generate a network that could take steps towards more inclusive strategies within digital data stewardship.

Based on standardized exams (SAT Suite) and a survey of rural Michigan students in grades 8-11, we find that rural students with broadband home Internet access are more interested in school and leave homework incomplete less often. However, the relationship to classroom grades (GPA) is relatively trivial. Yet, we find that students who are not dependent on a cell phone for Internet access and those with higher digital skills, especially social media skills, rank considerably higher on the SAT. Rural students with broadband Internet access are able to participate in a more diverse array of online media activities, which supports building digital skills. Any negative relationship between time spent on social media, video games, other digital media and educational outcomes is outweighed by the benefit to digital skills. However, aspects of rural culture;the emphasis on activities such as sports, as a path to postsecondary schooling and upward, social mobility;may be stunting the positive relationship between access, media use, and digital skills. Whereas extra-curricular sports have no direct relationship to SAT performance, students who spend more time on sports receive higher grades and have higher educational aspirations than those with more digital skills.

Liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis was performed to measure the abundance of itaconate. OI treatment and Irg1 knockdown were performed to study the role of OI in AAA formation. Nrf2 intervention in vivo was performed to detect the critical role of Nrf2 in the beneficial effect of OI on AAA. FINDINGS: We found that itaconate suppressed the formation of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AAA in apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe-/-) mice, while Irg1 deficiency exerted the opposite effect. Mechanistically, itaconate inhibited vascular inflammation by enabling Nrf2 to function as a transcriptional repressor of downstream inflammatory genes via alkylation of Keap1. Moreover, Nrf2 deficiency significantly aggravated inflammatory factor expression and promoted AAA formation. In addition, Keap1 overexpression significantly promoted Ang II-induced AAA formation, which was inhibited by itaconate. INTERPRETATION: Itaconate inhibited AAA formation by suppressing vascular inflammation, and therapeutic approaches to increase itaconate are potentially beneficial for preventing AAA formation.

Urgent surgical decompression aims to prevent progressive neurological deficit. Symptoms of cauda equina syndrome (CES), such as back pain, sciatica and bladder dysfunction are common in the population, but the majority of those investigated do not have radiological cauda equina compression. However, a missed diagnosis can have significant medical, social and legal consequences. We investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on presentation and management of suspected CES. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analysed referral, investigation and treatment of CES in a regional neurosurgical centre during the initial COVID-19 surge between March and May 2020 compared with March to May 2019. RESULTS: Referrals for suspected CES were similar during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 275) compared with 2019 (n = 261, p = 0.596) despite a significant (19%) decrease in total emergency neurosurgical referrals (1248 in 2020 vs 1544 in 2019, p < 0.001). Nineteen (7%) of the suspected CES referrals underwent decompression in 2020, similar to 16 (6%) in 2019 (p = 0.867). There were no differences in outcomes or complications and no evidence of delays in presentation or treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike other emergency neurosurgical conditions, the number of referrals for suspected CES and the percentage of referrals with radiological cauda equina compression were unchanged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The persistence of CES referrals when many people stayed away from hospital highlights the distress and worry caused by suspected CES and its symptoms to both patients and healthcare providers.","output":"Suspected cauda equina syndrome: no reduction in investigation, referral and treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: COVID-19 has impacted many facets of medical care Elective surgical procedures were put on hold to prevent the spread of the virus, reduce exposure risk of staff, and potentially repurpose ORs for critical care areas Interventional radiology (IR) suites were largely kept open for all procedures (emergent or elective) with changes focused on workflow, PPE, and room sanitation between procedures Previous single-hospital study showed a large reduction in IR procedure volume over a span of 4-weeks Here, we explore the effect of COVID-19 on procedure volume in a multi-hospital analysis over the course of months Materials and Methods: Case load in 3 URMC-affiliated hospitals during a 4-months period before and after the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed Procedure types and context (inpatient, outpatient, or emergency) were recorded for all procedures CT-guided procedures, angiograms, and venograms were grouped together Procedure volume was calculated as a percentage of all procedures, and differences per month were compared between pre-COVID and COVID months using two-tailed t-test with significance set at P&lt; 0 05 Results: A total of 7159 procedures were performed over the eight-month period (November 2019CJune 2020) There was a significant reduction in procedures per month after the onset of the COVID pandemic from 1005 to 838 (P = 0 023) When analyzing volume of individual procedures, there was a significant reduction in volume of common procedures, such as Mediport discontinuations (P = 0 035) and ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsies (P = 0 027) There was an increase in volume of procedures shared with other specialties, such as angiograms (P = 0 045) and paracenteses (P = 0 005) More complex procedures, such as TIPS or tumor ablations did not reflect a significant change in volume There was a significant decrease in volume of emergency room procedures (P = 0 011) and a significant increase in volume of inpatient procedures (P = 0 016);changes in outpatient procedures were not significant Conclusions: Across 3 hospitals in the URMC network, there was an overall reduction in monthly procedure volume after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic As expected, common elective procedures experienced a decrease in volume during the COVID-19 months However, IR continues to demonstrate its value during the COVID-19 pandemic as a minimally invasive specialty, seeing an overall increases in inpatient volume and procedures commonly shared with other specialties","output":"Abstract No. 167 Interventional radiology procedure volume changes during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose has been shown to improve symptoms and quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure and iron deficiency. We aimed to evaluate the effect of ferric carboxymaltose, compared with placebo, on outcomes in patients who were stabilised after an episode of acute heart failure. METHODS AFFIRM-AHF was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial done at 121 sites in Europe, South America, and Singapore. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, were hospitalised for acute heart failure with concomitant iron deficiency (defined as ferritin <100 g/L, or 100-299 g/L with transferrin saturation <20%), and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50%. Before hospital discharge, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous ferric carboxymaltose or placebo for up to 24 weeks, dosed according to the extent of iron deficiency. To maintain masking of patients and study personnel, treatments were administered in black syringes by personnel not involved in any study assessments. The primary outcome was a composite of total hospitalisations for heart failure and cardiovascular death up to 52 weeks after randomisation, analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and had at least one post-randomisation data point. Secondary outcomes were the composite of total cardiovascular hospitalisations and cardiovascular death; cardiovascular death; total heart failure hospitalisations; time to first heart failure hospitalisation or cardiovascular death; and days lost due to heart failure hospitalisations or cardiovascular death, all evaluated up to 52 weeks after randomisation. Safety was assessed in all patients for whom study treatment was started. A pre-COVID-19 sensitivity analysis on the primary and secondary outcomes was prespecified. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02937454, and has now been completed. FINDINGS Between March 21, 2017, and July 30, 2019, 1525 patients were screened, of whom 1132 patients were randomly assigned to study groups. Study treatment was started in 1110 patients, and 1108 (558 in the carboxymaltose group and 550 in the placebo group) had at least one post-randomisation value. 293 primary events (572 per 100 patient-years) occurred in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 372 (725 per 100 patient-years) occurred in the placebo group (rate ratio [RR] 079, 95% CI 062-101, p=0059). 370 total cardiovascular hospitalisations and cardiovascular deaths occurred in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 451 occurred in the placebo group (RR 080, 95% CI 064-100, p=0050). There was no difference in cardiovascular death between the two groups (77 [14%] of 558 in the ferric carboxymaltose group vs 78 [14%] in the placebo group; hazard ratio [HR] 096, 95% CI 070-132, p=081). 217 total heart failure hospitalisations occurred in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 294 occurred in the placebo group (RR 074; 95% CI 058-094, p=0013). The composite of first heart failure hospitalisation or cardiovascular death occurred in 181 (32%) patients in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 209 (38%) in the placebo group (HR 080, 95% CI 066-098, p=0030). Fewer days were lost due to heart failure hospitalisations and cardiovascular death for patients assigned to ferric carboxymaltose compared with placebo (369 days per 100 patient-years vs 548 days per 100 patient-years; RR 067, 95% CI 047-097, p=0035). Serious adverse events occurred in 250 (45%) of 559 patients in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 282 (51%) of 551 patients in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION In patients with iron deficiency, a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50%, and who were stabilised after an episode of acute heart failure, treatment with ferric carboxymaltose was safe and reduced the risk of heart failure hospitalisations, with no apparent effect on the risk of cardiovascular death.

We further found that empagliflozin raised endogenous ketone body (KB) levels, and thus its use or treatment with 1,3-butanediol, a KB precursor, prevented decreases in renal ATP levels and organ damage in the mice. The renoprotective effect of empagliflozin was abolished by gene deletion of Hmgcs2, a rate-limiting enzyme of ketogenesis. Furthermore, KBs attenuated mTORC1-associated podocyte damage and proteinuria in diabetic db/db mice.

Immune reactions against viral infections are closely related to viral and host proteins sequence similarity. Molecular Mimicry has been described for many different viruses; sequence similarities of viral and human tissue proteins may trigger autoimmune reactions after viral infections due to similarities between viral and human structures. With this study, we aimed to investigate the protein sequence similarity of SARS CoV-2 with retinal proteins and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) surface proteins. Retinal proteins involved in autoimmune retinopathy and retinal pigment epithelium surface transport proteins were analyzed in order to infer their structural similarity to surface glycoprotein (S), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), ORF1ab polyprotein (orf1ab) proteins of SARS CoV-2. Protein similarity comparisons, 3D protein structure prediction, T cell epitopes-MHC binding prediction, B cell epitopes-MHC binding prediction and the evaluation of the antigenicity of peptides assessments were performed. The protein sequence analysis was made using the Pairwise Sequence Alignment and the LALIGN program. 3D protein structure estimates were made using Swiss Model with default settings and analyzed with TM-align web server. T-cell epitope identification was performed using the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis (IEDB) resource Tepitool. B cell epitopes based on sequence characteristics of the antigen was performed using amino acid scales and HMMs with the BepiPred 2.0 web server. The predicted peptides/epitopes in terms of antigenicity were examined using the default settings with the VaxiJen v2.0 server. Analyses showed that, there is a meaningful similarities between 6 retinal pigment epithelium surface transport proteins (MRP-4, MRP-5, RFC1, SNAT7, TAUT and MATE) and the SARS CoV-2 E protein. Immunoreactive epitopic sites of these proteins which are similar to protein E epitope can create an immune stimulation on T cytotoxic and T helper cells and 6 of these 9 epitopic sites are also vaxiJen. These result imply that autoimmune cross-reaction is likely between the studied RPE proteins and SARS CoV-2 E protein. The structure of SARS CoV-2, its proteins and immunologic reactions against these proteins remain largely unknown. Understanding the structure of SARS CoV-2 proteins and demonstration of similarity with human proteins are crucial to predict an autoimmune response associated with immunity against host proteins and its clinical manifestations as well as possible adverse effects of vaccination.","output":"Using bioinformatic protein sequence similarity to investigate if SARS CoV-2 infection could cause an ocular autoimmune inflammatory reactions?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent pandemics of the SARS-Cov-2 has pushed physical activity (PA) and exercise at the forefront of the discussion, since PA is associated with a reduced risk of developing all the chronic diseases strongly associated with severe cases of SARS-Cov-2 and exercise is considered a complimentary therapeutics for the treatment of these age-related conditions.

METHODS: A total of 12 healthy volunteers and 27 COVID-19 survivors (62.4  8.1 days between infection and image acquisition) were recruited in this prospective study and performed chest (1)H MRI acquisitions with free tidal breathing. Then, conventional Fourier decomposition ventilation (FD-V) and global fractional ventilation (FV(Global)) were analyzed. Besides, a modified PREFUL (mPREFUL) method was developed to adapt to COVID-19 survivors and generate dynamic ventilation maps and parameters. All the ventilation maps and parameters were analyzed using Students t-test. Pearsons correlation and a Bland-Altman plot between FV(Global) and mPREFUL were analyzed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between COVID-19 and healthy groups regarding a static FD-V map (0.47  0.12 vs 0.42  0.08; p = .233). However, mPREFUL demonstrated lots of regional high ventilation areas (high ventilation percentage (HVP): 23.7%  10.6%) existed in survivors. This regional heterogeneity (i.e., HVP) in survivors was significantly higher than in healthy volunteers (p = .003). The survivors breathed deeper (flow-volume loop: 5375  3978 vs 1688  789; p = .005), and breathed more air in respiratory cycle (total amount: 62.6  19.3 vs 37.3  9.9; p < .001).

Using the experience of one of the hospitals as a case study, we discuss the health and economic implications of this response strategy and its potential application in other countries. METHODS: This retrospective observational study analyzed health resource utilization and clinical outcomes data for 2011 inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to Leishenshan Hospital during its 67 days of operation from February 8th to April 14th, 2020. We used a top-down costing approach to estimate the total cost of treating patients at the Leishenshan Hospital, including capital cost for hospital construction, health personnel costs, and direct health care costs. We used a multivariate generalized linear model to examine risk factors associated with in-hospital deaths. RESULTS: During the 67 days of hospital operation, 19 medical teams comprising of 933 doctors and 2312 nurses were gradually transferred to Leishenshan Hospital from across China. Of the 2011 admissions, 4.5% used intensive care and 2.0% used ventilators. Overall median length of stay was 19 days, and 21 days for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). The case fatality rate (CFR) was 2.3% overall, 41.8% in the ICU, and 0.4% in general ward (GW). CFRs were 55% and 50% among patients using non-invasive and invasive ventilators, respectively. The mean total cost and direct health care cost were CNY806 997 (US$114 793) and CNY16 087 (US$2288), respectively. Patients admitted to the ICU had much higher direct health care costs, on average, compared to those in the GW (CNY150 415 vs CNY9720, or US$21 396 vs US$1383). The mean direct health care cost per patient with severe or critical diseases was more than five times higher than those with mild or moderate diseases (CNY45 191 vs CNY8838, or US$6428 vs US$1257). Older age, having comorbidities, and critical disease were associated with higher risks of death from COVID-19. Lower health worker to patient ratio (<2.6) was not associated with in-hospital death. CONCLUSION: An adequate health workforce were mobilized and deployed to a new temporary hospital. The Leishenshan Hospital increased access to care during the surge in COVID-19 infections, facilitated timely treatment, and transferred COVID-19 patients between GWs and ICUs within the hospital, all of which are potential contributors to lowering the CFR. Patients in the ICU experienced a much higher CFR and a greater burden of health care cost than those in GW. Our results have important implications for other countries interested in constructing temporary emergency hospitals, such as the need for adequate infrastructure capacities and financial support, centralized strategies to mobilize health workforce and to provide respiratory protective devices, and improvement in access to health care.","output":"The health and economic impact of constructing temporary field hospitals to meet the COVID-19 pandemic surge: Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital in China as a case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background A redesigned MB ChB Medicine course at the University of Bristol had its first intake of students in 2017 and its first paediatric placement in 2020. An identical paediatric Practice Objective Structured Clinical Exam (pOSCE) was included in the 2020-2021 redesigned paediatric course as was previously in the 2019-2020 course. This provided us with an opportunity to assess any difference in outcome of the new Case Based Learning course. Objectives We evaluated whether the new redesigned, shorter (6-week versus 9-week) Case Based Learning paediatric course altered student performance in this identical pOSCE. Methods We evaluated the pOSCE marks of year 4 MB ChB students at the end of their paediatric courses, following initial successful pilot of the formative assessment. The two pOSCE stations (A and B) were identical in 2019-2020 and 2020- 2021 and each student's performance was examined using the same University structured mark scheme. The teaching fellow examiners were different in 2020-2021 and were blinded to the 2019-2020 student marks. We compared student marks of 2020-2021 to 2019-2020. Results One pOSCE took place in 2019-2020, due to Covid interruption, assessing 33 students. To date, 61 students have sat the pOSCE in the 2020-2021 cohort. After incomplete mark sheets were excluded, our evaluation compared 27 pOSCE mark sheets from 2019-2020 with 49 from 2020- 2021. The mean scores are outlined in the table 1 below. Conclusions Our evaluation provided evidence that students' paediatric clinical performance was similar from both courses. Whilst this is reassuring, perhaps one aim of a redesigned course would be increased clinical performance. Maintained performance despite the shortened course may have been due to the introduction of regular bedside teaching on the 2020 course. Limitations of our study included OSCE limitations and small sample size. Keeping practice assessments unchanged when introducing new courses can facilitate early course evaluation.

Also, incidence and injury pattern of hand and finger injuries in this patient group were analysed. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study, which was undertaken as a clinical audit service. All patients under 17 years presenting to our paediatric emergency department with hand and finger injuries over a 17-month period were included in the analysis. We studied incidence and injury mechanism, current subspecialty referral practice, as well as paediatric emergency department and hospital length of stay. RESULTS: We identified 929 children for inclusion in the analysis. The most frequent reasons for presentation were hand contusions (25.5%) and fractures (20.8%). Paediatric emergency medicine physicians alone managed 845 patients (90.6%), paediatric surgery referral occurred in 50 (5.4%) and hand surgery consultation in 37 (4.0%) cases. Mean length of stay in the paediatric emergency department was 154 min and significantly longer when subspecialty review occurred. Hospital admission occurred in 87 cases (9.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Involvement of subspecialties in the care of hand and finger injuries was associated with significantly increased length of stay in the paediatric emergency department. We discuss obstacles and enablers for timely patient referral and management. We suggest the implementation of referral guidelines, tailored to the individual emergency department, to reduce unnecessary patient journey delays and to ensure higher quality repair of complex hand injuries by the appropriate surgeon, with better outcomes. Making use of the emergence of multiple surgical subspecialties for targeted treatment of paediatric finger and hand injuries might be desirable.","output":"An analysis of finger and hand injuries in children in a tertiary paediatric emergency department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Real-world data regarding the effectiveness, safety and immunogenicity of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine are accumulating in the literature, suggesting that this vaccine generates high titres of S1-binding IgG antibodies that exhibit potent virus neutralization capacity.

They seem to be worthy of about as much scholarly scrutiny as their American counterpartshardly any, being mere infotainment, as some scholars say. However, their peculiar contexts make it difficult to trivialize them. Philippine satirists have long seemed vulnerable to prosecution under the country's defamation laws, including a recently-enacted cybercrime law. Thailand has a strict lse majest law and has been under martial rule twice in the past two decades. Singapore is one of the world's authoritarian democracies. Malaysia, sharing the colonial British legal heritage of Singapore, also has various legal restrictions on online expression. Indonesias Internet law makes online defamation and blasphemy a punishable offense. Yet the writers behind these websites seem to have been able to flout undemocratic laws and/or bypass the restrictions of repressive regimes without punishment. Is their largely unimpeded functionality under their respective regimes evidence that online satirical news is capable of pushing the boundaries of freedom of expression even in illiberal democratic states?

With rich experience in emergency responses and nursing, anesthesia nurses, along with emergency nurses and critical care nurses, play important roles during the treatment of COVID-19 patients. In our hospital, 27 of 34 anesthesia nurses participated in the front-line fight against COVID-19 and did an excellent job. Anesthesia care by nurses is relatively new in China, and the role of anesthesia nurses during a disaster response has not been fully appreciated.

This crisis offers us an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of emission reductions in terms of air quality. Here we use the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) in combination with surface observations to study the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown measures on air quality in southern California. Based on activity level statistics and satellite observations, we estimate the sectoral emission changes during the lockdown. Due to the reduced emissions, the population-weighted concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) decrease by 15 % in southern California. The emission reductions contribute 68 % of the PM2.5 concentration decrease before and after the lockdown, while meteorology variations contribute the remaining 32 %. Among all chemical compositions, the PM2.5 concentration decrease due to emission reductions is dominated by nitrate and primary components. For O3 concentrations, the emission reductions cause a decrease in rural areas but an increase in urban areas;the increase can be offset by a 70 % emission reduction in anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These findings suggest that a strengthened control on primary PM2.5 emissions and a well-balanced control on nitrogen oxides and VOC emissions are needed to effectively and sustainably alleviate PM2.5 and O3 pollution in southern California.","output":"Modeling the impact of COVID-19 on air quality in southern California: implications for future control policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: the purpose of this study was to estimate condition of right heart in patients with COVID-19 and viral pneumonia. Material and methods: 87 patients were included (age 53  13, 58% male) with established diagnosis of COVID-19 via PCR and viral pneumonia on CT scans. Patient's clinical condition was assessed by SHOCS-COVID and NEWS scales. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on 12  4.6 day from the first symptoms of disease. Levels of high-sense Troponin I and NT-proBNP were measured in blood samples. Results: Patients were divided into 3 groups according to pattern of viral pneumonia severity on CT scans.

RESULTS: We received a total of 148 survey responses; of the responders, 52% were male, 59% were physicians, and 50% worked in a hospital setting. We found that cardiology professionals were less likely, compared to other specialties, to view POCTs as improving patient management or reducing errors. These cardiology professionals were not constrained by resources or a lack of investment opportunities to implement these technologies.

However, those guidelines lack practical recommendations on ways to manage triage and diagnosis expressly for new cancer patients. Furthermore, there are no reports on the efficiency of the guidelines. One of the main issues in treating musculoskeletal tumours is the complexity and variability of presentation. We offer a triage model, used in a quaternary-referral musculoskeletal oncology centre, that allows us to maintain an open pathway for referral of new patients while minimizing exposure risks. A multidisciplinary approach and analysis of existing investigations allow for a pre-clinic evaluation. The model identifies 3 groups of patients: a? Patients with suspected high-grade malignancy, or benign cases with aggressive features, both in need of further evaluation in the clinic and prompt treatmenta? Patients with low-grade malignancy, and benign cases whose treatment is not urgent, that are managed during the pandemic by telemedicine, with reassurance and information about their illnessa? Patients who can be managed by their local medical professionals In comparison to a pre-pandemic period, that approach resulted in a higher ratio of malignant-to-benign conditions for new patients seen in the clinic (3:4 vs. 1:3 respectively), thus using available resources more efficiently and prioritizing patients with suspected high-grade malignancy.

Strategies for precise early detection and effective targeted treatment of pancreatic cancer are urgently needed. Because of its unique advantages, molecular targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging (CEUI) has generated new opportunities to overcome this challenge. The aim of this study was to explore multifunctional nanobubbles named IR780-NBs-DTX as novel ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) for dual-mode targeted imaging and photothermal ablation combined with chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. An optimized \\"film hydration method\\" was used to prepare IR780-NBs-DTX in this research. The characteristics and ability of the new UCAs were detected via in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo experiments. The initial dose of 0.15 mg IR-780 iodide/1.0 mg DTX was considered to be the best formula for IR780-NBs-DTX, and the concentration of 6 106 bubbles/mL was best for CEUI. The excellent characteristics of IR780-NBs-DTX, including a uniform nanoscale particle size (349.8 159.1 nm, n= 3), good performance in dual-mode imaging, high stability and reliable biocompatibility, were also proven. In the in vitro cell experiments, IR780-NBs-DTX targeted more pancreatic cancer cells than the control treatments, and the targeting rate was approximately 95.6 1.7%. Under irradiation with an 808 nm laser, most cells died. Furthermore, the in vivo study demonstrated that IR780-NBs-DTX could precisely detect pancreatic cancer through near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging and CEUI, and the tumor almost disappeared at 18 days after combined treatment. In ex vivo experiments, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) showed that the expression of HSP70 increased and that of PCNA decreased, and many apoptotic tumor cells were observed by TUNEL staining in the IR780-NBs-DTX group. The newly prepared IR780-NBs-DTX are novel nanosized UCAs with high efficiency for dual-mode molecular targeted imaging and combined therapy, and they may have future potential applications in the precise detection and effective targeted therapy of small and metastatic lesions in the early stage of pancreatic cancer.","output":"Preparation of multifunctional nanobubbles and their application in bimodal imaging and targeted combination therapy of early pancreatic cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination produces neutralizing antibody responses that contribute to better clinical outcomes.

We descriptively examine the turnover trends in nurse employees and all employees over time by profit status. We evaluate whether profit status is associated with high turnover using pooled linear regressions controlling for nursing home and resident characteristics. Descriptive results show that for-profit facilities had higher turnover of nurse employees (61.1% vs. 49.6%) and all employees (56.6% vs. 45.4%). Results from multivariate regressions show that, compared to non-profit facilities, for-profit facilities had 6.93 percentage points higher (p<0.01) turnover of all employees, and 7.76 percentage points higher (p<0.01) turnover of nurse employees after controlling for facility and resident characteristics.

The survivors have a higher risk of developing neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD) due to brain insults from perinatal complications related to poor quality of health services during pregnancy, around the time of birth, and during the postnatal period. This study aimed to assess health facility readiness to care for high risk newborn babies in order to inform programming that fosters early childhood development in eastern Uganda. METHODS: A cross sectional study of 6 hospitals and 10 higher level health centers that offer comprehensive maternal and newborn care was carried out in February 2020 in eastern Uganda. A World Health Organization Service Availability and Readiness Assessment tool (SARA) was adapted and used to assess the health facility readiness to manage maternal and neonatal conditions that are related to NDD. In addition, 201 mothers of high risk newborn babies were interviewed on their satisfaction with health services received. Readiness scores were derived from percentage average facilities with available infrastructure and essential medical commodities to manage neonatal complications. Descriptive statistics were computed for client satisfaction with service provision, and p values used to compare private not for profit to public health facilities. RESULTS: There was limited availability in numbers and skilled human resource especially the neonatal nurses. Hospitals and health centers scored least in preterm and hypothermia care, with averages of 38% and 18% respectively. The highest scores were in essential newborn care, with readiness of 78% and 85% for hospitals and health centers, followed by resuscitation at 78% and 77%, respectively. There were no guidelines on positive interaction with newborn babies to foster neurodevelopment. The main cause of admission to neonatal care units was birth asphyxia followed by prematurity, indicative of intrapartum care challenges. The overall client satisfaction with health services was higher in private not for profit facilities at 91% compared to public hospitals at 73%, p = 0.017. CONCLUSION: Health facility readiness was inadequate in management of preterm complications. Efforts should, therefore, be geared to improving availability of inputs and quality of emergency obstetric and newborn care in order to manage high risk newborns and reduce the burden of NDD in this setting.","output":"Health facility readiness to care for high risk newborn babies for early childhood development in eastern Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The models used to estimate disease transmission, susceptibility and severity determine what epidemiology can (and cannot tell) us about COVID-19. These include: 'model organisms' chosen for their phylogenetic/aetiological similarities; multivariable statistical models to estimate the strength/direction of (potentially causal) relationships between variables (through 'causal inference'), and the (past/future) value of unmeasured variables (through 'classification/prediction'); and a range of modelling techniques to predict beyond the available data (through 'extrapolation'), compare different hypothetical scenarios (through 'simulation'), and estimate key features of dynamic processes (through 'projection'). Each of these models: address different questions using different techniques; involve assumptions that require careful assessment; and are vulnerable to generic and specific biases that can undermine the validity and interpretation of their findings. It is therefore necessary that the models used: can actually address the questions posed; and have been competently applied. In this regard, it is important to stress that extrapolation, simulation and projection cannot offer accurate predictions of future events when the underlying mechanisms (and the contexts involved) are poorly understood and subject to change. Given the importance of understanding such mechanisms/contexts, and the limited opportunity for experimentation during outbreaks of novel diseases, the use of multivariable statistical models to estimate the strength/direction of potentially causal relationships between two variables (and the biases incurred through their misapplication/misinterpretation) warrant particular attention. Such models must be carefully designed to address: 'selection-collider bias', 'unadjusted confounding bias' and 'inferential mediator adjustment bias' - all of which can introduce effects capable of enhancing, masking or reversing the estimated (true) causal relationship between the two variables examined.1 Selection-collider bias occurs when these two variables independently cause a third (the 'collider'), and when this collider determines/reflects the basis for selection in the analysis. It is likely to affect all incompletely representative samples, although its effects will be most pronounced wherever selection is constrained (e.g. analyses focusing on infected/hospitalised individuals). Unadjusted confounding bias disrupts the estimated (true) causal relationship between two variables when: these share one (or more) common cause(s); and when the effects of these causes have not been adjusted for in the analyses (e.g. whenever confounders are unknown/unmeasured). Inferentially similar biases can occur when: one (or more) variable(s) (or 'mediators') fall on the causal path between the two variables examined (i.e. when such mediators are caused by one of the variables and are causes of the other); and when these mediators are adjusted for in the analysis. Such adjustment is commonplace when: mediators are mistaken for confounders; prediction models are mistakenly repurposed for causal inference; or mediator adjustment is used to estimate direct and indirect causal relationships (in a mistaken attempt at 'mediation analysis'). These three biases are central to ongoing and unresolved epistemological tensions within epidemiology. All have substantive implications for our understanding of COVID-19, and the future application of artificial intelligence to 'data-driven' modelling of similar phenomena. Nonetheless, competently applied and carefully interpreted, multivariable statistical models may yet provide sufficient insight into mechanisms and contexts to permit more accurate projections of future disease outbreaks.","output":"COVID-19 and the epistemology of epidemiological models at the dawn of AI."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Those over the age of 50 represent the majority of people living with HIV (PWH), most of the HIV research, prevention and service retention work is targeted at at-risk communities under age 50. Given this diverse and growing population, intersections of age with HIV need to be prioritized. This focus would actively increase quality of care and life experience for older PWH and the growing numbers transitioning into old age. Using local, national, and international data, this symposium will highlight the unmet social needs of older PWH. Presentations will provide evidence of unmet need, decreased self-esteem, enhanced health burden, and the damaging nature of stigma. Given the impact of COVID-19 globally, the data will further demonstrate the need to support immunocompromised older PWH. Older PWH are a marginalized community and the effects of COVID-19 have been disproportionately severe. With the adverse health outcomes experienced because of COVID-19 and intersectional stigma, it is important to understand the support structures that are and are not in place for older PWH. Advance care directives make up an integral part of future planning, especially for those living with chronic health concerns, yet little research has previously evidenced the steps taken by OPWH. Finally, using data from sub-Saharan Africa, emotional and instrumental social support sufficiency will be described to highlight the unmet needs of these older PWH.

Currently, only weekly standardized incidence rate data per age group are publicly available, limiting assessment of herd immunity. Here, we estimate the time-series case counts of COVID-19 among age groups currently ineligible for vaccination in the USA. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of publicly available data. COVID-19 case counts by age groups were computed using incidence rate data from the CDC and population estimates from the US Census Bureau. We also created a web-based application to allow on demand analysis. RESULTS: A total of 78 weeks of data were incorporated in the analysis, suggesting the highest peak in cases within the 5-11 year age group on week ending 2021-01-09 (n=61,095) followed by the 12-15 year age group (n=58,093). As of 2021-07-24, case counts in the 5-11 year age group have expanded beyond other groups rapidly. DISCUSSION: This study suggests it is possible to estimate pediatric case counts of COVID-19. National agencies should report COVID-19 time series case counts for pediatric age cohorts.

Understanding biases within case based data sources used in epidemiological analyses are important as they can detract from the value of these rich datasets. This raises questions of how variations in surveillance can affect the estimation of epidemiological parameters such as the case growth rates. We use standardised line list data of COVID-19 from Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia to estimate delay distributions of symptom-onset-to-confirmation, -hospitalisation and -death as well as hospitalisation-to-death at high spatial resolutions and throughout time. Using these estimates, we model the biases introduced by the delay from symptom-onset-to-confirmation on national and state level case growth rates (rt) using an adaptation of the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm. We find significant heterogeneities in the estimation of delay distributions through time and space with delay difference of up to 19 days between epochs at the state level. Further, we find that by changing the spatial scale, estimates of case growth rate can vary by up to 0.13 d-1. Lastly, we find that states with a high variance and/or mean delay in symptom-onset-to-diagnosis also have the largest difference between the rt estimated from raw and deconvolved case counts at the state level. We highlight the importance of high-resolution case based data in understanding biases in disease reporting and how these biases can be avoided by adjusting case numbers based on empirical delay distributions.

One third of 9 million Veterans Health Administration enrolled Veterans live in rural areas. Although digital solutions can expand capacity, enhance care access, and reduce financial burden, they may also exacerbate rural-urban health disparities. Careful evaluation of patients' perceptions and policy tradeoffs are necessary to optimize teleoncology postpandemic. METHODS Patients with  1 teleoncology visit with medical, surgical, or radiation oncology between March 2020 and June 2020 were identified retrospectively. Validated, Likert-type survey assessing patient satisfaction was developed. Follow-up survey was conducted on patients with  1 teleoncology visit from August 2020 to January 2021. Travel distance, time, cost, and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated based on zip codes. RESULTS A hundred surveys were completed (response rate, 62%). Patients overall were satisfied with teleoncology (83% Agree or Strongly Agree) but felt less satisfied than in-person visits (47% Agree or Strongly Agree). Audiovisual component improved patient perception of involvement in care, ability to self-manage health or medical needs, and comparability to in-person visits. Follow-up survey demonstrated similar satisfaction. Total travel-related savings are as follows: 86,470 miles, 84,374 minutes, $49,720 US dollars, and 35.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide. CONCLUSION Veterans are broadly satisfied with teleoncology. Audiovisual capabilities are critical to satisfaction. This is challenging for rural populations with lack of technology access. Patients experienced financial and time savings, and society benefitted from reduced carbon emissions.

The presence of many comorbidities further complicates matters, making a personalized approach necessary. An increasing number of reports indicate that inflammation of the brain leads to neurodegenerative changes, especially during perinatal life, short-circuiting the electrical system in the amygdala that is essential for our ability to feel emotions, but also regulates fear. Inflammation of the brain can result from the stimulation of mast cellsfound in all tissues including the brainby neuropeptides, stress, toxins, and viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, leading to the activation of microglia. These resident brain defenders then release even more inflammatory molecules and stop pruning nerve connections, disrupting neuronal connectivity, lowering the fear threshold, and derailing the expression of emotions, as seen in ASD. Many epidemiological studies have reported a strong association between ASD and atopic dermatitis (eczema), asthma, and food allergies/intolerance, all of which involve activated mast cells. Mast cells can be triggered by allergens, neuropeptides, stress, and toxins, leading to disruption of the bloodCbrain barrier (BBB) and activation of microglia. Moreover, many epidemiological studies have reported a strong association between stress and atopic dermatitis (eczema) during gestation, which involves activated mast cells. Both mast cells and microglia can also be activated by SARS-CoV-2 in affected mothers during pregnancy. We showed increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18 and its receptor, but decreased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-38 and its receptor IL-36R, only in the amygdala of deceased children with ASD. We further showed that the natural flavonoid luteolin is a potent inhibitor of the activation of both mast cells and microglia, but also blocks SARS-CoV-2 binding to its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A treatment approach should be tailored to each individual patient and should address hyperactivity/stress, allergies, or food intolerance, with the introduction of natural molecules or drugs to inhibit mast cells and microglia, such as liposomal luteolin.","output":"Ways to Address Perinatal Mast Cell Activation and Focal Brain Inflammation, including Response to SARS-CoV-2, in Autism Spectrum Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global financial market.

Medical professionals, notably junior doctors, are at increased risk of developing poor mental health and burnout. The GMC Barometer Study in 2020 showed that 32% of doctors found the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic detrimental to their wellbeing and mental health. The aim of this quality improvement project was to assess and improve hospital wellbeing support available to foundation doctors within Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (GHNHSFT) by learning and reflecting on the impact of COVID-19. METHOD: After identifying a lack of resources within GHNHSFT, wellbeing information boards were displayed in communal areas and distributed by email. These encompassed trust wide support, practical information including childcare and relaxation resources concentrating on mindfulness, exercise and culture. A survey of foundation doctors was completed to assess doctors focus and approach to wellbeing. Questions assessed influential factors in maintaining wellbeing, access to current hospital resources and future interventions. RESULT: 94% of respondents recognised that their focus on wellbeing increased during COVID-19. One third of foundation doctors found it challenging to maintain their wellbeing, with 40% reporting difficulty accessing hospital support and advice. The most important factors foundation doctors identified in maintaining wellbeing were exercise, cooking and baking, and social networks. Colleagues were a significant source of wellbeing support, followed by notice boards, email resources and social media. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 highlighted the importance and burden on wellbeing of foundation doctors, with a significant number struggling to access support. Future recommendations include the use of a buddy system, regular and accessible exercise classes and improved communication of wellbeing support and resources to staff members. Buddy systems have already shown success amongst teams however it is important these are accessible to all foundation doctors and universally offered within the trust. A weekly yoga class is being reintroduced to be available to all doctors. A particular focus has been the development of a health and wellbeing section to feature in the trusts weekly communications, with the aim to regularly signpost staff to ongoing wellbeing resources and support.

The outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019, and the eventual spread to other parts of the world, have pushed governments and health authorities to take drastic socioeconomic, sociocultural and sociopolitical measures to curb the spread of the virus, SARS-CoV-2. To help policy-makers, health authorities and governments, we propose a Susceptible, Exposed, Asymptomatic, Quarantined asymptomatic, Severely infected, Hospitalized, Recovered, Recovered asymptomatic, Deceased, and Protective susceptible (individuals who observe health protocols) to describe the dynamics of COVID-19. We fit the model to real data from Ghana and Egypt to estimate model parameters using standard incidence rate. Projections for disease control and sensitivity analysis are presented using MATLAB. We noticed that multiple peaks (waves) of COVID-19 for Ghana and Egypt can be prevented if stringent health protocols are implemented for a long time and/or the reluctant behaviour on the use of protective equipment by individuals are minimized. The sensitivity analysis suggests that: the rate of diagnoses and testing, the rate of quarantine through doubling enhanced contact tracing, adhering to physical distancing, adhering to wearing of nose masks, sanitizing-washing hands, media education remains the most effective measures in reducing the control reproduction number R c , to less than unity in the absence of vaccines and therapeutic drugs in Ghana and Egypt. Optimal control and cost-effectiveness analysis are rigorously studied.

We posited that the habitat relevance of a trait begets its underlying genomic complexity, so that traits within the repertoire would be differentially more complex in species successfully thriving in that habitat than in close species that cannot. To test this for the case of bloom-forming cyanobacteria, we curated 17 potentially relevant query metabolic pathways and five core pathways selected according to existing ecophysiological literature. The available 113 genomes were split into those of blooming (45) or nonblooming (68) strains, and an index of genomic complexity for each strain's version of each pathway was derived. We show that strain versions of all query pathways were significantly more complex in bloomers, with complexity in fact correlating positively with strain blooming incidence in 14 of those pathways. Five core pathways, relevant everywhere, showed no differential complexity or correlations. Gas vesicle, toxin and fatty acid synthesis, amino acid uptake, and C, N, and S acquisition systems were most strikingly relevant in the blooming repertoire. Further, we validated our findings using metagenomic gene expression analyses of blooming and nonblooming cyanobacteria in natural settings, where pathways in the repertoire were differentially overexpressed according to their relative complexity in bloomers, but not in nonbloomers. We expect that this approach may find applications to other habitats and organismal groups.IMPORTANCE We pragmatically delineate the trait repertoire that enables organismal niche specialization. We based our approach on the tenet, derived from evolutionary and complex-system considerations, that genomic units that can significantly contribute to fitness in a certain habitat will be comparatively more complex in organisms specialized to that habitat than their genomic homologs found in organisms from other habitats. We tested this in cyanobacteria forming harmful water blooms, for which decades-long efforts in ecological physiology and genomics exist. Our results essentially confirm that genomics and ecology can be linked through comparative complexity analyses, providing a tool that should be of general applicability for any group of organisms and any habitat, and enabling the posing of grounded hypotheses regarding the ecogenomic basis for diversification.","output":"The Trait Repertoire Enabling Cyanobacteria to Bloom Assessed through Comparative Genomic Complexity and Metatranscriptomics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vertical flow assays (VFAs) or flow-through assays have emerged as an alternate type of paper-based assay due to their faster detection time, larger sample volume capacity, and significantly higher multiplexing capabilities.

METHOD A systematic review of five databases (MEDLINE, PUBMED, PsycINFO, EMBASE and CINAHL) were undertaken using subject headings (MeSH) and keywords to identify studies relevant to our objectives. Inclusion criteria were applied independently by two researchers. A narrative synthesis was undertaken due to heterogeneity of the study designs of included studies followed by a study appraisal process. RESULTS Forty-five studies were included in this review. Findings indicate that: (1) those from ethnic minority backgrounds were conceptualised variably; (2) people from ethnic minority backgrounds had higher rates of hospital acquired infections, complications, adverse drug events and dosing errors when compared to the wider population; and (3) factors including language proficiency, beliefs about illness and treatment, formal and informal interpreter use, consumer engagement, and interactions with health professionals contributed to increased risk of safety events amongst these populations. CONCLUSION Ethnic minority consumers may experience inequity in the safety of care and be at higher risk of patient safety events. Health services and systems must consider the individual, inter- and intra-ethnic variations in the nature of safety events to understand the where and how to invest resource to enhance equity in the safety of care.

International recommendations for the control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic emphasize the central role of laboratory testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent, at scale. The availability of testing reagents, laboratory equipment and qualified staff are important bottlenecks to achieving this. Elsewhere, pooled testing (i.e. combining multiple samples in the same reaction) has been suggested to increase testing capacities in the pandemic period. Methods. We discuss our experience with SARS-CoV-2 pooled testing using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on the Kenyan Coast. Results. In mid-May, 2020, our RT-PCR testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 was improved by ~100% as a result of adoption of a six-sample pooled testing strategy. This was accompanied with a concomitant saving of ~50% of SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test kits at both the RNA extraction and RT-PCR stages. However, pooled testing came with a slight decline of test sensitivity. The RT-PCR cycle threshold value (Ct) was ~1.59 higher for samples tested in pools compared to samples tested singly. Conclusions. Pooled testing is a useful strategy to increase SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing capacity especially in low-income settings.","output":"Pooled testing conserves SARS-CoV-2 laboratory resources and improves test turn-around time: experience on the Kenyan Coast."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has impacted mental health globally, however, associations between anxiety and appetitive traits during the pandemic are unreported. This study evaluated anxiety symptom severity and associations with appetitive traits in students at a large public University in the U.S. during the pandemic. METHODS: Current undergraduate and graduate/professional students completed a cross-sectional survey in fall 2020. Demographic information, anxiety symptoms in the past 2 weeks assessed by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and appetitive traits assessed by the Adult Eating Behavior Questionnaire (AEBQ) were evaluated. Mean scores for eight AEBQ scales (four food approach and four food avoidance traits) were calculated. Differences in mean scores were examined between participants with moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 score &#8805; 10) and those with mild to no anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 score < 10) via independent samples t-tests and effect sizes. Associations between GAD-7 score and individual appetitive traits were also examined, adjusting for age and gender. RESULTS: Of the 1243 students who completed the survey (57% undergraduates; mean age = 26.5 years), 51.9% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. Groups experiencing the highest degree of moderate to severe anxiety symptoms included transgender, gender fluid, and other-gendered participants (73.6%); the youngest age group [18-20 years (62%)]; undergraduate students (60.7%); and Hispanic/Latinx participants (57.7%). Participants with moderate to severe anxiety symptoms had higher scores for most food approach and avoidance traits but lower scores for enjoyment of food than those with mild to no anxiety symptoms. Effect sizes were largest for hunger and emotional over-eating (Cohen's d = 0.31 and 0.30, respectively). Adjusting for age and gender, GAD-7 score was significantly and positively associated with hunger, emotional over-eating, food and satiety responsiveness, and food fussiness and negatively associated with enjoyment of food. CONCLUSIONS: Over half of students at a U.S. University reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms during COVID-19. More severe anxiety symptoms were associated with increased hunger, emotional over-eating, and food and satiety responsiveness and decreased enjoyment of food. Universities must consider strategies to address anxiety, particularly in younger students; transgender, gender fluid, and students of other genders; and across race/ethnicities keeping in mind associations with appetitive traits.","output":"Anxiety is associated with appetitive traits in university students during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, public health interventions such as social distancing and stay-at-home orders have widely been implemented, which is anticipated to contribute to reducing the spread of COVID-19 On the contrary, there is a concern that the public health interventions may increase the level of loneliness Loneliness and social isolation are public health risks, closely associated with serious medical conditions As COVID-19 is new to us today, little is known about emotional well-being among people with visual impairment during the COVID-19 pandemic To address the knowledge gap, this study conducted phone interviews with a convenience sample of 31 people with visual impairment The interview incorporated the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale (version 3) and the trait meta-mood scale (TMMS) to measure loneliness and emotional intelligence skills, respectively This study found that people with visual impairment were vulnerable to the feeling of loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic and showed individual differences in emotional intelligence skills by different degrees of loneliness Researchers and health professionals should consider offering adequate coping strategies to those with visual impairment amid the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Individual differences in emotional intelligence skills of people with visual impairment and loneliness amid the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human enterovirus 68 (EVD68) is a primary causative agent for respiratory illness worldwide.

Due to inducing G2/M phase arrest, pseudolaric acid B, oridonin, and erianin might be good candidates for inhibiting EVD68 production, and Chinese herbs with natural compounds inducing G2/M arrest should be considered for the treatment of EVD68-related diseases.","output":"Effect of ingredients from Chinese herbs on enterovirus D68 production."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic entails an urgent need for specific and sensitive high-throughput serological assays to assess SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. We therefore aimed at developing a fluorescent-bead based SARS-CoV-2 multiplex serology assay for detection of antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Methods: Proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and protein N of SARS-CoV-1 and common cold Coronaviruses (ccCoVs) were recombinantly expressed in E. coli or HEK293 cells. Assay performance was assessed in a Covid-19 case cohort (n=48 hospitalized patients from Heidelberg) as well as n=85 age- and sex-matched pre-pandemic controls from the ESTHER study. Assay validation included comparison with home-made immunofluorescence and commercial Enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. Results: A sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 86%-100%) was achieved in Covid-19 patients 14 days post symptom onset with dual sero-positivity to SARS-CoV-2 N and the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. The specificity obtained with this algorithm was 100% (95% CI: 96%-100%). Antibody responses to ccCoVs N were abundantly high and did not correlate with those to SARS-CoV-2 N. Inclusion of additional SARS-CoV-2 proteins as well as separate assessment of immunoglobulin (Ig) classes M, A, and G allowed for explorative analyses regarding disease progression and course of antibody response. Conclusion: This newly developed SARS-CoV-2 multiplex serology assay achieved high sensitivity and specificity to determine SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity. Its high throughput ability allows epidemiologic SARS-CoV-2 research in large population-based studies. Inclusion of additional pathogens into the panel as well as separate assessment of Ig isotypes will furthermore allow addressing research questions beyond SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence.","output":"From multiplex serology to serolomics: A novel approach to the antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 proteome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)) first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and rapidly spread across the globe. Since most respiratory viruses are known to show a seasonal pattern of infection, it has been hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 may be seasonally dependent as well. The present study looks at a possible effect of atmospheric temperature, which is one of the suspected factors influencing seasonality, on the evolution of the pandemic. Basic procedures: Since confirming a seasonal pattern would take several more months of observation, we conducted an innovative day-to-day micro-correlation analysis of nine outbreak locations, across four continents and both hemispheres, in order to examine a possible relationship between atmospheric temperature (used as a proxy for seasonality) and outbreak progression. Main findings: There was a negative correlation between atmospheric temperature variations and daily new cases growth rates, in all nine outbreaks, with a median lag of 10 days. Principal conclusions: The results presented here suggest that high temperatures might dampen SARS-CoV-2 propagation, while lower temperatures might increase its transmission. Our hypothesis is that this could support a potential effect of atmospheric temperature on coronavirus disease progression, and potentially a seasonal pattern for this virus, with a peak in the cold season and rarer occurrences in the summer. This could guide government policy in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres for the months to come.","output":"COVID-19: relationship between atmospheric temperature and daily new cases growth rate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 15, 2020 Puerto Rico implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including a mandatory curfew, as part of a state of emergency declaration to prevent the community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The strict enforcement of this curfew was extended through May 25, with a gradual relaxation beginning on May 1. This report summarizes an assessment of these early mitigation measures on the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in the island. From March 15 to May 15, 2020, 70,656 results of molecular (RT-PCR) tests were reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health. Of these, 1,704 were positive, corresponding to 1,311 individuals with COVID-19 included in the study. We derived the epidemic growth rates (r) and the corresponding reproductive numbers (R) from the epidemic curve of these 1,311 individuals with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 using their date of test collection as a proxy for symptoms onset. Through May 31, 2020, there were 143 COVID-19 associated deaths in Puerto Rico, for a case fatality risk of 10.9%. We compared the observed cases and deaths with Gompertz model projections had the mitigation measures not been implemented. The number of daily RT-PCR-confirmed cases peaked on March 30 (85 cases), showing a weekly cyclical trend, with lower counts on weekends and a decreasing secular trend since March 30. The initial exponential growth rate (r) was 15.87% (95% CI: 7.59%, 24.15%), corresponding to R of 1.82 (95% CI:1.37, 2.30). After March 30, the r value reverted to an exponential decay rate (negative) of -2.95% (95% CI: -4.99%, -0.92%), corresponding to R of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.98). We estimate that, had the initial growth rate been maintained, a total of 6,155 additional COVID-19 cases would have occurred by May 15, with 211 additional COVID-19 deaths by May 31. These findings are consistent with very effective implementation of early NPIs as mitigation measures in Puerto Rico.

This study aimed to determine whether COVID-19-free surgical pathways were associated with lower postoperative pulmonary complication rates compared with hospitals with no defined pathway. PATIENTS AND METHODS This international, multicenter cohort study included patients who underwent elective surgery for 10 solid cancer types without preoperative suspicion of SARS-CoV-2. Participating hospitals included patients from local emergence of SARS-CoV-2 until April 19, 2020. At the time of surgery, hospitals were defined as having a COVID-19-free surgical pathway (complete segregation of the operating theater, critical care, and inpatient ward areas) or no defined pathway (incomplete or no segregation, areas shared with patients with COVID-19). The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative pulmonary complications (pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, unexpected ventilation). RESULTS Of 9,171 patients from 447 hospitals in 55 countries, 2,481 were operated on in COVID-19-free surgical pathways. Patients who underwent surgery within COVID-19-free surgical pathways were younger with fewer comorbidities than those in hospitals with no defined pathway but with similar proportions of major surgery. After adjustment, pulmonary complication rates were lower with COVID-19-free surgical pathways (2.2% v 4.9%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.86). This was consistent in sensitivity analyses for low-risk patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists grade 1/2), propensity score-matched models, and patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 preoperative tests. The postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was also lower in COVID-19-free surgical pathways (2.1% v 3.6%; aOR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.76). CONCLUSION Within available resources, dedicated COVID-19-free surgical pathways should be established to provide safe elective cancer surgery during current and before future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.","output":"Elective Cancer Surgery in COVID-19-Free Surgical Pathways During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: An International, Multicenter, Comparative Cohort Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19, the disease caused by SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection has been declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020.

Before 2015, maternal deaths were identified using death certificates and by active surveillance in the hospitals.

Therefore, the Maternal Health Steering Committee was recently installed as a direct working arm of MOH to guide MDSR implementation. One of the main barriers to implementing MDSR in Suriname has been the lack of action following recommendations.

AIM: Our objective was to evaluate the effects that statutory adjustments in the Netherlands in 2008 and raising awareness during outbreaks had on notification timeliness. METHODS: In a retrospective analyses of routine surveillance data obtained between July 2003 and November 2017, delays between disease onset and laboratory confirmation (disease identification delay), between laboratory confirmation and notification to Municipal Health Services (notification delay) and between notification and reporting to the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (reporting delay) were analysed for 28 notifiable diseases. Delays before (period 1) and after the law change (periods 2 and 3) were compared with legal timeframes. We studied the effect of outbreak awareness in 10 outbreaks and the effect of specific guidance messages on disease identification delay for two diseases. RESULTS: We included 144,066 notifications. Average notification delay decreased from 1.4 to 0.4 days across the three periods (six diseases; p < 0.05), reporting delay decreased mainly in period 2 (from 0.5 to 0.1 days, six diseases; p < 0.05). In 2016C2017, legal timeframes were met overall. Awareness resulted in decreased disease identification delay for three diseases: measles and rubella (outbreaks) and psittacosis (specific guidance messages). CONCLUSIONS: Legal adjustments decreased notification and reporting delays, increased awareness reduced identification delays. As disease identification delay dominates the notification chain, insight in patient, doctor and laboratory delay is necessary to further improve timeliness and monitor the impact of control measures during outbreaks.","output":"Timeliness of infectious disease reporting, the Netherlands, 2003 to 2017: law change reduced reporting delay, disease identification delay is next"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hemagglutinating and acetylesterase functions as well as the 124 kDa glycoprotein were present in the highly cell-culture adapted, avirulent bovine coronavirus strain BCV-L9, in the Norden vaccine strain derived from it, and in 5 wild-type, virulent strains that multiplied in HRT-18 cells but were restricted in several types of cultured bovine cells.

The epidemiological parameters, clinical presentations, underlying diseases, laboratory test results, and disease outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The median age of all enrolled patients was 66 years. At least one underlying disease was identified in 101 COVID-19 patients, with hypertension being the most common one, followed by cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The most common symptoms identified upon admission were fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue. Compared to survival cases, patients who died during hospitalization had higher plasma levels of D-dimer, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, lactate, and lower percentage of lymphocytes (LYM [%]), platelet count and albumin levels. Most enrolled patients received antibiotics and anti-viral treatment. In addition, 60 patients received corticosteroids, and 51 received intravenous immunoglobulin infusion. Forty-four patients received noninvasive ventilation and 19 received invasive ventilation. Respiratory failure was the most frequently observed complication (106 [67.9%]), followed by sepsis (103 [66.0%]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (67 [42.9%]), and septic shock (50 [32.1%]).

In 601 vaccinated cases, mild cases were 352, moderate cases were 185 with SpO(2) <94%-90%, 64 cases are severe with SpO(2) <90%. In this study the vaccinated patients had less severe disease with mild symptoms, in the cases of present study from COVID-19 compared to non vaccinated cases. Conclusion: Vaccine Effectiveness was noted after two doses. Vaccinated people had less severe symptoms and disease compared to non vaccinated people. Finding would support the effort to maximize vaccine with two doses among vulnerable population.","output":"Severity of COVID-19 Disease in Vaccinated and Non Vaccinated COVID-19 Positive Cases: A Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the disease COVID-19 that has decimated the health and economy of our planet.

During these unprecedented circumstances, geriatrics are predisposed to be at an increased risk of sleep disorders due to the social isolation and loneliness imposed on them by the lockdowns. The fact that older adults are at a greater risk of contracting the virus due to the presence of comorbidities and the high virulence adds on to the existing risk of sleep disturbances. A lack of sleep in these circumstances has the potential to add on to the vicious cycle of sleep disorders predisposed by chronic disease and vice versa. Mental health, sleep and the presence of comorbidities are closely interlinked and they often tend to overlap. Research in sleep has established insomnia to be the most commonly diagnosed sleep disorder affecting almost 50% of the older adults which can subsequently, elevate their risk of falls. This prevalence of sleep disorders is hypothesized to increase during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and a good sleep routine needs to be advocated for to improve the quality of life of this population. However, scientific evidence concerning this is scarce and this review aims to highlight the significance of sleep and urges its readers to undertake studies that investigate the architecture of sleep amongst older adults during the pandemic.","output":"Was Sleep a Problem for the Elderly During COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the impact of Covid-19 on consumer's decision-making while purchasing a vehicle Consumers are faced with several sets of criteria to select the right vehicle during the global pandemic of COVID-19 Health and safety have become a paramount concern and simultaneously consumer purchasing power has changed given economic conditions We focus on consumer attitudes and preferences while purchasing a vehicle Vehicle selection is considered to be a multiple criteria decision-making problem The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach is used to determine consumer preferences towards vehicle selection using the following criteria: financial aspects, maintenance aspects, vehicle features, and promotions offered The objective of this research is to help understand what alternative is best for the consumer during COVID-19 given the preselected criteria Meanwhile, the paper sheds light to the dealerships in the Kingdom of Bahrain with regards to the offers, vehicle features, and after-sales service that could be an offer to potential buyers during COVID-19 ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Consumer Vehicle Purchase Decision-making during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dystrophin-deficient cardiomyopathy (DDC) is currently the leading cause of death in patients with dystrophinopathies. Targeting myocardial fibrosis (MF) has become a major therapeutic goal in order to prevent the occurrence of DDC. We aimed to review and summarize the current evidence about the role of the reninCangiotensinCaldosterone system (RAAS) in the development and perpetuation of MF in DCC. We conducted a comprehensive search of peer-reviewed English literature on PubMed about this subject. We found increasing preclinical evidence from studies in animal models during the last 20 years pointing out a central role of RAAS in the development of MF in DDC. Local tissue RAAS acts directly mainly through its main fibrotic component angiotensin II (ANG2) and its transducer receptor (AT1R) and downstream TGF-b pathway. Additionally, it modulates the actions of most of the remaining pro-fibrotic factors involved in DDC. Despite limited clinical evidence, RAAS blockade constitutes the most studied, available and promising therapeutic strategy against MF and DDC. Conclusion: Based on the evidence reviewed, it would be recommendable to start RAAS blockade therapy through angiotensin converter enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or AT1R blockers (ARBs) alone or in combination with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRa) at the youngest age after the diagnosis of dystrophinopathies, in order to delay the occurrence or slow the progression of MF, even before the detection of any cardiovascular alteration.","output":"Role of the ReninCAngiotensinCAldosterone System in Dystrophin-Deficient Cardiomyopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a global pandemic.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether monitoring cytokine production could contribute to the better management of pediatric patients with HIV-1 infection. SETTING Clinical Immunology Laboratory and Pediatrics Department, University Hospital, Hong Kong. PATIENTS Ten Asian and 2 Eurasian children infected with HIV-1 by mother-to-child transmission were followed for up to 5 years while on treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Numbers of unstimulated and mitogen-activated cytokine-secreting cells (IFN-gamma, interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-alpha) were measured by ELISPOT assay at frequent intervals, and correlations were sought with CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts and viral loads. RESULTS Mitogen-stimulated IL-2-secreting cells were directly associated with recovery of CD4+ cells. Correlations with viral load were found for Con A-induced IFN-gamma, Con A-induced IL-4, and unstimulated IL-10, suggesting that these cytokines were either suppressed by high virus levels or that higher cytokine levels suppressed virus. IFN-gamma, IL-2-, IL-4-, and IL-12-secreting cells induced by PHA, Con A, and/or SAC tended to increase for the first 3-4 years of treatment but declined thereafter. CONCLUSIONS Alterations in cytokine profiles were not associated with adverse clinical events and there was little evidence to indicate that monitoring cytokine enzyme-linked immunospots (ELISPOTs) could contribute to pediatric patient management.","output":"Cytokine profiles in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the main applications of ultrasonic melt treatment is the grain refinement of aluminium alloys. Among several suggested mechanisms, the fragmentation of primary intermetallics by acoustic cavitation is regarded as very efficient. However, the physical process causing this fragmentation has received little attention and is not yet well understood. In this study, we evaluate the mechanical properties of primary Al3Zr intermetallics by nano-indentation experiments and correlate those with in-situ high-speed imaging (of up to 1 Mfps) of their fragmentation process by laser-induced cavitation (single bubble) and by acoustic cavitation (cloud of bubbles) in water. Intermetallic crystals were chemically extracted from an Al-3 wt% Zr alloy matrix. Mechanical properties such as hardness, elastic modulus and fracture toughness of the extracted intermetallics were determined using a geometrically fixed Berkovich nano-diamond and cube corner indenter, under ambient temperature conditions. The studied crystals were then exposed to the two cavitation conditions mentioned. Results demonstrated for the first time that the governing fragmentation mechanism of the studied intermetallics was due to the emitted shock waves from the collapsing bubbles. The fragmentation caused by a single bubble collapse was found to be almost instantaneous. On the other hand, sono-fragmentation studies revealed that the intermetallic crystal initially underwent low cycle fatigue loading, followed by catastrophic brittle failure due to propagating shock waves. The observed fragmentation mechanism was supported by fracture mechanics and pressure measurements using a calibrated fibre optic hydrophone. Results showed that the acoustic pressures produced from shock wave emissions in the case of a single bubble collapse, and responsible for instantaneous fragmentation of the intermetallics, were in the range of 20-40 MPa. Whereas, the shock pressure generated from the acoustic cavitation cloud collapses surged up to 1.6 MPa inducing fatigue stresses within the crystal leading to eventual fragmentation.","output":"On the governing fragmentation mechanism of primary intermetallics by induced cavitation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This protocol outlines procedures for the development and evaluation of a remotely accessible intervention tool known as the Psychology And yoU: Self-Enhancement programme (i.e., PAUSE programme).

While the rapidity with which these vaccines have been developed and tested (at least for short-term efficacy and safety) is commendable, it should be acknowledged that this has occurred despite the lack of research into, and understanding of, the immune elements important for natural host protection against the virus, making this endeavor a somewhat unique one in medical history. In contrast, as pointed out in the review below, there were already important past observations that suggested that respiratory infections at mucosal surfaces were susceptible to immune clearance by mechanisms not typical of infections caused by systemic (blood-borne) pathogens. Accordingly, it was likely to be important to understand the role for both innate and acquired immunity in response to viral infection, as well as the optimum acquired immune resistance mechanisms for viral clearance (B cell or antibody-mediated, versus T cell mediated). This information was needed both to guide vaccine development and to monitor its success. We have known that many pathogens enter into a quasi-symbiotic relationship with the host, with each undergoing sequential change in response to alterations the other makes to its presence. The subsequent evolution of viral variants which has caused such widespread concern over the last 3C6 months as host immunity develops was an entirely predictable response. What is still not known is whether there will be other unexpected side-effects of the deployment of novel vaccines in humans which have yet to be characterized, and, if so, how and if these can be avoided.

Shelter-in-place measures led the rapid expansion of telemedicine to address the needs of the neurosurgical patient population. Our goal is to determine the extent of adoption of telemedicine across tumor, vascular, spine, and function neurosurgery and utilization for new patient visits. METHODS: A single-center retrospective cohort study of patients who received neurosurgical care at a tertiary academic center from February to April 2020 was conducted. Patients evaluated from March to April 2019 were included for comparison. A total of 10,746 patients were included: 1247 patients underwent surgery, 8742 were seen in clinic via an in-person outpatient visit, and 757 were assessed via telemedicine during the study period. RESULTS: A 40-fold increase in the use of telemedicine was noted after the shelter-in-place measures were initiated with a significant increase in the mean number of patients evaluated via telemedicine per week across all divisions of neurosurgery (4.5  0.9 to 180.4  13.9, P < 0.001).

Methods: All adults admitted with swab-proven RT-PCR COVID-19 to Homerton University Hospital (HUH) from 04.02.20 to 30.04.20 were eligible for inclusion. We retrospectively analysed demographic and biochemical data collected from the physical and electronic patient records according to the primary outcome of death at 28 days during hospital admission. Troponin positivity was defined above the upper limit of normal according to our local laboratory assay (>15.5ng/l for females, >34 ng/l for males). Univariate and multivariate logistical regression analyses were performed to evaluate the link between troponin positivity and death. Results: Mean length of stay for all 402 hospitalised COVID-19 patients at HUH was 9.1 days (SD 12.0). Mean age was 65.3 years for men compared to 63.8 years for women. A chi-squared test showed that survival of COVID-19 patients was significantly higher in those with a negative troponin (p = 3.23 x10-10) compared to those with a positive troponin. In the multivariate logistical regression, lung disease, age, troponin positivity and CPAP were all significantly associated with death, with an AUC of 0.8872, sensitivity of 0.9004 and specificity of 0.6292 for the model. Within this model, troponin positivity was independently associated with short term mortality (OR 3.23, 95% CI 1.53-7.16, p=0.00278). Conclusions: We demonstrated an independent association between troponin positivity and increased short-term mortality in COVID-19 in a London district general hospital.","output":"TROPONIN IS INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH DEATH IN PATIENTS WITH COVID: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"China has emerged as a champion of economic globalization, particularly through building global supply chains, financing overseas infrastructure and energy projects, and exporting labour to developing countries throughout the world. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), announced in 2013, is a keystone in Chinas economic globalization. The BRI emphasizes connectivity: policy, infrastructure, trade, financial, and people-to-people. Despite the broad significance of Chinese economic globalization, its legal dimensions are still poorly understood. China, Law and Development (CLD) is an international and multi-disciplinary research project that aims to study the legal and regulatory aspects of this stage of globalization.

This article introduces the symposium, and it does so through the example of Chinas role in global health governance. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) epidemic in late 2019 in China, which has since become a worldwide pandemic, has obstructed BRI connectivity through delinking global supply chains, blocking labour migration, freezing markets, and exacerbating Sinophobia. In response, China has sought to lead an effort in improving global health governance through participation in international organizations and strengthening its bilateral ties through health aid and technology export.

Understanding the influence of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 gene on clinical outcomes and related factors is critical for treatment and prevention. Here, we analyzed 209,551 high-coverage complete virus sequences and 321 RNA-seq samples to mine the mutations associated with clinical outcome in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Several important hotspot variants were found to be associated with severe clinical outcomes. Q57H variant in ORF3a protein were found to be associated with higher mortality rate, and was high proportion in severe cases (39.36%) and 501Y.V2 strains (100%) but poorly proportional to asymptomatic cases (10.04%). T265I could change nsp2 structure and mitochondrial permeability, and evidently higher in severe cases (20.12%) and 501Y.V2 strains (100%) but lower in asymptomatic cases (1.43%). Additionally, R203K and G204R could decrease the flexibility and immunogenic property of N protein with high frequency among severe cases, VUI 202012/01 and 484K.V2 strains. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 genome was more susceptible to mutation because of the high frequency of nt14408 mutation (which located in RNA polymerase) and the high expression levels of ADAR and APOBEC in severe clinical outcomes.

Here, we characterized 14 different low-passage replication-competent human SARS-CoV-2 isolates representing all major European clades observed during the first pandemic wave in early 2020. By integrating viral sequencing data from patient material, virus stocks, and passaging experiments, together with kinetic virus replication data from nonhuman Vero-CCL81 cells and primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (BEpCs), we observed several SARS-CoV-2 features that associate with distinct phenotypes. Notably, naturally occurring variants in Orf3a (Q57H) and nsp2 (T85I) were associated with poor replication in Vero-CCL81 cells but not in BEpCs, while SARS-CoV-2 isolates expressing the Spike D614G variant generally exhibited enhanced replication abilities in BEpCs. Strikingly, low-passage Vero-derived stock preparation of 3 SARS-CoV-2 isolates selected for substitutions at positions 5/6 of E and were highly attenuated in BEpCs, revealing a key cell-specific function to this region. Rare isolate-specific deletions were also observed in the Spike furin cleavage site during Vero-CCL81 passage, but these were rapidly selected against in BEpCs, underscoring the importance of this site for SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human cells.

A better explanation for the variability in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of mitotane, and the optimization and individualization of mitotane treatment, is desirable for patients. OBJECTIVES This study aims to develop a population PK (PopPK) model to characterize and predict the PK profiles of mitotane in patients with ACC, as well as to explore the effect of genetic variation on mitotane clearance. Ultimately, we aimed to facilitate mitotane dose optimization and individualization for patients with ACC. METHODS Mitotane concentration and dosing data were collected retrospectively from the medical records of patients with ACC taking mitotane orally and participating in the Dutch Adrenal Network. PopPK modelling analysis was performed using NONMEM (version 7.4.1). Genotypes of drug enzymes and transporters, patient demographic information, and clinical characteristics were investigated as covariates. Subsequently, simulations were performed for optimizing treatment regimens. RESULTS A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination best described the PK data of mitotane collected from 48 patients. Lean body weight (LBW) and genotypes of CYP2C19*2 (rs4244285), SLCO1B3 699A>G (rs7311358) and SLCO1B1 571T>C (rs4149057) were found to significantly affect mitotane clearance (CL/F), which decreased the coefficient of variation (CV%) of the random inter-individual variability of CL/F from 67.0 to 43.0%. Fat amount (i.e. body weight - LBW) was found to significantly affect the central distribution volume. Simulation results indicated that determining the starting dose using the developed model is beneficial in terms of shortening the period to reach the therapeutic target and limit the risk of toxicity. A regimen that can effectively maintain mitotane concentration within 14-20 mg/L was established. CONCLUSIONS A two-compartment PopPK model well-characterized mitotane PK profiles in patients with ACC. The CYP2C19 enzyme and SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 transporters may play roles in mitotane disposition. The developed model is beneficial in terms of optimizing mitotane treatment schedules and individualizing the initial dose for patients with ACC. Further validation of these findings is still required.","output":"Population Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacogenetic Analysis of Mitotane in Patients with Adrenocortical Carcinoma: Towards Individualized Dosing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Awake prone positioning (APP) improves oxygenation in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients and, when successful, may decrease the risk of intubation. However, factors associated with APP success remain unknown. In this secondary analysis, we aimed to assess whether APP can reduce intubation rate in patients with COVID-19 and to focus on the factors associated with success. METHODS: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, conducted in three high-acuity units, we randomly assigned patients with COVID-19-induced acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) requiring high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen to APP or standard care. Primary outcome was intubation rate at 28 days. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify the predictors associated to treatment success (survival without intubation). RESULTS: Among 430 patients randomized, 216 were assigned to APP and 214 to standard care. The APP group had a lower intubation rate (30% vs 43%, relative risk [RR] 0.70; CI(95) 0.54C0.90, P = 0.006) and shorter hospital length of stay (11 interquartile range [IQR, 9C14] vs 13 [IQR, 10C17] days, P = 0.001). A respiratory rate  25 bpm at enrollment, an increase in ROX index > 1.25 after first APP session, APP duration > 8 h/day, and a decrease in lung ultrasound score  2 within the first 3 days were significantly associated with treatment success for APP. CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19-induced AHRF treated by HFNC, APP reduced intubation rate and improved treatment success. A longer APP duration is associated with APP success, while the increase in ROX index and decrease in lung ultrasound score after APP can also help identify patients most likely to benefit.

Our approach is to apply multivariate control charts based on exponential smoothing and cumulative sums in order to monitor networks determined by temporal exponential random graph models (TERGM). This allows us to account for temporal dependence, while simultaneously reducing the number of parameters to be monitored. The performance of the proposed charts is evaluated by calculating the average run length for both simulated and real data. To prove the appropriateness of the TERGM to describe network data, some measures of goodness of fit are inspected.

The existence of the virus in the gastrointestinal tract makes digestive endoscopy a high-risk operation, which associated with an increased risk of infection rate in healthcare workers. This study aimed at exploring current knowledge, practice and attitudes of healthcare workers in endoscopy units in China regarding the status of occupational protection during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study of a national online survey involving 717 healthcare workers in endoscopy units from 94 medical structures in 24 provinces and municipalities around China was conducted online via a questionnaire platform called Wenjuanxing (wjx.cn). The data were analyzed using correlation approaches, Kruskal-Wallis test for independent samples, and linear regression models. Results: Most Chinese healthcare workers in endoscopy units had a good knowledge of COVID-19 (median: 10; range: 7C12), showed a strikingly positive attitude (median: 65; range: 39C65), and carried out good practice (median: 47; range: 14C50) in strengthening the protection, disinfection and management of COVID-19. In terms of attitudes, female staff was more concerned about protection against COVID-19 than male staff (KW = 8.146, P = 0.004). Nurses performed better in both attitude (KW = 2.600, P = 0.009) and practice (KW = 6.358, P < 0.001) than endoscopic physicians when carrying out personal protection, patient care and environmental disinfection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. More positive attitudes in protection were related to better protective behavior in endoscopic daily medical work (r = 0.312; P < 0.001). Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that Chinese endoscopy healthcare workers have an excellent mastery of knowledge about COVID-19, which is transformed into positive beliefs and attitudes, contributing to good practice during daily endoscopic procedures. Medical staff may benefit from further education. With the gradual normalization amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, protection and management in endoscopy units may be changed accordingly.","output":"The Status of Occupational Protection During COVID-19 Pandemic: Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practice of Healthcare Workers in Endoscopy Units, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding what factors predict whether an urban migrant will end up in a deprived neighbourhood or not could help prevent the exploitation of vulnerable individuals. This study leveraged pseudonymized mobile money interactions combined with cell phone data to shed light on urban migration patterns and deprivation in Tanzania. Call detail records were used to identify individuals who migrated to Dar es Salaam, Tanzanias largest city. A street survey of the citys subwards was used to determine which individuals moved to more deprived areas. t-tests showed that people who settled in poorer neighbourhoods had less money coming into their mobile money account after they moved, but not before. A machine learning approach was then utilized to predict which migrants will move to poorer areas of the city, making them arguably more vulnerable to poverty, unemployment and exploitation. Features indicating the strength and location of peoples social connections in Dar es Salaam before they moved (pull factors) were found to be most predictive, more so than traditional push factors such as proxies for poverty in the migrants source region.

COVID-19 is typically an acute self-limited disease that can rarely be fatal with a 5.6% case mortality rate (May, 2020), mainly due to substantial damage to pulmonary alveolar structures, and subsequent respiratory failure. Given the previous experience, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been proven to be an effective therapy in the treatment of respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). On the basis of similar principle, ECMO may also be an effective therapy in the treatment of severe COVID-19. However, due to huge cost, it is not common to apply ECMO continuously for a long time.

The purpose of the current study was to examine the factor structure and equivalence of the factor structure of the Abbreviated Math Anxiety Scale (AMAS) in middle school girls and boys. Participants were 604 children recruited from two middle schools in Texas. A single-factor, two-factor, and bifactor model were tested using a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). A Multigroup Confirmatory Factor Analysis (MGCFA) was used to investigate whether the AMAS demonstrated measurement invariance across the sample of middle school girls and boys. The bifactor model provided an excellent fit and the best fit of the three models tested (CFI = .99, TLI = .99, SRMR = .02, RMSEA = .03). Results of the MGCFA supported configural, metric, and scalar invariance of the AMAS across middle school boys and girls. These results suggest that the AMAS demonstrates strong factorial invariance across gender for middle school students and can be used to assess potential differences in math anxiety between middle school girls and boys in an unbiased manner.","output":"Factor Structure and Gender Invariance of the Abbreviated Math Anxiety Scale (AMAS) in Middle School Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spatiotemporal modelling of infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) involves using a variety of epidemiological metrics such as regional proportion of cases and/or regional positivity rates.

We estimated the point prevalence and change in depression and anxiety symptoms scores in relation to sociodemographic variables following the resolution of the first wave in Qatar compared with before the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a trend analysis using repeated nationally representative cross-sectional surveys spanning 2017, 2018, 2020/2021 and using the Physician Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms. Negative binomial regression modelled changes in these symptoms in relation sociodemographics and survey year. RESULTS: The two-week prevalence of depressive symptoms (10 on the PHQ-9) was 6.6% in 2017 and 6.5% in 2020/2021 (p = 0.986). The two-week prevalence of anxiety symptoms (10 or higher on the GAD-7) was 3.6% in 2018 and 5.1% in 2020/2021 (p = 0.062). The data for 2020/21 showed a 35.1% and 29.2% decrease in depression and anxiety symptoms scores compared to pre-pandemic years (2017/2018) after adjusting for sociodemographic factors. LIMITATIONS: Screening tools rather than structured interviews were to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence for depression and anxiety post the first COVID wave did not differ significantly to pre-pandemic estimates. The end of the first wave of the pandemic had a levelling effect on these symptoms and their associations with traditional sociodemographic risk factors.

We assert that examining and applying law can accelerate public health efforts to mitigate structural and systemic inequities, including racism. Recent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the community impacts of policing have brought into sharp relief the inequities faced by many populations. These stark and explosive examples arise out of long-standing, persistent, and sometimes hidden structural and systemic inequities that are difficult to trace because they are embedded in laws and accompanying policies and practices. We emphasize this point with a case study involving a small, majority Black community in semirural Appalachia that spent almost 50 years attempting to gain access to the local public water system, despite being surrounded by water lines. We suggest that public health practitioners have a role to play in addressing these kinds of public health problems, which are so clearly tied to the ways laws and policies are developed and executed.

We hypothesized that an impaired hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction aggravates hypoxemia. The objective of the study was to test the effect of two pulmonary vasoactive drugs on patient oxygenation. Methods: Observational, single-center, open-label study in one intensive care unit (ICU) of the Paris area, realized in April 2020. Eligible patients had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and moderate to severe ARDS [arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) <200 mmHg] despite conventional protective ventilation. Exclusion criteria included pulmonary artery hypertension defined by a pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PAPs) >45 mmHg. The assessment of oxygenation was based on PaO(2)/FiO(2) at (1) baseline, then after (2) 30 min of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) 10 ppm alone, then (3) 30 min combination of iNO + almitrine infusion 8 g/kg/min, then (4) 30 min of almitrine infusion alone. Results: Among 20 patients requiring mechanical ventilation during the study period, 12 met the inclusion criteria. Baseline PaO(2)/FiO(2) was 146  48 mmHg. When iNO was combined with almitrine, PaO(2)/FiO(2) rose to 255  90 mmHg (+80  49%, p = 0.005), also after almitrine alone: 238  98 mmHg (+67  75%, p = 0.02), but not after iNO alone: 185  73 mmHg (+30  5%, p = 0.49). No adverse events related to almitrine infusion or iNO was observed. Conclusion: Combining iNO and infused almitrine improved the short-term oxygenation in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS.

Accurate country level surveillance is critical to ending the pandemic. Effective routine reporting systems which track the course of the epidemic are vital in addressing TB. China, which has the third largest TB epidemic in the world and has developed a reporting system to help with the control and prevention of TB, this study examined its effectiveness in Eastern China. METHODS: The number of TB cases reported internally in two hospitals in Eastern China were compared to the number TB cases reported by these same hospitals in the national reporting systems in order to assess the accuracy of reporting. Qualitative data from interviews with key health officials and researcher experience using the TB reporting systems were used to identify factors affecting the accuracy of TB cases being reported in the national systems. RESULTS: This study found that over a quarter of TB cases recorded in the internal hospital records were not entered into the national TB reporting systems, leading to an under representation of national TB cases. Factors associated with underreporting included unqualified and overworked health personnel, poor supervision and accountability at local and national levels, and a complicated incohesive health information management system. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that TB in Eastern China is being underreported. Given that Eastern China is a developed province, one could assume similar problems may be found in other parts of China with fewer resources as well as many low- and middle-income countries. Having an accurate account of the number of national TB cases is essential to understanding the national and global burden of the disease and in managing TB prevention and control efforts.

These are: (1) the heightening of social boundaries, which thus increase the potential of conflict between different social groups;and (2) the impairment of normative interaction rituals followed by a dynamic of distancing, insulation, and social alienation. While we stop short from constructing a hierarchy of risks, we do argue that policy makers should consider these collateral risks as part of any large-scale Covid-19 risk mitigation and communication strategy.

We used hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and its co-prescription in a real-life database to illustrate this pipeline. Methods: We incorporated a weighted cumulative exposure statistical model into a data-driven strategy. This pipeline makes it possible to highlight both long-term and short-term side effects, while avoiding false positives due to the natural course of the underlying disease. We applied the proposed pipeline to a cohort of 2,010 patients with a prescription of HCQ and used their drug prescription as the source of data to highlight the HCQ safety profile. Results: The proposed pipeline introduces a bootstrap strategy into weighted cumulative-exposure statistics estimates to highlight significant drug signals. As applied to HCQ, the proposed pipeline showed nine drugs to be significantly associated with HCQ exposure. Of note, one of them has therapeutic indications for known HCQ side effects. Other associations could be explained by therapeutic indications linked to conditions associated with HCQ indications in France.

Does passive heat acclimation alter glomerular filtration rate and urine concentrating ability in response to passive heat stress? What is the main finding and its importance? Glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged following passive heat stress, and heat acclimation did not alter this response. However, heat acclimation mitigated the reduction in urine concentrating ability and reduced the incidence of albuminuria in young healthy adults following passive heat stress. Collectively, these results suggest that passive heat acclimation may improve structural integrity and reduce glomerular permeability during passive heat stress. ABSTRACT Little is known about the effect of heat acclimation on kidney function during heat stress. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of passive heat stress and subsequent passive heat acclimation on markers of kidney function. Twelve healthy adults (7 males/5 females; 26  5 y; 72.7  8.6 kg; 172.4  7.5 cm) underwent passive heat stress before and after a 7-day controlled hyperthermia heat acclimation protocol. The impact of passive heat exposure on urine and serum markers of kidney function was evaluated before and after heat acclimation. Glomerular filtration rate, determined from creatinine clearance, was unchanged with passive heat stress before (pre: 133  41 mL/min; post: 127  51 mL/min, P = 0.99) and after (pre: 129  46 mL/min; post: 130  36 mL/min, P = 0.99) heat acclimation. The urine-to-serum osmolality ratio was reduced following passive heating (P < 0.01), but heat acclimation did not alter this response. In comparison to baseline, free water clearance was greater following passive heating before (pre: -0.86  0.67 mL/min, post: 0.40  1.01 mL/min, P < 0.01) but not after (pre: -0.16  0.57 mL/min, post: 0.76  1.2 mL/min, P = 0.11) heat acclimation. Further, passive heating increased the fractional excretion rate of potassium (P < 0.03) but not sodium (P = 0.13) or chloride (P = 0.20). Lastly, heat acclimation reduced the fractional incidence of albuminuria following passive heating (before: 58  51%, after: 8  29%, P = 0.03). Collectively, these results demonstrate that passive heat stress does not alter glomerular filtration rate.

Several aspects of its pathogenesis and the related clinical consequences still need elucidation. In Italy, Sardinia has had very low numbers of infections. Taking advantage of the low genetic polymorphism in the Sardinian population, we analyzed clinical, genetic and immunogenetic factors, with particular attention to HLA class I and II molecules, to evaluate their influence on susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the clinical outcome. Method and Materials: We recruited 619 healthy Sardinian controls and 182 SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thirty-nine patients required hospital care and 143 were without symptoms, pauci-symptomatic or with mild disease. For all participants, we collected demographic and clinical data and analyzed the HLA allele and haplotype frequencies. Results: Male sex and older age were more frequent in hospitalized patients, none of whom had been vaccinated during the previous seasonal flu vaccination campaignes. Compared to the group of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic patients, hospitalized patients also had a higher frequency of autoimmune diseases and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PDH) deficiency.

The extended haplotype HLA-A*02:05, B*58:01, C*07:01, DRB1*03:01 [OR 0.1 (95% CI 0-0.6), Pc = 0.015] was absent in all 182 patients, while the HLA-C*04:01 allele and the three-loci haplotype HLA-A*30:02, B*14:02, C*08:02 [OR 3.8 (95% CI 1.8-8.1), Pc = 0.025] were more frequently represented in patients than controls. In a comparison between in-patients and home care patients, the HLA-DRB1*08:01 allele was exclusively present in the hospitalized patients [OR > 2.5 (95% CI 2.7-220.6), Pc = 0.024]. Conclusion: The data emerging from our study suggest that the extended haplotype HLA-A*02:05, B*58:01, C*07:01, DRB1*03:01 has a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Sardinian population. Genetic factors that resulted to have a negative influence on the disease course were presence of the HLA-DRB1*08:01 allele and G6PDH deficiency, but not the beta-thalassemic trait. Absence of influenza vaccination could be a predisposing factor for more severe disease.","output":"Human Leukocyte Antigen Complex and Other Immunogenetic and Clinical Factors Influence Susceptibility or Protection to SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Severity of the Disease Course.

However, out of concern for the concentration of liquidity in only a few countries, above all Germany, the ECB Council ultimately decided to differentiate its marginal policy interest rates. It did so by exempting huge brackets or tiers of banks deposits from penalty interest, thus effectively differentiating the marginal deposit rates between the countries. The differentiation immediately implied bank lending from liquidity abundant countries like Germany to the liquidity scarce Mediterranean countries in order to exploit the unexploited bracket space, which reduced the Target balances.","output":"Interest Spreads and Tiering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Di masa pandemi COVID-19 yang masih marak menyebar luas saat ini, masyarakat dituntut untuk menjaga kebersihan tubuh dan lingkungan dengan rajin mencuci tangan secara rutin menghindari kerumunan mengurangi kegiatan diluar rumah untuk menghindari penularan virus Corona-19.

They have successfully expanded the influenza vaccination programme and are now supporting the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out. AIM: This rapid realist review aims to understand how community pharmacy can most effectively deliver essential and advanced services, with a focus on vaccination, during the pandemic and in the future. METHOD: An embryonic programme theory was generated using four diverse and complementary documents along with the expertise of the project team. Academic databases, preprint services and grey literature were searched and screened for documents meeting our inclusion criteria. The data were extracted from 103 documents to develop and refine a programme theory using a realist logic of analysis. Our analysis generated 13 context-mechanism-outcome configurations explaining when, why and how community pharmacy can support public health vaccination campaigns, maintain essential services during pandemics and capitalise on opportunities for expanded, sustainable public health service roles. The views of stakeholders including pharmacy users, pharmacists, pharmacy teams and other healthcare professionals were sought throughout to refine the 13 explanatory configurations. RESULTS: The 13 context-mechanism-outcome configurations are organised according to decision makers, community pharmacy teams and community pharmacy users as key actors. Review findings include: supporting a clear role for community pharmacies in public health; clarifying pharmacists legal and professional liabilities; involving pharmacy teams in service specification design; providing suitable guidance, adequate compensation and resources; and leveraging accessible, convenient locations of community pharmacy. DISCUSSION: Community pharmacy has been able to offer key services during the pandemic. Decision makers must endorse, articulate and support a clear public health role for community pharmacy. We provide key recommendations for decision makers to optimise such a role during these unprecedented times and in the future.","output":"Rapid realist review of the role of community pharmacy in the public health response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dealing with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a monumental test of medical skills and resources worldwide.

This study tests the hypothesis that application of NPT to cranial critical-size defects (CSD) in skeletally mature rabbits leads to osseous healing. NPT was delivered 1, 4, 6 or 10 days over CSD-containing calcium phosphate scaffolds placed in contact with intact dura. At 12 weeks after defect creation, NPT groups exhibited significantly greater defect bridging and bone within the scaffolds (P<0.01). Increasing duration of NPT did not result in a greater amount of bone within the scaffolds, but did increase the amount of bone distributed in the upper half of the scaffolds. Appearance of tissue within defects immediately following the removal of NPT at day 6 suggests alternating regions of dural compression and distention indicative of cell stretching. Dura and adjacent tissue were composed of multiple cell layers that extended up into the scaffolds, lining struts and populating pore spaces. An extracellular matrix densely populated with cells and capillaries, as well as larger vessels, infiltrated pores of NPT-treated scaffolds, while scattered spindle-shaped cells and sparse stroma are present within pores of control scaffolds.

METHODS: This study compared stool microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) of 37 term infants with CGISCs with 36 term healthy infants (HIs). Two stool samples were collected from each infant: as soon as possible after birth (week 1) and 10C14 days of life (week 2). RESULTS: Bacterial richness and alpha diversity were comparable between CGISCs and HIs at week 1 and week 2 (all p > 0.05). Beta diversity analysis revealed that at week 1, CGISCs had similar community structures to HIs (p = 0.415). However, by week 2, community structures of CGISCs were significantly different from HIs (p = 0.003). At week 1, there were no significant differences in the relative abundances of genera Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides between CGISCs and HIs. At week 2, the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium was significantly lower in CGISCs (mean percentage 7.21  13.49 vs. 28.96  19.6; p = 0.002). Bacteroides were also less abundant in the CGISC group (mean percentage 0.12  0.49 vs. 6.59  8.62; p = 0.039). Relative abundance of genera Pseudomonas and EscherichiaCShigella were higher in CGISCs.

However, there is no consensus on the reasons behind the rapid increase in the usage of e-wallets. This study aims to fill a knowledge gap by incorporating government support, the perceived risk, and social influence as the potential factors affecting the use of e-wallets. Survey data were collated from 598 respondents using Google Forms and analyzed using covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM). The findings confirm that perceived usefulness, government support, the perceived risk, and social influence are positively related to the attitude toward the usage of e-wallets. This attitude is also positively related with the users intention of using the wallets. The outcomes of this study may assist policymakers to devise effective strategies that are able to capture the users intentions to use e-wallets during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The survey was discontinued due to the devastating explosion that shook Beirut early August. RESULTS: A total of 602 students (60.1% females), 20.6 years (4.3) took part in the study. 54% reported using the Internet to seek for COVID-19 information in the past month. Students in fields other than health and social sciences (HHS), and not using official sources, had limited DHL for information seeking (26.6%). Lebanese students, at undergraduate level, with a health impairment, and not using official sources and news portals had limited DHL for adding self-generated content (35.9%). Students at undergraduate level, who used social media for information, had limited DHL for evaluating reliability (42.7%). Non-HHS, with a health impairment, and not using official sources had limited DHL for determining relevance (32.0%).

Non-PV organized atrial arrhythmias (PAC, AT, macro-reentrant AFL) are possible contributors; however the prevalence and effect of their ablation on recurrent AF are unknown. We hypothesize that the identification and ablation of non-PV organized atrial arrhythmias were associated with less AF recurrence. METHODS: Patients who underwent repeat ablation for recurrent AF after prior PVI were retrospectively enrolled. The prevalence and characteristics of PV reconnections and non-PV organized atrial arrhythmias were identified. The outcomes of time to clinical AF recurrence, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, and mortality were analyzed in patients using multivariable adjusted Cox regression. RESULTS: In 74 patients with recurrent AF (age 66  9 years, left atrial volume index 38  10 ml/m2, 59% persistent AF), PV reconnections were found in 46 patients (61%), macro-reentrant atrial flutter in 27 patients (36%), and focal tachycardia in 12 patients (16%). Mapping and ablation of non-PV organized atrial arrhythmias were associated with a reduced recurrence of late clinical AF (adjusted HR 0.26, CI 0.08-0.85, p = 0.03) and the composite outcome of recurrence of late AF, HF hospitalization, and mortality (adjusted HR 0.38, CI 0.17-0.85, p = 0.02), with median follow-up of 1.6 (IQR 0.7-6.3) years. The presence of PV reconnections or empiric linear ablation was not associated with reduction in clinical AF or composite endpoints. CONCLUSION: The ablation of non-PV organized atrial arrhythmias resulted in a reduction of late clinical AF recurrence and composite outcome.

However, because viral proteins evolve very fast, commonly used sequence similarity detection methods such as BLAST may overlook homologs. We analyzed a data set of proteins from RNA viruses characterized as genus specific by BLAST. More powerful methods developed recently, such as HHblits or HHpred (available through web-based, user-friendly interfaces), could detect distant homologs of a quarter of these proteins, suggesting that these methods should be used to annotate viral genomes. In-depth manual analyses of a subset of the remaining sequences, guided by contextual information such as taxonomy, gene order, or domain cooccurrence, identified distant homologs of another third. Thus, a combination of powerful automated methods and manual analyses can uncover distant homologs of many proteins thought to be orphans. We expect these methodological results to be also applicable to cellular organisms, since they generally evolve much more slowly than RNA viruses. As an application, we reanalyzed the genome of a bee pathogen, Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV). We could identify homologs of most of its proteins thought to be orphans; in each case, identifying homologs provided functional clues. We discovered that CBPV encodes a domain homologous to the Alphavirus methyltransferase-guanylyltransferase; a putative membrane protein, SP24, with homologs in unrelated insect viruses and insect-transmitted plant viruses having different morphologies (cileviruses, higreviruses, blunerviruses, negeviruses); and a putative virion glycoprotein, ORF2, also found in negeviruses.

We hypothesize that SAR-COV2 induces mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of the mitochondrial-dependent intrinsic apoptotic pathway, resulting in microglial and neuronal apoptosis. The goal of our study was to determine the effect of SARS-COV2 on mitochondrial biogenesis and to monitor cell apoptosis in human microglia non-invasively in real time using Raman spectroscopy, providing a unique spatio-temporal information on mitochondrial function in live cells. We treated human microglia with SARS-COV2 spike protein and examined the levels of cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, determined the effect of SARS-COV2 on mitochondrial biogenesis and examined the changes in molecular composition of phospholipids. Our results show that SARS- COV2 spike protein increases the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS production, increases apoptosis and increases the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in microglial cells. Increases in OCR are indicative of increased ROS production and oxidative stress suggesting that SARS-COV2 induced cell death. Raman spectroscopy yielded significant differences in phospholipids such as Phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), which account for ~ 80% of mitochondrial membrane lipids between SARS-COV2 treated and untreated microglial cells.

However, systemic respiratory vaccines generally provide limited protection against viral replication and shedding within the airway, as this requires a local mucosal secretory IgA response. Indeed, preclinical studies of adenovirus and mRNA candidate vaccines demonstrated persistent virus in nasal swabs despite preventing COVID-19. This suggests that systemically vaccinated patients, while asymptomatic, may still be become infected and transmit live virus from the upper airway. COVID-19 is known to spread through respiratory droplets and aerosols. Furthermore, significant evidence has shown that many clinic and surgical endonasal procedures are aerosol generating. Until further knowledge is acquired regarding mucosal immunity following systemic vaccination, otolaryngology providers should maintain precautions against viral transmission to protect the proportion of persistently vulnerable patients who exhibit subtotal vaccine efficacy or waning immunity or who defer vaccination.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccines May Not Prevent Nasal SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Asymptomatic Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the global COVID-19 pandemic, many public health services were severely disrupted. Estimating the overall health effects of this is difficult as most disease surveillance systems have also been substantially affected during the pandemic. For some diseases, this effect is mitigated by the methods enacted to fight the pandemic, such as use of facial coverings, social distancing and quarantine, but measles is infectious to the degree that this mitigation is likely to be limited. Thus, outbreaks and an increase in global measles mortality are expected. However, the severity of this impact is not yet known. In early 2020, a study by Roberton and colleagues predicted an additional 12,360 to 37,920 deaths in children under-five worldwide from measles over the coming year based on three potential levels of vaccine coverage reductions ranging from 18.5 to 51.9%. Our study investigates the magnitude of the increase in measles mortality due to decreased vaccine coverage because of COVID-19, based on official estimates of 2020 measles vaccine coverage from WHO/UNICEF released in July 2021. Using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), an interventions modeling program, we estimated measles mortality for low/middle income countries (LMICs) based on the 2020 WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage (WUENIC). Because these calculations use actual reported vaccine coverage, they provide a more accurate picture of measles mortality related to COVID-19 disruptions in 2020. Using the WUENIC data, LiST predicted fewer additional deaths in 2020 due to decreases in measles vaccine coverage than estimations made by LiST based on Roberton, 2020 due to remarkable recovery efforts by national immunization programmes in the second half of 2020.","output":"Change in Measles Vaccine Coverage and Estimated Impact on Measles Mortality in Low and Middle Income Countries, 2020: An Investigation into Secondary Public Health Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic Using the Lives Saved Tool"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Inherited cutis laxa, or inelastic, sagging skin is a genetic condition of premature and generalized connective tissue aging, affecting various elastic components of the extracellular matrix. Several cutis laxa syndromes are inborn errors of metabolism and lead to severe neurological symptoms. PATIENT AND METHODS In a patient with cutis laxa, a choreoathetoid movement disorder, dysmorphic features and intellectual disability we performed exome sequencing to elucidate the underlying genetic defect. We identified the amino acid substitution R275W in phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type II, caused by a homozygous missense mutation in the PI4K2A gene. We used lipidomics, complexome profiling and functional studies to measure phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate synthesis in the patient and evaluated PI4K2A deficient mice to define a novel metabolic disorder. RESULTS The R275W residue, located on the surface of the protein, is involved in forming electrostatic interactions with the membrane. The catalytic activity of PI4K2A in patient fibroblasts was severely reduced and lipid mass spectrometry showed that particular acyl-chain pools of PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 were decreased. CONCLUSIONS Phosphoinositide lipids play a major role in intracellular signalling and trafficking and regulate the balance between proliferation and apoptosis. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases such as PI4K2A mediate the first step in the main metabolic pathway that generates PI4P, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 . Although neurologic involvement is common, cutis laxa has not been reported previously in metabolic defects affecting signalling.

In consequence, the period of seed availability for harvesting is brief. The possibility of staggering seed production among crops would allow extension of the harvest period and, hence, of equipment use. This work was carried out to evaluate the influence of N doses on this period and to discuss the possibility of using this practice to extend harvest period.

Because a correlation between inspiratory muscle pressure (Pmus) and electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) has been described, we aimed to assess the reliability of surface electromyography (EMG) of the respiratory muscles for monitoring diaphragm electrical activity and subject effort during assisted ventilation. METHODS At a general ICU of a single university-affiliated hospital, we enrolled subjects who were intubated and on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and were on mechanical ventilation for > 48 h. The subjects were studied at 3 levels of pressure support. Airway flow and pressure; esophageal pressure; EAdi; and surface EMG of the diaphragm (surface EAdi), intercostal, and sternocleidomastoid muscles were recorded. Respiratory cycles were sampled for off-line analysis. The Pmus/EAdi index (PEI) was calculated by relying on EAdi and surface EAdi (surface PEI) from an airway pressure drop during end-expiratory occlusions performed every minute. RESULTS surface EAdi well correlated with EAdi and Pmus, in particular, after averaging breaths into deciles (R = 0.92 and R = 0.84). When surface PEI was used with surface EAdi, it provided a reliable estimation of Pmus (R = 0.94 in comparison with measured Pmus). CONCLUSIONS During assisted mechanical ventilation, EAdi can be reliably monitored by both EAdi and surface EMG.

The strategy thus measures the dependence of the neighbors on the focal node, identifying the ability of this node to spread the disease.

In order to outline a standard/baseline model of care, we think that it can be useful to refer to already existing rehabilitative plans with a long-standing tradition in Italy, such as those ones prescribed for work-related respiratory diseases like pneumoconiosis, in which long-term outcomes share some clinical characteristics with post-infective lung fibrosis. Such programs include diagnostic procedures (spirometry, ECG, blood tests) and treatments like respiratory physio-kinesiotherapy and postural drainage of the lungs; mechanical pulmonary ventilation for rehabilitative purposes, with or without drugs, along with standard medical and, when required, oxygen therapy; inhalation therapies with mineral waters; physical activity and psychological support. In conclusion, we believe that spa facilities can be a proper setting for respiratory rehabilitation and that already existing programs employed in occupational medicine can be a good starting point to plan rehabilitative strategies for post-COVID-19 patients. In particular, health spa centers can be useful not only to offer tailored programs of physical rehabilitation but also to provide patients with a psychologically supportive and health-promoting environment.

The major objective of our current study was to analyze the tissue-specific expression pattern of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a proven functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in different organs of the hamster. Using two different antibodies (MA5-32307 and AF933), we have conducted immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analysis to evaluate the ACE2 expression in different tissues of the hamster. Further, at the mRNA level, the expression of Ace2 in tissues was evaluated through RT-qPCR analysis. Both the antibodies detected expression of ACE2 in kidney, small intestine, tongue, and liver. Epithelium of proximal tubules of kidney and surface epithelium of ileum expresses a very high amount of this protein. Surprisingly, analysis of stained tissue sections showed no detectable expression of ACE2 in the lung or tracheal epithelial cells. Similarly, all parts of the large intestine were negative for ACE2 expression. Analysis of tissues from different age groups and sex didnt show any obvious difference in ACE2 expression pattern or level.

OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to identify Long COVID research priorities using a citizen science approach and solely considering the needs of those affected. METHODS: This citizen science study followed an iterative process of patient needs identification, evaluation and prioritisation. A Long COVID Citizen Science Board (21 persons with Long COVID, and seven with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome) and a Long COVID Working Group (25 persons with Long COVID, four patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and one relative) were formed. The study included four activities: three remote meetings and one online survey. First, Board members identified the needs and research questions. Second, Working Group members and persons affected by Long COVID (241 respondents, 85.5% with Long COVID, 14.5% with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and 7.1% relatives) evaluated the research questions on a 1C5 Likert scale using an online survey. Then the Board gave feedback on this evaluation. Finally, Board members set the priorities for research through voting and discussion. RESULTS: Sixty-eight research questions were generated by the Board and categorised into four research domains (medicine, healthcare services, socioeconomics and burden of disease) and 14 subcategories. Their average importance ratings were moderate to high and varied from 3.41 (standard deviation = 1.16) for sex-specific diagnostics to 4.86 (standard deviation = 0.41) for medical questions on treatment. Five topics were prioritised: treatment, rehabilitation and chronic care management, availability of interfaces for treatment continuity, availability of healthcare structures, awareness and knowledge among professionals and prevalence of Long COVID in children and adolescents.

We aimed to evaluate the clinical course of community-acquired RSV pneumonia in newborns hospitalized in neonatal intensive care unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS All the newborns diagnosed as pneumonia were prospectively evaluated for RSV infection between November 2010 and April 2011. Fifty-four specimens of nasopharyngeal secretions were tested in parallel with the RAT and the multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR). Downes' score was used to assess the disease severity in patients with pneumonia. RESULTS RAT has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 78.5%, as the PCR technique target assay. Four of the patients with RSV pneumonia had secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) and all of four needed mechanical ventilation support. The first day Downes' score was positively correlated with time of intravenous fluid requirement (p= 0.001, r= 0.48), total oxygen need (p= 0.000, r= 0.63), and re-enteral feeding (p= 0.001, r= 0.46). Blood pH (p= 0.031, r= 0.46) were negatively correlated with Downes' score. The second day Downes' score was higher in patients with ASD than those of without ASD (3.8  2.6 vs. 2  1.1, p= 0.01). The most possible risk factor for longer hospital stay was the higher second day Downes' score (p= 0.02 OR: 1.9, CI 95% (1.1-3.2). All infants were discharged from hospital in a good health. CONCLUSION RAT is sensitive and specific in detecting RSV infections in newborns. Physicians may use Downes' score for evaluation of disease severity in infants with RSV pneumonia.

Critical to reducing waste is a clear understanding of why organs are not used: accurate metrics are essential to identify the extent and causes of waste but use of these measures as targets or comparators between units/jurisdictions must be done with caution as focus on any one measure may result in unintended adverse consequences. Comparison between centres or countries may be misleading because of variation in definitions, patient or graft characteristics. Two of the most challenging areas to improve appropriate deceased donor organ utilisation are appetite for risk and lack of validated tools to help identify an organ that will function appropriately. Currently the implanting surgeon is widely considered to be accountable for the use of a donated organ so guidelines must be clear to allow and support sensible decisions and recognition that graft failure or inadvertent disease transmission are not necessarily attributable to poor decision-making.

Both surveys ask about a patients likelihood to recommend a particular medical practice, which is a useful, but imperfect, surrogate for overall satisfaction. The purpose of this analysis was to identify any changes in patient satisfaction scores with the implementation of telemedicine services. A retrospective analysis of our institutions experience during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the months immediately prior to the pandemic was conducted. The percent of patients with a Top box response to survey questions regarding their likelihood to recommend a medical practice were compared. A total of 14 430 CG-CAHPS results collected in November 2019 through February 2020 were compared to 22 009 telemedicine survey results collected between March and May 2020. In general, most medical specialties incorporated telemedicine but suffered a decrease in their patients likelihood to recommend a medical practice during the first few months of the pandemic. However, the magnitude of this decrease was variable by medical specialty. Physical medicine and rehabilitation and pain medicine had relatively poor scores prior to the pandemic which did not statistically change. Oncology was the sole medical specialty that continued to have unchanged high patient satisfaction scores. These data provide insights for the refinement of telemedicine.","output":"Changes in Patient Satisfaction Scores During the Early COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severity of radiographic abnormalities on chest radiograph in subjects with COVID-19 has been shown to be associated with worse outcomes, but studies are limited by different scoring systems, sample size, subject age, and study duration. Data regarding the longitudinal evolution of radiographic abnormalities and its association with outcomes are scarce. We sought to evaluate these questions using a well-validated scoring system (the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema [RALE] score) using data over 6 months from a large, multihospital health care system. METHODS: We collected clinical and demographic data and quantified radiographic edema on chest radiograph obtained in the emergency department (ED) as well as on days 1-2 and 3-5 (in those admitted) in subjects with a nasopharyngeal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) visiting the ED for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID)-19-related complaints between March-September 2020. We examined the association of baseline and longitudinal evolution of radiographic edema with severity of hypoxemia and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Eight hundred and seventy subjects were included (median age 53.6; 50.8% female). Inter-rate agreement for RALE scores was excellent (interclass correlation coefficient 0.84 [95% CI 0.82-0.87], P < .001). RALE scores correlated with hypoxemia as quantified by SpO2 /FIO2 (r = -0.42, P < .001). Admitted subjects had higher RALE scores than those discharged (6 [2-11] vs 0 [0-3], P < .001). An increase of RALE score  4 was associated with worse 30-d survival (P = .006). Larger increases in the RALE score were associated with worse survival. CONCLUSIONS: The RALE score was reproducible and easily implementable in adult subjects presenting to the ED with COVID-19. Its association with physiologic parameters and outcomes at baseline and longitudinally makes it a readily available tool for prognostication and early ICU triage, particularly in patients with worsening radiographic edema.","output":"Chest Radiograph Severity and Its Association With Outcomes in Subjects With COVID-19 Presenting to the Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) may have acute psychological consequences, both in relation to the impact of the virus itself and the restrictions imposed to tackle its spread We conducted an online survey of 403 residents in Guangzhou, China We found the prevalence of anxiety (defined as Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 score 5) was 37 7%, and anxiety was significantly and moderately correlated with worry about COVID-19 Higher anxiety levels in community residents was associated with the presence of individuals with COVID-19 in the same building;a longer time spent each day gathering information about the virus;and choosing social media as their preferred source of information Our findings provide an insight into the psychological support and guidance about information sources that are required in this type of public health emergency","output":"Proximity to people with COVID-19 and anxiety among community residents during the epidemic in Guangzhou, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Currently, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become pandemic and spread globally. In Nepal, the number of COVID-19 is increasing day-by-day. This research was done to find out the impact of COVID-19 on dentists, patients, and dental practice in Nepal. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional study conducted using an online survey from May 10 to17, 2020. A questionnaire was designed and uploaded in Freeonlinesurveys.com. Following ethical approval, the questionnaire was distributed among 500 dentists, and 406 dentists participated in the study. The survey link was dispersed to the Nepali dentists through social media and e-mail, and the results of the responses were received online. The questionnaire consisted of a total of 34 closed-ended questions containing three parts; demographic details, knowledge of dentists on COVID-19, and the impact of COVID-19 on dentists, patients, and dental treatments. RESULTS: It showed that majority of the participants were females 243 (60%) of the age group 25-29 years with the clinic as the workplace. Patients receive dental treatments only from 40 (10%) of the dentist. A high number of dentists: 284 (70%) were severely affected by the financial burden and were not receiving a salary during this lockdown. About 349(86%) of the dentist think they should do regular dental treatments, but only 101 (25%) think the dentist should do only dental emergency treatments for COVID-19 infected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Dentists, patients, and dental practice are severely affected by the COVID-19. The majority of the dentists have faced financial burdens.

In this study, we treated Malus prunifolia (MP) at four different stages of AR development, and analyzed the level of the endogenous hormones MT, auxin (IAA), zeatin-riboside (ZR), abscisic acid (ABA), and gibberellins (GA1 + 3) in all four treatment groups and the untreated control group. The expression of MT, IAA biosynthesis, transport and signal transduction, the cell cycle, and root development related genes were quantified by RT-qPCR. The function of MdWOX11 was analyzed in transgenic apple plants. RESULTS: The promotion of AR development by MT was dependent on the stage of AR induction between 0 and 2 d in apple rootstocks. MT-treatment increased the level of IAA and crosstalk existed between MT and IAA during AR formation. The expression of MdWOX11 was induced by MT treatment and positively regulated AR formation in apple. Furthermore, transgenic lines that overexpressed MdWOX11 lines produced more ARs than 'GL3'. Phenotypic analysis indicated that MdWOX11 overexpression lines were more sensitive to exogenous MT treatment than 'GL3', suggesting that MdWOX11 regulates AR formation in response to MT in apple rootstock.

DESIGN: Participants reported their interaction status using a self-report questionnaire. Face-to-face interactions comprised in-person meetings, while virtual interactions (e.g., via phone calls or emails) were defined as non-face-to-face interactions. We examined the relationship between their interaction status at baseline and the risk of disability incidence at follow-up. We also considered several potential confounding variables, such as demographic characteristics. SETTING: The National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology-Study of Geriatric Syndromes. PARTICIPANTS: We included 1159 adults from Takahama City aged 75 years (mean age  standard deviation = 79.5  3.6 years). MEASUREMENTS: Interaction status was assessed using a self-reported questionnaire consisting of two sections (face-to-face and non-face-to-face interactions), and four questionnaire items. Based on the responses we categorized study participants into four groups: both interactions, face-to-face only, non-face-to-face only, and no interactions. RESULTS: Individuals with both kinds of interactions (49.3/1000 person-years) or only one kind of interaction (face-to-face = 57.7/1000 person-years; non-face-to-face = 41.2 person-years) had lower incidence of disability than those with no interactions (88.9/1000 person-years). Moreover, the hazard ratios adjusted for potential confounding factors for the incidence of disability in the both interaction, face-to-face-only, and non-face-to-face only groups were 0.57 (confidence interval = 0.39C0.82; p = 0.003), 0.66 (confidence interval = 0.44C0.98; p = 0.038), and 0.47 (confidence interval = 0.22C0.99; p = 0.048), respectively.

Most of the selected readiness measures were instituted before confirmation of the first case and response measures were initiated rapidly after the outbreak confirmation.

Parents reported personal and household experiences of COVID-19 stressors, their level of distress, and use of neglectful parenting and discipline practices for a randomly selected child in their home. Analyses estimated rates of COVID-19 related stress and parenting practices. Logistic regression was used to assess the relation of COVID-19 stress to parenting behaviors. RESULTS: Individual and household stressor level, as well as distress were each positively associated with likelihood of neglect. Personal exposure to stressors was minimally related to discipline, but household stressor level and parents' distress were positively associated with harsh and positive discipline. DISCUSSION: Indicators of COVID-19 stress (e.g., exposure to stressors and distress) each uniquely predicted parents' use of neglect, particularly physical and family-based sub-types, and use of harsh and positive discipline practices.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the presence of cerebral microbleeds and their distribution are related to the integrity of white matter microstructures. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study comprised 982 participants who underwent brain MR imaging to determine microbleed status. The cross-sectional relation between microbleeds and the microstructural integrity of the white matter was assessed by 2 statistical methods: a multilinear regression model based on the average DTI parameters of normal-appearing white matter and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics analysis, a tract-based voxelwise analysis. Fiber tractography was used to spatially describe the microstructural abnormalities along WM tracts containing a cerebral microbleed. RESULTS The presence of cerebral microbleeds was associated with lower mean fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity, and the association remained when cardiovascular risk factors and cerebral small-vessel disease markers were further adjusted. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics analysis indicated strictly lobar cerebral microbleeds associated with lower fractional anisotropy, higher mean diffusivity, and higher radial diffusivity in the internal capsule and corpus callosum after adjusting other cerebral small-vessel disease markers, while only a few voxels remained associated with deep cerebral microbleeds. Diffusion abnormalities gradients along WM tracts containing a cerebral microbleed were not found in fiber tractography analysis.

As the major types of programmed cell death, autophagy and apoptosis have been observed in response to H2O2-mediated oxidative stress and have been demonstrated to be responsible for porcine GC death. To date, however, the cellular reactions linking autophagy to the apoptosis of porcine GC under oxidative stress are still poorly understood. Porcine GC were treated with H2O2, and autophagic flux was examined by western blotting. Cell viability and cell death assays were performed after cotreatment of porcine GC with autophagy activator (rapamycin) or inhibitor (3-methyladenine, 3-MA) together with H2O2. We revealed that short exposure (1-3 h) of porcine GC to H2O2 dramatically increased autophagic flux (1.8- to 2.5-fold over that in the control), whereas 6-12 h prolonged treatment decreased autophagy but elevated the caspase-3 activity and GC apoptotic rate. Furthermore, we showed that pretreatment with rapamycin exacerbated H2O2-mediated cytotoxicity and caspase-3 activation but that 3-MA or siRNAs specific for Beclin 1 and Atg7 genes ameliorated H2O2-mediated GC apoptosis. Together, our results indicate that autophagy plays a pivotal role in H2O2-mediated porcine GC apoptosis. Importantly, we show that the early induction of autophagic flux contributes to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in porcine GC. The results also suggest that regulating the autophagy response in porcine GC under oxidative stress might be a new strategy for abnormal follicular atresia.","output":"Autophagy Contributes to Oxidative Stress-Induced Apoptosis in Porcine Granulosa Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We collected tweets directed at the official Twitter account of the Canadian Public Health Office as well as comments on a Canadian Public Health Office press conference posted to YouTube.

The patient position is reversed (from prone to supine or vice versa) and the aspiration repeated. METHODS Between January 1, 2010, and April 3, 2012, 129 consecutive, CT image-guided, percutaneous needle biopsies of lung nodules were performed in 127 patients (75 men, 52 women; mean age, 67.8 years; range, 26-88 years). Two patients underwent repeated biopsies. The mean lesion diameter was 38 mm (range, 8-110 mm). Core biopsy and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) were performed in 126 procedures; in three cases, only FNA was performed. In the cases with symptomatic minimal pneumothorax and in all patients with pneumothorax > 10 mm, immediate, simple, manual aspiration was performed. Ipsilateral opposite-side aspiration was performed when simple aspiration failed. RESULTS Among 129 CT image-guided biopsies, pneumothorax was detected by CT scan in 54 (42%); 51 (39%) were detected during the biopsy. Delayed pneumothorax occurred in two patients (1.55%). Manual aspiration to treat pneumothorax was performed in 27 of 129 procedures (21%). Simple aspiration was successful in 20 of these 27 cases (74%). Ipsilateral opposite-side aspiration was accomplished in the remaining seven cases (26%) and was successful in six cases (86%). Two of 129 procedures (1.55%) required chest tube placement.

A deeper understanding of the kinds of services that people affected by ACEs feel they need to overcome these negative impacts is required. REVIEW QUESTION: How do people affected by ACEs between the ages of 3 to 18 experience support and services in the UK? What are their needs relating to services and support? METHODS: Systematic review of qualitative evidence. We harvested relevant studies from existing systematic reviews of qualitative evidence located through a search of 18 databases. Included studies needed to be published in or after 2008, conducted in the UK, and report the views of people exposed to ACEs relating to their service needs. We included studies with participants who were affected by ACEs between 3 -18 years old with no restriction on the age at which they accessed services. RESULTS: We identified 71 reviews from which we harvested 238 references on title and abstract screening. Following full text screening and quality and relevance appraisal we included 20 studies. Each of the included studies focussed on a specific ACE population. Almost half focused on young people who were fostered, looked-after or leaving care. No studies focussed on parental incarceration or divorce. Young people value emotional and practical support. Service providers were most valued for displaying empathy, being non-judgemental, and being active listeners. Supportive relationships, especially with adults, are a key factor in feeling understood. CONCLUSIONS: People affected by ACEs describe the importance of stability and continuity in the support they receive. These factors are important for allowing necessary time to overcome obstacles and build up trust.

Indeed, although AI allows us to address and solve very difficult and complicated problems, AI-based tools act as a black box and, usually, do not explain how/why/when a specific decision has been taken. Among AI models, Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems (FRBSs) are recognized world-wide as transparent and interpretable tools: they can provide explanations in terms of linguistic rules. Moreover, FRBSs may achieve accuracy comparable to those achieved by less transparent models, such as neural networks and statistical models.

A total of fourteen clinical isolates from patients with positive Nocardia cultures and clinical evidence were included between January 2017 and June 2020 in HeNan Provincial Peoples Hospital. DNA extraction and 16S rRNA PCR were performed on positive cultures, and pathogens were detected by mNGS in these same samples directly. Among the 14 Nocardia isolates, four species were identified, and N. cyriacigeorgica (8 cases) is the most common species. Twelve of the 14 Nocardia spp. isolates were identified by the two methods, while two strains of N. cyriacigeorgica were not identified by mNGS. All tested isolates showed susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), amikacin and linezolid. Apart from Nocardia species, other pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumonia, Aspergillus, Enterococcus faecalis, Human herpesvirus, etc., were detected from the same clinical samples by mNGS. However, these different pathogens were considered as colonization or contamination. We found that it is essential to accurately identify species for determining antibiotic sensitivity and, consequently, choosing antibiotic treatment. 16S rRNA PCR was useful for identification of nocardial infection among species, while this technique needs the clinicians to make the pre-considerations of nocardiosis.

Thus, a low-cost membrane was developed for highly effective removal and rapid surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection of PCBs by filling esterified-sawdust (CA-SD) modified with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into solid phase extraction (SPE) column. SD was first modified by an esterification cross-linking strategy and then AgNPs were anchored on the CA-SD to prepare highly sensitive and reproducible SERS substrates (AgNPs/CA-SD). Due to the contraction of the surface area of the CA-SD caused by drying, the gap between the AgNPs could be reduced, thereby generating a large number of hot spots and driving more target molecules into them to obtain the enhanced SERS signals. The AgNPs/CA-SD-based SPE membrane showed excellent SERS activity with an enhancement factor of 5.98a?a?108 for the R6G analysis. The proposed SERS-active SPE membrane with functionalization of mercapto-?-cyclodextrin was further developed for the determination of PCB-77 and PCB-1 with the LODs of 1.43a?a?10-9a?M and 2.12a?a?10-8a?M, respectively. In addition, each PCB in the mixed sample could be quickly distinguished based on the characteristic peaks.

Demands in social and material needs surged, and they could not be met solely by unprepared infrastructures. Although local communities complemented them in previous disasters, physical distancing measures to prevent the spread of the virus undermined human connection, and local communities had to come up with novel ways to provide support. To develop insights from such adaptations of local communities, we explored civic activities for immediate disaster relief in multiple local communities across the United States and interviewed civic initiative organizers and attendees.

Due to a lack of confidence in vaccination as a result of safety concerns, HCWs increasingly do not take the influenza vaccine. Consequently, there is a rising influenza burden which results in increasing mortality of vulnerable patients and absenteeism in hospitals. This policy brief aims to increase the awareness of HCWs regarding the importance of influenza vaccination uptake, which may result in improved patient and workplace safety. Policy Options: To increase vaccination coverage and reduce vaccine hesitancy among HCWs, a change in attitude towards and knowledge about the influenza vaccine is needed. Two potential approaches are presented in this paper. Firstly, a mandatory vaccination policy is discussed. Practical and ethical challenges of implementing a mandatory vaccination policy are considered. Secondly, information campaigns are described, consisting of three pillars: safety, information, and knowledge. Recommendations: It is recommended to initiate information campaigns focussing on patient safety. Furthermore, a structural approach to increase access to vaccination at the workplace must be taken. Higher vaccination rates of HCWs lead to an improved workplace safety. The recommended information campaign can also be used for other vaccine preventable diseases or in other situations, such as HCWs vaccine hesitancy regarding COVID-19 vaccines.

The study intended to explore potential biomarkers for predicting the presence of HF in CAD patients. METHODS: According to the presence of HF, 83 CAD patients with HF were assigned to the AHF group and 52 CAD patients without HF to the CAD group. Additionally, healthy controls (n = 52) were those who had received physical examinations at the same period. The serum levels of IL-13, TGF-1, and periostin were detected by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD), left ventricle-end diastolic volume (LVEDV), and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were detected 3 times by color Doppler ultrasound. The predictive values of IL-13, TGF-1, and periostin methods were compared by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: Increased levels of IL-13, TGF-1, and periostin were noted in the AHF group than in the control and CAD groups (p < 0.001); the CAD group showed higher levels of IL-13, TGF-1, and periostin than the control group (p < 0.001). Based on the NYHA classification, there were 33 cases with grade II, 28 cases with grade III, and 22 cases with grade IV among 83 CAD patients with HF. It was found that the serum levels of IL-13, TGF-1, and periostin were higher in the AHF-IV group than in the AHF-III and AHF-II groups (p < 0.001); these levels were also higher in the AHF-III group than in the AHF-II group (p < 0.001). The periostin level was positively correlated with the levels of IL-13 (r = 0.458) and TGF-1 (r = 0.569) in CAD patients with AHF. Besides, the serum levels of periostin (r = -0.425), IL-13 (r = -0.341), and TGF-1 (r = -0.435) were negatively correlated with the LVEF of CAD patients with AHF, respectively.

Mosquito-borne viruses with expanding ranges include West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and Chikungunya virus. Zoonotic viruses that have recently crossed into humans to cause neurologic disease include the bat henipaviruses Nipah and Hendra, as well as the primate-derived human immunodeficiency virus. Viruses adapt to new hosts, or to cause more severe disease, by changing their genomes through reassortment (e.g. influenza virus), mutation (essentially all RNA viruses) and recombination (e.g. vaccine strains of poliovirus). Viruses that appear to have recently become more neurovirulent include West Nile virus, enterovirus 71 and possibly Chikungunya virus. In addition to these newer challenges, rabies, polio and measles all remain important causes of neurologic disease despite good vaccines and global efforts toward control. Control of human rabies depends on elimination of rabies in domestic dogs through regular vaccination. Poliovirus eradication is challenged by the ability of the live attenuated vaccine strains to revert to virulence during the prolonged period of gastrointestinal replication.

We collected nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs at enrollment and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a real-time PCR assay. RESULTS: Of 382 children, 293 (77%) were SARS-CoV-2-infected. SARS-CoV-2-infected children were more likely to be Hispanic (p<0.0001), less likely to have asthma (p=0.005), and more likely to have an infected sibling contact (p=0.001) than uninfected children. Children ages 6-13 years were frequently asymptomatic (39%) and had respiratory symptoms less often than younger children (29% vs. 48%; p=0.01) or adolescents (29% vs. 60%; p<0.0001). Compared to children ages 6-13 years, adolescents more frequently reported influenza-like (61% vs. 39%; p<0.0001), gastrointestinal (27% vs. 9%; p=0.002), and sensory symptoms (42% vs. 9%; p<0.0001), and had more prolonged illnesses [median (IQR) duration: 7 (4, 12) vs. 4 (3, 8) days; p=0.01].

Hyperglycemia is a predictor of poor prognosis in COVID-19 disease. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this work is to describe a case series of HHS and/or DKA likely triggered by the COVID-19 vaccine. The aim is to alert physicians of the potential hyperglycemic complications from the COVID-19 vaccination and to provide further insight into the underlying mechanism of the bidirectional relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and DM. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: All 3 patients developed HHS and/or DKA within 2 to 10 days of the COVID-19 vaccination. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative and other clinical precipitating factors were excluded. Two patients had a history of type 2 DM (T2DM) with pre-admission HbA1c levels of 7.0% to 7.5% while 1 patient was newly diagnosed with T2DM during the hospitalization. They were each treated with insulin infusion and were discharged on subcutaneous insulin therapy. Due to the rapid resolution of the hyperglycemia, insulin was discontinued in all patients within 8 weeks and they remain well-controlled on oral DM medications. CONCLUSION: Severe hyperglycemia including HHS and DKA may be triggered by COVID-19 vaccination.

This study aimed to determine whether alternative testing strategies based on sample pooling can increase the speed and throughput of screening for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: A mathematical modelling approach was chosen to simulate six different testing strategies based on key input parameters (infection rate, test characteristics, population size, testing capacity etc.). The situations in five countries (US, DE, UK, IT and SG) currently experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks were simulated to reflect a broad variety of population sizes and testing capacities. The primary study outcome measurements that were finalised prior to any data collection were time and number of tests required; number of cases identified; and number of false positives. Findings: The performance of all tested methods depends on the input parameters, i.e. the specific circumstances of a screening campaign. To screen one tenth of each country's population at an infection rate of 1% - e.g. when prioritising frontline medical staff and public workers -, realistic optimised testing strategies enable such a campaign to be completed in ca. 29 days in the US, 71 in the UK, 25 in Singapore, 17 in Italy and 10 in Germany (ca. eight times faster compared to individual testing). When infection rates are considerably lower, or when employing an optimal, yet logistically more complex pooling method, the gains are more pronounced. Pool-based approaches also reduces the number of false positive diagnoses by 50%. Interpretation: The results of this study provide a clear rationale for adoption of pool-based testing strategies to increase speed and throughput of testing for SARS-CoV-2.

With the larger datasets, the domain shift problem arises, affecting the performance of methods on the unseen data. One of the critical sources of domain shift in CT images is the difference in reconstruction kernels used to generate images from the raw data (sinograms).

Furthermore, we compare several domain adaptation approaches to tackle the problem, such as task-specific augmentation and unsupervised adversarial learning. Finally, we propose the unsupervised adaptation method, called F-Consistency, that outperforms the previous approaches. Our method exploits a set of unlabeled CT image pairs which differ only in reconstruction kernels within every pair. It enforces the similarity of the network hidden representations (feature maps) by minimizing mean squared error (MSE) between paired feature maps. We show our method achieving 0.64 Dice Score on the test dataset with unseen sharp kernels, compared to the 0.56 Dice Score of the baseline model. Moreover, F-Consistency scores 0.80 Dice Score between predictions on the paired images, which almost doubles the baseline score of 0.46 and surpasses the other methods.

Available traditional toxicity techniques have some limitations (assessments and ethical issues). Behaviour toxicology is a promising research area towards early warning and non-invasive approaches. We studied the potential eco-toxic effects of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) on the swimming behaviour of zebrafish. Zebrafish were exposed to different concentrations (Treatment I, Treatment II, Treatment III, and Treatment IV) of NaOCl for 360 h. Recovery study (144 h) was conducted for NaOCl treatment groups. The swimming behaviour of zebrafish was quantified efficiently using an online monitoring system (OMS). OMS dataset was processed for determination of behavioural differences by MATLAB and SPSS. Compared to the control group, the swimming strength of zebrafish under NaOCl treatments declined significantly (p < 0.001). Avoidance behaviour has occurred on zebrafish under NaOCl exposure periods. Furthermore, NaOCl toxicity also adjusted circadian rhythms on zebrafish. Zebrafish swimming strength was significantly (p < 0.001) improved under-recovery periods. Moreover, normal diurnal patterns have occurred. NaOCl could cause behavioural abnormalities in non-target organisms. Continuous exposure to common disinfectants could cause external and internal stress on non-target organisms, resulting in behavioural changes and circadian rhythm adjustments. Continuous changes in behavioural and circadian rhythms might reduce organisms fitness and adaptation capacity.

This drug is characterized by a long half-life (more than 200 hours), a favorable safety profile, and an activity against a wide array of gram-positive organisms, including several strains of Staphylococci and Enterococci. METHODS: In this study, we presented 3 cases of critically ill patients treated with dalbavancin. All patients were therapeutically monitored for plasma dalbavancin concentrations; ultrafiltrate dalbavancin concentrations were assessed in a patient undergoing continuous renal-replacement therapy. Dalbavancin concentrations were measured using a validated liquid chromatographic method coupled with mass spectrometry. RESULTS: All 3 severely ill patients experiencing necrotizing fasciitis were successfully treated during the acute phase with dalbavancin. Dalbavancin clearance in patient 3 (0.334 L/h) was considerably increased compared with values measured in the other 2 patients (0.054 and 0.075 L/h) and with data reported in the literature (0.04-0.06 L/h).

For our analysis, we explored the PHEME9 rumour dataset (consisting of 9 events), including source tweets (both rumour and non-rumour categories) and response tweets. We compared the rumour and nonrumour source tweets and then their corresponding reply (response) tweets to understand how they differ linguistically for every incident. Furthermore, we also evaluated if these features can be used for classifying rumour vs. non-rumour tweets through machine learning models. To this end, we employed various classical and ensemble-based approaches. To filter out the highly discriminative psycholinguistic features, we explored the SHAP AI Explainability tool.

Total variable costs (TVCs) were tabulated for each patient, and stratified by category [e.g. 'floor', 'operating room' (OR), 'radiology']. Costs for index admissions and 30-day readmissions were compared between LDP and ODP groups. RESULTS Of 153 procedures, 115 (70 LDP, 45 ODP) were selected for analysis. The TVC of the index admission was US$3420 less per patient in the LDP group (US$10 480 versus US$13 900; P = 0.06). Although OR costs were significantly greater in the LDP cohort (US$5756 versus US$4900; P = 0.02), the shorter average hospitalization in the LDP group (5.2 days versus 7.7 days; P = 0.01) resulted in a lower overall cost.

The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a significant disruption in the provision of dental services globally. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on dental services provided in Australia through the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. METHODS This study was a retrospective analysis of Medicare data on utilization of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule obtained from the Australian Government. Data were analysed for the period February to September 2020, with the number of services provided per month across five categories (diagnostic, preventive, restorative, endodontic and oral surgery) compared with the monthly average for 2019 (95% CI) and the same month for 2019. Total services by month were reported for 2017, 2018 and 2019 to compare the yearly trend with 2020. Differences in services provision by State/Territory were also described. RESULTS Over the period of March to September, there were 881 454 fewer dental services provided in 2020 than 2019, with the largest decline seen in April. There was a greater decline in preventive and diagnostic services, and a smaller decline in endodontic and oral surgery services. A second wave of COVID-19 in Victoria saw 198 609 fewer dental services provided in that state from July to September 2020 than 2019. Dental service provision had still not returned to normal levels across Australia by September 2020. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the provision of dental services to children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who already experience higher levels of dental disease and disadvantage in accessing dental care. Although the restriction of dental services was deemed necessary in order to minimize the risk of transmission of COVID-19 in the dental setting, the impact of these restrictions on oral health will be long lasting. Given the chronic and progressive nature of dental disease, the deferral of necessary dental care is likely to contribute to poorer oral health and long-term problems for many Australians.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on the provision of paediatric dental care: Analysis of the Australian Child Dental Benefits Schedule."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Highly virulent variants of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) have been closely associated with recent outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) in China, which have resulted in severe economic losses to the pork industry","output":"Isolation and characterization of a variant subgroup GII-a porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strain in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in humans a D614G substitution in the spike (S) protein emerged and became the predominant circulating variant (S-614G) of the COVID-19 pandemic(1).

Flow Cytometry (FC) was used to quantify and characterize bioaerosols in terms of dead, injured and live cells. The most efficient system was ZnO/Perlite with 72% inactivation of bioaerosols, maintaining such inactivation during 7.5 h due to the higher water retention capacity of Perlite (2.8 mL/g(Perlite)) in comparison with Poraver (1.5 mL/g(Perlite)). However, a global balance showed that TiO(2)/Poraver system triggered the highest level of cytotoxicity to bioaerosols retained on the support after 96 h with 95% of dead cells. SEM and FC analyses showed that the mechanism of inactivation with ZnO was based on membrane damage, morphological cell changes and cell lysis; whereas only membrane damage and cell lysis were involved with TiO(2). Overall, results highlighted that photocatalytic technologies can completely inactivate bioaerosols in indoor environments.

DESIGN: Outbreak investigation. SETTING: Cases presented in 4 healthcare facilities in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: a tertiary-care hospital, a specialty pulmonary hospital, an outpatient clinic, and an outpatient dialysis unit. METHODS: Contact tracing and testing were performed following reports of cases at 2 hospitals. Laboratory results were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and/or genome sequencing. We assessed exposures and determined seropositivity among available healthcare personnel (HCP) cases and HCP contacts of cases. RESULTS: In total, 48 cases were identified, involving patients, HCP, and family members across 2 hospitals, an outpatient clinic, and a dialysis clinic. At each hospital, transmission was linked to a unique index case. Moreover, 4 cases were associated with superspreading events (any interaction where a case patient transmitted to 5 subsequent case patients). All 4 of these patients were severely ill, were initially not recognized as MERS-CoV cases, and subsequently died. Genomic sequences clustered separately, suggesting 2 distinct outbreaks. Overall, 4 (24%) of 17 HCP cases and 3 (3%) of 114 HCP contacts of cases were seropositive. CONCLUSIONS: We describe 2 distinct healthcare-associated outbreaks, each initiated by a unique index case and characterized by multiple superspreading events. Delays in recognition and in subsequent implementation of control measures contributed to secondary transmission. Prompt contact tracing, repeated testing, HCP furloughing, and implementation of recommended transmission-based precautions for suspected cases ultimately halted transmission.","output":"Scope and extent of healthcare-associated Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus transmission during two contemporaneous outbreaks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As most COVID-19 transmission occurs locally, targeted measures where the likelihood of infection and hospitalization is highest may be a prudent risk management strategy. To date, in the Republic of Ireland, a regional comparison of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations has not been completed. Here, we investigate (i) the variation in rates of confirmed infection and hospital admissions within geographical units of the Republic of Ireland and (ii) frequency of deviations in risk of infection or risk of hospitalization. METHODS: We analyzed routinely collected, publicly available data available from the National Health Protection and Surveillance Centre and Health Service Executive from nine geographical units, known as Community Health Organization areas. The observational period included 206 14-day periods (1 September 2020C15 April 2021). RESULTS: A total of 206 844 laboratory-confirmed cases and 7721 hospitalizations were reported. The national incidence of confirmed infections was 4508 [95% confidence interval (CI) 4489C4528] per 100 000 people. The risk of hospital admission among confirmed cases was 3.7% (95% CI 3.5C3.9). Across geographical units, the likelihood that rolling 14-day risk of infection or hospitalization exceeded national levels was 9C86% and 0C88%, respectively. In the most affected regions, we estimate this resulted in an excess of 15 180 infections and 1920 hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Responses to future COVID-19 outbreaks should consider the risk and harm of infection posed to people living in specific regions. Given the recent surges of COVID-19 cases in Europe, every effort should be made to strengthen local surveillance and to tailor community-centred measures to control transmission.","output":"Quantifying the impact of regional variations in COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations across Ireland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Financial transactions constitute connections between entities and through these connections a large scale heterogeneous weighted graph is formulated.

Findings: This study reveals that unemployed and furloughed hospitality workers are financially strained, depressed, socially isolated and panic-stricken due to the pandemics effects. These effects lead to impaired well-being and an increased intention to leave the hospitality industry. Female and younger employees are impacted to a greater extent, while furloughed workers received fewer impacts compared to their laid-off compatriots.

Methods & Materials This was a prospective study from Dec 2020 to May 2021 conducted in a 220 bed tertiary care hospital in Mumbai. We are a designated COVID care hospital with 55 isolation beds including 16 beds in the COVID ICU, a dedicated OPD for symptomatic patients and Emergency services (EMS). The test was performed on a syndromic approach based respiratory PCR with 22 targets inclusive of SARS-CoV2. Nasal and a pharyngeal swab samples (NPS) were collected and the results of the test were available in 1.5 hours from sample receipt to the lab. Results A total of 335 patient samples were received during the study period for the syndromic approach based PCR. 133 (39.7%) of the symptomatic patients had a positive test result. 87(26%) SARS-CoV2 and 27(8.05%) Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (RhV/EV) were the two common viruses that were identified during the study duration. Other viruses, like Parainfluenza 3 (PIV3), Coronavirus 229E (229E), Coronavirus HKU1 (HKU1), Influenza AH3 (AH3), H1N1, Coronavirus OC43 (OC43) and Adenovirus were also identified.

For the task of automated diagnosis, there should be flexibility to deal with an enormous amount of data represented in the form of medical images. In addition, efficient algorithms that could be adapted according to the nature of images should be used. The importance of automated medical diagnosis has been maximized with the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 first appeared in China, Wuhan, and then it has exploded in the whole world with a very bad impact on our daily life. The third wave of COVID-19 in the third world is really a disaster in current days, especially with the emergence of the delta variant of COVID-19 that is widespread. Required inspections should be carried out to monitor the COVID-19 spread in daily life and allow primary diagnosis of suspected cases, and long-term clinical laboratory monitoring. Healthcare professionals or radiologists can exploit AI (Artificial Intelligence) tools to quickly and reliably identify the cases of COVID-19. This paper introduces a DCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Network) framework for chest X-ray and CT image classification based on TL (Transfer Learning). The objective is to perform multi-class and binary classification of the images in order to determine pneumonia and COVID-19 case. The TL is feasible, when using a small dataset by transferring knowledge from natural image classification to medical image classification. Two types of TL are used. The first type is fine-tuning of the DenseNet121, Densenet169, DenseNet201, ResNet50, ResNet152, VGG16, and VGG19 models. The second type is deep tuning of the LeNet-5, AlexNet, Inception naive v1, and VGG16 models.

Lower lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, platelets and higher delta neutrophil index (DNI), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were found in COVID-19 and influenza groups compared to healthy controls. The eosinophils, lymphocytes and PLR made the highest contribution to differentiate COVID-19 patients from healthy controls (area under the curves (AUCs): 0.819, 0.817 and 0.716, respectively; P-value is <0.0001 for all). The NLR, the optimal cut-off value was 3.58, which resulted in a sensitivity of 30.8 and a specificity of 100 (AUC: 0.677, P < 0.0001). Higher leucocytes, neutrophils, DNI, NLR, PLR and lower lymphocytes, red blood cells, haemoglobin, haematocrit levels were found in severe patients at the end of treatment. Nonsevere patients showed an upward trend for lymphocytes, eosinophils and platelets, and a downward trend for neutrophils, DNI, NLR and PLR. However, there was an increasing trend for eosinophils, platelets and PLR in severe patients. In conclusion, NLR and PLR can be used as biomarkers to distinguish COVID-19 patients from healthy people and to predict the severity of COVID-19.

A discrete choice experiment method was used to analyze the willingness of residents to pay for additional CSO infrastructure through the installation of GI options such as bioretention gardens, rain barrels, and green roofs. Furthermore, study identified attributes such as secondary benefits, proximity, and water retention that respondents found the most utility in when choosing GI stormwater management interventions. We found that several attributes, including improved air quality ($58.60), increased water supply ($49.71), and closer proximity ($110.01C$125.97) had the highest utility and similarly were associated with a higher willingness to pay than other tested attributes. These findings are important in assessing the overall attitude toward these fixtures, and may be critical in crafting local policy and development, especially to address environmental equity.","output":"Public preferences for green infrastructure improvements in Northern New Jersey: a discrete choice experiment approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY We present our results with minimally invasive surgical treatment of lone atrial fibrillation (LAF) employing a radiofrequency (RF) source through a bilateral thoracoscopy. METHODS Between January 2007 and January 2011, 28 consecutive patients (85.7% male, mean age 67.1  9.1 years) with LAF underwent video-assisted bilateral RF ablation. Fourteen patients (50%) had paroxysmal, five (17.8%) persistent, and nine (32.2%) long-persistent LAF. All patients were followed-up according to the Heart Rhythm Society/ European Heart Rhythm Association/European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society (HRS/EHRA/ECA) and success/failure was reported as suggested by Society of Thoracic Surgeon (STS) guidelines. Mean follow-up was 27.8  8.6 months. RESULTS Time-related prevalence of postoperative AF was 4.5% at 36 months. Success was much more likely in subjects with paroxysmal (3-year prevalence, 0%) or persistent (3-year prevalence, 0%) than long-standing persistent LAF (3-year prevalence, 8.3%). At 36 months the estimated prevalence of antiarrhythmic drugs was 11.3% (8.8 to 13.7). No major thromboembolic events were detected during the follow-up period and 36-month prevalence of Warfarin use was 15.2% (11.5 to 18.1). Finally, no patient underwent electrical cardioversion.

As opposed to what was believed at the beginning of the pandemic, the virus has not only spread but persevere causing secondary waves and challenging the concept of herd immunity against viral infections. While the majority of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals may remain asymptomatic, a fraction of individuals may develop low to high-grade severity signs and symptoms of COVID-19. The disease is multifactorial and can progress quickly, leading to severe complications and even death in a few days. Therefore, understanding the pre-existing factors for disease development has never been so pressing. In this scenario, the insights on the mechanisms underlying disease allied to the immune response developed during the viral invasion could shed light on novel predictive factors and prognostic tools for COVID-19 management and interventions. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) revealed several molecules that significantly impacted critically ill COVID-19 patients, leading to the core mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Considering these findings and the fact that ACE-2 polymorphisms alone cannot explain disease progress and severity, this review aims at summarizing the most important and recent findings of the research and expert consensus of possible cytokine-related polymorphisms existing in the differential expression of paramount immune molecules that could be crucial for providing guidelines for decision-making and appropriate clinical management of COVID-19.","output":"Will a little change do you good?

Experimentally infected cats have measurable immune suppression, which sometimes progresses to an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A transient initial state of infection is followed by a long latent stage with low virus replication and absence of clinical signs. In the terminal stage, both viruses can cause severe immunosuppression. Thus, FIV infection in cats has become an important natural model for studying HIV infection in humans, especially for evaluation of antiviral compounds. Of particular importance for chemotherapeutic studies is the close similarity between the reverse transcriptase (RT) of FIV and HIV, which results in high in vitro susceptibility of FIV to many RT-targeted antiviral compounds used in the treatment of HIV-infected patients.

However, the presence of bony structures such as ribs and clavicles can obscure subtle abnormalities, resulting in diagnostic errors. This study aims to build a deep learning (DL)-based bone suppression model that identifies and removes these occluding bony structures in frontal CXRs to assist in reducing errors in radiological interpretation, including DL workflows, related to detecting manifestations consistent with tuberculosis (TB). Several bone suppression models with various deep architectures are trained and optimized using the proposed combined loss function and their performances are evaluated in a cross-institutional test setting using several metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and multiscale structural similarity measure (MSCSSIM). The best-performing model (ResNetCBS) (PSNR = 34.0678; MSCSSIM = 0.9828) is used to suppress bones in the publicly available Shenzhen and Montgomery TB CXR collections. A VGG-16 model is pretrained on a large collection of publicly available CXRs. The CXR-pretrained model is then fine-tuned individually on the non-bone-suppressed and bone-suppressed CXRs of Shenzhen and Montgomery TB CXR collections to classify them as showing normal lungs or TB manifestations. The performances of these models are compared using several performance metrics such as accuracy, the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), analyzed for statistical significance, and their predictions are qualitatively interpreted through class-selective relevance maps (CRMs). It is observed that the models trained on bone-suppressed CXRs (Shenzhen: AUC = 0.9535  0.0186; Montgomery: AUC = 0.9635  0.0106) significantly outperformed (p < 0.05) the models trained on the non-bone-suppressed CXRs (Shenzhen: AUC = 0.8991  0.0268; Montgomery: AUC = 0.8567  0.0870)..

We sought to describe our recent experience with percutaneous catheter insertion and peritoneal dialysis in patients in the ICU with COVID-19 infection. Method: Patients were selected according to local protocol, and catheters were inserted percutaneously by experienced operators using a Seldinger technique. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and ventilation requirements were recorded at the time of insertion and 24 hours later. Procedural complications, proportion of RRT provided by PD, renal recovery, and RRT parameters (serum potassium and maximum base excess) during PD were assessed. Results: Percutaneous PD catheters were successfully inserted in 37 of 44 patients (84.1%) after a median of 13.5 days (interquartile range [IQR] = 10.0, 20.3 days) in the ICU. No adverse events were reported; SOFA scores and ventilation requirements were comparable before and after insertion; and adequate RRT parameters were achieved. The median proportion of RRT provided by PD following catheter insertion was 94.6% (IQR = 75.0, 100%).

This is the question that has occupied ophthalmologists since the beginning of the outbreak. In order to infect a certain type of tissue specific receptors for each virus and sometimes also coreceptors or other proteins must be present. The aim of this review was to summarize and reflect the current state of research with the help of the currently available literature as of 28 May 2020. At the time of the research, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was clearly identified as the receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) as the necessary protease to enable the infection of human cells with SARS-CoV?2. In the eye both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed, although sometimes very weakly and with varying degrees in different tissues. It is noteworthy that very different results were obtained with different methods. Several reasons can account for this effect: Firstly, the method of detection or preservation of the tissue, secondly, the possibly different expression of the tested tissue samples and thirdly, a possibly rapid loss of receptor expression post-mortem. Therefore, an infection of the eye seems possible, which has already been reported in various publications. The amount of virus or receptor expression necessary to cause an infection is not known. According to current state of knowledge the eye is not considered to be a high-risk tissue due to the low ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression.

The study instruments used were the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Risk perception scores were analyzed using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis test. Logistic regression was done to identify factors significantly associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression determined. RESULTS: A total of 516 HCWs were included in the study. Most of them have anxiety symptoms (70.74%), but only half of them have symptoms of depression (50.97%).

As a direct result, ideas, which would otherwise have never been considered, are being presented as golden solutions. One such case is that of the 'immunity passport', i.e. determining the movement of people within countries and across borders on the basis of their immunity status. The argument being made is that such a passport would allow people with immunity to help on the front line, as for example to alleviate pressure in hospitals safeguarding the health of many. Similar argumentation is used across sectors, with tremendous burden being placed on low-paid and seasonal workers, who may attempt to try and get infected to be 'able' to work or cross a border to seek work. Additionally, legislative provisions on testing for immunity expose individuals to enforced 'solutions' infringing upon their rights and privacy, and even stigmatising them. Thus, COVID19 represents a threat to human rights, individual freedoms and, ultimately, social cohesion, mostly impacting adversely vulnerable people already at a disadvantage. The legal nature of this measure raises questions on whether this is necessary and in accordance to a legitimate aim in a democratic society. Is there a difference between healthcare settings and the broader society? Who would manage 'immunity registries'? Could data safe and privacy safeguarded? Would human rights be infringed upon and with what implication for democracy? Vaccines are destined to become a catalyst in this debate. Currently, we do not know whether antibody presence translates to protection from subsequent infection, with uncertainty on antibody testing, response durability, and on the role of antibodies in conferring immunity. The same concerns are applicable to a future vaccine. Would it be acceptable to revisit the immunity passports in the advent of a vaccine? Where do we stand in terms of having a s! afe and effective vaccine? What is the role science can play to elucidate such dilemmas and inform policy? What role can patient summaries play were we to transition to recording immunity vs vaccination status? Immunity passports represent a Trojan horse to compromise democratic societies and exacerbate inequalities, also representing an impediment to empowerment. Safe care can be ensured by saying no to immunity passports and yes to citizen empowerment, with patient summaries associated with provenance and including immunization information for safe care.

Alveolar lavage fluid datasets of COVID-19 and asthma were obtained from the GEO and GSV database. A series of analyses of common host factors for COVID-19 and asthma were conducted, including PPI network construction, module analysis, enrichment analysis, inference of the upstream pathway activity of host factors, tissue-specific analysis and drug candidate prediction. Finally, the key host factors were verified in the GSE152418 and GSE164805 datasets. RESULTS: 192 overlapping host factors were obtained by analyzing the intersection of asthma and COVID-19.

According to the degree values ranking in the PPI network, EEF1A1, EGR1, UBA52, DDX5 and IRF8 were considered as the key cohost factors for COVID-19 and asthma. The H(2)O(2), VEGF, IL-1 and Wnt signaling pathways had the strongest activities in the upstream pathways. Tissue-specific enrichment analysis revealed the different expression levels of the five critical host factors. LY294002, wortmannin, PD98059 and heparin might have great potential to evolve into therapeutic drugs for COVID-19 and asthma comorbidity. Finally, the validation dataset confirmed that the expression of five key host factors were statistically significant among COVID-19 groups with different severity and healthy control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This study constructed a network of common host factors between asthma and COVID-19 and predicted several drugs with therapeutic potential. Therefore, this study is likely to provide a reference for the management and treatment for COVID-19/asthma comorbidity.","output":"Insights into potential mechanisms of asthma patients with COVID-19: A study based on the gene expression profiling of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Communication is something that can never be separated from a person's life. Communicating well will help achieve goals. The communication that will be discussed here is the importance of good communication in the office environment, as well as how it affects employees. Sometimes people don't pay much attention to communication, but actually without good communication, work in the office will be hampered. The flow of communication in the office has vertical and horizontal flows. Vertical flow is the flow of communication carried out from superiors to subordinates or vice versa, while horizontal flow is the flow of communication carried out with colleagues or equivalent. What includes communication in the vertical flow is orders, tasks, suggestions, opinions, and complaints, while what includes horizontal communication is sharing feelings, and solidarity of cooperation.This study aims to determine and see the effect of good communication on improving employee performance, especially in the office. This research uses library research method. The office is a place for data processing activities so that it becomes more useful information, while performance is the result of work or how the work process takes place. From the data that has been collected, it explains that communication has a very meaningful relationship for employees.

We assessed the incidence and trends in selected thrombotic and cardiac events among hospitalized COVID-19 patients from a large, geographically diverse US electronic health records (EHR) database. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed Optum? de-identified COVID-19 EHR dataset to identify patients hospitalized between 03/01/2020 and 10/31/2020 with a COVID-19 diagnosis code. Patients were members of an integrated delivery network with 1 encounter during the 12 months prior to admission. Events of interest, including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), venous thromboembolism (VTE), stroke and myocarditis, were identified by diagnosis codes during hospitalization. Patients with any such events in their 12-month baseline were excluded. A composite event was defined by the occurrence of any of these events. Events were reported as proportions, in total as well as by month of admission and age group. Results: Among 25,574 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the median age was 60 years (IQR: 44-72), and 54.5% were female. The composite event occurred in 3,052 (11.9%) patients (ACS=6.4%, VTE=4.1%, stroke=2.4%, myocarditis=0.6%) and its incidence increased with age (19=4.6%, 20-49=6.2%, 50-59=11.7%, 60-69=13.4%, 70=17.3%). In the youngest age group, myocarditis (2.2%) and VTE (1.7%) contributed to the majority of events, while in the oldest, ACS (10.9%), VTE (4.2%) and stroke (4.1%) were observed most often. Patients admitted during March had the highest incidence (20.6%), which decreased to 9.1% by July and remained steady through October (9.6%). The percentage decline in the composite event incidence during the study period was higher in younger versus older patients (19=77.0% 20-49=61.9%, 50-59=66.0%, 60-69=58.6%, 70=44.1%). Conclusions: The incidence of the composite event was highest among patients hospitalized early in the pandemic.

One remarkable demonstration of this is the development of laparoscopic surgery. Once this proved to be a safe and reliable surgical approach, robotics seemed a logical progression of surgical technology. The aim of this project was to evaluate the utility of robotics in the context of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC). METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of robotic single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (RSILC) and traditional SILC performed by a single surgeon at our institution from July 2010 to August 2013 was queried. All consecutive patients undergoing RSILC and SILC during this time period were included. Primary outcomes include conversion rate and operative time. Secondary outcomes include length of stay, duration of narcotic use, time to independent performance of daily activities and cost. Categorical variables were evaluated using Chi-square analysis and continuous variables using t test or Wilcoxon's rank test. RESULTS Thirty-eight patients underwent RSILC and 44 underwent SILC. BMI was higher in the RSILC group, and the number of patients with prior abdominal surgeries was higher in the SILC group. Otherwise, demographics were similar between the two groups. There was no difference in conversion rate between RSILC and SILC (8 vs 11 %, p = 0.60). Mean operative time for RSILC was significantly greater compared with SILC (98 vs 68 min, p < 0.0001). RSILC was associated with a longer duration of narcotic use (2.3 vs 1.7 days, p = 0.0019) and time to independent performance of daily activities (4 vs 2.3 days, p < 0.0001). Total cost is greater in RSILC ($8961 vs $5379, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION While RSILC can be safely performed, it is associated with longer operative times and greater cost.","output":"A comparison of robotic single-incision and traditional single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Since its first reported from Wuhan in December 2019, the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and its complications are still evolving As the number of COVID patients requiring positive pressure ventilation is increasing, so is the incidence of subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum We report the case series of 10 patients of COVID-19, with subcutaneous emphysema along with pneumomediastinum METHODS: All patients were admitted to the critical care area from April to June 2020 at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan Electronic records and medical files reviewed for the patient's baseline characteristics, days of ventilation before subcutaneous emphysema, treatment given for COVID-19, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) grade, and with in-hospital mortality RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the patients was 598 years (range, 23-97) The majority of them were men (80%), and common symptoms were dyspnea (100%), fever (80%), and cough (80%) None of them had underlying lung disorder Six patients had hypertension, and five had diabetes All patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on admission, with a median PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 122 5 Eight patients with CRS grade III were being managed in high dependency units at the time of development of subcutaneous emphysema, and two with CRS grade IV were treated in ICU The median duration of assisted ventilation before the development of subcutaneous emphysema was 7 days (interquartile range, 5-10 days) The highest PEEP for invasively ventilated patients was 10, while the CPAP ranged from 12-16, in non-invasive ventilation patients Eventually, all required intubation Chest tubes thoracostomy was done in five patients All received corticosteroids, 6 received tocilizumab, and 7 received convalescent plasma therapy Seven patients died during their hospital stay Obstructive shock with tension pneumothorax was the cause of death in 1 patient, while four died of septic shock Two patients had their ventilator withdrawn due to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome CONCLUSIONS: High risk COVID-19 patients requiring positive pressure ventilation can develop subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum One has to be vigilant about lung-protective ventilator strategies for the management of hypoxia in COVID -19 patients","output":"Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum in patients with COVID-19 disease: Case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tomazin, K, Strojnik, V, Feriche, B, Garcia Ramos, A, ?trumbelj, B, and Stirn, I. Neuromuscular adaptations in elite swimmers during concurrent strength and endurance training at low and moderate altitudes. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2020-This study evaluated neuromuscular adaptations in elite swimmers during concurrent strength and endurance training (SET) at low (295 m) and moderate (2,320 m) altitudes. Sixteen elite swimmers took part in a 3-week SET during a general preparation phase. All neuromuscular tests were performed a week before and after a SET. In posttraining, maximal knee isometric torque (TMVC) and soleus H-reflex remained statistically unchanged for sea-level (SL) and for altitude (AL) training. Rate of torque development (RTD) decreased post-SL (-14.5%; p < 0.01) but not post-AL (-4.7%; p > 0.05) training. Vastus lateralis electromyographic (EMG) activity during RTD decreased post-SL (-17.0%; P = 0.05) but not post-AL (4.8%; p > 0.05) training. Quadriceps twitch torque (TTW) significantly increased post-AL (12.1%; p < 0.01) but not post-SL (-1.0%; p > 0.05; training  altitude: F1,15 = 12.4; p < 0.01) training. Quadriceps twitch contraction time and M-wave amplitude remained statistically unchanged post-SL and post-AL training. After SL training, increment in TMVC was accompanied with increment in vastus lateralis EMG (R = 0.76; p < 0.01) and TTW (R = 0.48; p < 0.06). Posttraining in AL, increment in TMVC was accompanied with increment in TTW (R = 0.54; p < 0.05). Strength and endurance training at altitude seems to prompt adaptations in twitch contractile properties. In contrast, SET performed at SL may hamper the magnitude of neural adaptations to strength training, particularly during rapid voluntary contractions. In conclusion, SET at AL might benefit muscular adaptations in swimmers compared with training at SL.","output":"Neuromuscular Adaptations in Elite Swimmers During Concurrent Strength and Endurance Training at Low and Moderate Altitudes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Triage is crucial for patients management and estimation of the required intensive care unit (ICU) beds is fundamental for health systems during the COVID-19 pandemic.

After reviewing existing assistive technologies for mental health interventions, we provide an overview of how social robots have been used in many clinical interventions. We then propose to integrate social robots in conventional behavioural and cognitive therapies for both children and adults who struggle with social anxiety. We categorize the different therapeutic roles that social robots can potentially play in activities rooted in conventional therapies for social anxiety and oriented towards symptom reduction, social skills development, and improvement in overall quality of life. We discuss possible applications of robots in this context through four scenarios. These scenarios are meant as food for thought for the research community which we hope will inspire future research. We discuss risks and concerns for using social robots in clinical practice. This article concludes by highlighting the potential advantages as well as limitations of integrating social robots in conventional interventions to improve accessibility and standard of care as well as outlining future steps in relation to this research direction. Clearly recognizing the need for future empirical work in this area, we propose that social robots may be an effective component in robot-assisted interventions for social anxiety, not replacing, but complementing the work of clinicians.

METHODS: We assembled a cohort of adults with documented history of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positivity who were  2 weeks past onset of COVID-19 symptoms or, if asymptomatic, first positive test. At 4-month intervals, we queried physical and mental health symptoms and quality of life. RESULTS: Of the first 179 participants enrolled, 10 were asymptomatic during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 125 symptomatic but not hospitalized, and 44 symptomatic and hospitalized. During the post-acute phase, fatigue, shortness of breath, concentration problems, headaches, trouble sleeping and anosmia/dysgeusia were most common through 8 months of observation. Symptoms were typically at least somewhat bothersome and sometimes exhibited a waxing-and-waning course. Some participants experienced symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress, as well as difficulties with performance of usual activities. The median visual analogue scale rating of general health was lower at 4 and 8 months compared to pre-COVID-19. Two clusters of symptom domains were identified. CONCLUSION: Many participants report bothersome symptoms following onset of COVID-19 with variable patterns of persistence and impact on quality of life.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated mechanical thrombectomy-assisted revisions in five patients between January 2012 and April 2021. Two patients had to be revised twice due to recurrent occlusion. We designated thrombosis within 10 days after shunt creation or revision as acute. Insidious deterioration of portal hypertension related symptoms for at least 6-8 weeks was recorded in chronic cases. We treated four acute and three chronic occlusions. After transjugular lesion crossing, we performed two mechanical thrombectomy device passages. If indicated, balloon dilatation, covered stent placement, or variceal embolization were added. RESULTS: The technical success rate was 100%. No procedure-related complications occurred.

The purpose of this study was to compile a comprehensive list of tactics used by disparate groups and provide a framework for identifying further instances of manufactured doubt. METHODS: We examined scholarly books, peer-reviewed articles, well-researched journalism pieces, and legal evidence related to five disparate industries and organizations selected for their destructive impacts on environmental and public health (tobacco, coal, and sugar industries, manufacturers of the pesticide Atrazine, and the Marshall Institute, an institute focused on climate change research, and other scientists from the era that associated with those in the Institute). These documents provided evidence for a list of tactics used to generate pro-industry spin and manufacture doubt about conferred harm. We then identified trends among sets of strategies that could explain their differential use or efficacy. RESULTS: We recognized 28 unique tactics used to manufacture doubt.

Indeed, the early detection of interstitial pneumonia is particularly relevant for the survival of these patients. Recent studies on rheumatoid arthritis and interstitial lung diseases have shown that pathological pulmonary sounds can be automatically detected by suitably developed algorithms. The scope of this preliminary work consists of proving that the pathological lung sounds evidenced in patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia can be automatically detected as well by the same class of algorithms. In particular the software VECTOR, suitably devised for interstitial lung diseases, has been employed to process the lung sounds of 28 patient recorded in the emergency room at the university hospital of Modena (Italy) during December 2020. The performance of VECTOR has been compared with diagnostic techniques based on imaging, namely lung ultrasound, chest X-ray and high resolution computed tomography, which have been assumed as ground truth. The results have evidenced a surprising overall diagnostic accuracy of 75% even if the staff of the emergency room has not been suitably trained for lung auscultation and the parameters of the software have not been optimized to detect interstitial pneumonia.

Previous studies have shown moderate efficacy for custom-made foot orthoses (CFO) in reducing foot pain and disability in people with rheumatoid arthritis. However, evidence on the efficacy of CFO in people with PsA is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To explore the effects of CFO on foot function, foot and lower limb pain, gait function, and free-living walking activities (FWA) in people with PsA. METHODS: A pre-experimental study including twenty participants with PsA (mean age: 54.10  9.06 years and disease duration: 11.53  10.22 years) was carried out. All the participants received and wore CFO for 7 weeks. Foot and lower limb pain and foot function were measured before and after the intervention using the numerical rating scale (NRS) and the foot function index (FFI). Gait function was assessed by recording spatiotemporal parameters (STPs) during a 10-m walk test using an instrumented gait analysis system (Mobility Lab). Free-living walking activities (step count, free-living cadence, time spent in different ambulatory physical activities (APA)) were recorded over 7 days using an accelerometer-instrumented sock. RESULTS: The FFI reported scores demonstrated severe baseline levels of foot pain (54.46  14.58 %) and disability (46.65  16.14%). Statistically and clinically significant improvements in foot pain and foot function and large effect sizes (Cohens effect size > 1, p < 0.005) were observed after the intervention period. A strong correlation (r = ?0.64, p < 0.01) between the CFO wearing time and foot function was demonstrated. However, no significant changes were found for gait STP or free-living walking activities after 7 weeks of CFO use. CONCLUSION: Results support the clinical and biomechanical plausibility of using CFO in people with PsA to reduce pain and improve foot function. Large-scale and controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings. Moreover, a multidisciplinary approach including the prescription of exercise therapy and physiotherapy combined with CFO could be required to improve STP and promote APA in people with PsA.

RESULTS: A total of 16 experts participated in Round 1 (16/29, 55%). Of these experts 13/16 (response rate, 81%), and 13/13 (response rate, 100%), responded to Rounds 2 and 3, respectively. As a result of developments in AI/ML by 2029 experts anticipated workplace changes including incursions into the disintermediation of physician expertise, and increased AI/ML training requirements for medical students. Informaticians also forecast that by 2029 AI/ML will increase diagnostic accuracy especially among those with limited access to experts, minorities and those with rare diseases. Expert panelists also predicted that AI/ML-tools would improve access to expert doctor knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents timely information on informaticians consensus views about the impact of AI/ML on US primary care in 2029. Preparation for the near-future of primary care will require improved levels of digital health literacy among patients and physicians.","output":"US primary care in 2029: A Delphi survey on the impact of machine learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is spreading rapidly all over the world. The case fatality rate seems higher in cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Other comorbidities do not seem to confer the same risk, therefore the understanding of the relationship between infection and cardiovascular system could be a crucial point for the fight against the virus. A great interest is currently directed towards the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE 2) which is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and creates important connections between the virus replication pathway, the cardiovascular system and blood pressure. All cardiovascular conditions share an imbalance of the renin angiotensin system (RAAS) in which ACE 2 plays a central role. In the last few days, much confusion has appeared about the management of therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in infected patients and in those at risk of critical illness in case of infection.

Desktops, laptops, and tablets are essential tools for communication and project management. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many workers have transitioned to work from home (WFH) to sustain public health emergency guidelines, and it is anticipated that many WFH jobs will be maintained post-pandemic. The transition to WFH occurred rapidly without time to establish ideal workstations. Ergonomic assessments that were typically performed in person needed to be performed using virtual technology. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The purpose of this review is (1) to describe the components of a computer workstation evaluation; (2) to offer suggestions for identifying computer workstation problems that may be contributing to the client's musculoskeletal (MSK) pain and symptoms; (3) to provide suggestions that may improve the safety and comfort at the computer workstation, and (4) to suggest a method of completing the workstation analysis virtually, without onsite in-person evaluation. METHODS AND RESULTS There is a paucity of peer-reviewed literature regarding computer workstation evaluations to be performed in person, let alone using a virtual method. The components of computer workstation evaluations have been recommended by regulatory agencies that survey injuries in the workplace. Prior to 2020, these evaluations were done in person at the office workstation. Modifications in data collection were needed to transition the analysis to a reliable virtual format. The remote method described provides a consistent approach that engages the client in the process.","output":"Computer workstation ergonomics: Current evidence for evaluation, corrections, and recommendations for remote evaluation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To date, only dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients. Tocilizumab has been recently added to the treatment guidelines for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but data remain conflicting. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Electronic databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane central were searched from March 1, 2020, until March 10, 2021, for randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of tocilizumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality, mechanical ventilation, and time to discharge. RESULTS: Nine studies (with 6490 patients) were included in the analysis. In total, 3358 patients received tocilizumab, and 3132 received standard care/placebo. Pooled analysis showed a significantly decreased risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.98, p = 0.02) and progression to mechanical ventilation (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71-0.89, p < 0.0001) in the tocilizumab arm compared to standard therapy or placebo. In addition, there was a trend towards improved median time to hospital discharge (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.12-1.45, p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab therapy improves outcomes of mortality and need for mechanical ventilation, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection compared with standard therapy or placebo.

An important question for policy design is whether this policy has been effective in boosting the firm's production and investment. While answering this question is challenging from a theoretical and empirical perspective, I provide a step forward in understanding the possible effects of this policy on firms' decisions using a theoretical and analytical model. The model suggests that the firm's default probability plays a key role in transmitting the effects of COVID-19 shock and the UMP. Using the model to evaluate two kinds of heterogeneities (size and initial credit risk), I show that large firms and high-risk firms are more affected by COVID-19 shock and are more responsive to the UMP. I then use a cross-sectional regression to evaluate the models prediction on the heterogeneity effects of UMP across firm size and to study the role of firms' characteristics in the effects of UMP. The estimation results support the size-firm hypothesis and suggest that firm's characteristics such as assets and operating income are relevant to understand the effects of the UMP.","output":"What Kind of Firm is More Responsive to the Unconventional Monetary Policy?

This study sought to understand SSWs views about mental health and trauma in relation to the pandemic and schools reopening. Data came from written responses to open-ended questions on a national survey of SSWs during JuneCJuly 2020 (Kelly et al., 2021; Watson et al., 2022). In the national survey, 450 SSWs responded to open-ended questions, providing 115 single-spaced pages of detailed qualitative comments. A unified conceptual model for a trauma-informed school was created by integrating components suggested within the literature. This conceptual model was then used to generate a theory-based coding schema. Responses mapped well onto the conceptual model. Major themes included recognition of COVID-19 and 2020 social unrest as a unique period and potentially traumatic experience; the need for a trauma-informed school response; the challenges of addressing all facets of safety during the pandemic; and the essentiality and difficulty of maintaining school-based relationships during school closures and remote learning. Results demonstrated that SSWs used and discussed key components of a trauma-informed approach. Respondents offered several recommendations for implementing trauma-informed approaches during and after the pandemic, many of which required collaboration from other school staff. Findings provide empirical support for a unified school model that integrates components of a trauma-informed approach found in the literature.

Genomic selection on selection index (SI) values may increase gain over phenotypic selection but empirical studies remain limited. We compared gain in overall SI value for height, heading date, preharvest sprouting (PHS) resistance, and spot blotch resistance and component traits in two cycles of GS with one round of phenotypic selection (PS) in two-row spring malting barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Higher realized gain for SI value, height, and PHS was observed with GS compared with PS but GS did not result in significant gain for heading date and spot blotch. Genetic variances for height and heading date, which had small index weights, were not reduced with GS but variances were substantially reduced for heavily weighted PHS and correlated seed germination traits.

However, there has been little conceptual analysis of the types of mandates available, nor empirical analysis of how the public thinks about different mandates and why. Our conceptual study examines available instruments, how they have been implemented pre-COVID, and their use for COVID-19 globally. Then, our qualitative study reports the acceptability of such measures in Western Australia, which has experienced very limited community transmission, posing an interesting scenario for vaccine acceptance and acceptability of measures to enforce it. METHOD: Our conceptual study developed categories of mandates from extant work, news reports, and legislative interventions globally. Then, our empirical study asked 44 West Australians about their attitudes towards potential mandatory policies, with data analysed using NVivo 12. RESULTS: Our novel studies contribute richness and depth to emerging literature on the types and varying acceptability of vaccine requirements. Participants demonstrated tensions and confusion about whether instruments were incentives or punishments, and many supported strong consequences for non-vaccination even if they ostensibly opposed mandates. Those attached to restrictions for disease prevention were most popular. There were similar degrees of support for mandates imposed by employers or businesses, with participants showing little concern for potential issues of accountability linked to public health decisions delegated to the private sector. Participants mostly supported tightly regulated medical exemptions granted by specialists, with little interest in religious or personal belief exemptions. CONCLUSION: Our participants are used to being governed by vaccine mandates, and now by rigorous lockdown and travel restrictions that have ensured limited local COVID-19 disease and transmission. These factors appear influential in their general openness to COVID-19 vaccine mandates, especially when linked explicitly to the prevention of disease in high-risk settings.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine Mandates: An Australian attitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the principles of burn management are still primarily focused on survival, as advances are realized in resuscitation, nutrition, and wound management, the functional and aesthetic outcomes following burn injury have become increasingly important.

This study investigated disturbances to working life and mental health among Americans aged &#8805;55 during early months of the pandemic. METHODS: Using data from the nation-wide COVID-19 Coping Study (N=6,264), we examined rates of job loss, furloughs, hour/income reductions, and work-from-home, along with unchanged work status, by age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and occupation. We next described sources of worry by job transition group and tested the adjusted associations of COVID-19-related job transitions with life satisfaction, loneliness, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Most job loss occurred among respondents under age 65 and those without college degrees. Job loss and reduced hours/income were more common among Hispanics compared to other racial/ethnic groups, and work-from-home transitions were most common among respondents with high educational attainment and jobs in government- and education-related occupations. Workers who lost their jobs had the lowest life satisfaction and the highest loneliness and depressive symptoms, followed by workers who were furloughed and workers with reduced hours/income. Work-from-home was associated with more anxiety than unchanged work. DISCUSSION: COVID-19-related job transitions are detrimental to mental health, even when they might keep workers safe.

Sarcopenia is an age-related disorder that increases hospitalization, dependencies, and mortality in older adults. It starts to develop in midlife or even earlier as a result of unbalanced diet/poor nutrition and low levels of physical activity, in addition to chronic disorders such as obesity and diabetes mellitus. Given that social isolation is adopted as the most protective measure against COVID-19, the level of physical activity and the intake of adequate diet have considerably declined, especially among older adultsdenoting an increased possibility for developing sarcopenia. Research also shows a higher vulnerability of sarcopenic people to COVID-19 as well as the development of wasting disorders such as sarcopenia and cachexia in a considerable proportion of symptomatic and recovering COVID-19 patients. Muscular wasting in COVID-19 is associated with poor prognosis. Accordingly, early detection and proper management of sarcopenia and wasting conditions in older adults and COVID-19 patients may minimize morbidity and mortality during the current COVID-19 crisis. This review explored different aspects of screening for sarcopenia, stressing their relevance to the detection of altered muscular structure and performance in patients with COVID-19. Current guidelines recommend prior evaluation of muscle strength by simple measures such as grip strength to identify individuals with proven weakness who then would be screened for muscle mass loss. The latter is best measured by MRI and CT. However, due to the high cost and radiation risk entailed by these techniques, other simpler and cheaper techniques such as DXA and ultrasound are given preference. Muscle loss in COVID-19 patients was measured during the acute phase by CT scanning of the pectoralis muscle simultaneously during a routine check for lung fibrosis, which seems to be an efficient evaluation of sarcopenia among those patients with no additional cost. In recovering patients, muscle strength and physical performance have been evaluated by electromyography and traditional tests such as the six-minute walk test. Effective preventive and therapeutic interventions are necessary in order to prevent muscle loss and associated physical decline in COVID-19 patients.

Viruses can hijack the glycosylation machinery of host cells to shield themselves from the host's immune response and attenuate antibody efficiency. However, it remains unclear if targeting glycosylation on viral spike protein can impair infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. METHODS: We adopted flow cytometry, ELISA, and BioLayer interferometry approaches to assess binding of glycosylated or deglycosylated spike with ACE2. Viral entry was determined by luciferase, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence assays. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) revealed a significant relationship between STT3A and COVID-19 severity. NF-B/STT3A-regulated N-glycosylation was investigated by gene knockdown, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and promoter assay. We developed an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that couples non-neutralization anti-spike antibody with NGI-1 (4G10-ADC) to specifically target SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. FINDINGS: The receptor binding domain and three distinct SARS-CoV-2 surface N-glycosylation sites among 57,311 spike proteins retrieved from the NCBI-Virus-database are highly evolutionarily conserved (99.67%) and are involved in ACE2 interaction. STT3A is a key glycosyltransferase catalyzing spike glycosylation and is positively correlated with COVID-19 severity. We found that inhibiting STT3A using N-linked glycosylation inhibitor-1 (NGI-1) impaired SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and that of its variants [Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351)]. Most importantly, 4G10-ADC enters SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and NGI-1 is subsequently released to deglycosylate spike protein, thereby reinforcing the neutralizing abilities of antibodies, vaccines, or convalescent sera and reducing SARS-CoV-2 variant infectivity. INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that targeting evolutionarily-conserved STT3A-mediated glycosylation via an ADC can exert profound impacts on SARS-CoV-2 variant infectivity. Thus, we have identified a novel deglycosylation method suitable for eradicating SARS-CoV-2 variant infection in vitro.

Their spread into new territories has been the cause of major epidemics throughout human history, including the Spanish flu in 1918 and the latest COVID-19 pandemic. Thanks to their outer membrane, consisting essentially of host lipids, enveloped viruses are more resistant to enzymes, and are also less susceptible to host immune defenses than their naked counterparts. Therefore, the development of effective approaches to combat enveloped virus infections represents a major challenge for antiviral therapy in the current century. This review focuses on the characteristics of enveloped viruses, their importance in the entry phase, drugs targeting envelope membrane-mediated entry, and those specifically designed to target the envelope. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of these compounds can be attributed to their ability to affect the envelope, an essential structural feature common to several viruses. This makes this class of compounds agents of great interest when no specific drugs or vaccines are available to block viral infections.","output":"Viral Envelope Membrane: A Special Entry Pathway and a Promising Drug Target"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has a devastating impact worldwide. Recognizing factors that cause its progression is important for the utilization of appropriate resources and improving clinical outcomes. In this study, we aimed to identify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients who were hospitalized with moderate versus severe COVID-19 illness. A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted between 3 March and 9 September 2020. Following the CDC guidelines, a two-category variable for COVID-19 severity (moderate versus severe) based on length of stay, need for intensive care or mechanical ventilation and mortality was developed. Data including demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, therapeutic interventions and clinical outcomes were assessed using descriptive and inferential analysis. A total of 1002 patients were included, the majority were male (n = 646, 64.5%), Omani citizen (n = 770, 76.8%) and with an average age of 54.2 years. At the bivariate level, patients classified as severe were older (Mean = 55.2, SD = 16) than the moderate patients (Mean = 51.5, SD = 15.8). Diabetes mellitus was the only significant comorbidity potential factor that was more prevalent in severe patients than moderate (n = 321, 46.6%; versus n = 178, 42.4%; p < 0.001). Under the laboratory factors; total white cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer and corrected calcium were significant. All selected clinical characteristics and therapeutics were significant. At the multivariate level, under demographic factors, only nationality was significant and no significant comorbidity was identified. Three clinical factors were identified, including; sepsis, Acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) and requirement of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). CRP and steroids were also identified under laboratory and therapeutic factors, respectively. Overall, our study identified only five factors from a total of eighteen proposed due to their significant values (p < 0.05) from the bivariate analysis. There are noticeable differences in levels of COVID-19 severity among nationalities. All the selected clinical and therapeutic factors were significant, implying that they should be a key priority when assessing severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. An elevated level of CRP may be a valuable early marker in predicting the progression in non-severe patients with COVID-19.

Three months later, the highly contagious coronavirus disease, Covid-19, was declared a pandemic. Covid-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, that in March 2021 has infected more than 120 million people worldwide and killed more than 2.7 million. Covid-19 has been the deadliest pandemic to arise since the 1918 Spanish flu, shutting down economies and societies worldwide. Covid-19 caused patients to neglect routine visitations to their healthcare providers, out of fear of catching the disease. Fortunately, within our arsenal exist great tools to limit transmission of Covid-19, including face masks and persistent decontamination of surfaces. They have allowed the population to safely return to work and feel safer when visiting their healthcare providers. Arguably, dental workers and patients face a great risk. Although dental workers are appropriately masked during procedures, patients cannot be masked. With 50% of Covid-19 patients presenting as asymptomatic, contamination of dental clinics with SARS-CoV-2 is a genuine concern. An unmasked patient undergoing routine dental procedures can easily spread saliva containing SARS-CoV-2 across dental clinics, which may facilitate transmission of Covid-19. Therefore, an effective decontamination method, such as ultraviolet C (UVC) light, capable of inactivating SARS-CoV-2 on different surfaces as well as within aerosols, may warranted lower the risk of transmission within the dental clinic. In this review, we propose to discuss the studies that have investigated the potential for UVC to decontaminate face masks, surfaces, and aerosols, with a focus on how these may be applied to the dental clinic.","output":"Shedding UVC light on Covid-19 to protect dentistry staff and patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alloy is a lightweight specification language based on relational logic, with an analysis engine that relies on SAT solvers to automate bounded verification of specifications.

This challenge is exacerbated by the ever-evolving nature of complex software systems. This paper presents Platinum, a technique for efficient analysis of evolving Alloy specifications, that recognizes opportunities for constraint reduction and reuse of previously identified constraint solutions. The insight behind Platinum is that formula constraints recur often during the analysis of a single specification and across its revisions, and constraint solutions can be reused over sequences of analyses performed on evolving specifications.

Data from 2016 through 2019 was combined, averaged by month, and compared to data from 2020 using Chi-squared analysis. Results During the months of interest, 992 trauma patients were triaged in 2020 and 4,311 in 2016-2019. The numbers of penetrating and Level 1 trauma activations in January C March of 2020 were similar to average numbers for the same months during 2016 through 2019. In April 2020, there was a significant increase in incidence of penetrating trauma compared to the prior four-year average (27% vs. 16%, p<0.002).

Haematological parameters were measured. Population genetics was investigated using 13 unlinked microsatellite loci. Immunogenic diversity was assessed for Mhc-Drb. Frequency of the Y139F mutation (conferring resistance to rodenticides) and two linked microsatellites were studied, concurrently with the presence of anticoagulant residues in the liver. Combination of microscopy and molecular methods were used to investigate the occurrence of 25 parasites. Statistical approaches were used to explore multiple parasite relationships and model parasite occurrence. Eighty-six rats were caught. The first haematological data for a wild urban R. norvegicus population was reported. Genetic results suggested high genetic diversity and connectivity between Chanteraines rats and surrounding population(s). We found a high prevalence (55.8%) of the mutation Y139F and presence of rodenticide residues in 47.7% of the sampled individuals. The parasite species richness was high (16). Seven potential zoonotic pathogens were identified, together with a surprisingly high diversity of Leptospira species (4). Chanteraines rat population is not closed, allowing gene flow and making eradication programs challenging, particularly because rodenticide resistance is highly prevalent. Parasitological results showed that co-infection is more a rule than an exception. Furthermore, the presence of several potential zoonotic pathogens, of which four Leptospira species, in this urban rat population raised its role in the maintenance and spread of these pathogens.

Adolescents spend more time interacting with peers than any other age group and display heightened reward sensitivity, impulsivity and diminished inhibitory self-control, which contribute to increased risky behaviors, including the initiation and progression of alcohol use. Compared to adults, adolescents are less susceptible to the negative effects of ethanol, but are more susceptible to the negative effects of stress, particularly social stress. Juvenile exposure to social isolation or binge ethanol disrupts synaptic connections, dendritic spine morphology, and myelin remodeling in the frontal cortex.

RESULTS: We included a total of 1,935,827 TCM visits of patients from January 2017 to May 2020 in this study. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of patients decreased significantly, except in February 2020. The number of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic had fallen by more than 15% compared with those in the same months last year.

Performing patient-specific quality assurance (PSQA) is one of the most resource intensive and time-consuming tasks. With technological advancements in radiotherapy treatment planning and quality assurance, research towards measurement-free PSQA has become a focus within the field. Most of these techniques involve modeling the relationship between treatment plan complexity and corresponding PSQA outcomes. However, to our knowledge, none of these efforts have been assessed and prospectively validated for clinical use. We implemented and a machine learning-based virtual VMAT QA (VQA) workflow to assess the safety and workload reduction of measurement-free patient-specific QA at a multi-site institution in light of COVID-19. Materials and Methods An XGBoost machine learning model was trained and tuned to predict QA outcomes of VMAT plans, represented as percent differences between the planned dose and measured ion chamber point dose in a phantom. The model was developed using a dataset of 579 previous clinical VMAT plans and associated QA measurements from our institution. 30 classes of complexity features were extracted from each VMAT plan and used as input for the model, which was tuned using a grid search over learning rate and tree depth hyperparameters and evaluated with 10-fold cross-validation. The final model was implemented within a webbased VQA application to predict QA outcomes of clinical plans within our existing clinical workflow. The application also displays relevant plan-specific feature importance and nearest neighbor analyses relative to database plans for physicist evaluation and documentation (Figure 1). VQA predictions were prospectively validated over one month of measurements at our clinic to assess the safety and efficiency gains of clinical implementation. $g Results 147 VMAT plans were measured at our institution over the course of one month, taking an average of approximately 20 minutes per plan for QA. VQA predictions for these plans had a mean absolute error of 0.97 +/- 0.69%, with a maximum absolute error of 2.75% (Figure 2). Employing a prediction decision threshold of 1% - meaning plans with absolute predictions of less than 1% would not need measurements - would flag all plans that may have ion chamber disagreements greater than 4%. This translates to a 73% reduction in QA workload in terms of time. A more conservative implementation of this workflow, where all SBRT plans will continue to be measured, would still result in a 46% reduction in QA workload. $g Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first prospective clinical implementation and validation of VQA, which we observed to be safe and efficient. Using a conservative threshold, VQA can substantially reduce the number of required measurements for patient-specific QA, leading to a more effective allocation of clinical resources.","output":"Virtual VMAT QA prospective validation: towards measurement-free patient-specific quality assurance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The national health care response to coronavirus (COVID-19) has varied between countries.

Understanding why and how similarities and differences occurred in these two contexts could inform optimal care in normal circumstances, and during future crises. AIM: To compare the UK and Dutch COVID-19 maternity and neonatal care responses in three key domains: choice of birthplace, companionship, and families in vulnerable situations. METHOD: A multi-method study, including documentary analysis of national organisation policy and guidance on COVID-19, and interviews with national and regional stakeholders. FINDINGS: Both countries had an infection control focus, with less emphasis on the impact of restrictions, especially for families in vulnerable situations. Differences included care providers fear of contracting COVID-19; the extent to which community- and personalised care was embedded in the care system before the pandemic; and how far multidisciplinary collaboration and service-user involvement were prioritised. CONCLUSION: We recommend that countries should 1) make a systematic plan for crisis decision-making before a serious event occurs, and that this must include authentic service-user involvement, multidisciplinary collaboration, and protection of staff wellbeing 2) integrate womens and families values into the maternity and neonatal care system, ensuring equitable inclusion of the most vulnerable and 3) strengthen community provision to ensure system wide resilience to future shocks from pandemics, or other unexpected large-scale events.","output":"The United Kingdom and the Netherlands maternity care responses to COVID-19: a comparative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Video conferencing systems have been developed for a long time.

With the growing number of users of video conferencing systems, it is essential to be able to manage the system better. Even though Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has helped in handling the dynamic nature of video conferencing systems by providing the ability to deploy and/or remove virtual instances, being able to manage the virtual instances efficiently and optimally is a necessity. One of the main problems to be solved to achieve this goal is the auto-scaling problem. In this problem, an auto-scaling agent has to decide whether the number of a virtual instance type has to be increased, decreased, or maintained. In this paper, we designed and experimented a new auto-scaling algorithm by using Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. The experiment was done in both emulated and simulated environments. We then evaluated our proposed approach by comparing it with a threshold-based auto-scaler, the baseline algorithm. The results showed that the DQN-based auto-scaler performed better than the baseline algorithm, using fewer virtual instances with a better quality of service overall, as well as being more robust to shifting data distribution. Overall, the applications of DQN on auto-scaling algorithms for cost-effective and high-performance video conferencing systems are promising. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Machine Learning-Based Auto-Scaler for Video Conferencing Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New and emerging diseases present a constant challenge.

This single-center retrospective survey included all patients with STEMI admitted to our CPC from January 22, 2020 to April 30, 2020 (during COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan), compared with those admitted during the analogous period in 2019, in respect of important time points of PPCI and clinical outcomes of STEMI patients. In the present article, we observed a descending trend in STEMI hospitalization and a longer time from symptom onset to first medical contact during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the control period (4.35 h versus 2.58 h). With a median delay of 17 minutes in the door to balloon time (D2B), the proportion of in-hospital cardiogenic shock was significantly higher in the COVID-19 era group (47.6% versus 19.5%), and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) tend to increase in the 6-month follow-up period (14.3% versus 2.4%). Although the reorganization of CPC may prolong the D2B time, immediate revascularization of the infarct-related artery could be offered to most patients within 90 minutes upon arrival.

Despite calls to include older people in societal decision making, the extent to which older adults have participated in the pandemic-related public debate is unknown. This study investigated older adults (65+ years) voice and visibility as guests on political talk shows as an important arena of public debate. Specifically, we examined how often older adults appeared as guests, their characteristics, and how older versus younger guests discussed the pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Judges assessed all guests age, gender, migration experience, functional aids, and professional background on all episodes of the 4 most-watched political talk shows in Germany between January 1 to December 31, 2020 (N = 136 episodes, K = 754 guests). We used an exploratory sequential mixed-methods approach and frame analysis on all episodes featuring older guests (n = 37), to first identify how guests discussed the pandemic, and then assess differences in positions between older and younger guests (<65 years). RESULTS: Older guests rarely appeared (12.2% of all guests, 9.6% of guests on COVID-related episodes) and if they did, they were majorly male, young-old, German-born professionals with no functional aids. Rather than appearing as peer advocates of older adults, older guests framed the pandemic similarly to younger guests, with a tendency to more strongly address disproportionate restrictions of civil liberties in society. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Results suggest that one prominent part of German media failed to represent the diverse voice of a population most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Differences between how older and younger guests discussed the pandemic may reflect their privileged background in addition to generational differences in attitudes toward government. Future research in other social fora and of other social groups of older adults might facilitate understanding how older adults shaped the public debate on the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"(In)visible and (Un)heard?

A separate area of research also details that both poor oral health and food insecurity during pregnancy can have adverse consequences for maternal and infant well-being. The authors examine the connection between food insecurity and women's oral health care experiences during pregnancy. METHODS: Data from 2016 through 2019 came from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (N = 21,080). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between food insecurity and 6 indicators of oral health care experiences during pregnancy. RESULTS: Food-insecure women reported worse oral health care experiences during pregnancy, including being more likely to need to see a dentist for a problem, going to see a dentist for a problem, not receiving dental prophylaxis, not talking with an oral health care provider about dental health, not knowing it was important to care for teeth, and having unmet oral health care needs. CONCLUSIONS: Food-insecure women exhibit worse overall oral health outcomes and unmet oral health care needs during pregnancy. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Considering the risk that both food insecurity and oral health problems pose for maternal and infant health, interventions that can reduce food insecurity and improve oral health and oral health care access among pregnant women are important steps in promoting greater health equity.","output":"Food insecurity and oral health care experiences during pregnancy: Findings from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Longstanding discordances and enigmas persist as to the specificities and other properties of antibodies (Abs) most effective in preventing or limiting many viral infections in mammals; in turn, failure to decipher key complexities has added to headwinds for both Ab-based therapeutic approaches and rational vaccine design.

Because individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of severe COVID19, we determined whether ACE2 expression in the lower airways was related to COPD and cigarette smoking. Methods: Using RNAseq, we determined gene expression levels in bronchial epithelia obtained from cytologic brushings of 6th to 8th generation airways in individuals with and without COPD. We externally validated these results from two additional independent cohorts, which used microarray technologies to measure gene expression levels from 6th to 12th generation airways. Results: In the discovery cohort (n=42 participants), we found that ACE2 expression levels were increased by 48% in the airways of COPD compared with non-COPD subjects (COPD=2.52 (0.66) log2 counts per million reads (CPM) versus non-COPD= 1.70 (0.51) CPM , p=.000762). There was a significant inverse relationship between ACE2 gene expression and FEV1% of predicted (r=negative 0.24; p=0.035).

The movement protein (MP) of Ourmia melon virus (OuMV) is targeted to plasmodesmata (PD) and forms tubules to facilitate cell-to-cell movement. Despite a number of functionally important regions for correct subcellular localization of OuMV MP has been identified, little is known about the pathways OuMV MP hijacks to reach PD. Here, we demonstrate that OuMV MP localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but not to the multivesicular body/prevacuolar compartment or Golgi, and carries two putative sorting motifs, a tyrosine (Y) and a dileucine (LL) motif, near its N-terminus. Introducing glycine substitutions in these motifs results in loss of OuMV infectivity in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Live cell imaging of GFP-labeled sorting motif mutants shows that Y motif mutants fail to localize to the TGN, plasma membrane, and PD. Mutations in the LL motif do not impair plasma membrane targeting of MP, but affect its ability to associate with callose deposits at PD. Taken together, these data suggest that both Y and LL motifs are indispensable for targeting of OuMV MP to PD and for efficient systemic infection, but show differences in functionality. This study provides new insights into the role of sorting motifs in intracellular targeting of MPs and vesicle trafficking pathways that plant viruses hijack for cell-to-cell movement.","output":"The role of post-Golgi transport pathways and sorting motifs in the plasmodesmal targeting of the movement protein (MP) of Ourmia melon virus (OuMV)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CD28 is recognized as the primary costimulatory molecule involved in the activation of na?ve T cells.

It is a molecular level analysis based on the existing experimental validation. METHOD: Computer-aided drug designing techniques such as molecular modelling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to determine the consequential effects of the two point mutations. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that the two mutations led to a decrease in the overall stability of IL11. This was evident by the increased atomic fluctuations in the mutated regions as well as the corresponding elevation in the deviations seen through RMSD and Rg values. It was also accompanied by a loss in the secondary structural organisation in the mutated proteins. Moreover, mutation R135E led to an increase in the binding affinity of IL11 with IL11R and the formation of a more stable complex in comparison to the wild-type protein with its receptor.

For hand hygiene during healthcare interactions, lower compliance was seen among nonclinical staff [OR (odds ratio): 0.43; 95% CI (Confidence interval): 0.21-0.89], and healthcare workers with secondary level qualification (OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.08-0.71). Midwives (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.09-0.93) and Pharmacists (OR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.02-0.92) compliance with hand hygiene was significantly lower than registered nurses. For PPE usage during healthcare interactions, lower compliance was seen among healthcare workers who were separated/divorced/widowed (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01-0.43), those with secondary level qualifications (OR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01-0.43), non-clinical staff (OR 0.16 95% CI 0.07-0.35), cleaners (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.05-0.52), pharmacists (OR: 0.07; 95% CI: 0.01-0.49) and among healthcare workers who reported of insufficiency of PPEs (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.14-0.77). Generally, healthcare workers' infection prevention and control compliance were high, but this compliance differs across the different groups of health professionals in the treatment centers. Ensuring an adequate supply of IPC logistics coupled with behavior change interventions and paying particular attention to nonclinical staff is critical in minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the treatment centers.","output":"Infection prevention and control compliance among exposed healthcare workers in COVID-19 treatment centers in Ghana: A descriptive cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new challenge has immerged in the form of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in worldwide.

However, the role of caspase-1/11 in the recovery of muscle from ischemia caused by peripheral arterial disease is unknown. We hypothesized that caspase-1/11 mediates recovery in muscle via effects on autophagy and this is modulated by CQ. METHODS: C57Bl/6 J (WT) and caspase-1/11 double-knockout (KO) mice underwent femoral artery ligation (a model of hind-limb ischemia) with or without CQ (50 mg/kg IP every 2nd day). CQ effects on autophagosome formation, microtubule associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3), and caspase-1 expression was measured using electron microscopy and immunofluorescence. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging documented perfusion every 7 days. After 21 days, in situ physiologic testing in tibialis anterior muscle assessed peak force contraction, and myocyte size and fibrosis was also measured. Muscle satellite cell (MuSC) oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate was measured. Caspase-1 and glycolytic enzyme expression was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: CQ increased autophagosomes, LC3 consolidation, total caspase-1 expression and cleaved caspase-1 in muscle. Perfusion, fibrosis, myofiber regeneration, muscle contraction, MuSC fusion, OCR, ECAR and glycolytic enzyme expression was variably affected by CQ depending on presence of caspase-1/11. CQ decreased perfusion recovery, fibrosis and myofiber size in WT but not caspase-1/11KO mice. CQ diminished peak force in whole muscle, and myocyte fusion in MuSC and these effects were exacerbated in caspase-1/11KO mice. CQ reductions in maximal respiration and ATP production were reduced in caspase-1/11KO mice. Caspase-1/11KO MuSC had significant increases in protein kinase isoforms and aldolase with decreased ECAR. CONCLUSION: Caspase-1/11 signaling affects the response to ischemia in muscle and effects are variably modulated by CQ. This may be critically important for disease treated with CQ and its derivatives, including novel viral diseases (e.g. COVID-19) that are expected to affect patients with comorbidities like cardiovascular disease.","output":"Caspase1/11 signaling affects muscle regeneration and recovery following ischemia, and can be modulated by chloroquine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinicians should use a systematic approach to evaluating patients presenting with a concern for cognitive impairment.

DESIGN: This was a multicentre retrospective cross-sectional descriptive study. SETTING: The medical records generated in three temporary military hospitals in Wuhan. PARTICIPANTS: Medical records of 2702 inpatients generated from 5 February to 5 April 2020 were randomly selected for this study. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: DWs of COVID-19 symptoms were determined by the person trade-off approach. The inpatients' medical records were analysed and used to calculate the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The mean DALY was evaluated across sex and age groups. The relationship between DALY and age, sex, body mass index, length of hospital stay, symptom duration before admission and native place was determined by multiple linear regression. RESULTS: For the DALY of each inpatient, severe expiratory dyspnoea, mild cough and sore throat had the highest (0.399) and lowest (0.004) weights, respectively. The average synthetic DALY and daily DALY were 2.291.33 and 0.180.15 days, respectively. Fever and fatigue contributed the most DALY at 31.36%, whereas nausea and vomiting and anxiety and depression contributed the least at 7.05%. There were significant differences between sex and age groups in both synthetic and daily DALY. Age, body mass index, length of hospital stay and symptom duration before admission were strongly related to both synthetic and daily DALY.

However, the under-reporting of cases is widespread in fields associated with public health.

Therefore, in this paper, a novel framework was proposed to explore the impact of under-reporting on COVID-19 spatiotemporal distributions, and empirical analysis was carried out using infection data of healthcare workers in Wuhan and Hubei (excluding Wuhan). The results show that (1) the lognormal distribution was the most suitable to describe the evolution of epidemic with time; (2) the estimated peak infection time of the reported cases lagged the peak infection time of the healthcare worker cases, and the estimated infection time interval of the reported cases was smaller than that of the healthcare worker cases. (3) The impact of under-reporting cases on the early stages of the pandemic was greater than that on its later stages, and the impact on the early onset area was greater than that on the late onset area. (4) Although the number of reported cases was lower than the actual number of cases, a high spatial correlation existed between the cumulatively reported cases and healthcare worker cases.

Particularly, we focus on the accuracy and timeliness of knowledge dissemination on COVID-19 among people in remote regionsa topic largely omitted in existing research. In February 2020, at the early-stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, a questionnaire survey was carried out. In total, 8,520 participants from seven less economically developed provinces situated in the borderlands of China with large ethnic minority groups responded.

OBJECTIVE to assess the utility of the basophil activation test (BAT) to predict the allergic status and reduce the need for OFC in children with one or more nut or seed allergies. METHODS Participants in the Pronuts study recruited at the Geneva and the London centers were tested on the BAT to hazelnut, cashew nut, sesame, almond and peanut, Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 6, using FlowCAST, a commercially available BAT kit, and flow cytometry. RESULTS The BAT to hazelnut, cashew nut, sesame, almond and peanut discriminated between allergic and non-allergic children, to the respective nut or seed. The optimal allergen concentration and their optimal, positive and negative cut-offs were identified for BAT and the other tests, for each nut and seed. Using BAT as a second step in the diagnostic process, following equivocal skin prick test and IgE to extracts and components, reduced the number of total OFCs by 5-15% and of positive OFC by 33-75% (except for hazelnut) with 0% false-negatives and a diagnostic accuracy of 96-100%.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a machine learning model that predicts the need for intensive care for patients with COVID-19 using easily obtainable characteristicsbaseline demographics, comorbidities, and symptoms. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed using a nationwide cohort in South Korea. Patients admitted to 100 hospitals from January 25, 2020, to June 3, 2020, were included. Patient information was collected retrospectively by the attending physicians in each hospital and uploaded to an online case report form. Variables that could be easily provided were extracted. The variables were age, sex, smoking history, body temperature, comorbidities, activities of daily living, and symptoms. The primary outcome was the need for intensive care, defined as admission to the intensive care unit, use of extracorporeal life support, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or death within 30 days of hospitalization. Patients admitted until March 20, 2020, were included in the derivation group to develop prediction models using an automated machine learning technique. The models were externally validated in patients admitted after March 21, 2020. The machine learning model with the best discrimination performance was selected and compared against the CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and 65 years of age or older) score using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: A total of 4787 patients were included in the analysis, of which 3294 were assigned to the derivation group and 1493 to the validation group. Among the 4787 patients, 460 (9.6%) patients needed intensive care. Of the 55 machine learning models developed, the XGBoost model revealed the highest discrimination performance. The AUC of the XGBoost model was 0.897 (95% CI 0.877-0.917) for the derivation group and 0.885 (95% CI 0.855-0.915) for the validation group.

This study explores the cytotoxicity of IVM in human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms. The results show that IVM treatment (2.5C15 M) for 24 h could induce dose-dependent cell death in SH-SY5Y cells. Compared to the control, IVM treatment significantly promoted the production of ROS, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell apoptosis. IVM treatment also promoted mitophagy and autophagy, which were charactered by the decreased expression of phosphorylation (p)-Akt and p-mTOR proteins, increased expression of LC3II, Beclin1, ATG5, PINK, and Pakin1 proteins and autophagosome formation. N-acetylcysteine treatment significantly inhibited the IVM-induced production of ROS and cell death in SH-SY5Y cells. Autophagy inhibitor (e.g., 3-methyladenine) treatment significantly inhibited IVM-induced autophagy, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis.

This study investigates a) inconsistencies between scientific peer-reviewed health services research (HSR) publications and non-scientific societal publications and b) replication of reporting inadequacies from these scientific publications to corresponding societal publications. METHODS: A sample of HSR publications was drawn from 116 publications authored in 2016 by thirteen Dutch HSR institutions. Societal publications corresponding to scientific publications were identified through a systematic internet search. We conducted a qualitative, directed content analysis on societal publications derived from the scientific publications to assess both reporting inadequacies and determine inconsistencies. Descriptive frequencies were calculated for all variables. Odds ratios were used to investigate whether inconsistencies in societal publications were less likely when the first scientific author was involved. RESULTS: We identified 43 scientific and 156 societal publications. 94 societal publications (60.3%), (associated with 32 scientific publications (74.4%)) contained messages that were inconsistent with the scientific work. We found reporting inadequacies in 22 scientific publications (51.2%). In 45 societal publications (28.9%), we found replications of these reporting inadequacies.

METHODS: Patients hospitalized at two quaternary care facilities, New York Presbyterian Hospital (CUIMC/NYPH) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), for SARS-CoV-2 infection between February and May 2020 were included. Five independent biomarkers were identified as mediators of sex effects, including high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTNT), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, and creatinine. RESULTS: In the CUIMC/NYPH cohort (n = 2,626, 43% female), male sex was associated with significantly greater mortality (26 vs. 21%, p = 0.0146) and higher peak hs-cTNT, hs-CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, and creatinine (p < 0.001). The effect of male sex on the primary outcome of death was partially mediated by peak values of all five biomarkers, suggesting that each pathophysiological pathway may contribute to increased risk of death in men. Hs-cTnT, creatinine, and hs-CRP were the strongest mediators. Findings were highly consistent in the MGH cohort with the exception of D-dimer. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the effect of sex on COVID-19 outcomes is mediated by cardiac and kidney injury, as well as underlying differences in inflammation and iron metabolism. Exploration of these specific pathways may facilitate sex-directed diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for patients with COVID-19 and provides a framework for the study of sex differences in other complex diseases.","output":"Biomarkers of Cardiac Injury, Renal Injury, and Inflammation Are Strong Mediators of Sex-Associated Death in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motivation: With the coronavirus pandemic still raging, prophylactic nasal and early treatment throat sprays that put the virus in lockdown, could help prevent infection and reduce viral load. Niclosamide has the potential to treat a broad range of viral infections if local bioavailability is optimized as mucin-penetrating solutions instead of microparticles that cannot penetrate the mucin. Experimental: pH-dependence of supernatant concentrations and dissolution rates of niclosamide were measured in buffered solutions by Nanodrop-UV/Vis-spectroscopy for niclosamide from different suppliers, as precipitated material and as cosolvates. Data was compared to predictions from Henderson Hasselbalch and precipitation pH models. Optimal microscopy was used to observe the morphologies of precipitated and converted niclosamide. Results: Supernatant-concentrations of niclosamide increased with increasing pH: from 1.77uM at pH 3.66 to 30uM at pH 8; more rapidly from 90uM at pH8.5 to 300uM at pH9.1, reaching 641uM at pH 9.5. Logarithmic rates for dissolution increased by ~3x for pHs 8.62 to 9.44. However, when precipitated from supersaturated solution, niclosamide equilibrated to much lower final supernatant concentrations, reflective of more stable polymorphs at each pH that were also apparent for niclosamide from other suppliers and cosolvates. Conclusions: Niclosamide is not niclosamide is not niclosamide. A low dose (20uM) prophylactic solution of niclosamide at a nasally safe pH of 7.9 and a (up to 300uM) throat spray at pH 9.1 would be one of the simplest and potentially most effective formulations from both an efficacy standpoint as well as manufacturing and distribution, with no cold chain. It now needs testing. Executive Summary Motivation: With the coronavirus pandemic still raging, more contagious (delta and delta+) variants already in circulation (1), a world-wide average of only 15.4% fully vaccinated (2), and many parts of the world with <1% vaccinated (3), there is still an urgent need for additional mitigation efforts to support current and potential vaccinations. A prophylactic nasal spray and an early treatment throat spray that put the virus in lockdown, could help to prevent infection and reduce viral load in the early stages for unvaccinated populations, as well as vaccinated spreaders where break through infections are now occurring. Niclosamide has emerged from multiple drug screens with potential to treat cancer and many other diseases and conditions (4), and now in a broad range of viral infections (5C20). At the cellular level, niclosamide can inhibit three of the six stages of viral infection by: preventing uncoating and RNA release from the endosome (18); inhibiting viral replication by reducing the amount of ATP available from mitochondria needed for ATP-dependent viral transcription and translation (10); and interfering with capsid assembly in the Golgi that then promotes the secretion of non-competent virions (21). The main issue for nose and throat formulations, is how to optimize local bioavailability for a drug that has intrinsic low solubility in aqueous solution (1-2uM) compared to its cellular efficacy (2-3uM) and the fact that the traditional choice for nasal sprays of microparticles cannot penetrate the mucin. It is here that we have focused on what it takes to provide a mucin-penetrating niclosamide solution. We have found a way to increase the amount of niclosamide in aqueous buffered solution and therefore its bioavailability to infectable and infected epithelial cells, just by slightly increasing the pH (22). Experimental: Experimentation focused on a series of specific aims that measured the pH-dependence of equilibrium supernatant concentrations and dissolution rates of niclosamide in buffered solutions. We compared niclosamide from different suppliers as well as precipitated niclosamide and presumed cosolvates of acetone and ethanol. Nanodrop UV/Vis spectroscopy was used to quantify niclosamide concentrations in supernatant solutions and data was compared to predictions from Henderson Hasselbalch and precipitation pH models. Optimal microscopy was used to observe the morphologies of precipitated and converted niclosamide. Results: When excess powdered niclosamide was dissolved in pH buffers, the supernatant concentration of niclosamide increased slowly with pH from 1.77uM at pH 3.66 to 30uM at pH 8. It then showed a more rapid rise in concentration to 90uM at 8.5 to 300uM at 9.1, reaching 641uM at pH 9.5. In dissolution experiments, the logarithmic rate for niclosamide dissolution over a pH range from 8.62 to 9.44 increased by a factor of just over 3x. A more optimized stirring gave a further increased rate of niclosamide dissolution as expected from dissolution models. However, when precipitated from supersaturated solution, niclosamide equilibrated to much lower final supernatant niclosamide concentrations, reflective of more stable polymorphs at each pH. While niclosamide from one supplier (AKSci), readily dissolved and remained as a stable solution, even in contact with the excess solid, that from another supplier (Sigma) converted to a much lower solubility polymorph over a period of the next several hours. Conclusions: In the preparation of any formulation of niclosamide, especially for local nasal and throat delivery, niclosamide is not niclosamide is not niclosamide; the source and nature of niclosamide can dramatically influence the solubility, amount in solution, bioavailability, and pharmaceutical performance of the drug compound. A low dose (20uM) prophylactic solution of niclosamide at a nasally safe pH of 7.9 and a (up to 300uM) throat spray at pH 9.1 would be one of the simplest and potentially most effective formulations from both an efficacy standpoint as well as manufacturing and distribution, with no cold chain.

At the end, the clinical relevance and market value of RNA-based liquid biopsy are explored and discussed with respect to the field of precision medicine. ABSTRACT: There is unequivocal acceptance of the variety of enormous potential liquid nucleic acid-based diagnostics seems to offer. However, the existing controversies and the increased awareness of RNA-based techniques in society during the current global COVID-19 pandemic have made the readiness of liquid nucleic acid-based diagnostics for routine use a matter of concern. In this regardand in the context of oncologyour review presented and discussed the status quo of RNA-based liquid diagnostics. We summarized the technical background of the available assays and benchmarked their applicability against each other. Herein, we compared the technology readiness level in the clinical context, economic aspects, implementation as part of routine point-of-care testing as well as performance power. Since the preventive care market is the most promising application sector, we also investigated whether the developments predominantly occur in the context of early disease detection or surveillance of therapy success. In addition, we provided a careful view on the current biotechnology investment activities in this sector to indicate the most attractive strategies for future economic success.

Analysis of social engagements can therefore provide insights to understand the motivation behind how and why users engage with others in different activities. In this study, we aim to understand the driving factors behind four engagement types in Twitter, namely like, reply, retweet, and quote. We extensively analyze a diverse set of features that reflect user behaviors, as well as tweet attributes and semantics by natural language processing, including a deep learning language model, BERT. The performance of these features is assessed in a supervised task of engagement prediction by learning social engagements from over 14 million multilingual tweets. In the light of our experimental results, we find that users would engage with tweets based on text semantics and contents regardless of tweet author, yet popular and trusted authors could be important for reply and quote. Users who actively liked and retweeted in the past are likely to maintain this type of behavior in the future, while this trend is not seen in more complex types of engagements, reply, and quote. Moreover, users do not necessarily follow the behavior of other users with whom they have previously engaged.

Articles were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria after duplicates were removed. Infection rate, maternal antibody response, placental antibody transfer, and adverse events were described. This systematic review was performed with quality assessment and semi-quantitative synthesis according to PRISMA guidelines. ResultsTwelve observational studies with a total of 40.509 pregnant women included. The mRNA based vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) can prevent future SARS-CoV-2 infections (p=0.0004). Both vaccines did not affect pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes. The most commonly encountered adverse reactions are injection-site pain, fatigue, and headache but only transient. Antibody responses were rapid after the prime dose of vaccines. After booster, antibody responses were higher and associated with better placental antibody transfer.

SARS-CoV-2 is disseminated by respiratory aerosols. The virus uses the spike protein to target epithelial cells by binding to the ACE2 receptor on the host cells. As a result, effective vaccines must target the viral spike glycoprotein. However, the appearance of an Omicron variant with 32 mutations in its spike protein raises questions about the vaccines efficacy. Vaccines are critical in boosting immunity, lowering COVID-19-related illnesses, reducing the infectious burden on the healthcare system, and reducing economic loss, according to current data. An efficient vaccination campaign is projected to increase innate and adaptive immune responses, offering better protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants. MAIN BODY: The presence of altered SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating around the world puts the effectiveness of vaccines already on the market at risk. The problem is made even worse by the Omicron variant, which has 32 mutations in its spike protein. Experts are currently examining the potential consequences of commercial vaccines on variants. However, there are worries about the vaccines safety, the protection they provide, and whether future structural changes are required for these vaccines to be more effective. As a result of these concerns, new vaccines based on modern technology should be developed to guard against the growing SARS-CoV-2 variations. CONCLUSION: The choice of a particular vaccine is influenced by several factors including mode of action, storage conditions, group of the vaccinee, immune response mounted, cost, dosage protocol, age, and side effects. Currently, seven SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platforms have been developed. This comprises of inactivated viruses, messenger RNA (mRNA), DNA vaccines, protein subunits, nonreplicating and replicating vector viral-like particles (VLP), and live attenuated vaccines.

Furthermore, stronger increases in boredom across the semester were negatively associated with SCH scores and GH. In conclusion, given that boredom is negatively linked with HRQoL and that stronger boredom growth is linked with more severe health-related problems, signs of academic boredom could be an early warning signal for adolescents potentially severe problems.","output":"Boredom Makes Me Sick: Adolescents Boredom Trajectories and Their Health-Related Quality of Life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organizations characterized by a climate and culture of competition and overwork facilitate the emergence of the workaholism phenomenon, as they provide favorable conditions for employees to spend more time in the workplace.

An innovative and promising therapeutic intervention is perturbation-based balance training (PBT). OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review to summarise the current evidence for PBT on postural control and gait in people with PD. Intervention studies including PBT, in isolation or associated with other physical interventions, were included. LITERATURE SURVEY: PubMed, SciELO, PEDro and Cochrane databases were searched between June 2000 and March 2020. METHODS: This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, and is registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020203961). The quality of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Studies were assessed for methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Two of the authors reviewed the search results and selected studies using predefined selection criteria. No restrictions based on severity of PD, time since diagnosis or age were used. SYNTHESIS: Eleven studies were selected for final evaluation. Most outcomes were downgraded in quality of evidence, mainly because of publication bias and limitations. The most consistent results indicate that PBT can improve postural control and gait in people with PD, including a reduction in the number of falls and a decrease in the severity of PD. CONCLUSION: PBT may be a promising option for the treatment of people with PD, and an adjunct to conventional physiotherapeutic treatment. However, deficiencies in the methodological quality and quality of evidence of studies included in this review have limited the reliability of the conclusions.

Similar to other high-income countries, Australia has extensively used telehealth services. Virtual health care, including telemedicine in combination with remote patient monitoring, has been implemented in certain settings as part of new models of care that are aimed at managing patients with COVID-19 outside the hospital setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the implementation of and early experience with virtual health care for community management of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This observational cohort study was conducted with patients with COVID-19 who availed of a large Australian metropolitan health service with an established virtual health care program capable of monitoring patients remotely. We included patients with COVID-19 who received the health service, could self-isolate safely, did not require immediate admission to an in-patient setting, had no major active comorbid illness, and could be managed at home or at other suitable sites. Skin temperature, pulse rate, and blood oxygen saturation were remotely monitored. The primary outcome measures were care escalation rates, including emergency department presentation, and hospital admission. RESULTS: During March 11-29, 2020, a total of 162 of 173 (93.6%) patients with COVID-19 (median age 38 years, range 11-79 years), who were diagnosed locally, were enrolled in the virtual health care program. For 62 of 162 (38.3%) patients discharged during this period, the median length of stay was 8 (range 1-17) days. The peak of 100 prevalent patients equated to approximately 25 patients per registered nurse per shift. Patients were contacted a median of 16 (range 1-30) times during this period. Video consultations (n=1902, 66.3%) comprised most of the patient contacts, and 132 (81.5%) patients were monitored remotely. Care escalation rates were low, with an ambulance attendance rate of 3% (n=5), emergency department attendance rate of 2.5% (n=4), and hospital admission rate of 1.9% (n=3). No deaths were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Community-based virtual health care is safe for managing most patients with COVID-19 and can be rapidly implemented in an urban Australian setting for pandemic management. Health services implementing virtual health care should anticipate challenges associated with rapid technology deployments and provide adequate support to resolve them, including strategies to support the use of health information technologies among consumers.","output":"Virtual Health Care for Community Management of Patients With COVID-19 in Australia: Observational Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis has resulted in a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE).

We identified and assessed 78 patients who underwent 2- and 3-dimensional echocardiography-guided mini-invasive per-atrial closure of pmVSD in the cardiac surgery department of our institution, from February 2016 to August 2018, and 76 patients who underwent transcatheter closure of VSD guided by fluoroscopy at the pediatric department (percutaneous control group). All the patients underwent echocardiography. Their clinical data were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. All patients were followed up using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for a maximum of 24 months after the closure. All patients underwent successful device implantation. Echocardiography showed that the major immediate complications included residual shunt, pericardial effusion, and tricuspid regurgitation in the per-atrial group. During the mid-term follow-up period, TTE revealed that the most common complication was tricuspid regurgitation (non-preexisting). There were no cases of VSD recurrence, device displacement, valvular injury, malignant arrhythmias, hemolysis, or death. Moreover, according to the TTE data, the intracardiac structure of the patients were improved. Compared to the control group, the intracardiac manipulation time was shorter and the number of patients with residual shunts, redeployment of devices, or immediate new tricuspid regurgitations was fewer when using 2- and 3-dimensional echocardiography. However, the procedure time in the per-atrial group was slightly longer than that in the control group. Two- and 3-dimensional echocardiography are feasible monitoring tools during mini-invasive per-atrial VSD closure.

Methods: A cross sectional survey (Nordic musculoskeletal) was used to estimate the prevalence of LMSDs among BMSs. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science software version 25. Chi square was performed to find the significant association between LMSDs and different risk factors. Results: The study included 83 BMSs. Females represented 63.9% and 36.1% were in the age group of 35 to 44. The overall prevalence of LMSDs was 77.1%. The most prevalent LMSDs were neck, shoulders, and lower back with 50.6%, 49.4%, and 43.4%, respectively. Neck complaints and upper back complaints were found statistically significant with the female gender. Shoulders complaints were associated with pipetting and microscopy. Lower back complaints were associated with pipetting and heavy work at home. A total of 65.57% of BMSs had irregular symptoms of LMSDs, 54.10% experienced moderate pain due to these symptoms, and 44.26% had symptoms that persisted from hours to days.

It is of great importance for human health worldwide to predict the possible virus mutations, which can effectively avoid the potential second outbreak. In this work, we develop a GAN-based multi-class protein sequence generative model, named ProteinSeqGAN. Given the viral species, the generator is modeled on RNNs to predict the corresponding antigen epitope sequences synthesized by viral genomes. Additionally, a Graphical Protein Autoencoder (GProAE) built upon VAE is proposed to featurize proteins bioinformatically. GProAE, as a multi-class discriminator, also learns to evaluate the goodness of protein sequences and predict the corresponding viral species.

The viral load obtained was correlative with the number of COVID-19 patients being treated in the hospital. Targeted wastewater-based sequencing over time demonstrated that nonsynonymous mutations fluctuate in the viral population. Clades and shifts in mutation profiles within the community were monitored and could be used to determine if vaccine or diagnostics need to be adapted to ensure continued efficacy.

Because this process takes time, speciation studies often necessarily examine populations within a species that are at various stages of divergence. The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E.

Depending on their fitness, these mutants either become extinct or thrive, spawning variants that escape the immune system. The most important SARS-CoV-2 mutations are those that alter the amino acid sequence in the viral S protein because this protein holds the key for the virus to enter the human cell. The more viruses replicate, the more they mutate, and the more likely it is that dominant resistant variants will appear. In such cases, more stringent measures for community protection will be required. Vaccines and polyclonal antibodies, which induce a response directed towards several sites along the S protein, would maintain effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Furthermore, vaccines appear to induce an increased helper and cytotoxic T-cell response, which may also be a biomarker of protection. In densely populated areas with insufficient protection measures, the virus spreads freely, thus increasing the likelihood of generating escape mutants. India and Manaus exemplify this situation. Natural evolution selects the mutants that multiply most efficiently without eliminating the host, thus facilitating their spread. Contrastingly, the circulation of viruses of high virulence and lethality (Ebola, hantavirus) that eliminate the host remain limited to certain geographic areas, without further dissemination.

METHODS: The study included 602 patients with stable coronary artery disease (490 males, 57.7  7.3 years) who had received CABG and were divided into two groups: patients with type D personality (n = 134) and patients without type D (n = 468). The risk of fatal and nonfatal events within 5 years after CABG was assessed. RESULTS: There was no difference in total mortality in patients with type D and without type D (7.9% and 7.7%, respectively) over the 5-year period. The absence of cardiac events was detected much less frequently in patients with type D (28%) compared with patients without type D (82%; p = 0.021).

Previously, we identified the murine CTLDcp Cd302 as restriction factor, limiting hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection of murine hepatocytes. In this study, we investigated in detail the human orthologues ability to restrict HCV infection in human liver cells. CD302 overexpression in Huh-7.5 cells potently inhibited infection of diverse HCV chimeras representing seven genotypes. Transcriptional profiling revealed abundant CD302 mRNA expression in human hepatocytes, the natural cellular target of HCV. Knockdown of endogenously expressed CD302 modestly enhanced HCV infection of Huh-7.5 cells and primary human hepatocytes. Functional analysis of naturally occurring CD302 transcript variants and engineered CD302 mutants showed that the C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) is essential for HCV restriction, whereas the cytoplasmic domain (CPD) is dispensable. Coding single nucleotide polymorphisms occurring in human populations and mapping to different domains of CD302 did not influence the capacity of CD302 to restrict HCV. Assessment of the anti-HCV phenotype at different life cycle stages indicated that CD302 preferentially targets the viral entry step. In contrast to the murine orthologue, overexpression of human CD302 did not modulate downstream expression of nuclear receptor-controlled genes. Ectopic CD302 expression restricted infection of liver tropic hepatitis E virus (HEV), while it did not affect infection rates of two respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the alpha coronavirus HVCoV-229E. Together, these findings suggest that CD302 contributes to liver cell-intrinsic defense against HCV and might mediate broader antiviral defenses against additional hepatotropic viruses. IMPORTANCE The liver represents an immunoprivileged organ characterized by enhanced resistance to immune responses. However, the importance of liver cell-endogenous, noncytolytic innate immune responses in pathogen control is not well defined. Although the role of myeloid cell-expressed CTLDcps in host responses to viruses has been characterized in detail, we have little information about their potential functions in the liver and their relevance for immune responses in this organ. Human hepatocytes endogenously express the CTLDcp CD302. Here, we provide evidence that CD302 limits HCV infection of human liver cells, likely by inhibiting a viral cell entry step.

De novo CaBP4 variants have been identified as a cause of congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB). However, we recently reported a 4-generation pedigree with 11 individuals diagnosed with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) that were validated with only one novel missense mutation, c.464G>A (p.G155D), in CaBP4. De novo CaBP4 variants have never been reported to be related with ADNFLE. This study aimed to identify whether c.464G>A (p.G155D) in CaBP4 reduced the expression of CaBP4. Methods: In vitro experiments using recombinant protein expressed in human neuron cells were utilized in this study. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to evaluate the effect of c.464G>A on CaBP4 mRNA expression. Western blot was performed to assess the effect of c.464G>A on CaBP4 protein expression. Results: According to the RT-PCR and Western blot results, c.464G>A (p.G155D) was associated with an increased expression of CaBP4 mRNA and a reduced expression of CaBP4 protein.

Even though the VA was an early adopter of telehealth in the late 1990s, the vast majority of VA outpatient care continued to be face-to-face visits through February 2020. OBJECTIVE: We compared telehealth service use at a VA Medical Center, Greater Los Angeles across 3 clinics (primary care [PC], cardiology, and home-based primary care [HBPC]) 12 months before and 12 months after the onset of COVID-19 (March 2020). METHODS: We used a parallel mixed methods approach including simultaneous quantitative and qualitative approaches. The distribution of monthly outpatient and telehealth visits, as well as telephone and VA Video Connect encounters were examined for each clinic. Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with 34 staff involved in telehealth services within PC, cardiology, and HBPC during COVID-19. All audiotaped interviews were transcribed and analyzed by identifying key themes. RESULTS: Prior to COVID-19, telehealth use was minimal at all 3 clinics, but at the onset of COVID-19, telehealth use increased substantially at all 3 clinics. Telephone was the main modality of patient choice. Compared with PC and cardiology, video-based care had the greatest increase in HBPC. Several important barriers (multiple steps for videoconferencing, creation of new scheduling grids, and limited access to the internet and internet-connected devices) and facilitators (flexibility in using different video-capable platforms, technical support for patients, identification of staff telehealth champions, and development of workflows to help incorporate telehealth into treatment plans) were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Technological issues must be addressed at the forefront of telehealth evolution to achieve access for all patient populations with different socioeconomic backgrounds, living situations and locations, and health conditions. The unprecedented expansion of telehealth during COVID-19 provides opportunities to create lasting telehealth solutions to improve access to care beyond the pandemic.","output":"Implementation of Telehealth Services at the US Department of Veterans Affairs During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundTherapeutically immunosuppressed transplant recipients exhibit attenuated responses to COVID-19 vaccines. To better understand the immune alterations that determined poor vaccine response, we correlated quantities of circulating T and B cell subsets at baseline with longitudinal serologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in heart and lung transplant recipients. MethodsSamples at baseline and at approximately 8 and 30 days after each vaccine dose for 22 heart and lung transplant recipients with no history of COVID-19, four heart and lung transplant recipients with prior COVID-19 infection, and 12 healthy controls undergoing vaccination were analyzed. Anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and pseudovirus neutralization activity were measured. Proportions of B and T cell subsets at baseline were comprehensively quantitated. ResultsAt 8-30 days post vaccination, healthy controls displayed robust anti-RBD IgG responses, whereas heart and lung transplant recipients showed minimally increased responses. A parallel absence of activity was observed in pseudovirus neutralization. In contrast, three of four (75%) transplant recipients with prior COVID-19 infection displayed robust responses at levels comparable to controls. Baseline levels of activated PD-1+ HLA-DR+ CXCR5- CD4+ T cells (also known as T peripheral helper [TPH] cells) and CD4+ T cells strongly predicted the ability to mount a response. ConclusionsImmunosuppressed patients have defective vaccine responses but can be induced to generate neutralizing antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Diabetes mellitus is associated with severity and lethal outcomes up to death independent of other comorbidities. Nevertheless, information regarding the determinant factors that contributed to the increased mortality among diabetic COVID-19 patients is limited. Thus, this study aimed at identifying the determinants of mortality among COVID-19 infected diabetic patients. Methods: An unmatched case-control study was conducted on 340 randomly selected patients by reviewing patient records. Data were collected using a structured extraction checklist, entered into Epi data V-4.4.2.2, and analyzed using SPSS V-25. Then, binary logistic regression was used for bivariate and multivariable analysis. Finally, an adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI and a p-value of less than 0.05 was used to determine the strength of association and the presence of a statistical significance consecutively. Results: The study was conducted on 340 COVID-19 patients (114 case and 226 controls). Patient age (AOR=4.90; 95% CI: 2.13, 11.50), severity of COVID-19 disease (AOR=4.95; 95% CI: 2.20, 11.30), obesity (AOR=7.78; 95% CI: 4.05, 14.90), hypertension (AOR=5.01; 95% CI: 2.40, 10.60), anemia at presentation (AOR=2.93; 95% CI: 1.29, 6.65), and AKI after hospital admission (AOR=2.80; 95% CI: 1.39, 5.64) had statistically significant association with increased mortality of diabetic patients with COVID-19 infection. Conversely, presence of RVI co-infection was found to be protective against mortality (AOR=0.35; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.90). Conclusion: Patient age (<65years), COVID-19 disease severity (mild and moderate illness), presence of hypertension, obesity, anemia at admission, and AKI on admission was independently associated with increased mortality of diabetic COVID-19 patients. Contrariwise, the presence of RVI co-infection was found to be protective against patient death.

Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines using three databases (PubMed, Ovid, and Embase). English-language publications describing results on complication rates in patients who underwent TSA in an outpatient or ambulatory setting were included. All nonclinical and deidentified database studies were excluded. Bias assessment was conducted with the methodologic index for nonrandomized studies criteria. Results Seven studies describing outcomes in outpatient TSA were identified for inclusion. The included studies used varying criteria for selecting patients for an outpatient procedure. The total outpatient 90-day complication rate (commonly including hematomas, wound issues, and nerve palsies) ranged from 7.1%-11.5%.

This study was aimed to determine the role of stimulator of IFN genes (STING), an essential regulator to innate immunity, in the context of SAH. METHODS: A total of 344 male C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to endovascular perforation to develop a model of SAH. Selective STING antagonist C-176 and STING agonist CMA were administered at 30 min or 1 h post-modeling separately. To investigate the underlying mechanism, the AMPK inhibitor compound C was administered intracerebroventricularly at 30 min before surgery. Post-SAH assessments included SAH grade, neurological test, brain water content, western blotting, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence. Oxygenated hemoglobin was introduced into BV2 cells to establish a SAH model in vitro. RESULTS: STING was mainly distributed in microglia, and microglial STING expression was significantly increased after SAH. Administration of C-176 substantially attenuated SAH-induced brain edema and neuronal injury. More importantly, C-176 significantly alleviated both short-term and persistent neurological dysfunction after SAH. Meanwhile, STING agonist CMA remarkably exacerbated neuronal injury and deteriorated neurological impairments. Mechanically, STING activation aggravated neuroinflammation via promoting microglial activation and polarizing into M1 phenotype, evidenced by microglial morphological changes, as well as the increased level of microglial M1 markers including IL-1?, iNOS, IL-6, TNF-&#945;, MCP-1, and NLRP3 inflammasome, while C-176 conferred a robust anti-inflammatory effect. However, all the mentioned beneficial effects of C-176 including alleviated neuroinflammation, attenuated neuronal injury and the improved neurological function were reversed by AMPK inhibitor compound C. Meanwhile, the critical role of AMPK signal in C-176 mediated anti-inflammatory effect was also confirmed in vitro. CONCLUSION: Microglial STING yielded neuroinflammation after SAH, while pharmacologic inhibition of STING could attenuate SAH-induced inflammatory injury at least partly by activating AMPK signal. These data supported the notion that STING might be a potential therapeutic target for SAH.","output":"Stimulator of IFN genes mediates neuroinflammatory injury by suppressing AMPK signal in experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Practical surgical training in orthopedics and trauma surgery is becoming more and more difficult due to increasing economic pressure. In addition, more and more interventions are carried out on an outpatient basis. This particularly applies to arthroscopy, which also places high demands on the skills of the surgeon. Therefore, numerous virtual arthroscopy simulators have been developed over the past 20 years. These are virtual desktop systems that are coupled with a joint simulator, which allow tactile feedback. In this way basic arthroscopic skills (e.g. triangulation) or arthroscopic operations (e.g. partial meniscectomy) can be trained. The systems enable success control by recording various parameters (surgical time, camera and instrument path length, cartilage contact). Specific simulators already exist for all major joints. Scientific data are now available on face validity, content validity, construct validity and transfer validity of these systems. The skills learned can therefore be transferred to success in the operating room. The cost efficiency of these systems has so far not been resolved.

RESULTS: The follow-up was 94% complete. Cumulative follow-up time was 2268 patient-years [mean follow-up time 5.1 (4.3 SD) years]. Thirty-day mortality was 2.2% (n = 10). Late (>30 days) survival did not differ from that of the age- and gender-matched general population. Freedom from reoperation in patients without additional cusp reconstruction was 94% [95% confidence interval (CI) 91-98] and 92% (95% CI 88-97) at 5 and 10 years, respectively, which was not significantly different (P = 1) for patients who did require additional cusp reconstruction 98% (95% CI 95-100) and 89% (95% CI 81-99). In patients with tricuspid aortic valves (n = 338), freedom from reoperation was 96% (95% CI 94-99) and 93% (95% CI 88-97) at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Patients with bicuspid aortic valves (n = 111) had a freedom from reoperation of 94% (95% CI 89-99) at 5 years and 88% (95% CI 79-98) at 10 years (P = 0.021 for the comparison to tricuspid aortic valve). Overall, 23 patients (5%; 1%/patient-year) required reoperation with a mean interval of 4.5 (4.8 SD) months.

Ethical approval, name of approving committee, type of consent, data source and whether the study used data collected as part of a study reported elsewhere were recorded. Differences in failure to report approval and consent by study design, journal and vulnerable study population were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS Ethical approval and consent were not mentioned in 31% and 47% of manuscripts, respectively. 88 (27%) papers failed to report both approval and consent. Failure to mention ethical approval or consent was significantly more likely in all study designs (except case-control and qualitative studies) than in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Failure to mention approval was most common in the BMJ and was significantly more likely than in The New England Journal of Medicine. Failure to mention consent was most common in the BMJ and was significantly more likely than in all other journals. No significant differences in approval or consent were found when comparing studies of vulnerable and non-vulnerable participants.

Hence an objective severity assessment is crucial in making therapeutic decisions judiciously. Computed Tomography (CT)-scans can provide demarcating features to identify the severity of pneumonia, commonly associated with COVID-19, in the affected lungs. Here, a semi-quantitative severity assessing lung CT image feature is demonstrated for COVID-19 patients. An open-source multi-center Italian database was used, among which 61 cases were incorporated in the study (age 27-86, 71% males) from 27 CT imaging centers. Lesions in the form of opacifications, crazy-paving patterns, and consolidations were heuristically marked and the severity determining feature L_norm was quantified and established to be statistically distinct for the three classes i.e., mild, moderate, and severe (p-value < 0.0001). The thresholds of L_norm for a 3-class classification were determined based on the optimum sensitivity/specificity combination from ROC analyses. The feature L_norm classified the cases in the three severity categories with 89.34% accuracy when L_norm was calculated based on experts' heuristic annotations. Substantial to almost-perfect intra-rater and inter-rater agreements were achieved involving expert and non-expert based evaluations ({kappa}-score 0.79-0.97). We trained machine learning based classification models and showed L_norm alone has a superior diagnostic accuracy over standard image intensity and texture features. Classification accuracy was further increased when L_norm was used to delineate the severe cases from non-severe ones (98.9%) with high sensitivity (97.7%), and specificity (97.49%). Therefore, key highlights of this severity assessment feature are accuracy, lower dependency on expert availability, and wide utility across multiple imaging centers.","output":"A Quantitative Lung Computed Tomography Image Feature for Multi-Center Severity Assessment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fitness coaches need to understand the needs of people living with HIV engaged in community-based exercise (CBE) to be competent in developing exercises programs with this population.

The patients operated between March 11th, 2019-and March 10th, 2020 were taken as the pre-COVID group, and those operated between March 11th and May 11th, 2020 were taken as the COVID group. The data was retrospectively collected, and the two periods were compared. RESULTS: Monthly average number of cases which was 52 patients/month (626 patients in 12 months) before COVID decreased to 35 patients/month (70 patients in 2 months) during COVID periods (P < .01). During the pre-COVID period the median postoperative length of hospital stay was 3 (IQR: 1-5) days. During the COVID period, this decreased to 1 (IQR: 1-3) day (P < .01). During the pre-COVID period, the hospital expenses of 17% (8/47) of the foreign nationals were covered by their homeland. The remaining 83% (39/47) were paid from the asylum seekers' fund.

METHODS CDC analyzed National HIV Surveillance System data for persons aged 13 years to determine age-adjusted death rates per 1,000 PWDH during 2010-2018. Using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, deaths with a nonmissing underlying cause were classified as HIV-related or non-HIV-related. Temporal changes in total deaths during 2010-2018 and deaths by cause during 2010-2017 (2018 excluded because of delays in reporting), by demographic characteristics, transmission category, and U.S. Census region of residence at time of death were calculated. RESULTS During 2010-2018, rates of death decreased by 36.6% overall (from 19.4 to 12.3 per 1,000 PWDH). During 2010-2017, HIV-related death rates decreased 48.4% (from 9.1 to 4.7), whereas non-HIV-related death rates decreased 8.6% (from 9.3 to 8.5).

RESULTS The literature search identified 11 previous studies involving a total of 237 subjects out of whom 193 (81.4 %) were treated with acute stent placement for the extracranial internal carotid artery occlusion. Mean initial NIHSS score was 17, and median time from onset to recanalization was 283.5 min. Mean intravenous thrombolysis rate was 63.8 %. In the meta-analysis, the recanalization rate reached 81 % (95 % CI, 73-89).

Instead of a multicultural understanding of global sociology, a critical sociology that contributes to global justice is now often advocated. Based on this historical overview, it is suggested that global sociology might contribute to more self-reflexivity within the discipline.

Clinical severity was assessed upon hospital admission, with mild cases considered suitable for home treatment, moderate cases for hospital admission and severe cases for intensive care unit admission. Results: : 658 patients were included. Concordance correlation coefficient for the RAD-Covid Score was almost perfect among observers (0.833), with an overall agreement of 89.5%. The RAD-Covid Score was positively correlated with clinical severity and death, i.e., the higher the RAD-Covid Score, the greater the chance of a more severe clinical condition and mortality.

Microstate and omega complexity are two reference-free electroencephalography (EEG) measures that can represent the temporal and spatial complexities of EEG data. Few studies have focused on potential brain spatiotemporal dynamics in the early stages of depression to use as an early screening feature for depression. Thus, this study aimed to explore large-scale brain network dynamics of individuals both with and without subclinical depression, from the perspective of temporal and spatial dimensions and to input them as features into a machine learning framework for the automatic diagnosis of early-stage depression. To achieve this, spatioCtemporal dynamics of rest-state EEG signals in female college students (n = 40) with and without (n = 38) subclinical depression were analyzed using EEG microstate and omega complexity analysis. Then, based on differential features of EEGs between the two groups, a support vector machine was utilized to compare performances of spatioCtemporal features and single features in the classification of early depression. Microstate results showed that the occurrence rate of microstate class B was significantly higher in the group with subclinical depression when compared with the group without. Moreover, the duration and contribution of microstate class C in the subclinical group were both significantly lower than in the group without subclinical depression. Omega complexity results showed that the global omega complexity of -2 and  band was significantly lower for the subclinical depression group compared with the other group (p < 0.05). In addition, the anterior and posterior regional omega complexities were lower for the subclinical depression group compared to the comparison group in -1, -2 and  bands. It was found that AUC of 81% for the differential indicators of EEG microstates and omega complexity was deemed better than a single index for predicting subclinical depression. Thus, since temporal and spatial complexity of EEG signals were manifestly altered in female college students with subclinical depression, it is possible that this characteristic could be adopted as an early auxiliary diagnostic indicator of depression.","output":"Temporal and Spatial Dynamics of EEG Features in Female College Students with Subclinical Depression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate the method and application of ultrasound-guided post-mortem lung tissue sampling in cases of COVID-19 Methods: Ultrasound-guided post-mortem lung tissue sampling was performed with 14G biopsy needles in 17 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from Feb to Mar 2020 Ten conventional puncture points were designed according to the anatomy of human lung lobes and the projections on the body surface The 3rd and 6th intercostal spaces in the left midclavicular line were the puncture points for the tissues of the medial areas of the upper and lower lobes of the left lung, and the 3rd, 4th, and 6th intercostal spaces in the right midclavicular line were the puncture points of the lung tissues taken from the medial areas of the upper, middle, and lower lobes of the right lung The 4th and 7th intercostal spaces in the left midaxillary line were the puncture points of the lung tissues from the upper and lower lateral lobes, and the 4th, 5th, and 7th intercostal spaces in the right midaxillary line were the puncture points of the lung tissues from the lateral areas of the upper, middle and lower lobes of the right lung According to the sonographic findings of the lung tissues at each puncture point, it was divided into three types: air-containing lung, consolidated lung and compressed lung And the corresponding sampling methods were designed to complete multiple points of the medial and lateral areas of the left and right lung lobes The time required for each lung sampling was recorded, and the sizes of the specimens were measured The success rates of all puncture points were compared and the success rates of various type lung tissues were compared Results: In 17 COVID-19 death cases, 174 puncture points were selected for bilateral lung tissues, and 288 lung tissue specimens were obtained by puncture There were differences in the success rates of the puncture points, and the success rate of the 6th intercostal puncture points on the left and right midclavicular lines were lower than those of the other puncture points(P&lt;0 05) There were differences in the success rate of corpse lung sampling with different types of ultrasonographic performance The success rates of gas-containing lung sampling was 74 4%, which was lower than that of consolidation lung (86 8%)and compressed lung(84 1%)(P&lt;0 05) The length of the compressed lung specimen was 11 4(10 6, 12 3)mm, which was lower than that of gas-containing lung and consolidation lung[14 6(12 5, 15 2)mm, 13 5(12 5, 15 0)mm] (P&lt;0 05) Conclusions: This study introduces an ultrasound-guided minimally invasive puncture method for cadaver lung tissue sampling, and itmay be a reliable method for collecting lung tissues in COVID-19 cases ? 2020 Chinese Medical Association","output":"Ultrasound-guided pathological sampling of cadaver lung tissue in cases of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this advice column, Phyllis Fagell answers educators? questions about their professional dilemmas.

Moreover, this chip will decrease the risk of spreading infection during transportation. RESULTS: A series of experiments were performed to establish a microfluidic chip. The resulting data showed that the positive nucleic acid of four swine viruses were detected by using a portable and rapid microfluidic PCR system, which could achieve a on-site real-time quantitative PCR detection. Furthermore, the detection results of eight clinical samples were obtained within an hour. The lowest concentration that amplified of this microfluidic PCR detection system was as low as 1 copies/L. The results showed that the high specificity of this chip system in disease detection played an important role in customs inspection and quarantine during customs clearance. CONCLUSION: The microfluidic PCR detection system established in this study could meet the requirement for rapid detection of samples at the customs port. This chip could avoid the risky process of transporting the samples from the sampling site to the testing lab, and drastically reduce the inspection cycle. Moreover, it would enable parallel inspections on one chip, which greatly raised the efficiency of inspection.","output":"Multiplex and on-site PCR detection of swine diseases based on the microfluidic chip system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic affected teachers and students worldwide.

However, a few recent studies have suggested the possible existence of other Iranian PPMV-1 genotypes/subgenotypes. Recently, we isolated a PPMV-1 closely related to the African origin subgenotype VI.2.1.2 from an ill captive pigeon in a park aviary in central Tehran (Pg/IR/AMMM160/2019). This subgenotype had never been reported from Iran or neighboring countries. We also isolated a subgenotype VII.1.1 NDV (Pg/IR/AMMM117/2018), usually reported from non-pigeon birds in Iran. The nucleotide distance of AMMM117 was 1.0-2.5% compared to other Iranian subgenotypes VII.1.1 isolates. However, usually the same year VII.1.1 viruses that we isolate from Iranian poultry farms show negligible distances (0.0-0.5%). More isolates are required to study if this difference is due to subgenotype VII.1.1 being circulated and mutated in pigeons. Here, we also characterized two other isolates, namely Pg/IR/AMMM168/2019 and Pg/IR/MAM39/2017. The latter is the first Iranian subgenotype XXI.1.1 to be featured in the NDV datasets of the international NDV consortium. We also investigated the phylogenetic relation of all the published Iranian pigeon-derived NDV to date and updated the grouping according to the latest classification system. We have concluded that at least six different groups of pigeon-derived NDV have been circulating in Iran since 1996, four of which have been reported from just one city over the last seven years. This study suggests that the Iranian pigeon-origin NDV have been more diverse than the Iranian poultry-derived NDV in recent years.","output":"Circulation of at Least Six Distinct Groups of Pigeon-Derived Newcastle Disease Virus in Iran Between 1996 and 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Welcome to the Special Issue of Life entitled \\"Neutralizing-Antibody-Based Treatments for COVID-19: Achievements and Lessons Learnt for Future Pandemics\\" [...].","output":"Antibodies and SARS-CoV-2: New Data on Diagnostics and Therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The research aimed to see a relevance of the preservation of the Javanese language in Javanese conversations that Ganjar Pranowo carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic.

There are emerging eosinophil-related considerations concerning COVID-19. Variable eosinophil counts have been reported during COVID-19. Whether these changes are related to the primary disease process or due to immunomodulation induced by the treatment has not yet been elucidated. AIM OF THE STUDY: To describe changes in the differential leukocyte counts including eosinophils, in a cohort of symptomatic patients with confirmed COVID-19 and to correlate these changes, if any, with the severity of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recorded the clinical data, lab findings, including inflammatory markers and leukocyte and differential count, course of the disease and severity score in 314 confirmed symptomatic cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: Laboratory tests revealed that 28.7 % (n =86) had mild eosinophilia (eosinophil count > 500 <1,500/L). Thirty-four patients (11.3%) had elevated absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (>8,000/L), and 7 (2.3%) had decreased ANC (< 1,500/l). Seven patients (2.3%) had lymphopenia (<1,000/L) and 4 (4.67%) had lymphocytosis (> 4,000/L). C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated in 83 patients (27.6%). Chest X-Ray changes included: increased broncho vascular markings (38%), ground-glass opacity (GGO) pneumonitis (19.3%), lobar consolidation (5%), bronchopneumonia (8.3%), nodular opacity (1%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (2.3%), pleural effusion (1.0%) and other atypical findings (6.6%). Patients with eosinophilia had significantly lower CRP, and lower % of GGO, lobar and bronchopneumonia and ARDS in their chest images compared to patients without eosinophilia (p: <0.05). They also had a lower requirement for a hospital stay, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and oxygen supplementation versus patients without eosinophilia (p: <0.05). The eosinophils count was correlated negatively with the duration of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and oxygen supplementation and with CRP level (r: - 0.34, -0.32, -0.61 and - 0.39, respectively) (p: < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports a relatively high prevalence of eosinophilia in symptomatic COVID-19 positive patients. Patients with eosinophilia had a lower level of CRP, milder clinical course and better disease outcomes compared to those without eosinophilia. Our findings indicated a protective role of eosinophils in mitigating the severity of inflammatory diseases through an inhibitory mechanism, as evidenced by lower CRP. This protective role of eosinophils needs to be validated by further prospective studies.","output":"Clinical Outcome of Eosinophilia in Patients with COVID-19: A Controlled Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For nearly two decades, coronaviruses have caused many health and economic problems, while no effective commercial vaccine has yet been developed. It is worth mentioning that despite some mutations and recombination in SARS-CoV-2, its genotype is very close to the original strain from Wuhan, China. Therefore, the development of an effective vaccine would be promising. It might be hypothesized that BCG vaccination is performed in high-risk populations before the commercialization of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, the development of an effective vaccine without considering the adverse immune reactions derived from antibody-dependent or cell-based immune enhancement is may threaten vaccinated people's lives and long-term side effect must be considered. To this end, targeting of the receptorbinding domain (RBD) in spike and not whole spike, glycolization of FC receptors, PD-1 blockers, CPPs, etc. are promising. Therefore, the subunit vaccines or RNA vaccines that encode the RBP segment of the spike are of interest. To enhance the vaccine efficacy, its co-delivery with an adjuvant has been recommended. Nanoparticles modulate immune response with higher efficiency than the soluble form of antigens and can be functionalized with the positively charged moieties and ligands of targeted cells, such as dendritic cells, to increase cellular uptake of the antigens and their presentation on the surface of immune cells.

METHODS: Patients seen for emergency psychiatric evaluation during the height of the COVID-19 period (March 1-April 30, 2020; N = 201) were compared with those in the immediate Pre-COVID-19 period (January 1-February 28, 2020; N = 355), on sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric diagnoses, symptoms, and disposition. Patients tested positive for COVID-19 were compared with those that tested negative on the same outcomes. Prevalence and nature of COVID-19-stressors that influenced the emergency presentation were rated. OUTCOME: The most common psychiatric diagnoses and presenting symptoms during both periods were depression and suicidal ideation. Comparing the Pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, a significant decline in emergency psychiatric volume was observed in children and adolescents (C/A), but not adults. COVID-19 period C/A patients had more new onset disorders and were more likely to be admitted to inpatient care, but were less likely to present with suicide attempts, impulse control disorders and agitation/aggression. Adults were more likely to have no access to outpatient care, present with anxiety disorders, and were also more likely to be admitted for inpatient care. COVID-19 directly affected the psychiatric emergency in 25% of patients, with the more severe stressors triggered by fear of COVID infection (including psychosis), actual COVID infection in self or family members, including death of a loved one. COVID-positive patients were more likely to have psychosis, including new-onset, and were less likely to be depressed/suicidal compared to their COVID-negative counterparts.

Coronary manifestations encompass obstructive intra-luminal lesions, external encasing pseudo-tumour on imaging, or lymphoplasmacytic arteritis. Case summary: Case 1: A fit and healthy 50-year-old man was found deceased. His only known medical condition was treated Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Post-mortem examination demonstrated an isolated severe stenosis of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery without histopathological evidence of acute myocardial infarction. Coronary plaque histopathology showed florid IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltrate throughout all layers of the artery with dense fibrous tissue connective tissue stroma, all features consistent with coronary artery IgG4-RD. Case 2: A 48-year-old man collapsed at work. Computed tomography scan 1 week prior reported an ill-defined para-aortic retroperitoneal soft tissue density. No cardiac symptoms were reported in life. Post-mortem examination showed coronary arteritis and peri-arteritis with sclerosing peri-aortitis in the LAD. There was myocardial fibrosis of the anterior left ventricle and focal myocarditis of the right ventricle. Discussion: IgG4-related disease presenting as sudden cardiac death without any preceding symptoms is very rare (six prior cases identified on literature review).

We also verified whether other behavioral variations could relate to range use. To that aim, over three different periods (before range access, first weeks of range access, and last weeks of range access), chickens with different ranging levels (low and high rangers) were submitted to a contrafreeloading test and had different behaviors recorded (such as foraging, resting, locomotion) in their home environment. During the contrafreeloading test, chickens were conditioned to one chamber presenting a foraging substrate and mealworms, while in the other chamber, mealworms were freely available on the floor. During testing trials, chickens had access to both empty chambers, and the time spent in each chamber was quantified. On average, low rangers preferred the chamber where mealworms were easily accessible (without the foraging substrate), while high rangers preferred the chamber where mealworms were accessible with difficulty, showing greater contrafreeloading. Out of ten behaviors recorded in chickens' home environment, foraging was the only one that differed significantly between our two ranging groups, with low rangers foraging, on average, significantly less than high rangers. These results corroborate previous experiences suggesting that range use is probably linked to chickens' exploratory trait and suggest that individual differences in free-range broiler chickens are present even before range access. Increasing our knowledge of individual particularities is a necessary step to improve free-range chicken welfare on the farm.","output":"Working for food is related to range use in free-range broiler chickens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, a SEIR epidemic model for the COVID-19 is built according to some general control strategies, such as hospital, quarantine and external input.

The successful implementation of ePI has led to advantages and convenience to patients, health care professionals, and pharmaceutical companies in many regions and countries. In the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), there is currently no citywide implementation of ePI. The SAR exhibits conditions that would favor the implementation of an ePI system, as well as existing barriers hindering its implementation. However, no study has been performed to examine the specific situation in Hong Kong. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to explore working pharmacists overall perception of ePI and to identify potential challenges to the implementation of an ePI system in Hong Kong. METHODS: This mixed-method study involved a structured survey and interview with practicing pharmacists in Hong Kong. Pharmacists were eligible if they were licensed to practice in Hong Kong, and currently working locally in any pharmacy-related sectors and institutions. Respondents completed a survey to indicate their level of agreement with statements regarding the potential advantages of ePI over paper PI. A structured interview was conducted to gather respondents perceived advantages of ePI over paper PI in different aspects, such as professionalism, usability, presentation, and environment, as well as challenges of citywide ePI implementation in Hong Kong. Thematic analysis was adopted to analyze the qualitative data. Grounded theory was used to generate themes and identify specific outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 16 pharmacists were recruited, comprising 4 community pharmacists, 5 hospital pharmacists, and 7 industrial pharmacists. All of them used electronic platforms at least once per month on average. Respondents identified many flaws in physical package inserts that can potentially be mitigated using ePI. The speed with which drug information can be retrieved and the degree to which the drug information can be readily updated and disseminated were considered the greatest strengths of ePI. The clarity with which ePI present drug information to patients was considered as the weakest aspect of ePI. Many respondents highlighted concerns about the security risks and high cost associated with system maintenance and that certain subpopulations may not be sufficiently computer literate to navigate the ePI system. Respondents also voiced many concerns about the implementation and maintenance of a local ePI system. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that an ePI system is generally supported by pharmacists but concerns about implementation process and maintenance of the system has been raised. The perceived benefits of ePI gathered from this study, as well as collective evidence from other countries with mature ePI systems, confirm that more efforts should be made to promote optimized development and implementation of an ePI system in Hong Kong.","output":"Pharmacists Perceptions of the Benefits and Challenges of Electronic Product Information System Implementation in Hong Kong: Mixed-Method Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The number of residency applications submitted by medical students rises annually, resulting in increased work and costs for residency programs and applicants, particularly in emergency medicine. We propose a solution to this problem: an optional, two-stage Match with a \\"summer match\\" stage, in which applicants can submit a limited number of applications early. This would be conducted similarly to the early decision process for college admissions. The study objectives were to explore stakeholder opinions on the feasibility of a summer match and to identify the ideal logistic parameters to operationalize this proposal. Methods We used exploratory qualitative methodology following a constructivist paradigm to develop an understanding of the potential impact of a summer match. We interviewed 34 key stakeholders in the U.S. residency application process identified through purposive sampling including educational administrators (program directors, designated institutional officials, medical school deans) and trainees (students, residents). We coded and thematically analyzed interview data in two stages using an inductive approach. Results We identified six themes from the participant interviews that broadly reflected issues of the residency application process, value, and equity. These themes included disrupting the status quo, logistic concerns, match strategy, differential benefits, unintended consequences, and return on investment. Most study participants supported the summer match concept, with medical students and residents most in favor. We developed a theoretical summer match protocol based on these findings. Conclusions A summer match may reduce the burdens of increasing residency applications and associated costs. Pilot testing is necessary to confirm this hypothesis and determine the impact of the proposed summer match protocol. Unintended consequences must be considered carefully during implementation.","output":"The Summer Match: A qualitative study exploring a two-stage residency match option."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the feces of infected patients and wastewater has drawn attention, not only to the possibility of fecal-oral transmission but also to the use of wastewater as an epidemiological tool. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted problems in evaluating the epidemiological scope of the disease using classical surveillance approaches, due to a lack of diagnostic capacity, and their application to only a small proportion of the population. As in previous pandemics, statistics, particularly the proportion of the population infected, are believed to be widely underestimated. Furthermore, analysis of only clinical samples cannot predict outbreaks in a timely manner or easily capture asymptomatic carriers. Threfore, community-scale surveillance, including wastewater-based epidemiology, can bridge the broader community and the clinic, becoming a valuable indirect epidemiological prediction tool for SARS-CoV-2 and other pandemic viruses.

OBJECTIVES To determine: Coefficient of variation (CV) between replicates of a commercial assay (Spec cPL) and 2 in-house assays (VetScan cPL, Vcheck cPL) under routine conditions. Effects of sample condition or personnel on results. Potential directional bias between assays. ANIMALS Serum from 12 canine clinical patients. METHODS Prospective study. Serum Spec cPL, VetScan cPL, and Vcheck cPL (6 aliquots each) were measured, and CVs were calculated, effects of sample condition and personnel were assessed using a linear mixed model, and direction of bias was assessed using least square mean cPLI concentration. RESULTS Mean %CVs for Spec cPL, VetScan cPL, and Vcheck cPL were 5.5, 17.0, and 23.7%. Three of 6 VetScan cPL samples and 5/9 Vcheck cPL samples had an unacceptably high %CV (>20%). Transportation (Spec cPL) and sample condition or personnel (VetScan cPL, Vcheck cPL) did not affect repeatability. Least square mean cPL was higher for Spec cPL (807.9 g/L) than for VetScan cPL (558.5 g/L) or Vcheck cPL (399.8 g/L). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE For clinical use, the commercial Spec cPL has the highest repeatability, and Vcheck cPL has significantly lower repeatability.

Despite this, many government agencies and members of the general public may be resistant to NPI adoption. We sought to understand public attitudes and beliefs regarding various NPIs and self-reported adoption of NPIs, and to explore associations between NPI performance and the baseline characteristics of respondents. We performed a cross-sectional age-, sex-, and race- stratified survey of the general US population. Of the 1,005 respondents, 37% (95% CI 34.0, 39.9) felt that NPIs were inconvenient, while only 0.9% (95% CI 0.3, 1.5) of respondents believed that NPIs would not reduce their personal risk of illness. Respondents were most uncertain regarding the efficacy of mask and eye protection use, with 30.6 and 22.1%, respectively, unsure whether their use would slow disease spread. On univariate logistic regression analyses, NPI adherence was associated with a belief that NPIs would reduce personal risk of developing COVID-19 [OR 3.06, 95% CI [1.25, 7.48], p = 0.014] and with a belief that NPIs were not difficult to perform [OR 1.79, 95% CI [1.38, 2.31], p &lt; 0.0001]. Respondents were compliant with straightforward, familiar, and heavily-encouraged NPI recommendations such as hand-washing; more onerous approaches, such as avoiding face touching, disinfecting surfaces, and wearing masks or goggles, were performed less frequently. NPI non-adherence is associated with both outcome expectations (belief that NPIs are effective) and process expectations (belief that NPIs are not overly inconvenient); these findings have important implications for designing public health outreach efforts, where the feasibility, as well as the effectiveness, of NPIs should be stressed.","output":"Non-pharmaceutical Interventions for Pandemic COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Investigation of US General Public Beliefs, Attitudes, and Actions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Noroviruses are recognized as emerging enteric pathogens of humans and have been identified in recent years in a number of mammalian species.

Four modeling approaches were examined to predict total waste disposal at the Regina landfill during the COVID-19 period, including (i) continuous total (Baseline), (ii) continuous fraction, (iii) truncated total, and (iv) truncated fraction. A single feature input recurrent neural network model was adopted for each approach. It is hypothesized that waste quantity modeling using different waste fractions and separate time series can better capture disposal behaviors of residents during the lockdown. Compared to the baseline approach, the use of waste fractions in modeling improves both result accuracy and precision. In general, the use of continuous time series over-predicted total waste disposal, especially when actual disposal rates were less than 50 t/day. Compared to the baseline approach, mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean square error (MSE) were reduced. The R value increased from 0.63 to 0.79. Comparing to the baseline, the truncated total and the truncated fraction approaches better captured the total waste disposal behaviors during the COVID-19 period, probably due to the periodicity of the weeklong data set.

In the present study we surveyed two populations of P. maniculatus that are maintained at the Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center (PGSC) for polymorphisms across their 2.5  10(9) bp genome. RESULTS: High density of variation was identified, corresponding to one SNP every 55 bp for the high altitude stock (SM2) or 207 bp for the low altitude stock (BW) using snpEff (v4.3). Indels were detected every 1157 bp for BW or 311 bp for SM2. The average Watterson estimator for the BW and SM2 populations is 248813.70388 and 869071.7671 respectively.

Several controls being used to protect passengers from virus transmission in other modes of mass transportation could also have the potential for immediate incorporation into school buses.","output":"Considerations for the Transportation of School Aged Children Amid the Coronavirus Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous research has established that creative adolescents are generally low in neuroticism and as well-adjusted as their peers From 2006 to 2013, data from cohorts of creative adolescents attending a counseling laboratory supported these results Clinical findings of increased anxiety, depression, and suicidality among creative students in 2014 led the researchers to create 3 studies to explore these clinical findings Once artifactual causes of these changes were ruled out, a quantitative study was conducted Study 1, an analysis of mean differences of pre-2014 and post-2014 cohorts showed that post-2014 cohorts scored significantly higher in Neuroticism, Openness to Experience, and Conscientiousness and lower in Extraversion on Big 5 inventories Regression analyses suggested that while Neuroticism was associated with gender, Conscientiousness and Grade Point Average for the earlier group, Neuroticism in the post 2014 groups was related to complex interplay of all personality dynamics except Agreeableness In the qualitative Study 2, focus groups of 6-10 students, for a total of 102 participants were queried about the reasons they perceived for increased anxiety and depression in creative students Increased achievement pressures and awareness of environmental and social problems were major sources of external stressors;perfectionism and desire to fulfill expectations of others were the primary sources of internal stress The authors suggest that creative students' openness to experience and advanced knowledge made it possible for these students to see the potential for environmental and social crises and respond to their inability to solve these problems with anxiety and depression Study 3 was a qualitative study that followed up 19 participants from the post-2014 cohort to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and creativity While the majority perceived a negative effect of the pandemic on their mental health, most also produced a surprising variety of creative works during that time In conclusion, rapid changes in the lives of creative adolescents since 2014 suggest that scholars focus on current cohorts and the ways in which adolescent personality is shaped by internal expectation and external pressures and global events Despite the pandemic, creative young people continued to create","output":"They Saw It Coming: Rising Trends in Depression, Anxiety, and Suicidality in Creative Students and Potential Impact of the COVID-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus detected in China at the end of 2019. Because SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious due to contamination in the air, there is a high risk of infection in the dental environment which is represents a serious problem for professionals and students (dentistry and dental hygiene). In Italy, since February 23, 2020, the government has suspended all teaching activities of schools and universities. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was administered to the students of the degree courses in Dental Hygiene of the Emilia Romagna Region, one of the most affected regions in Italy. The survey was intended to highlight the practical and emotional consequences of the emergency of COVID-19 on educational activities and in the training of students. RESULTS: The survey was sent to the 150 students enrolled in the universities of Bologna, Ferrara and Modena and Reggio Emilia; 141 of them completed it (94%). Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, several surveys have been proposed to measure the impact of this emergency situation on dental professionals; at present, however, there are still no assessments for dental hygiene degree courses, in particular aimed at assessing the psychological impact on students. CONCLUSIONS: Students consider the dental hygienist as a risky profession, while the risk taken by patients is considered as low. Given the concern reported the students, it would be useful to address the issue of proper assessment of risk during the university training of dental hygienists.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dental hygiene students in the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There was a lack of information about prognostic accuracy of time to sputum culture conversion (SCC) in forecasting cure among extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) patients. Therefore, this study evaluated the prognostic accuracy of SCC at various time points in forecasting cure among XDR-TB patients. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included 355 eligible pulmonary XDR-TB patients treated at 27 centers in Pakistan between 01-05-2010 and 30-06-2017. The baseline and follow-up information of patients from treatment initiation until the end of treatment were retrieved from electronic nominal recording and reporting system. Time to SCC was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between groups were compared through log-rank test. Predictors of time to SCC and cure were respectively evaluated by multivariate Cox proportional hazards and binary logistic regression analyses. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 226 (63.6%) and 146 (41.1%) patients respectively achieved SCC and cure. Median time to SCC was significantly shorter in patients who achieved cure, 3 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.47-3.53), than those who did not (median: 10 months, 95% CI: 5.24-14.76) (p-value < 0.001, Log-rank test). Patient's age > 40 years (hazards ratio [HR] = 0.632, p-value = 0.004), baseline sputum grading of scanty, + 1 (HR = 0.511, p-value = 0.002), + 2, + 3 (HR = 0.523, p-value = 0.001) and use of high dose isoniazid (HR = 0.463, p-value = 0.004) were significantly associated with early SCC. Only SCC at 6 month of treatment had statistically significant association with cure (odds ratio = 15.603, p-value < 0.001). In predicting cure, the sensitivities of SCC at 2, 4 and 6 months were respectively 41.8% (95%CI: 33.7-50.2), 69.9% (95%CI: 61.7-77.2) and 84.9% (95%CI: 78.1-90.3), specificities were respectively, 82.8% (95%CI: 76.9-87.6), 74.6% (95%CI: 68.2-80.4) and 69.4% (95%CI: 62.6-75.5) and prognostic accuracies were respectively 65.9% (95%CI: 60.7-70.8), 72.7% (95%CI: 67.7-77.2) and 75.8% (95%CI: 71.0-80.1). CONCLUSION: In forecasting cure, SCC at month 6 of treatment performed better than SCC at 2 and 4 months. However, it would be too long for clinicians to wait for 6 months to decide about the regimen efficacy. Therefore, with somewhat comparable prognostic accuracy to that SCC at 6 month, using SCC at 4 month of treatment as a prognostic marker in predicting cure among XDR-TB patients can decrease the clinicians waiting time to decide about the regimen efficacy.","output":"Prognostic accuracy of time to sputum culture conversion in predicting cure in extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis patients: a multicentre retrospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The goal of this study was to empirically examine the degree to which alcohol use and drinking motives changed during the first month of the pandemic and to examine individual differences associated with such changes. Methods: A U.S. nationwide survey of 500 adults was conducted; data from 201 individuals (Mage=38.98, SD=12.04, 52.2% female, 76.1% White) who endorsed current alcohol use were included in this study. Results: Paired-samples t-tests indicated that there was a significant decrease in drinking quantity [t(199)=3.74, p<.001], but no change in drinking frequency [t(198)=0.19, p=.849] overall during the first month of the U.S. pandemic. There were significant decreases in enhancement [t(201)=4.55, p<.001], social [t(201)=9.39, p<.001] and conformity [t(201)=3.58, p<.001] motives, but a significant increase in coping motives [t(201)=-3.71, p<.001]. Regression analyses showed that increases in enhancement [?=0.46, p<.001] and coping [?=0.27, p=.004] motives were significantly related to increases in drinking frequency, and increases in coping motives [?=0.32, p=.002] were related to increases in drinking quantity. Riskier drinking prior to the pandemic was significantly related to greater increase in drinking quantity in the first month of the U.S. pandemic [?=0.31, p<.001]. Conclusion: Results of this study provide initial support that changes in drinking motives were important predictors for changes in alcohol use during the first month of the U.S. pandemic. Contrary to anecdotal reports, drinking decreased overall during the first month of the U.S. pandemic; however, those with existing risky patterns of drinking prior to the start of the U.S. pandemic were at greatest risk for drinking escalation during this time.","output":"Early Impact of the U.S. COVID-19 Pandemic on Drinking Motives and Alcohol Use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced policy makers to decree urgent confinements to stop a rapid and massive contagion.

We report the largest case series to date of cerebrovascular complications of COVID-19 and compare with stroke patients without infection. METHODS: Retrospective case series of COVID-19 patients with imaging-confirmed stroke, treated at 11 hospitals in New York, between March 14 and April 26, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, and outcome data were collected, and cases were compared with date-matched controls without COVID-19 from 1 year prior. RESULTS: Eighty-six COVID-19-positive stroke cases were identified (mean age, 67.4 years; 44.2% women). Ischemic stroke (83.7%) and nonfocal neurological presentations (67.4%) predominated, commonly involving multivascular distributions (45.8%) with associated hemorrhage (20.8%). Compared with controls (n=499), COVID-19 was associated with in-hospital stroke onset (47.7% versus 5.0%; P<0.001), mortality (29.1% versus 9.0%; P<0.001), and Black/multiracial race (58.1% versus 36.9%; P=0.001). COVID-19 was the strongest independent risk factor for in-hospital stroke (odds ratio, 20.9 [95% CI, 10.4-42.2]; P<0.001), whereas COVID-19, older age, and intracranial hemorrhage independently predicted mortality.

BACKGROUND: AAs have worse outcomes compared to whites while facing heart diseases, stroke, cancer, asthma, influenza and pneumonia, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS. However, there is no current study to show the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the AA communities. METHODS: This is a retrospective study that included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 2 tertiary centers in New Orleans, LA. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 157 patients were identified. Of these, 134 (77%) were AAs, whereas 23.4% of patients were Whites. Interestingly, AA were younger, with a mean age of 63  13.4 compared to 75.7  23 years in Whites (P < 0.001). Thirty-seven patients presented with no insurance, and 34 of them were AA. SOFA Score was significantly higher in AA (2.57  2.1) compared to White patients (1.69  1.7), P = 0.041.

Methodology: A systematic review of articles on the novel coronavirus, containing information on obesity and its association with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. In the bibliographic research, four databases were used, with the terms ['COVID-19'] AND ['hospitalization'] AND ['obesity'] AND ['mortality']. Studies published from 12/01/2019 until 05/01/2020 were included. The research contains inclusive criteria targeting studies of humans adults infected by Sars-Cov-2, with or without comorbidities. This research was selected from publications in Spanish and English languages. Results: 96 articles were identified, 15 being presented in two databases. Twenty articles were included, with a population total estimated from 1 to 7671 patients, with a prevalence of obesity ranging from 13.3% to 68.6%. The association of obesity and mortality has been observed in at least 4 studies, that 85.3% of the population was hospitalized. Among 19 of the 20 studies, more severe forms of the disease were observed and in 14 of them, higher rates of complications among obese people infected with the new coronavirus. Limitation differences in the definition of obesity was observed among publications, of which obesity was considered from a body mass index >25 kg/m2. Conclusions: In the current review, obesity and overweight were represented an unfavorable factor for infection of novel coronavirus, where the higher the BMI the worse the outcomes. This occurred by worsening the infection itself, as well as increasing the prevalence of hospitalizations, worst outcomes and greater lethality; especially when co-occurring with other chronic conditions and in the elderly as well.

Hydroxyurea therapy prevents SCD-related complications;yet it is underutilized, which contributes to further health inequities. Mobile health (mHealth) apps for patients and providers have the potential to improve hydroxyurea adherence. Our objective was to use the RE-AIM framework to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on implementation and effectiveness of patient and provider hydroxyurea (HU) mHealth apps (InCharge Health app and HU Toolbox app, respectively) in two large academic medical centers. Methods: Patient-level data (n=46) were collected between 11/2019-7/2020. Adherence was measured by calculating Percentage of Days Covered (PDC) from prescription records over 24 weeks before implementing the mHealth apps and during 12 and 24 weeks of implementation. As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to reduce virus spread, both sites temporarily suspended non-emergent clinical activities. During implementation, Site A clinics shut down for approximately 2 months (3/2020-5/2020) and Site B clinics for 7 months (3/2020-10/2020). To better understand contextual factors associated with mHealth implementation, we purposively sampled participants according to app use level (high vs low) and conducted semi-structured interviews with adult SCD patients, providers (physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants), administrators, and research staff between 6/2020 and 3/2021. Results: A total of 46 patients participated and contributed to the PDC hydroxyurea adherence data. Mean change in PDC, adjusted for baseline PDC, was greater at Site A than at Site B (12-weeks: difference = 16.59%, p=.01, Figure 1A;24-weeks: difference = 15.08%, p=.01, Figure 1B). Eleven patients (mean age 26.2 years old, 64% males, 100% Black, 73% HbSS, 45% low app users) and 11 providers (mean age 36.7 years old, 73% females, 36% Black, 54.5% physicians, average 8 years in practice, 36% low app users) completed the semi-structured interviews across the 2 sites. Site B was more affected during the COVID-19 pandemic where patients had difficulty obtaining hydroxyurea and other challenges related to reaching their providers and clinic setting for non-urgent or emergent reasons. In addition, participants with lower baseline hydroxyurea adherence level, as measured by PDC, had a more remarkable improvement in their PDC values at 12 weeks (Figure 1C) and 24 weeks (Figure 1D) Additional qualitative data focused on the implementation process were collected from 3 administrators, and 4 research staff. Among patients, both high and low app users reported the pandemic was a barrier to getting needed care (e.g., difficulty getting to hospital/clinic) and obtaining hydroxyurea;this was particularly a concern among low app users at Site B. Among providers, all but 2 high app users reported the pandemic did not impact app use, but nearly all low users perceived the pandemic to be a barrier to using the provider app because fewer patients came to clinic for maintenance SCD visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Low users also reported the pandemic would negatively impact continued use of the app. Administrators and research staff also said reduced in-person clinic visits were a barrier to app implementation. Conclusions: mHealth apps are promising tools for improving hydroxyurea adherence among adolescents and adults with SCD. Contextual data show that some patients who experienced challenges accessing healthcare during COVID-19 pandemic have also experienced challenges navigating mHealth implementation. A focus on removing barriers to mobile apps use during care disruptions will likely improve patient and provider mHealth apps implementation, and ultimately, reduce health inequities for this vulnerable population. Our findings suggest that strategies such as including an mHealth facilitator has the potential to help addressing some of these implementation challenges.

METHODS A total of 90 patients with COVID-19 accompanied with insomnia were randomly divided into an observation group (45 cases, 3 cases dropped off) and a control group (45 cases). In the observation group, baduanjin, a traditional Chinese fitness activity, was practiced everyday. Besides, auricular point sticking therapy was exerted at ear-shenmen (TF 4), subcortex (AT 4), heart (CO 15), occiput (AT 3), etc. These auricular points were pressed and kneaded three times a day, 30 s at each point each time, consecutively for 12 days. In the control group, estazolam tablets were prescribed for oral administration, 1 mg, once daily, consecutively for 12 days. Before and after treatment, the score of Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), the score of self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), the score of self-rating depression scale (SDS) and the score of symptoms in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) were observed in the two groups and the clinical therapeutic effect was evaluated. RESULTS After treatment, the scores of every item and the total scores in PSQI were all reduced as compared with those before treatment in the two groups (P<0.01). The scores of sleep time and sleep efficiency in the observation group were lower than those in the control group after treatment (P<0.05). SAS scores and SDS scores in the observation group and SAS score in the control group after treatment were all reduced as compared with those before treatment (P<0.01), and SDS score in the observation group was lower than that in the control group (P<0.01). After treatment, in the observation group, the score of each of the symptoms of TCM, i.e. unsound sleep, irritability and hot temper, profuse sputum and sticky feeling in the mouth, bitter taste in the mouth and foul breath, abdominal distention and poor appetite, as well as lassitude was reduced as compared with that before treatment successively (P<0.01), and the scores aforementioned (excepted for the unsound sleep) in the observation group were all lower than the control group (P<0.05). The total effective rates were 83.3% (35/42) in the observation group and 84.4% (38/45) in the control group, without statistical difference in comparison (P>0.05).

Results Of 200 participants, 112 (56%) were men and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 45 (40-55) years. There was random assignment of 100 patients (50%) to the rhG-CSF group and 100 (50%) to the usual care group. Time to clinical improvement was similar between groups (rhG-CSF group median of 12 days (IQR, 10-16 days) vs usual care group median of 13 days (IQR, 11-17 days); hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.95-1.71; P = .06). For secondary end points, the proportion of patients progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, or septic shock was lower in the rhG-CSF group (rhG-CSF group, 2% vs usual care group, 15%; difference, -13%; 95%CI, -21.4% to -5.4%). At 21 days, 2 patients (2%) had died in the rhG-CSF group compared with 10 patients (10%) in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 0.19; 95%CI, 0.04-0.88). At day 5, the lymphocyte cell count was higher in the rhG-CSF group (rhG-CSF group median of 1050/L vs usual care group median of 620/L; Hodges-Lehmann estimate of the difference in medians, 440; 95% CI, 380-490). Serious adverse events, such as sepsis or septic shock, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, occurred in 29 patients (14.5%) in the rhG-CSF group and 42 patients (21%) in the usual care group. Conclusion and Relevance In preliminary findings from a randomized clinical trial, rhG-CSF treatment for patients with COVID-19 with lymphopenia but no comorbidities did not accelerate clinical improvement, but the number of patients developing critical illness or dying may have been reduced.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the emotional well-being of pharmacy students several months from the COVID19 pandemic in the US. Methods: A retrospective study was designed to evaluate the effect of pandemic on second, third- and fourth-year Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students. Data was obtained from an online survey conducted once in November 2019 and once in November 2020. The survey consisted of the Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms-62 (CCAPS-62) questionnaire. Subscales from CCAPS-62 considered in this study included depression, general anxiety (GA), hostility and substance abuse (SA). Raw scores for each subscale was categorized into healthy and clinical. A logistic regression model, adjusted for gender, race, class and physical activity was used to find any association between the pandemic and the probability of each subscale. Results: Overall, 305 and 159 students participated in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Majority of students were female and Asian. The results of adjusted regression model did not show any significant changes in the probability of depression, GA and SA between 2019 and 2020. However, a decrease in hostility was observed (OR=0.66 95%CI=0.43-o.997) in 2020.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, pediatric patients with symptoms of testicular torsion may be reluctant to seek medical care which increases the likelihood of delayed presentation and the need for an orchiectomy. This observational study sought to determine whether there was a higher number of testicular torsion cases during COVID-19. METHODS: As the first patient with COVID-19 was admitted to our facility on March 6, 2020, we identified male children ages 1-18 years with testicular torsion between March 1-December 31, 2020 (during COVID-19) compared to the same time period between 2015 and 2019 (prior to COVID-19). All patients were evaluated at our Institution's Emergency Department by a pediatric urologist. RESULTS: There were 38 cases of testicular torsion between March 1-December 31, 2020 compared to 15.8 cases on average during the same 10-month period between 2015 and 2019 (a total of 79 cases). There was a statistically significant increase in testicular torsion cases during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to equivalent time periods in 2015-2019 (38a?vs. 15.8, pa?=a?0.05). Patients with testicular torsion during the COVID-19 pandemic were younger, had a longer duration of symptoms, and had a higher number of orchiectomies (although not statistically significant). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, an escalation in testicular torsion cases was observed.

METHODS: Between October 2020 and January 2021 this descriptive study recruited a national sample of nurses who worked in the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic through American Association of Critical Care Nurses newsletters and social media. RESULTS: A total of 488 survey responses were received from critical care nurses working in the U.S. during the COVID pandemic. Over two thirds of respondents experienced a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). Nurse respondents reported moderate/high levels of moral distress and burnout. Symptoms of moderate to severe depression and anxiety were reported by 44.6% and 31.1% of respondents, respectively. Forty-seven percent of respondents were at risk for having posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Lack of perceived support from administration and shortage of PPE were associated with higher levels of burnout, moral distress, and PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents had higher anxiety and depression than the general population and higher risk for having PTSD than recent veterans or patients after traumatic injury.

Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) is a rare, indolent Hodgkin lymphoma subtype with distinct clinicopathologic features and treatment paradigms. The neoplastic lymphocyte-predominant cells typically express bright CD20 and other B-cell antigens, which distinguishes them from Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells of lymphocyte-rich classic Hodgkin lymphoma. OBJECTIVE. To characterize the clinicopathologic features of CD20-negative NLPHL at a single institution. DESIGN. A retrospective search for CD20-negative NLPHL in our pathology archives and medical records was conducted. RESULTS. Of 486 NLPHL patients identified with CD20 available for review, 14 (2.8%) had LP cells with absent CD20 expression. Patients with prior rituximab administration (n = 7) and insufficient clinical history (n = 1) were excluded, leaving 6 patients with rituximab-na?ve, CD20-negative NLPHL. A broad immunohistochemical panel showed the LP cells in all cases expressed B-cell antigens, particularly Oct-2, although PAX5 and CD79a were frequently also dim. CD30, CD15, and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNAs were negative in all evaluated cases. Two patients had high-risk variant immunoarchitectural pattern D. One patient had extranodal disease, involving the spleen and bone, and was suspected to have large cell transformation. Standard NLPHL therapy was given, including local radiation and/or chemotherapy. Of 5 patients with available follow-up, 4 are alive in complete remission after therapy, and 1 is alive with relapsed disease. CONCLUSIONS. NLPHL can lack CD20 de novo without prior rituximab therapy. In such cases, extensive immunophenotyping helps distinguish NLPHL from lymphocyte-rich classic Hodgkin lymphoma, which differ in clinical behavior and therapy. In our series, CD20-negative NLPHL showed both classic and variant histologic patterns and the expected range of clinical behavior seen in NLPHL, including 1 case with suspected large cell transformation.","output":"CD20-Negative Nodular Lymphocyte-Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma: A 20-Year Consecutive Case Series From a Tertiary Cancer Center."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many biologic matrices and synthetic meshes are available as adjuncts for prosthetic and autologous breast reconstructions to help control implant position and to reinforce abdominal flap donor sites.

METHODS A lung model was used to simulate representative compliance (mL/cmH2O): resistance (cmH2O/L/s) combinations, 45:5 for N and BI, 60:7.7 for COPD, 15:7.7 and 35:7.7 for ARDS. Two levels of PEEP (cmH2O) were used for each scenario, 12/16 for ARDS, and 5/10 for others. The CO2 productions of 2, 3, 4 and 5 mL/kg predicted body weight/min were simulated. Tidal volume was set to 6 mL/kg during VC and PC. Outcomes of interest were end tidal CO2 (etCO2) and plateau pressure (P Plat). RESULTS EtCO2 levels in N and BI and COPD were similar for all modes. In ARDS, etCO2 was higher in ASVCO2 than in other modes (p < 0.001). Under all mechanical conditions ASVCO2 revealed a narrower range of etCO2. P Plat was similar for all modes in all scenarios but ARDS where P Plat in ASV and ASVCO2 were lower than in VC (p = 0.001). When P Plat was  28 cmH2O, P plat in ASV and ASVCO2 were lower than in VC and PC (p = 0.024). CONCLUSION All modes performed similarly in most cases. Minor differences observed were in favor of the closed loop modes. Overall, ASVCO2 maintained tighter CO2 control.

It is possible to discern certain distinct AKI syndromes in the tropics, like febrile illness with AKI, envenomation-related AKI, and obstetric AKI, where the patients develop AKI along with a typical constellation of clinical features, allowing more specific and quick diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Changes in disease epidemiology and ongoing socioeconomic transitions in the tropics are reflected in changing epidemiology of tropical AKI. While the incidence of obstetric AKI has shown a steady decline, HIV-associated AKI emerged as a significant entity in regions where HIV was endemic in the past few decades. There is better recognition of scrub typhus as a significant contributor to AKI with availability of better diagnostic techniques, and it is well recognized that the epidemiology of AKI associated with post-infectious glomerulonephritis is different in the tropics. Rapid urbanization has made large swaths of population susceptible to emerging infections like dengue fever, with increased incidence of AKI.

Sleep disturbances have been shown to be associated with poor clinical outcomes, such as a greater risk of cardiovascular disease and increasing mortality. Critically ill patients, particularly those receiving mechanical ventilation, may be more susceptible to sleep disruption. METHODS AND RESULTS Mechanical ventilation is an important factor influencing sleep in critically ill patients as it may have positive or negative effects, depending on patient population, mode, and specific settings. Other causes of sleep disruption include the acute illness itself, the daily routine care, and the effects of medications. Improving sleep in patients admitted to an intensive care unit has the potential to improve both short- and long-term clinical outcomes. In this article we review the specific aspects of sleep in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients, including abnormal sleep patterns and loss of circadian rhythm, as well as the effects of mechanical ventilation and intravenous sedatives on sleep quality and quantity.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: For this study we used a cohort of runners participating in an ongoing randomized controlled trial on running injury prevention among recreational runners. At baseline, demographic and training variables were collected. Seven weeks after starting the lockdown, information on running behavior (interval training, training with partner and physical distancing during training) and running habits (training frequency, duration, distance and speed) were obtained. Furthermore, healthcare utilization and symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 were assessed. To determine the association between running and symptoms suggestive for COVID-19, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of the 2586 included participants, 2427 (93.9%) participants continued running during lockdown with no significant changes in mean weekly training variables. A total of 253 participants (9.8%) experienced symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 and 10 participants tested positive for COVID-19. Two participants were admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 with both one day of admission. Running behavior and running habits were not associated with the onset of symptoms suggestive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The large majority of runners in the Netherlands did not change their running habits during lockdown. No association between running behavior or running habits and onset of symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 was identified. This implicates that running outdoor during lockdown does not negatively affect health of runners.","output":"Running behavior and symptoms of respiratory tract infection during the COVID-19 pandemic: A large prospective Dutch cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To compile current best practices regarding tracheostomy decision making, care, and technical performance during the global COVID-19 pandemic Data Sources: Articles listed in PubMed and Google sources for up-to-date information Review Methods: All sources presenting objective evidence related to the topic were reviewed and distilled Conclusions: Tracheostomy in patients with coronavirus disease should be a rare event yet one that requires significant decision making and procedural deliberation Indications for surgery must be balanced by risk of disease transmission to health care workers Considerations are given to personal protective equipment, viral testing, and alternatives Implications for Practice: Otolaryngologists worldwide must be aware of these considerations to provide safe patient care without undue risk to themselves or their hospital coworkers","output":"Tracheostomy Considerations during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A well-known characteristic of pandemics such as COVID-19 is the high level of transmission heterogeneity in the infection spread: not all infected individuals spread the disease at the same rate and some individuals (superspreaders) are responsible for most of the infections.

In 21 healthy immunocompetent subjects all of whom demonstrated circulating IgG antibodies 4 months after mRNA1273 or BNT162b vaccination, a) the strength of S-IgG was stable while RBD-IgG declined, b) S2-reactive B-cell frequencies increased progressively (p=0.002) c) S1-reactive CD8+T-cells and CD19+B-cells were undetectable after a transient increase, and d) monocytic and polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSC, PMN-MDSC) increased after the first vaccine dose. Compared with 4-month measurements from immunocompetent subjects, single samples from 20 vaccinated immunocompromised (IC) subjects revealed a) circulating S-IgG and RBD-IgG in 13 (65%) and 9 (45%) subjects, respectively, b) no differences in S2-reactive T- and B-cells, c) undetectable S1-reactive T- and B-cells, and d) fewer S-reactive CD8+T-cells and CD19+B-cells (p<0.05). Among 11 IC recipients who failed to make RBD-IgG, frequencies of PMN-MDSC were significantly higher (p<0.0004) compared with IC or immunocompetent subjects with RBD-IgG. COVID-19 vaccination induces stable antibodies to the spike protein and expands circulating B-cells reactive to the conserved spike protein sequence in immunocompetent subjects.

This study investigates the influence of the HCL on glycemic control in children and adolescents with T1D in a real-life setting during the first year on HCL. METHODS This retrospective study included all the patients (n=111) aged 3 to 16 years with T1D who initiated the HCL system between 1st of December 2018 and 1st of December 2019 in the Helsinki University Hospital. Time in range (TIR), HbA1c, mean sensor glucose (SG) value, time below range (TBR), and SG coefficient of variance (CV) were measured at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The changes over time were analyzed with a repeated mixed model adjusted with baseline glycemic control. RESULTS After the initiation of HCL, all measures of glycemic control, except HbA1c, improved and the effect lasted throughout the study period. Between 0 and 12 months, TIR increased (=-2.5 [95%CI: -3.6-(-1.3)], p<0.001), whereas mean SG values (=-0.7 [95%CI: -0.9-(-0.4)]), TBR (=-2.5 [95%CI: -3.6-(-1.3)]), and SG CV (=-4.5 [95%CI: -6.3-[-2.8]) decreased significantly (p<0.001). Importantly, the changes occurred regardless of the age of the patient. CONCLUSIONS Measurements of glycemic control, except HbA1c, improved significantly after the initiation of the HCL system and the favorable effect lasted throughout the follow-up.

The angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key host membrane-bound protein that modulates ALI induced by viral infection, pulmonary acid aspiration, and sepsis. However, the contributions of ACE2 sequence variants to individual differences in disease risk and severity after viral infection are not understood. In this study, we quantified H1N1 influenza-infected lung transcriptomes across a family of 41 BXD recombinant inbred strains of mice and both parents-C57BL/6J and DBA/2J. In response to infection Ace2 mRNA levels decreased significantly for both parental strains and the expression levels was associated with disease severity (body weight loss) and viral load (expression levels of viral NA segment) across the BXD family members. Pulmonary RNA-seq for 43 lines was analyzed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and Bayesian network approaches. Ace2 not only participated in virus-induced ALI by interacting with TNF, MAPK, and NOTCH signaling pathways, but was also linked with high confidence to gene products that have important functions in the pulmonary epithelium, including Rnf128, Muc5b, and Tmprss2. Comparable sets of transcripts were also highlighted in parallel studies of human SARS-CoV-infected primary human airway epithelial cells. Using conventional mapping methods, we determined that weight loss at two and three days after viral infection maps to chromosome X-the location of Ace2. This finding motivated the hierarchical Bayesian network analysis, which defined molecular endophenotypes of lung infection linked to Ace2 expression and to a key disease outcome. Core members of this Bayesian network include Ace2, Atf4, Csf2, Cxcl2, Lif, Maml3, Muc5b, Reg3g, Ripk3, and Traf3. Collectively, these findings define a causally-rooted Ace2 modulatory network relevant to host response to viral infection and identify potential therapeutic targets for virus-induced respiratory diseases, including those caused by influenza and coronaviruses.","output":"Genetic Dissection of the Regulatory Mechanisms of Ace2 in the Infected Mouse Lung"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Attempts to mitigate the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID) have disrupted the delivery of nonCpandemic care. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the COVID pandemic on surgical volume and variety at an academic oral and maxillofacial surgery program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the surgical logs of the University of Pennsylvania, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery from January 2012 through January 2021. Each record identified patient demographics and case classifications. The study predictor was timing of care, which was divided into pre-pandemic, peak pandemic, or post-peak pandemic. The primary study outcomes were the monthly procedure count and the procedure categories. The secondary dependent variables were patient age and race. Multivariate and univariate analyses of variance were used to determine whether pandemic effects existed within outcome groups. RESULTS: The final sample included 64,709 surgical procedures. Before, during, and after the pandemic peak, there were means of 691.0, 209.0, and 789.4 procedures per time period, respectively (P < .01). There was significantly more infection (baseline 2.2%, peak 6.0%, post-peak 2.0%, P < .01) and trauma (baseline 5.3%, peak 26.7%, post-peak 3.9%, P < .01) cases during the pandemic peak. The mean percentage of pediatric patients increased during the peak and post-peak periods (baseline 2.4%, peak 12.9%, post-peak 10.2%, P < .01). No differences were observed among the mean percentage of White (P = .12), Black (P = .21), and Hispanic (P = .25) patients treated. CONCLUSIONS: Along with a predictable decline in surgical numbers, a greater proportion of infection and trauma procedures were performed at the pandemic's peak. Despite these changes, surgery volume normalized and case variety returned to pre-pandemic levels in the post-peak period. Our study suggests that the addition of COVID restrictions did not change the case volume or variety in the months after the initial crisis.","output":"How has the COVID Pandemic Impacted the Clinical Volume and Variety of an Academic Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Program?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The literature highlights Twitter as a vital instrument tool for health policy-makers for health communication and promotion.

Thirteen out of the twenty-seven European countries already have 3Rs Centres. These support the development, acceptance, and/or implementation of methods that address the 3Rs principle at a research and educational level. To date, Ireland has no 3Rs centre. In this commentary, we present the reasons for Ireland to embrace the creation of a national Irish 3Rs Centre. We believe the centre will enable Ireland to be ready for the paradigm shift that is internationally occurring in biomedical research, towards the modernisation and replacement of tests carried out in animals when it is scientifically possible to do so. ABSTRACT: Since its publication, the 3Rs principle has provided a cornerstone for more ethical and humane biomedical and regulatory research. In Europe, the 3Rs principle has been incorporated into the European Directive 63/2010/EU, with the ultimate aim of fully replacing the procedures on live animals for scientific and educational purposes as soon as it is scientifically possible to do so. Thus, a critical shift in the discussion on animal use in biomedical and regulatory research is undergoing in Europe, a discussion where satisfying the replacement principle is becoming more and more defined as a scientific rather than ethical need. 3Rs Centres have been established in recent years across Europe. To date, Ireland has no 3Rs Centre, and the uptake of the 3Rs principle, and in particular of the replacement aspect, has been slow. In this Commentary, we present the Irish context of the use of animal models in biomedical and regulatory research, and urge for what, in the authors opinion, are the most critical actions that Ireland must undertake to align its biomedical (basic, applied and translational) research with the European 3Rs strategy.","output":"The Case for Modernizing Biomedical Research in Ireland through the Creation of an Irish 3Rs Centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the increasing global human population, travel, and socioeconomic activities, more and more novel pathogenic viruses will emerge or re-emerge.

In addition, both cases depicted a severe form of infection than the initial one. Laboratory investigations revealed these patients were unable to produce COVID-19 antibodies, even though one of the patients received convalescent plasma. CONCLUSION Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of relapsing COVID-19, especially in immunosuppressed patients.

The presence of the tracer was measured at 90 sites on the dental unit and the surrounding surfaces of the operatory environment. Results All tested instruments spread the tracer over the entire dental unit and the surrounding environment, including the walls and ceiling.

Relevant studies from the search and other data sources on COVID-19 surveillance strategies and associated challenges in 13 African countries (Mauritius, Algeria, Nigeria, Angola, Cote dIvoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Ethiopia, South Africa, Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania, and Uganda) were identified and reviewed. Results: Our findings revealed that the selected African countries have ramped up COVID-19 surveillance ranging from immediate case notification, virological surveillance, hospital-based surveillance to mortality surveillance among others. Despite this, there exist variations in the level of implementation of the surveillance systems across countries. Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy is also being leveraged in some African countries, but the implementation across countries remains uneven. Our study also revealed various challenges facing surveillance which included shortage of skilled human resources resulting in poor data management, weak health systems, complexities of ethical considerations, diagnostic insufficiency, the burden of co-epidemic surveillance, and geographical barriers, among others. Conclusion: With the variations in the level of implementation of COVID-19 surveillance strategies seen across countries, it is pertinent to ensure proper coordination of the surveillance activities in the African countries and address all the challenges facing COVID-19 surveillance using tailored strategies.","output":"COVID-19 surveillance systems in African countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Antimalarial drugs (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) are widely used for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, these drugs may have side effects such as hearing loss. This study aimed to describe the hearing function in SLE patients using antimalarials. Secondarily, this study aimed to investigate whether SLE causes hearing loss and if there are any serological or clinical aspects of this diseases associated with inner ear damage. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: This study included 84 individuals (43 SLE patients and 41 controls) with audiometry and tympanometry tests. Epidemiological, clinical, serological, and treatment profiles of SLE patients were extracted from the charts. RESULTS: SLE patients had more sensorineural hearing loss than controls (23.2% vs. 0; P = .001). Pure-tone averages in SLE patients using antimalarials and not using antimalarials were similar (8.75 vs. 8.75; P = .63). At 8,000 Hz, antimalarial dug nonusers performed worse than users (10.00 vs. 22.50; P = .03). Tympanometry was normal in all participants. SLE serological and clinical profiles in patients with and without hearing loss were the same (all P = nonsignificant).

This is possibly because many interventions for child mental health lie outside the realm of narrowly defined biomedical interventions and platforms, with the majority of interventions targeting psychological and social mechanisms and a strong emphasis on prevention. This situation must change, however, as child mental health interventions have potentially the greatest impact on the burden of mental disorders, and other health and social outcomes, than at any other time in the life course. There is now a growing body of evidence that indicates which interventions are ready for scale-up or show sufficient promise for further research and refinement. These are primarily delivered in community or school platforms through nonspecialist workers in partnership with parents and teachers. They include interventions to promote early child development, parenting interventions through childhood into adolescence, school interventions aimed at reengineering school environments and strengthening life skills, and interventions for the early detection and management of neurodevelopmental disorders and mental health problems through trans-diagnostic interventions based on impairments. Above all, what is needed is a population-based approach, which emphasizes the goal of coverage of evidence-based interventions for all children; with a particular focus on disadvantaged children; with seamless coordination of preventive and treatment interventions across platforms of care; and utilizing collaborative, stepped-care delivery paradigms.","output":"Editorial Commentary: An agenda for global child mental health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: We investigated an outbreak of influenza-like illness (ILI) at a boarding school in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. We aimed to confirm the etiological agent, estimate attack rates and identify risk factors for illness. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including senior school boarders (n=308). Students with ILI (cough and fever) were identified through school medical records. We also conducted a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study among senior students including boarders (n=107) and day students (n=45). We collected respiratory specimens for respiratory pathogen testing by real-time polymerase chain reaction from a subset of symptomatic students. We calculated attack rates of medically attended ILI (medILI) and identified factors associated with medILI using logistic regression. We calculated seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medILI. RESULTS: Influenza A (H3N2) virus was detected in 61% (23/38) of specimens. Attack rate for medILI was 13% among boarders (39/308) in the cohort study and 20% in both day students (9/45) and boarders (21/107) in the cross-sectional study. Playing squash was associated with medILI (aOR 5.35, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.68-17.07). Of the boarders, 19% (57/308) were vaccinated before the outbreak. The adjusted VE against medILI was 18% (aOR 0.82, 95% CI 0.38-1.78). The outbreak led to cancellation of several events and the need for academic remedial sessions. CONCLUSION: We confirmed an influenza A (H3N2) virus outbreak with a high attack rate. The outbreak affected academic and sports activities. Participation in sports and social gatherings while experiencing ILI should be discouraged to reduce viral transmission and impact on school activities.","output":"Outbreak of influenza A in a boarding school in South Africa, 2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The drastic changes during the COVID-19 pandemic may have a negative impact on the psychological wellbeing of children and adolescents. OBJECTIVES: COPSY is the first national, representative German study to examine mental health and quality of life of children and adolescents during the pandemic. Results are compared with data of the representative longitudinal BELLA study conducted before the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Internationally established instruments for measuring health-related quality of life and mental health (including anxiety and depressive symptoms) were administered to na?= 1586 parents with 7- to 17-year-old children and adolescents, of whom na?= 1040 11- to 17-year-olds also provided self-reports, from 26 May to 10 June 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and bivariate tests. RESULTS: Seventy-one percent of the children and adolescents and 75% of the parents felt burdened by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to the time before the pandemic, the children and adolescents reported a lower health-related quality of life, the percentage of children and adolescents with mental health problems almost doubled, and their health behavior worsened. Socially disadvantaged children felt particularly burdened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Two-thirds of the parents would like to receive support in coping with their child during the pandemic.

Members of the L-antigen (LAGE) family participate in the development of various cancers, but their expressions and prognostic values in breast cancer remain to be clarified. High-throughput methods for exploring disease progression mechanisms might play a pivotal role in the improvement of novel therapeutics. Therefore, gene expression profiles and clinical data of LAGE family members were acquired from the cBioportal database, followed by verification using the Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. In addition, the Kaplan-Meier method was applied to explore correlations between expressions of LAGE family members and prognoses of breast cancer patients. MetaCore, GlueGo, and GluePedia were used to comprehensively study the transcript expression signatures of LAGEs and their co-expressed genes together with LAGE-related signal transduction pathways in BRCA. The result indicated that higher LAGE3 messenger (m)RNA expressions were observed in BRCA tissues than in normal tissues, and they were also associated with the stage of BRCA patients. Kaplan-Meier plots showed that overexpression of LAGE1, LAGE2A, LAGE2B, and LAGE3 were highly correlated to poor survival in most types of breast cancer. Significant associations of LAGE family genes were correlated with the cell cycle, focal adhesion, and extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interactions as indicated by functional enrichment analyses. Collectively, LAGE family members gene expression levels were related to adverse clinicopathological factors and prognoses of BRCA patients; therefore, LAGEs have the potential to serve as prognosticators of BRCA patients.","output":"Analysis of LAGEs Family Gene Signature and Prognostic Relevance in Breast Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 negatively impacts social determinants of health that contribute to disparities for people living with HIV.

Here, we propose an EOS-based multiphase lattice Boltzmann model, in which the nonideal force is directly evaluated by EOSs. This multiphase model is used to model the pulmonary airway reopening and study aerosol formation during exhalation. The numerical model is first validated with the simulations of Fujioka et al.(2008). and the result is in reasonable agreement with their study. Furthermore, two rupture cases with and without aerosol formation are contrasted and analyzed. It is found that the injury on the epithelium in the case with aerosol formation is essentially the same that of without aerosol formation even while the pressure drop in airway increases by about 67%. Then extensive simulations are performed to investigate the effects of pressure drop, thickness of liquid plug and film on aerosol size and the mechanical stresses. The results show that aerosol size and the mechanical stresses increase as the pressure drop enlarges and thickness of liquid plug become thicken, while aerosol size and the mechanical stresses decrease as thickness of liquid film is thicken.

Amino acids asparagine (r = 0.1765, p < 0.001) and serine (r = 0.1186, p < 0.05) were found to have a strong positive correlation with TSH. Valine, leucine, and arginine (p < 0.05) also exhibited a significant positive correlation with serum levels of T4 and FT4. No other significant correlations were observed with other micronutrients. Our study suggests strong evidence for the association of the levels of micronutrients with thyroid markers with a special note on the effect of serum levels of certain amino acids.","output":"Effect of Micronutrients on Thyroid Parameters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious health problem worldwide. Evaluating liver injury in patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) with detectable HBV DNA and normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is crucial to guide their clinical management. We aimed to investigate the stages of liver inflammation and fibrosis as well as the predictive accuracy of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-to-platelet ratio (GPR) in these patients. Methods A total of 184 treatment-na?ve HBeAg-negative CHB patients with detectable HBV DNA and normal ALT were enrolled. The Scheuer scoring system was used to classify liver inflammation and fibrosis. Results The distribution of patients with different liver inflammation grades were as follows: G0, 0 (0%); G1, 97 (52.7%); G2, 68 (37.0%); G3, 12 (6.5%); and G4, 7 (3.8%). The distribution of patients with different liver fibrosis stages were as follows: S0, 22 (12.0%); S1, 72 (39.1%); S2, 42 (22.8%); S3, 19 (10.3%); and S4, 29 (15.8%). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves of GPR in predicting significant inflammation, severe inflammation, and advanced inflammation were 0.723, 0.895, and 0.952, respectively. The accuracy of GPR was significantly superior to that of ALT in predicting liver inflammation. The AUROCs of GPR in predicting significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and cirrhosis were 0.691, 0.780, and 0.803, respectively. The predictive accuracy of GPR was significantly higher than that of aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis index based on four factors (FIB-4) in identifying advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, and it was superior to FIB-4 but comparable to APRI in identifying significant fibrosis. Conclusions Nearly half of the HBeAg-negative CHB patients with detectable HBV DNA and normal ALT levels had significant liver inflammation or fibrosis. GPR can serve as an accurate predictor of liver inflammation and fibrosis in these patients.","output":"Gamma-glutamyl Transpeptidase to Platelet Ratio Predicts Liver Injury in Hepatitis B e Antigen-negative Chronic Hepatitis B Patients With Normal Alanine Aminotransferase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID)-2019 has been affected many people all around the world Patients with mental disorders are not as safe as others;also, they might be more vulnerable in such situations These patients take various medications, which can lead to numerous drug-drug interactions with experimental drugs uses against COVID-19 According to the potential critical interactions, we reviewed the reputable databases to find the interactions between main categories of psychiatric medications (e g , antidepressants, anti-psychotics, sedative/hypnotics, and mood stabilizers) when used in concomitant with COVID-19 experimental agents (e g , hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir, and chloroquine) We hope the list provided in this review helps the clinical care staff in treating patients with mental illness infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Drug-drug interaction between psychiatric medications and experimental treatments forcoronavirusdisease-19:A mini-review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted all wakes of lives in many countries including Sri Lanka, an island nation in the South Asian region.

However, consumer behaviors need to be studied in terms of satisfaction and the intention to purchase and re-purchase according to the online shopping process because online shopping platforms still have influenced their usage behaviors. This work proposes a retentive consumer behavior assessment model of the online shopping platforms through integration of Technology Acceptance Model and Online Purchase Decision-Making Process with two input factors: Trust and Quality. A questionnaire designed according to all factors from the proposed conceptual model is used to collect data from a sample group. The participants of this study are 384 respondents who have experienced using online shopping platforms. The data is used to analyze causal relationships through the use of structural equation modeling. The results showed that the proposed model can be explained for the relationship with consistent E-Business platforms affecting purchase and continue to purchase (re-purchase or recommend) behaviors of online trading users, and it also can be used to assess purchasing behaviors and repeating purchases of online consumers through 3 types of E-businesses: E-commerce, M-commerce, and S-commerce.

METHODS Single institution retrospective analysis of all cases from 1 April 2008 to 31 Dec 2019. RESULTS Overall, 34 patients (38 tumours) underwent transgastric laparo-endoscopic resection. Of these, 27 (71.1%) and 5 (14.7%) cases were located close to the GOJ and pylorus respectively. Three (8.0%) cases were converted to conventional laparoscopic excision. No anatomical gastric resection was required. The mean (SD) operative time was 167.5 (64.2) minutes and reduced with increasing experience. The median (IQR) length-of-stay was 3.0 (3.0-4.5) days. Major post-operative complication (Clavian-Dindo 3) occurred in 1 (2.9%) patient, which required surgical control of staple line bleeding. The most common pathology was gastrointestinal stromal tumour (71.1%), followed by leiomyoma (10.5%), schwannoma (5.2%), dysplastic polyp (5.2%), and neuroendocrine tumour (2.6%). The mean (SD) tumour diameter was 3.9 (2.1) cm (largest 10.1 cm, 10 cases >5 cm). Resection margins were clear in all cases. We found no evidence of tumour recurrence or gastric stenosis at a median follow-up of 88 months. CONCLUSION Transgastric laparo-endoscopic resection of junctional and pyloric tumours with low metastatic potential is technically feasible.

The syndromes of pulmonary aspergillosis complicating severe viral infections are distinct from classic invasive aspergillosis, which is recognized most frequently in persons with neutropenia and in other immunocompromised persons. Combined with severe viral infection, aspergillosis comprises a constellation of airway-invasive and angio-invasive disease and results in risks associated with poor airway fungus clearance and killing, including virus- or inflammation-associated epithelial damage, systemic immunosuppression, and underlying lung disease. Radiologic abnormalities can vary, reflecting different pathologies.

Substantial differences in the time series and variability have been observed over different zones of India in different atmospheric layers. The changes observed in these species are large over Central India compared to South India and Indo-Gangetic plain regions. An enhancement in CO (~25C40%) and WV (50C60%) has been noticed over Central India in the UT at 147 hPa and 215 hPa, respectively, during lockdown. The strong updrafts before the lockdown and the extended weak zonal wind aloft over this region are found responsible for the observed enhancement in these trace gases in the UT.

In previous reports we hypothesized that the worse outcome of the COVID-19 disease in diabetes mellitus condition could be related to the non-enzymatic glycation of ACE2 receptor and an in silico evaluation led to the demonstration that the number of interactions is decreased in comparison to the unmodified model, possibly shifting the virus attack through different, multiple alternative entry routes. Given the evidenced features of this variant, we aimed to investigate with a computational approach the characteristics of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 with respect to its binding to human ACE-2 receptor, in a particular population, namely people affected by diabetes mellitus, at risk for unfavorable outcomes of the COVID-19. The computational analysis, considering the case in which all the lysine residues in the system are subjected to non-enzymatic glycation, confirmed that lysine glycation causes a general loss of interactivity between wild-type (WT)-Spike-RBD and ACE2. In the Omicron variant, Lys417 mutates into an asparagine, preventing the possible non-enzymatic glycation of this residue. Therefore, if non-enzymatic glycation seemed to cause a shift in the way in which the virus enters the cell from the ACE2-mediated mechanism to other pathways, in the case of the Omicron variant the ACE2-mediated approach of the virus seems to remain an important event to take into account. Indeed, interaction profile analysis, together with molecular mechanicsCgeneralized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) calculations, suggests that the Omicron-Spike-RBD maintains a higher affinity for ACE2 subsequently to non-enzymatic glycation with respect to WT-Spike-RBD. The finding of the present computational study may suggest a different clinical relevance of the Omicron variant for the diabetes mellitus field, also in the possible direction of a lower severity of the disease.","output":"Omicron Variant of SARS-CoV-2 Virus: In Silico Evaluation of the Possible Impact on People Affected by Diabetes Mellitus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Neurosurgical patients with stroke, trauma, and brain tumors can be among the victims of the COVID-19 pandemic in developing countries, which need to be managed efficiently Methods: This is an overview of neurosurgical nurses' challenges and strategies in the current COVID-19 pandemic environment in developing countries Results: Here, we reviewed the unique challenges of providing neurosurgical nursing services during the COVID-19 pandemic in developing countries We address specific issues such as transferring neurosurgical patients, allocating medical supplies, prioritizing neurosurgical services, COVID-19 testing protocols, and patient triage (emergent vs urgent vs delayed surgery) Teleconsultation, telenursing services for outpatient treatment, follow-up and virtual teaching strategies associated with neurosurgical nursing are discussed Conclusion: Neurosurgical nursing during the COVID-19 pandemic in developing countries requires transparent planning, implementation, and careful consideration of various telemedicine strategies","output":"Challenges posed by COVID-19 and neurosurgical nursing strategies in developing countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Screening and diagnostic tests are applied for the classification of people into diseased and non-diseased populations.

METHODS: Data on confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 for 2,814 US counties were obtained from Johns Hopkins University. We used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map the spatial aspects of this pandemic and investigate the disparities between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan communities. Multiple regression models were used to explore the contextual risk factors of infections and death across US counties. We included population density, percent of population aged 65+, percent population in poverty, percent minority population, and percent of the uninsured as independent variables. A state-level measure of the percent of the population that has been tested for COVID-19 was used to control for the impact of testing. FINDINGS: The impact of COVID-19 in the United States has been extremely uneven. Although densely populated large cities and their surrounding metropolitan areas are hotspots of the pandemic, it is counterintuitive that incidence and mortality rates in some small cities and nonmetropolitan counties approximate those in epicenters such as New York City. Regression analyses support the hypotheses of positive correlations between COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates and socioeconomic factors including population density, proportions of elderly residents, poverty, and percent population tested.

The aim of this study was to identify potential novel lead compounds against EBOV VP35 using computational techniques in drug discovery. The 3D structure of the EBOV VP35 with PDB ID: 3FKE was used for molecular docking studies. An integrated library of 7675 African natural product was pre-filtered using ADMET risk, with a threshold of 7 and, as a result, 1470 ligands were obtained for the downstream molecular docking using AutoDock Vina, after an energy minimization of the protein via GROMACS. Five known inhibitors, namely, amodiaquine, chloroquine, gossypetin, taxifolin and EGCG were used as standard control compounds for this study. The area under the curve (AUC) value, evaluating the docking protocol obtained from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, generated was 0.72, which was considered to be acceptable. The four identified potential lead compounds of NANPDB4048, NANPDB2412, ZINC000095486250 and NANPDB2476 had binding affinities of ?8.2, ?8.2, ?8.1 and ?8.0 kcal/mol, respectively, and were predicted to possess desirable antiviral activity including the inhibition of RNA synthesis and membrane permeability, with the probable activity (Pa) being greater than the probable inactivity (Pi) values. The predicted anti-EBOV inhibition efficiency values (IC(50)), found using a random forest classifier, ranged from 3.35 to 11.99 M, while the Ki values ranged from 0.97 to 1.37 M. The compounds NANPDB4048 and NANPDB2412 had the lowest binding energy of ?8.2 kcal/mol, implying a higher binding affinity to EBOV VP35 which was greater than those of the known inhibitors.

Ongoing concerns of emergent variants include possible recombinants, as genome recombination is an important evolutionary mechanism for the emergence and re-emergence of human viral pathogens. Although recombination events among SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV were well-documented, it has been difficult to detect the recombination signatures in SARS-CoV-2 variants due to their high degree of sequence similarity. In this study, we identified diverse recombination events between two Omicron major subvariants (BA.1 and BA.2) and other variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs), suggesting that co-infection and subsequent genome recombination play important roles in the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Through scanning high-quality completed Omicron spike gene sequences, eighteen core mutations of BA.1 variants (frequency >99%) were identified (eight in NTD, five near the S1/S2 cleavage site, and five in S2). BA.2 variants share three additional amino acid deletions with the Alpha variants. BA.1 subvariants share nine common amino acid mutations (three more than BA.2) in the spike protein with most VOCs, suggesting a possible recombination origin of Omicron from these VOCs. There are three more Alpha-related mutations (del69-70, del144) in BA.1 than BA.2, and therefore BA.1 may be phylogenetically closer to the Alpha variant. Revertant mutations are found in some dominant mutations (frequency >95%) in the BA.1 subvariant. Most notably, multiple additional amino acid mutations in the Delta spike protein were also identified in the recently emerged Omicron isolates, which implied possible recombination events occurred between the Omicron and Delta variants during the on-going pandemic.

We tested whether CD26/DPP4 deficiency leads to reduced inflammation and decreased structural damage when infected with PA. METHODS: CD26/DPP4(+) and CD26/DPP4(?) rats were instilled intratracheally with NaCl (controls) or with PA. Six hours later, bacterial distribution was detected with the in vivo imaging system 200 (IVIS). Lungs were then processed for molecular biology, light and electron microscopy and analyzed qualitatively, quantitatively and stereologically. Bacterial numbers were determined in homogenized lungs. RESULTS: Compared to saline treated controls, in both infected groups (1) the acinar airspace was significantly increased, (2) the volume density of the alveolar epithelium was significantly decreased, (3) the septal thickness was significantly reduced, (4) more than 40% of the alveolar epithelial surface was damaged, and up to 36% of the epithelial surface was covered with edema. In infected CD26(?) rats, the increase in lung weight was significantly less pronounced, the portion of edematous alveolar airspace was significantly lower and the part of edema interspersed with PA was decreased significantly.

While the originally developed protocols for benzylic C-H functionalization in diarylmethanes employing base-mediated and metal-catalyzed strategies are still actively used, they are joined by a new array of metal-free conditions, offering milder and benign conditions. With the recent surge of interest towards the synthesis of functionalized diarylmethanes, numerous choices are now available for a synthetic organic chemist to transform the benzylic C-H bond to C-C or C-X bond offering the synthesis of any molecule of choice. This review highlights benzylic methylene (CH2 ) functionalizations of diaryl/heteroarylmethanes utilizing various base-mediated, transition-metal-catalyzed, and transition-metal free approaches for the synthesis of structurally diverse important organic molecules, often with a high chemo-, regio- and enantio-selectivity.

Steaming is an important step prior to drying in the processing of C. deserticola. This research investigated the effects of high-humidity hot air impingement steaming (HHAIS) parameters such as temperature, time, and relative humidity (RH) on drying characteristics, weight loss, color, microstructure, and active components of C. deserticola slices. The results showed that the steaming process caused a weight loss in C. deserticola; however, increasing the RH reduced the weight loss. Starch gelatinization observed from the microstructure of the steamed samples explained their long drying time. The Page model can well fit the drying process with a high R 2 (>0.956) under the drying conditions of 60C and 6 m/s. Steaming increased the content of phenylethanoid glycosides, and the highest content was obtained at 95C and 60% RH for 20 min, 75C and 70% RH for 20 min, and 75C and 60% RH for 30 min. The steamed samples appeared in an oil black color. When the color difference (E) values were in the range of 16.79-20.12, the contents of echinacoside and acteoside reached the maximum.

Specific amendments to the Dutch national infection control guidelines were promulgated. This study aimed to map the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on providing oral health care during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 in the Netherlands. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey was sent via email to a representative sample of dental hygienists and dentists in the Netherlands. RESULTS: Of the 1,700 oral health care practitioners approached, 440 (25.9%) responded to the survey. Patient access to oral health care was severely restricted during the lockdown in the Spring of 2020. A total of 1.6% of the oral health care practitioners had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during the study period, although this is likely to be an underrepresentation due to limited access to testing. Over half of the participants perceived an increased risk of virus transmission during aerosol-generating treatments in their practices. A large majority (65.0 C 87.1%) of the oral health care practitioners followed the COVID-19-specific amendments to the national infection control guidelines. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, additional personal protective equipment and protocols were applied. Factors related with compliance with the additional recommendations were age, employment status and occupation. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic had a profound impact on both the accessibility and practice of oral health care. This survey study found that most Dutch oral health care practitioners paid extra attention to hygiene and infection control. Also, a low number of COVID-19 infections detected amongst Dutch oral health care practitioners was reported in the Netherlands.

We examined how exposure to immunization information sources may be associated with vaccination uptake in Sierra Leone. METHODS: In 2019, a household survey was conducted using multistage cluster sampling to randomly select 621 caregivers of children aged 12C23 months in 4 districts in Sierra Leone. We measured exposure to various sources of immunization information and 2 outcomes: (1) vaccination confidence using an aggregate score (from 12 Likert items, informed by previously validated scale) that was dichotomized into a binary variable; (2) uptake of the third dose of diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus-hepatitis B-Haemophilus influenzae type-b-pentavalent vaccine (penta-3) based on card record or through caregiver recall when card was unavailable. Associations between information sources and the outcomes were examined using modified Poisson regression with robust variance estimator. RESULTS: Weighted estimate for penta-3 uptake was 81% (75.2%C85.5%). The likelihood of uptake of penta-3 was significantly greater when caregiver received information from health facilities (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR]=1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.1, 1.5), faith leaders (aPR=1.16, 95% CI=1.1, 1.3), and community health workers (aPR=1.13, 95% CI=1.003, 1.3). Exposure to greater number of information sources was associated with high penta-3 uptake (aPR=1.05, 95% CI=1.02, 1.1). DISCUSSION: Immunization information received during health facility visits and through engagement with religious leaders may enhance vaccination uptake.

A multi-agent classifier successfully identified functional binding dynamics that are evolutionarily conserved from bat CoV-HKU4 to human endemic/emergent strains. Conserved dynamics regions of ACE2 involve both the N-terminal helices, as well as a region of more transient dynamics encompassing residues K353, Q325 and a novel motif AAQPFLL 386-92 that appears to coordinate their dynamic interactions with the viral RBD at N501.

Previous studies have suggested significant declines in cases of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a quasi-experimental, retrospective cohort study of ACS hospitalisations by using a multi-institutional administrative claims database in Japan. We used interrupted time series analyses to ascertain impacts on cases, treatment approaches, and in-hospital mortality before and after Japan's state of emergency to respond to COVID-19. The primary outcome was the change in ACS cases per week. RESULTS: A total of 30,198 ACS cases (including 21,612 acute myocardial infarction and 8,586 unstable angina) were confirmed between 1st July 2018 and 30th June 2020. After the state of emergency, an immediate decrease was observed in ACS cases per week (-18.3%; 95% confidence interval, -13.1 to -23.5%).

Despite the final event (the cytokine storm) is shared by various conditions leading to sHLH, the aetiology, either infectious, autoimmune or neoplastic, accounts for the differences in the various phases of this process. Moreover, the evidence of a hyperinflammatory microenvironment provided the rationale to employ immunomodulating agents for therapeutic purposes in severe COVID-19. This viewpoint aims at discussing the pitfalls and issues to be considered with regard to the use of immunomodulating agents in COVID-19, such as timing of treatment based on the viral load and the extent of cytokine/ferritin overexpression. Furthermore, it encompasses recent findings in the paediatric field about a novel multisystem inflammatory disease resembling toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease observed in children with proven SARS-CoV2 infection. Finally, it includes arguments in favour of adding COVID-19 to the spectrum of the recently defined hyperferritinemic syndrome, which already includes adult-onset Stills disease, macrophage activation syndrome, septic shock and catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome.","output":"Storm, typhoon, cyclone or hurricane in patients with COVID-19?

It is therefore critical to understand the factors that determine people's vaccination intentions. We applied a reasoned action approach - the theory of planned behavior - to explore these factors. We used data from an online survey of adults (18C74 years; n = 5044) conducted in Germany between April 9 and April 28, 2021 and found that attitudes toward getting vaccinated predicted vaccination intentions, while normative and control beliefs did not. In turn, positive attitudes toward getting vaccinated were supported by trust in science and fear of COVID-19 whereas negative attitudes were associated with acceptance of conspiracy theories and skepticism regarding vaccines in general. We advise policymakers, physicians, and health care providers to address vaccination hesitancy by emphasizing factors that support positive attitudes toward getting vaccinated, such as prevention of serious illness, death, and long-term health detriments, as opposed to exerting social pressure or pointing to the ease of getting vaccinated.","output":"Correlates of COVID-19 vaccination intentions: Attitudes, institutional trust, fear, conspiracy beliefs, and vaccine skepticism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: While the immediate care and access disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have received growing attention in certain areas, the full range of gaps in cancer screenings and treatment is not yet well understood or well documented throughout the country comprehensively. METHODS: This study used a large medical claims clearinghouse database representing 5%-7% of the Medicare fee-for-service population to characterize changes in the utilization of cancer care services and gain insight into the impact of COVID-19 on the US cancer population, including identification of new patients, gaps in access to care, and disruption of treatment journeys. RESULTS: In March-July 2020, in comparison with the baseline period of March-July 2019, there is a substantial decrease in cancer screenings, visits, therapy, and surgeries, with variation by cancer type and site of service. At the peak of the pandemic in April, screenings for breast, colon, prostate, and lung cancers were lower by 85%, 75%, 74%, and 56%, respectively. Significant utilization reductions were observed in April for hospital outpatient evaluation and management (E&M) visits (-74%), new patient E&M visits (-70%), and established patient E&M visits (-60%). A decrease in billing frequency was observed for the top physician-administered oncology products, dropping in both April (-26%) and July (-31%). Mastectomies were reduced consistently in April through July, with colectomies similarly reduced in April and May and prostatectomies dipping in April and July.

Feasibility tests include cell growth in the Matrigel as well as film dosimetric experiments that rule out the appearance of field inhomogeneities due to the presence of the well plate irregular structure. The response of CHO-K1 cells in Matrigel to radiation was studied by obtaining survival curves following X-ray and monoenergetic12C ion irradiation, which showed increased radioresistance of 3D cell cultures in Matrigel as compared to a monolayer.

The highest mortality rate is observed among the older adult population. During the first wave of the pandemic (March-June 2020), following a national health decree demanding that no visitors or family members be allowed in health institutions, our geriatric rehabilitation center closed gates to all visitors from the outside. We aimed to assess the rehabilitation outcomes of older patients with hip fractures in the first pandemic wave, who underwent rehabilitation under complete social isolation from primary care givers and family members. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. It took place at a university-affiliated, major postacute geriatric rehabilitation center. Rehabilitation outcomes measured were discharge functional independence measure (FIM) score and motor FIM score, FIM score change, motor FIM score change, favorable motor FIM effectiveness, length of stay, discharge destination, and home aid at discharge. RESULTS: The study group included 36 patients who were admitted during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020). The control group comprises 106 individuals with hip fractures who were admitted in the respective time periods during the previous 2 years, that is, March 1, 2018, to June 30, 2018, and March 1, 2019, to June 30, 2019. The facility's occupancy rates were much lower during the first wave of the pandemic in comparison with previous years (78 and 99%, respectively). Patients showed similar demographics and comorbidities, but the social isolation group was more severely deconditioned upon admission. All rehabilitation outcomes were similar between groups.

Plants are great producers of secondary metabolites and as such, especially those from poorly studied regions, they captured the interest of many researchers trying to develop new medicines. Antiviral bioactivities have been described in numerous medicinal plants and associated with compounds like flavonoids, heterosides, terpenes and triterpenes, organic acids, alkaloids, saponins, and quaternary ammonium salts, among others. The aim of this work was to evaluate compounds of natural origin, mainly from medicinal plants, as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors through docking studies. Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock, with the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm, to analyse the probability of docking. The viral spike (S) glycoprotein and the main protease Mpro, involved in the recognition of virus by host cells and in viral replication, respectively, were the main molecular targets in this study. These proteins are essential to the transmission and virulence of the virus. By inhibiting anyone of these proteins or both, for a higher active therapy, the severity of the infection will be reduced. Our efforts have been placed in competitively inhibiting the binding of its natural substrates. The best energy binding values for S protein were, in kcal/mol: -19.22 for glycyrrhizin, -17.84 for gitoxin, -12.05 for dicumarol, -10.75 for diosgenin, and -8.12 for delphinidin. For Mpro were, in kcal/mol: -9.36 for spirostan, -8.75 for N-(3-acetylglycyrrhetinoyl)-2-amino-propanol, -8.41 for -amyrin, -8.35 for oleanane, -8.11 for taraxasterol, and -8.03 for glycyrrhetinic acid. In addition, the synthetic drugs umifenovir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine were used as controls for S protein, while atazanavir and nelfinavir were used for Mpro. Key hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between natural compounds and the respective viral proteins were identified, allowing us to explain the great affinity obtained in those compounds with the lowest binding energies. These results suggest that these natural compounds could potentially be useful as drugs to be experimentally evaluated against COVID-19.

In this study, we investigated and compared the influence of head rotation on oropharyngeal leak pressures (OPLP) of the i-gel and LMA? Supreme? which are second-generation SGA devices. METHODS Patients who underwent elective surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled in this study and randomly divided into i-gel or LMA Supreme groups. After induction of anesthesia with muscle relaxation, the i-gel or LMA Supreme was inserted according to computerized randomization. The primary outcome was the OPLP at 0, 30, and 60 head rotation. The secondary outcomes were the maximum airway pressure and expiratory tidal volume when patients were mechanically ventilated using a volume-controlled ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 10 mL/kg (ideal body weight), ventilation score, and fiber-optic views of vocal cords.

These measures were implemented to reduce virus spread and to ensure the continuity of nation-wide medical care, in particular with a view to having sufficient intensive-care capacities in case of a large caseload of patients infected with COVID-19. With regard to surgical specialties, this implied a temporary hold on elective cases for an indefinite period of time. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of these measures on the caseload of a level-three plastic surgery unit. METHODS This study retrospectively assessed the caseload at the Division of Plastic, Aesthetic and Reconstructive Surgery at Medical University Graz during the so-called lockdown from 16 March 2020 to 27 April 2020 (6 weeks) as well as two weeks before. The data was compared with the corresponding time period of the year 2019. Surgical spectrum, procedural urgency, medical indication of surgical procedures as well as complication rates were compared. RESULTS The suspension of elective cases led to a significant reduction in caseload of 57.5 % (2019: 353, 2020: 150 cases). There was a significant increase in emergency and acute case procedures performed during the lockdown compared with the previous year (2019: 41, 2020: 58 cases, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the number of self-inflicted injuries and suicide attempts increased significantly (2019: 0, 2020: 16 cases, p < 0.001). With regard to private and work-related injuries, there was no significant difference. Also, there was no difference in complication rates (2019: 6.8, 2020: 10 %, p = 0.219). CONCLUSION A significant amount of surgical procedures in plastic surgery at a supraregional academic health centre consists of emergency, acute and urgent medically necessary cases. During the lockdown, surgical procedures were performed without a significant increase in complication rates. Despite challenges during the pandemic, high-quality patient care was provided throughout. To process less urgent yet important cases accumulated during the lockdown in a reasonable amount of time and maintaining the same level of high-quality care, additional capacities regarding operating rooms, hospital beds and outpatient care are needed.

The maximum R2O3 content of light rare-earth compounds reached 63 mol % and decreased with a decrease in the ionic radius of R3+. The thermal, optical, vibrational, and structural properties were investigated, particularly for 50R2O3-50B2O3 glasses. The glass transition temperature increased with a decrease in the ionic radius of R3+, while the thermal stability was not affected by the glass composition. The packing density increased with a decrease in the ionic radius of R3+ due to lanthanoid contraction. Raman scattering and Fourier transform infrared spectra revealed that, in the rare-earth-rich glasses, no conventional three-dimensional networks consisting of corner-sharing BOn (n = 3 or 4) units existed because all B atoms were formed as isolated BO3 units. The simple environment around B atoms in the glasses led to additional IR transmittance regions, irrespective of the kinds of R. The total correlation functions obtained from high-energy X-ray diffraction measurements were analyzed using the pair-function method and compared with those of various RBO3 crystalline phases. It was suggested that the local structure around R resembles the &#957;-NdBO3-type crystal structure, and the O coordination number of R ranged from 6.5 to 7.7, smaller than that of the crystalline phase. The glass-forming ability depending on R was discussed based on the structural similarities between the melt, glass, and crystalline phases.","output":"Structural Origin of Additional Infrared Transparency and Enhanced Glass-Forming Ability in Rare-Earth-Rich Borate Glasses without B-O Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Efficacy and safety of different hemoglobin thresholds for transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) in adults with an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are unknown. We therefore assessed the effect of two transfusion thresholds on short-term outcome in patients with ARDS. METHODS: Patients who received transfusions of RBCs were identified from a cohort of 1044 ARDS patients. After propensity score matching, patients transfused at a hemoglobin concentration of 8 g/dl or less (lower-threshold) were compared to patients transfused at a hemoglobin concentration of 10 g/dl or less (higher-threshold). The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. Secondary endpoints included ECMO-free, ventilator-free, sedation-free, and organ dysfunction-free composites. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred ninety-two patients were eligible for analysis of the matched cohort. Patients in the lower-threshold group had similar baseline characteristics and hemoglobin levels at ARDS onset but received fewer RBC units and had lower hemoglobin levels compared with the higher-threshold group during the course on the ICU (9.1 [IQR, 8.7C9.7] vs. 10.4 [10C11] g/dl, P < 0.001). There was no difference in 28-day mortality between the lower-threshold group compared with the higher-threshold group (hazard ratio, 0.94 [95%-CI, 0.59C1.48], P = 0.78). Within 28 days, 36.5% (95%-CI, 27.0C46.9) of the patients in the lower-threshold group compared with 39.5% (29.9C50.1) of the patients in the higher-threshold group had died. While there were no differences in ECMO-free, sedation-free, and organ dysfunction-free composites, the chance for successful weaning from mechanical ventilation within 28 days after ARDS onset was lower in the lower-threshold group (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.36 [95%-CI, 0.15C0.86], P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion at a hemoglobin concentration of 8 g/dl, as compared with a hemoglobin concentration of 10 g/dl, was not associated with an increase in 28-day mortality in adults with ARDS. However, a transfusion at a hemoglobin concentration of 8 g/dl was associated with a lower chance for successful weaning from the ventilator during the first 28 days after ARDS onset.

The aim of this initiative was to safely lower the rate of early births across the ACT and the surrounding areas in New South Wales. Modelled on the Western Australian PTB Prevention Initiative, the program included new clinical guidelines and a new PTB prevention clinic at the main tertiary hospital. AIM To evaluate the initiative and its effects on preterm and early term birth rates at the main tertiary hospital after 16 months of implementation. MATERIALS AND METHODS A before and after intervention study was conducted. Rates of preterm and early term birth before (previous five years) and after 16 months of implementation of the ACT PTB Prevention Initiative were evaluated. RESULTS At the main tertiary hospital in The Canberra Hospital, the rate of PTB was significantly reduced by 10% after 16 months of implementation of the initiative. Rates of PTB were lower than any of the preceding five years and resulted in 45 averted or delayed PTBs. The number of planned early term births with no medical indication was significantly reduced by 34.5% and resulted in 77 averted or delayed early term births. CONCLUSIONS The multifaceted PTB Prevention Initiative safely lowered the rates of early birth in the ACT context. These results highlight the importance of prioritising early birth prevention, education, research and expanding the initiative nationwide.","output":"Preventing early births in a regional tertiary maternity unit: Evaluating preterm and early term birth rates before and after implementation of the Preterm Birth Prevention Initiative in the Australian Capital Territory."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The tourism industry is a major contributor to the gross domestic product of several countries, including Malaysia. However, recent tourism growth has led to increase the industry's carbon dioxide (CO2). Low-carbon tourism, therefore, needs to be introduced to the sector to help curb global climate change. A comprehensive understanding of lowcarbon tourism needs to be developed to achieve this goal. This article looks at the relevant studies in the literature using content analysis. By adopting a qualitative methodology, the article collected and assessed measurements of tourism's carbon emissions and examined the effects of implementing a low-carbon tourism programme. Some of the low-carbon strategies were listed by going through the entire implementation process of lowcarbon tourism as an alternative form of tourism development. The discussion also focuses on how Covid-19 can influence lowcarbon tourism development. A blueprint for a low-carbon recovery proposed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is also presented at the end of the paper.

In this study, we investigate the association between self-reported belief of COVID-19 illness and seropositivity. METHODS: : Cross-sectional study of three key worker streams comprising (A) Police and Fire & Rescue (2 sites) (B) healthcare workers (1 site) and (C) healthcare workers with previously positive PCR result (5 sites). We collected self-reported signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and compared this with serology results from two SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays (Roche Elecsys? and EUROIMMUN). RESULTS: : Between 01 and 26 June, we recruited 2847 individuals (Stream A: 1,247, Stream B: 1,546 and Stream C: 154). Among those without previous positive PCR tests, 687/2,579 (26%) reported belief they had had COVID-19, having experienced compatible symptoms; however, only 208 (30.3%) of these were seropositive on both immunoassays. Both immunoassays had high sensitivities relative to previous PCR positivity (>93%); there was also limited decline in antibody titres up to 110 days post symptom onset. Symptomatic but seronegative individuals had differing symptom profiles and shorter illnesses than seropositive individuals.

The aim of our study was to investigate in asthmatic children the level of asthma control and the maintenance therapy used during the lockdown. METHODS: Among asthmatic children attending our clinic, we identified those who had been prescribed the same therapy in March-April 2019 and March-April 2020. The level of asthma control (GINA-score) and the maintenance therapy used during the lockdown (March-April 2020) were compared with those of March-April 2019. We separately analyzed a small group of children with severe asthma treated with Omalizumab during the lockdown. RESULTS: We enrolled 92 asthmatic children (67 males). Compared to 2019, in 2020 a higher proportion of children modified their maintenance therapy (38% vs. 15.2%, p < .001), with a significant increase in both the proportion of children who increased (p = .033) and in that of children who decreased their therapy (p = .026). The level of control resulted as significantly higher in 2020 (March p = .023; April p = .007). Also, the 13 children treated with Omalizumab showed a good level of control in 2020.

This research explored HCPs knowledge, decision making, and routine practice of physical activity promotion with older adults. Furthermore, it aimed to enhance our understanding of the supports that HCPs need to effectively promote physical activity in routine practice across a wide range of healthcare professions, settings, and sectors. Semi-structured online interviews were completed with HCPs between November 2020CMarch 2021. Data were first analysed by coding instances within the transcripts, mapping onto relevant Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) domains utilising a deductive thematic analysis approach. The data were then analysed utilising an inductive approach to thematically generate explanatory subthemes within the identified domains. Participants (n = 63) included general practitioners (15.87%), occupational therapists (30.16%), physiotherapists (38.10%), and nurses (15.87%) from the island of Ireland (Ireland and Northern Ireland). Of those interviewed, 10 (15.87%) were male and 53 (84.13%) were female. Two thirds (65.08%) were HCPs practicing in Ireland. Domains and subthemes related to the application of physical activity, and emergent themes on developing practice to support the application and integration of physical activity in routine practice are discussed. HCPs identified that focused education, appropriate training, and access to tailored resources are all essential to support the promotion of physical activity in routine practice. For such supports to be effective, a cultural shift is required in HCP training and health service provision to adopt the growing evidence base that physical activity promotion must be part of disease prevention and treatment in routine practice. HCPs highlighted a range of areas for service development to support them to promote physical activity.

Most countries took two main interventions: suppression like immediate lockdown cities at epicentre or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both strategies have their apparent merits and limitations; it becomes extremely hard to conduct one intervention as the most feasible way to all countries. Targeting at this problem, this paper conducted a feasibility study by defining a mathematical model named SEMCR that can access effectiveness of mitigation, suppression and hybrid interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and Wuhan. It extended traditional SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed Infectious-Recovered) model by adding two key features: a direct connection between Exposed and Recovered populations, and separating infections into mild and critical cases. It defined parameters to classify two stages of COVID-19 control: active contain by isolation of cases and contacts, passive contain by suppression or mitigation. The model was fitted and evaluated with public dataset containing daily number of confirmed active cases including Wuhan and London during January, 2020 and March 2020. The simulated results showed that 1) Immediate suppression taken in Wuhan significantly reduced the total exposed and infectious populations to 119610, but it has to be consistently maintained at least 90 days (by the middle of April 2020). Its success heavily relied on sufficiently external support from other places of China. This mode were not suitable to other countries that have no sufficient health resources. 2) In London, it is possible to take a hybrid intervention of suppression and mitigation for every 2 or 3 weeks over a longer period to balance the total infections and economic loss. While the total infectious populations in this scenario would be possibly 2 times than the one taking suppression, economic loss and recovery of London would be less affected. 3) Both in Wuhan and London cases, one important issue of fitting practical data was that there were a large portion (probably 62.9% in Wuhan) of self-recovered populations that were asymptomatic or mild symptomatic. These people might think they have been healthy at home and did not go to hospital for COVID-19 tests. Early release of intervention intensity potentially increased a risk of the second outbreak. One limitation of our model was that our prediction of infections and deaths depended on a parameter estimation of intervention intensity that presented by average number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals in a certain region. It assumed that each intervention had equivalent effects on the reproduction number R in different regions over time. Practical effectiveness of implementing intervention intensity might be varied with respect to cultures or other issues of certain county.","output":"Feasibility Study of Mitigation and Suppression Intervention Strategies for Controlling COVID-19 Outbreaks in London and Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background At the end of February 2020 a new case was diagnosed with COVID-19 in north Italy, suddenly followed by new cases Italian health authorities decided to enforce restrictive measures Northern areas of Italy were identified as red areas to slow down the epidemic and its impact on the healthcare system From this perspective, the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy constitutes a testing ground for the assessment of the ability of consumers to cope with this health risk Methods A cross-sectional study on a representative sample of 1000 Italian citizens was conducted over the period 27 February- 5 March exploring the following hypotheses: 1) less engaged individuals are more concerned for the health emergency and feel more vulnerable;2) less engaged have higher probability to develop negative attitudes and dysfunctional behaviors Results only the 16% the interviewees presented a high level of engagement Lower levels of engagement were measured in the southern parts of Italy (not yet touched by the epidemics at the time of data collection) People with lowers levels of engagement reported higher fears for the contagion and sense of vulnerability Furthermore, they showed the lower levels of trust in the Public Health Authorities, in medical research and in vaccines Finally, they appeared more dismissive in their preventive behaviors and more disorganized in the fruition of the healthcare services Conclusions A psychological analysis of processes of attitudinal and role change in the direction of becoming more engaged in health prevention is worthy in order to forecast potential dysfunctional reactions to restrictive health prevention measures and to orient personalized education initiatives to consumers with different level of engagement Key messages Profiling based on the levels of health engagement is important in order to plan more effective healthcare measures during epidemics Targeted educational initiatives should take into account citizens' engagement profiles","output":"Patient health engagement model: explaining citizens noncompliance and maladaptive behaviors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The conditions imposed by the Covid-19 outbreaks forced residential care (RC) facilities to experience new challenges and to adopt new practices.

However, knowledge about the ontogeny of stress coping style is still limited. Here, we performed a detailed analysis of the light dark challenge behavioural assay in zebrafish larvae, where after acclimation in ambient light sudden alternating dark and light phases elicit an anxiety-like response. A principal component analysis on parameters related to locomotion (distance moved, swimming velocity, acceleration, mobility) and directionality (angular velocity, meandering of swimming path) revealed independence between the parameters determined in the light and the dark phases of the assay, indicating unrelated generalised behaviours per phase. However, high collinearity was observed between behavioural parameters within the same phase, indicating a robust response to the stimulus within behavioural phenotypes. Subsequently, this assay was used to determine the correlation between individual hatching time and the behavioural phenotype. The results show that fish that had hatched during daytime have a stronger behavioural response to the dark phase at 5 days post-fertilisation in locomotion related parameters and a weaker response in directionality related parameters, than fish that had hatched during nighttime. These results show that behavioural responses to the light dark challenge assay are robust and can be generalised for the light and the dark phase, and that diel hatching time may determine the behavioural phenotype of an individual.","output":"Detailed Analysis of Zebrafish Larval Behaviour in the Light Dark Challenge Assay Shows That Diel Hatching Time Determines Individual Variation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background DNA vaccines are safe, tolerable, elicit humoral and cellular responses, allow for repeated dosing over time, are thermostable at room temperature, and are easy to manufacture.

Methods Participants in the open-label Phase 1 trial received 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg intradermally (ID) followed by electroporation (EP) at Days 0 and 28. An optional booster dose was administered >6 months post-dose 2. The Phase 2 further compared the 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg doses against placebo in a total of 401 participants randomized at a 3:3:1:1 ratio. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT04336410 and NCT04642638 Results The majority of adverse events (AEs) related to INO-4800 across both trials were mild in severity and did not increase in frequency with age and subsequent doses. In Phase 1, 78% (14/18) and 84% (16/19) of subjects generated neutralizing antibody responses with geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 17.4 (95%CI 8.3, 36.5) and 62.3 (95% CI 36.4, 106.7) in the 1.0 and 2.0 groups, respectively (Figure 1). By week 8, 74% (14/19) and 100% (19/19) subjects generated T cell responses by Th1- associated IFN ELISPOT assay . Following a booster dose, neutralizing GMTs rose to 82.2 (95% CI 38.2, 176.9) and 124.7 (95% CI 62.8, 247.7) in the 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg groups, respectively, demonstrating the ability of INO-4800 to boost (Figure 2). In Phase 2, neutralizing antibody responses demonstrated GMTs of 93.6 (95%CI 77.3, 113.4) in the 1.0 mg dose group and 150.6 (95%CI 123.8, 183.1) in the 2.0 mg dose group (Figure 3). Conclusion INO-4800 appears safe and tolerable as a primary series and as a booster with the induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses. In addition to eliciting neutralizing antibodies, INO-4800 also induced T cell immune responses as demonstrated by IFN ELISpot. Finally, as a homologous booster, INO-4800, when administered 6-10.5 months following the primary series, resulted in an increased immune response without increase in reactogenicity.

Demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and outcomes of the patients were all collected and compared between deceased and recovered patients. RESULTS: Fifty-six cases had died of COVID-19, and 14 patients had fully recovered and discharged. The median age of the patients was 68 years old, ranging from 22 to 91 years, 66% were men, 80% had one or more comorbidities, and hypertension was the most common comorbidities (45% of deceased cases). The most common signs and symptoms at the onset of illness were SPO(2) depression (92%) and dyspnea (90%). Dyspnea was significantly more common in deceased patients (95%) than recovered patients (70%) (P = 0.048). Most patients had lymphopenia (80%).

However, the outcome of such actions was at certain times detrimental. This study was conducted as an attempt to identify the reasons for such instances as well as to identify the behaviours of the Sri Lankan populace during such a crisis event. To support this study, observations, as well as data of related posts from a sample of 50 sources, were manually collected from the most popular social media platform in Sri Lanka, Facebook. The posts considered spanned until approximately a month after the initial major virus outbreak in the country and contained content that even vaguely related to the virus. Utilising such data, various forms of analyses such as topic significance and topic co-occurrences were conducted. The findings highlight, while there can be social detrimental ideas shared, the majority of the posts point constructive and positive thoughts suggesting the successful influence from the cultural and social values Sri Lanka society promotes throughout.","output":"Exploratory Analysis of a Social Media Network in Sri Lanka during the COVID-19 Virus Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe recovery of other respiratory viruses in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported, either at the time of a SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis (co-infection) or subsequently (superinfection). However, data on the prevalence, microbiology and outcomes of co-infection and super infection are limited. The purpose of this study was to examine occurrence of respiratory co-infections and superinfections and their outcomes among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients and MethodsWe searched literature databases for studies published from October 1, 2019, through June 11, 2020. We included studies that reported clinical features and outcomes of co-infection or super-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. We followed PRISMA guidelines and we registered the protocol with PROSPERO as: CRD42020189763. ResultsOf 1310 articles screened, 48 were included in the random effects meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of co-infection was 12% (95% confidence interval (CI): 6%-18%, n=29, I2=98%) and that of super-infection was 14% (95% CI: 9%-21%, n=18, I2=97%). Pooled prevalence of pathogen type stratified by co- or super-infection: viral co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 2%-7%); viral super-infections, 2% (95% CI: 0%-7%); bacterial co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 1%-8%); bacterial super-infections, 6% (95% CI: 2%-11%); fungal co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 1%-8%); and fungal super-infections, 4% (95% CI: 0%-11%). Compared to those with co-infections, patients with super-infections had a higher prevalence of mechanical ventilation [21% (95% CI: 13%-31%) vs. 7% (95% CI: 2%-15%)] and greater average length of hospital stay [mean=12.5 days, standard deviation (SD) =5.3 vs. mean=10.2 days, SD= 6.7]. ConclusionsOur study showed that as many as 14% of patients with COVID-19 have super-infections and 12% have co-infections. Poor outcomes were associated with super-infections. Our findings have implications for diagnostic testing and therapeutics, particularly in the upcoming respiratory virus season in the Northern Hemisphere.","output":"Prevalence and outcomes of co-infection and super-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccines induce immunity through different mechanisms. The aim of this study is to compare the titers of specific antibodies in subjects vaccinated with either the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine or the Sinopharm vaccine. This prospective observational cohort included Jordanian adults vaccinated with two doses, 21 days apart, of either of the two aforementioned vaccines. Titers were collected 6 weeks after the administration of the second dose. Overall, 288 participants were included, of which 141 were administered the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, while 147 were administered the Sinopharm vaccine. Remarkably, 140 (99.3%) of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine recipients had positive IgG titers, while 126 (85.7%) of Sinopharm recipients had positive IgG (p < 0.001). The mean titer for IgG among Pfizer-BioNTech recipients was 515.5  1143.5 BAU/mL, compared to 170.0  230.0 BAU/mL among Sinopharm subjects (p < 0.001).

Results: Despite immediate, successful surgical decompression, severe optic nerve atrophy and permanent visual loss occurred during early postoperative period. The reported case gives rise to different hypotheses regarding pathophysiology that may lead to irreversible blindness. A systematic review of the respective literature is provided attempting to compare different approaches in the management of Onodi cell-associated compressive optic neuropathy and assess their efficacy in the final visual outcome. Poor initial visual acuity (VA) may represent a bad prognostic factor. Moreover, age and gender do not seem to significantly influence the outcome. Conclusion: This report and associated literature review highlight the importance of the radiologic characteristics and early diagnosis in the final visual outcome of the Onodi cell-associated optic neuropathy.

Synthetic biology holds great potential for artificially controlling their replication, a strategy that could be used to attenuate infectious viruses but is still in the exploratory stage. Herein, we used the genetic-code expansion technique to convert Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a model of RNA virus, into a controllable EV71 strain carrying the unnatural amino acid (UAA) N{varepsilon}-2-azidoethyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine (NAEK), which we termed an EV71-NAEK virus. EV71-NAEK could recapitulate an authentic NAEK time- and dose-dependent infection in vitro and in vivo, which could serve as a novel method to manipulate virulent viruses in conventional laboratories. We further validated the prophylactic effect of EV71-NAEK in two mouse models. In susceptible parent mice, vaccination with EV71-NAEK elicited a strong immune response and potentially protected their neonatal offspring from lethal challenge similar to that of commercial vaccines. Meanwhile, in transgenic mice harboring a PylRS-tRNAPyl pair, substantial elements of genetic-code expansion technology, EV71-NAEK evoked an adjustable neutralizing-antibody response in a strictly external NAEK dose-dependent manner. These findings suggested that EV71-NAEK could be the basis of a feasible immunization program for populations with different levels of immunity. Moreover, we expanded the strategy to generate controllable coxsackieviruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for conceptual verification. In combination, these results could underlie a competent strategy for attenuating viruses and priming the immune system via artificial control, which might be a promising direction for the development of amenable vaccine candidates and be broadly applied to other RNA viruses.","output":"Engineering RNA viruses with unnatural amino acid to evoke adjustable immune response in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the causative agent of the respiratory disease infectious bronchitis of domestic fowl, and is controlled by routine vaccination. To explore the potential use of IBV as a vaccine vector a reverse genetics system was utilised to generate infectious recombinant IBVs (rIBVs) expressing the reporter genes enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) or humanised Renilla luciferase (hRluc). Infectious rIBVs were obtained following the replacement of Gene 5 or the intergenic region (IR) with eGFP or hRluc, or the replacement of ORFs 3a and 3b with hRluc. The replacement of Gene 5 with an IBV codon-optimised version of the hRluc gene also resulted in successful rescue of infectious rIBV. Reporter gene expression was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, or luciferase activity assays, for all successfully rescued rIBVs following infection of primary chick kidney (CK) cells. The genetic stability of rIBVs was analysed by serial passage on CK cells. Recombinant IBV stability varied depending on the genome region being replaced, with the reporter genes maintained up to at least passage 8 (P8) following replacement of Gene 5, P7 for replacement of the IR and P5 for replacement of ORFs 3a and 3b. Codon-optimisation of the hRluc gene, when replacing Gene 5, resulted in an increase in genome stability, with hRluc expression stable up to P10 compared to P8 for standard hRluc. Repeated passaging of rIBVs expressing hRluc at an MOI of 0.01 demonstrated an increase in stability, with hRluc expression stable up to at least P12 following the replacement of Gene 5. This study has demonstrated that heterologous genes can be incorporated into, and expressed from a range of IBV genome locations and that replacement of accessory Gene 5 offers a promising target for realising the potential of IBV as a vaccine vector for other avian pathogens.","output":"Infectious Bronchitis Virus as a Vector for the Expression of Heterologous Genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Medical schools throughout the world were forced to modify their programming during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Malaysia, virtual learning plans were implemented for non-clinical programming, while clinical posting modifications were designed to meet local SOPs. The prolonged enforcement of these modifications to undergraduate medical education will have affected student experiences, including well-being. Since these feelings can relate to perceived relatedness, autonomy, and competence, it is important to identify any potential factors that may lead to reduced intrinsic motivation in students. It is also important to consider how demographic features may contribute to student perspectives, which can be studied using the unique diversity represented by Malaysian students. Methods: A quantitative survey was distributed to Malaysian medical students to assess their overall wellbeing, autonomy in educational decision making, student experiences, and position on changes to graduation timing. Intrinsic components were identified using Principal Component Analysis and were aligned with the three needs for self-determination, namely relatedness, autonomy, and competence. Finally, trends in responses for participants from various sub-populations were assessed using ANOVA testing. Results: Responses were collected from 442 students representing 23 accredited Malaysian medical schools. Upon validation and reliability testing, eight components were identified with themes relating to: mental health, social concerns, communication, timing of modifications, depth of learning, and student-centred learning. Of these, gender was related to mental health, student-centred learning, and delayed graduation, while stage was related to student-centred learning and delayed graduation in addition to concerns about depth of learning and timing of modifications. Interestingly, ethnicity was related to differences in opinions about delayed graduation and income was related to social concerns. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that, while students were satisfied in general with the content and delivery of their programmes given the circumstances, there is evidence to suggest negative effects on emotional wellbeing, expression of student voice, due to the modifications that were made. Additionally, these feelings related to the three motivational needs, suggesting that students were experiencing a dampened motivational profile during the pandemic. Further, motivational profiles were distinct between student sub-groups, providing insight for developing appropriate and inclusive accommodations moving forward.","output":"Mental Health and Self-Determination Profiles of the Diverse Population of Medical Students in Malaysia During the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The sharing of individual participant-level data from COVID-19 trials would allow re-use and secondary analysis that can help accelerate the identification of effective treatments.

These are used to track the motion of a particle that is initially trapped in a potential well close to one of the surfaces, and experiences a drag force proportional to the difference between its velocity and that of the surrounding fluid. Complications such as particle-wall hydrodynamic interactions, finite size effects, and Brownian motion are ignored for now. Unsurprisingly, particles remain trapped unless the flow driven by the wall motion is strong compared to the depth of the trapping potential well. Perhaps less obvious is that for many starting positions the process of escape to large distances from the wall takes place over a large number of periods [Formula: see text] , essentially because the no-slip boundary condition means that fluid velocities relative to the wall are small close to the wall, and thus the velocities of particles along or away from the wall are also small.

Analysis including publicly available Hungatella genomes found substantial genomic differences as compared to the type strain, indicating this isolate was not C. difficile. We examined the whole-genome of Hungatella species and related genera, using comparative genomics to fully examine species identification and toxin production. Orthogonal phylogenetic using the 16S rRNA gene and entire genome analyses that included genome distance analyses using Genome-to-Genome Distance (GGDC), Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI), and a pan-genome analysis with inclusion of available public genomes determined the speciation to be Hungatella. Two clearly differentiated groups were identified, one including a reference H. hathewayi genome (strain DSM-13,479) and a second group that was determined to be H. effluvii, which included our clinical isolate. Also, some genomes reported as H. hathewayi were found to belong to other genera, including Clostridium and Faecalicatena. We show that the Hungatella species have an open pan-genome reflecting high genomic diversity. This study highlights the importance of correctly assigning taxonomic identification, particularly in disease-associated strains, to better understand virulence and therapeutic options.","output":"Analyses of publicly available Hungatella hathewayi genomes revealed genetic distances indicating they belong to more than one species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In Punjab, first COVID-19 case was detected on March 5 2020 followed by multiple clusters. Understanding the epidemiology of reported COVID-19 cases helps decision makers in planning future responses. We described the epidemiological patterns, laboratory surveillance and contact tracing of COVID-19 cases in Punjab. Methods: We analysed state's COVID-19 data from March-May 2020 to describe time, place and person distribution. We analysed the laboratory surveillance and contact tracing reports to calculate frequency of testing, sample positivity rate (PR) and contacts traced per case. Findings: A total of 2256 cases were reported from March-May, 2020 (attack rate 75 cases/million and case fatality rate 2%). Attack rate was higher among males (81 cases/million males) and maximum affected age group was 60-69 years (164a??5 cases/million). Five of 22 districts reported almost half cases in May's first week. Mortality rate was highest among individuals >60years (six deaths/million) and males (two deaths/million males). Of 45 deaths, 41 reported comorbidities [(hypertension (42%), diabetes (40%)]. COVID-19 testing increased from 46 samples/day (PR: 2%) in March's first week to 4000 samples/day (PR: 2a??5%) by May's end (2752 tests/million). Amritsar conducted 2035 tests/million (highest PR: 6a??5%) while Barnala conducted 4158 tests/million (lowest PR: 1%). For 2256 cases, 19,432 contacts were traced (nine contacts/case) with 11% positivity rate. Interpretation: COVID-19 in Punjab mostly affected males, >60 years of age and individuals with comorbid conditions. Many districts with less testing and contact tracing had higher positivity rate. We recommended to implement and ensure adequate testing and contact tracing in all the districts of Punjab.","output":"COVID-19 in Punjab, India: Epidemiological patterns, laboratory surveillance and contact tracing of COVID-19 cases, March-May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic caused by the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to a dramatic increase in medical waste worldwide This tremendous increase in medical waste is an important transmission medium for the virus and thus poses new and serious challenges to urban medical waste management This study investigates the response of medical waste management to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent changes in Wuhan City based on the most detailed data available, including waste generation, storage, transportation, and disposal The results show that despite a 5-fold increase in the demand for daily medical waste disposal in the peak period, the quick responses in the storage, transportation, and disposal sectors during the pandemic ensured that all medical waste was disposed of within 24 hours of generation Furthermore, this paper discusses medical waste management during future emergencies in Wuhan The ability of the medical waste management system in Wuhan to successfully cope with the rapid increase in medical waste caused by major public health emergencies has important implications for other cities suffering from the pandemic and demonstrates the need to establish resilient medical emergency systems in urban areas","output":"What medical waste management system may cope With COVID-19 pandemic: Lessons from Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it has been observed that hepatic injury occurs in a significant proportion of patients, particularly in those with severe or critical illness.

However, little is currently known about the potential for pre-existing resistance to RDV and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification that might impact RDV efficacy as the virus continue to spread globally. In this study, >90,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from globally circulating clinical isolates, including sequences from recently emerged United Kingdom and South Africa variants, and >300 from mink isolates were analyzed for genetic diversity in the RNA replication complex (nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14) with a focus on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the molecular target of RDV. Overall, low genetic variation was observed with only 12 amino acid substitutions present in the entire RNA replication complex in 0.5% of analyzed sequences with the highest overall frequency (82.2%) observed for nsp12 P323L that consistently increased over time. Low sequence variation in the RNA replication complex was also observed among the mink isolates. Importantly, the coronavirus Nsp12 mutations previously selected in vitro in the presence of RDV were identified in only 2 isolates (0.002%) within all the analyzed sequences. In addition, among the sequence variants observed in 0.5% clinical isolates, including P323L, none were located near the established polymerase active site or sites critical for the RDV mechanism of inhibition.

We reported a case of adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) with Eisenmenger Syndrome (ES) who survived COVID-19 without progression to severe infection. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 39 years old male with history of uncorrected ACHD complained of low-grade fever and cough for 3 days. Initial oxygen saturation was 85%, no tachypnoea, no tachycardia, and blood pressure was normal. SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR results was positive. Thorax CT showed lung fibrosis, minimal GGO, and prominent pulmonary notch. Notable laboratory result was haemoglobin: 20.4g/dL. Echocardiography showed a large secundum ASD with bidirectional shunt, dilated RA and RV, normal ventricular systolic functions, mild TR with increased tricuspid gradient (TR V max 4.27m/s) which concluded the diagnosis of ES.

DISCUSSION: Studies have documented CHD and PAH as comorbid to severe COVID-19 infection, but our patient had moderate COVID-19 infection and recovered without progression to severe disease. We proposed several pathophysiological characteristics of ES which could serve as protective factors against severe COVID-19, which are: 1) Pre-existing PAH, where pulmonary vasculopathy and remodelling lessened endothelial response to inflammation, and reduced expression of ACE2 receptors, 2) Chronic hypoxia, which prepared cells and tissues against hypoxic environment, and 3) Polycythaemia, might be beneficial in haemoglobinopathy directly caused by SARS-CoV2.","output":"C42.

Recent evidence suggests that condensate formation is prevalent in the cell nucleus. To understand how different components of the nucleus interact during condensate formation is an important challenge. In particular, the physics of co-condensation of proteins together with nucleic acids remains elusive. Here we use optical tweezers to study how the prototypical prion-like protein Fused-in-Sarcoma (FUS) forms liquid-like assemblies in vitro, by co-condensing together with individual DNA molecules. Through progressive force-induced peeling of dsDNA, buffer exchange, and force measurements, we show that FUS adsorbing in a single layer on DNA effectively generates a sticky FUSCDNA polymer that can collapse to form a liquid-like FUSCDNA co-condensate. Condensation occurs at constant DNA tension for double-stranded DNA, which is a signature of phase separation. We suggest that co-condensation mediated by protein monolayer adsorption on nucleic acids is an important mechanism for intracellular compartmentalization.","output":"Co-condensation of proteins with single- and double-stranded DNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Transmission in healthcare settings can result in significant infections in healthcare workers and patients.

Methods: In this case series report we describe a cluster of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) in a tertiary care university hospital, in the early phases of the epidemic, after hospital visiting had been stopped and when the UK lockdown was in place. Findings: A 48 year old patient developed COVID-19 31 days post-admission and four days after admission to a medical ward from ITU. Infection was likely acquired from an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic healthcare worker (HCW). Subsequent investigation over a 14 day period revealed symptoms in 23 staff members and five linked cases in patients on the same ward. Nine of the 23 affected staff members provided care for and had direct exposure with the index case. Four staff reported caring for the index case without use of personal protective equipment. One was coughed on directly by the patient 24 hours prior to the onset of symptoms. Conclusion: SARS CoV2 infection can be introduced to a ward area by asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic healthcare workers. Staff members and patients can act as Trojan horses carrying infection into and around the hospital, setting up unexpected transmission events.

Participants (N = 620) were recruited online through social media advertising. The results showed that there were self-reported changes to food consumption during the lockdown across the sample. Increases in consumption of HED (high energy density) snack foods during the lockdown was associated with sex, pre-lockdown eating behaviour (emotional eating and uncontrolled eating), and Covid-specific health anxiety. Increases in positive eating practices such as eating more home prepared foods, and fruits and vegetables, were associated with adaptive coping strategies. Higher emotional eating (EE) during the lockdown was associated with a higher BMI, higher pre-lockdown EE and maladaptive coping strategies. Maladaptive coping strategies moderated the relationship between BMI and EE during the lockdown. In particular a higher BMI was associated with higher EE during the lockdown if an individual also had higher maladaptive coping strategies.

This study analysed the association between sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality in Brazil. Study design C A retrospective analysis was conducted of COVID-19 quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-confirmed adult hospitalised patients with a defined outcome (i.e. hospital discharge or death) in Brazil. Data were retrieved from the national surveillance system database (SIVEP-Gripe) between 16 February and 8 August 2020. Methods C Clinical characteristics, sociodemographic variables, use of hospital resources and outcomes of COVID-19 adult hospitalised patients, stratified by self-reported race, were investigated. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The association between self-reported race and in-hospital mortality, after adjusting for clinical characteristics and comorbidities using a logistic regression model, was evaluated. Results C During the study period, Brazil had 3,018,397 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 100,648 deaths. The study population included 228,196 COVID-19-positive adult in-hospital patients with a defined outcome; the median age was 61 years, 57% were men, 35% (79,914) self-reported as Black/Brown and 35.4% (80,853) self-reported as White. Total in-hospital mortality was 37% (85,171/228,196). Black/Brown patients showed higher in-hospital mortality than White patients (42% vs 37%, respectively), were admitted less-frequently to the intensive care unit (ICU) [32% vs 36%] and used more invasive mechanical ventilation (21% vs 19%), especially outside the ICU (17% vs 11%).

This study examines these effects with common face masks, namely a neck gaiter, disposable surgical mask, and N95 mask, as well as a novel material that could be used as a mask (acoustic foam). A recorded excerpt from the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" was played through a miniature speaker placed inside the mouth of a masked manikin. Experienced listeners were asked to rate perceptual qualities of these singing stimuli by blindly comparing them with the same recording captured without a mask. Acoustic analysis showed that face masks affected the sound by enhancing or suppressing different frequency bands compared to no mask. Acoustic energy around the singer's formant was reduced when using surgical and N95 masks, which matches observations that these masks are more detrimental to the perceptions of singing voice compared with neck gaiter or acoustic foam. It suggests that singers can benefit from masks designed for minimal impact on auditory perception of the singing voice while maintaining reasonable efficacy of filtering efficiency.","output":"How Face Masks Affect Acoustic and Auditory Perceptual Characteristics of the Singing Voice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY OBJECTIVES: The stress imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing social isolation could adversely affect sleep. As sleep problems may persist and hurt health, it is important to identify which populations have experienced changes in sleeping patterns during the pandemic and their extent. METHODS: In Study 1, 3,062 responders from 49 countries accessed the survey website voluntarily between March 26-April 26, 2020, and 2,562 (84%; age: 45.214.5, 68% women) completed the study. In Study 2, 1,022 adult US responders were recruited for pay through Mechanical Turk, and 971 (95%; age 40.413.6, 52% women) completed the study. The survey tool included demographics and items adapted from validated sleep questionnaires on sleep duration, quality and timing, and sleeping pills consumption. RESULTS: In Study 1, 58% of the responders were unsatisfied with their sleep. Forty percent of the responders reported a decreased sleep quality vs. before COVID-19 crisis. Self-reported sleeping pill consumption increased by 20% (p<0.001). Multivariable analysis indicated that female sex, being in quarantine, 31 to 45-year age group, reduced physical activity and adverse impact on livelihood were independently associated with more severe worsening of sleep quality during the pandemic. The majority of findings were reproduced in the independent cohort of Study 2. CONCLUSIONS: Changes imposed due to the pandemic have led to a surge in individuals reporting sleep problems across the globe. The findings raise the need to screen for worsening sleep patterns and use of sleeping aids, especially in more susceptible populations, namely, women and people with insecure livelihoods subjected to social isolation.","output":"Escalation of sleep disturbances amid the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional international study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivos Quantificar e identificar os motivos de desprezo de plaquetas coletadas por afrese no Hemocentro Regional de Santa Maria (HEMOSM), durante o perodo da pandemia de COVID-19.

The choice between early mechanical ventilation and noninvasive oxygen therapies, such as, high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) and/or noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) has to balance the contradictory priorities of protecting healthcare workers by minimizing aerosol-generation and optimizing resource management. This survey over two timeframes aimed to explore the controversial issue of location and noninvasive oxygen therapy in non-intubated ICU patients using a clinical vignette. Materials and methods: An online survey was designed, piloted, and distributed electronically to Indian intensivists/anesthetists, from private hospitals, government hospitals, and medical college hospitals (the latter two referred to as first-responder hospitals), who are directly responsible for admitting/managing patients in ICU. Results: Of the 204 responses (125/481 in phase 1 and 79/320 in phase 2), 183 responses were included. Respondents from first-responder hospitals were more willing to manage non-intubated hypoxemic patients in neutral pressure rooms, while respondents from private hospitals preferred negative-pressure rooms (p < 0.001). In both the phases, private hospital doctors were less comfortable to use any form of noninvasive oxygen therapies in neutral-pressure rooms compared to first-responder hospitals (low-flow oxygen therapy: 72 vs 50%, p < 0.01; HFNO: 47 vs 24%, p < 0.01 and NPPV: 38 vs 28%, p = 0.20). Interpretation: Variations existed in practices among first-responder and private intensivists/anesthetists. The resource optimal private hospital intensivists/anesthetists were less comfortable using noninvasive oxygen therapies in managing COVID-19 patients.

The aim of the present study was to assess the role of a (MWYF) decoction in a bleomycin (BLM)-induced PF mouse model and to investigate the underlying functional mechanism. Chemical components within the MWYF decoction were analysed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 50 C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to one of the following five groups with 10 mice per group: Control, model, low dose MWYF (20 g/kg), medium dose MWYF (40 g/kg) and high dose MWYF (60 g/kg). A mouse PF model was established by the tracheal instillation of BLM (5 mg/kg) prior to MWYF treatment, except for mice in the control group. After 21 days of treatment with MWYF, the mice were sacrificed and the body weights were recorded. In addition, pulmonary tissues and bronchial alveolar lavage fluid were collected. TNF-, IL-6, IL-17, hydroxyproline, pyridinoline and collagen I levels were determined using ELISA. Vimentin, -smooth muscle actin (-SMA), fibronectin, TGF-1, Smad3, TNF-, IL-6, IL-17, collagen I and collagen III were determined using western blotting. Vimentin and -SMA levels were also determined using immunofluorescence analysis.

Following treatment with MWYF decoction, the body weight of the mice in the PF group increased, the degree of pulmonary alveolitis and PF was reduced, collagen levels were reduced and the expression levels of -SMA, vimentin and fibronectin were decreased. Although both protein and mRNA expression levels of TGF-1 and Smad3 were reduced, they remained higher than those observed in the control group.

A paradigm shift in the concept of anesthetic management has occurred recently owing to the innumerable diverse revelations from the ongoing research in this field. DISCUSSION: Long lasting but reversible epigenetic changes can occur due to surgical stress and perioperative anesthetic medications. The exact relationship between these factors and tumor biology is being studied further. A popular topic under research now is the influence of regional anesthesia on cancer recurrence. Combining nerve blocks with total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) brings down the requirement of opioids and volatile anesthetic agents implicated in cancer recurrence. The study of mechanism of pain at the molecular level has led to the discovery of novel modes of prevention of chronic post-surgical pain. Newer combination aggressive treatment therapies -intraoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy, isolated limb perfusion, photodynamic therapy and robotic surgery require specialized anesthetic management. The COVID pandemic introduced new guidelines for safe management of oncosurgical patients .Use of genomic mapping to personalize pain management will be the breakthrough of the decade.

Although Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) has received most scholarly recognition, the potential negative consequences of Social Media Disorder (SMD) have also been found. However, few studies have assessed the symptoms of these two digital media addictions in the same way, making comparisons difficult. The present study aims to fill this gap by investigating differences and similarities regarding how common the symptoms are, sex differences, the suitability of the symptoms, and their association with psychosocial difficulties. Method: A total of 688 university students (63.2% women, Mean age = 25.98) completed a questionnaire measuring symptoms of IGD and SMD, as well as psychosocial difficulties (i.e., psychosomatic symptoms, low self-concept, and social problems). Results: Results showed that 1.2% of the men and 0.9% of the women met the symptom criteria for IGD (non-significant difference), whereas 3.2% men and 2.8% women met the symptom criteria for SMD (non-significant difference). Dimensional analyses indicated that men had higher IGD scores compared to women, whereas the opposite was found for SMD. Symptoms of heavy involvement in digital media (i.e., Preoccupation, Tolerance, Withdrawal, Unsuccessful attempts to control, and Escape) had high sensitivity, but low positive predictive value (PPV). However, symptoms associated with negative consequences of digital media use (i.e., Loss of interest, Continued excessive use, Deception, and Jeopardizing career/relationships) had low sensitivity, but high PPV. These symptom patterns were similar for IGD and SMD. Meeting the criteria for IGD or SMD as well as being at risk of these disorders were significantly associated with psychosocial difficulties. Symptoms of SMD generally had stronger associations with psychosomatic symptoms compared to symptoms of IGD. Conclusions: We conclude that heavy involvement in digital media seems common among individuals with IGD or SMD, but also among those not meeting the symptom criteria, whereas negative consequences are less common but highly predictive of digital media addictions once present. Further attention to SMD is warranted, as it seems more common than IGD and also seems to be equally or more strongly associated with psychosocial difficulties.","output":"Gaming and Social Media Addiction in University Students: Sex Differences, Suitability of Symptoms, and Association With Psychosocial Difficulties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, governments have taken drastically restrictive public health measures with significant collateral effects. It is important to understand the impact of these measures on SARS-CoV-2 circulation. However, pandemic indicators lag behind the actual level of viral circulation and these delays are an obstacle to assessing the effectiveness of policy decisions. Here, we propose one way to solve this problem by synchronizing the indicators with viral circulation in a country (France) based on a landmark event. METHODS: Based on a first lockdown, we measured the time lag between the peak of governmental and non-governmental surveillance indicators and the highest level of virus circulation. This allowed alignment of all surveillance indicators with viral circulation during the second period of the epidemic, overlaid with the type of public health measures implemented. RESULTS: We show that the second peak in viral circulation in France happened ~21 October 2020, during the public health state of emergency but before the lockdown (31 October). Indicators also suggest that viral circulation decreased earlier in locations where curfews were implemented. Indicators did, however, begin to rise once the autumnal lockdown was lifted and the state of emergency resumed. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that in France, the 2020 autumnal lockdown was not the main initiator of the decrease in SARS-CoV-2 circulation and curfews were important in achieving control of the transmission. Less-restrictive measures may need to be balanced with more-stringent measures to achieve desirable public health outcomes over time.","output":"The autumnal lockdown was not the main initiator of the decrease in SARS-CoV-2 circulation in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shown the need for early diagnosis to manage infectious disease outbreaks.

As older adults use technologies with greater frequency, proficiency, and confidence, health information technologies (HITs) now hold considerable potential as a means to enable broader access to tools and services for the purposes of screening, treatment, monitoring, and ongoing maintenance of health for this group. The InnoWell Platform is a digital tool co-designed with lived experience to facilitate better outcomes by enabling access to a comprehensive multidimensional assessment, the results of which are provided in real time to enable consumers to make informed decisions about clinical and nonclinical care options independently or in collaboration with a health professional. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the usability and acceptability of a prototype of the InnoWell Platform, co-designed and configured with and for older adults, using self-report surveys. METHODS: Participants were adults 50 years and older who were invited to engage with the InnoWell Platform naturalistically (ie, at their own discretion) for a period of 90 days. In addition, they completed short web-based surveys at baseline regarding their background, health, and mental well-being. After 90 days, participants were asked to complete the System Usability Scale to evaluate the usability and acceptability of the prototyped InnoWell Platform, with the aim of informing the iterative redesign and development of this digital tool before implementation within a health service setting. RESULTS: A total of 19 participants consented to participate in the study; however, only the data from the 16 participants (mean age 62.8 years, SD 7.5; range 50-72) who completed at least part of the survey at 90 days were included in the analyses. Participants generally reported low levels of psychological distress and good mental well-being. In relation to the InnoWell Platform, the usability scores were suboptimal. Although the InnoWell Platform was noted to be easy to use, participants had difficulty identifying the relevance of the tool for their personal circumstances. Ease of use, the comprehensive nature of the assessment tools, and the ability to track progress over time were favored features of the InnoWell Platform, whereas the need for greater personalization and improved mobile functionality were cited as areas for improvement.

METHODS: One-hundred-and-twenty Israeli ex-prisoners of war (ex-POWs) from 1973 Yom Kippur War and 65 matched controls (combat veterans from the same war) were followed up at five points of time: 1991 (T1), 2003 (T2), 2008 (T3), 2015 (T4), and in April-May 2020 (T5), during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Ex-POWs had higher odds of COVID-19 related increase in TV news watching, which, in turn, contributed to PTSD severity at T5. In addition, delayed PTSD trajectory was associated with COVID-19 related increase in TV news watching, which, in turn, contributed to more severe PTSD at T5. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the negative implications of TV news watching during a mass trauma for traumatized individuals. More specifically, they demonstrate its potential pathogenic role in exacerbating prior PTSD among trauma survivors.","output":"Overwhelmed by the news: A longitudinal study of prior trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder trajectories, and news watching during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the current uncontrolled outbreak of infectious disease, has caused significant challenges throughout the world.

However, the identification of the placental lesions due to SARS-CoV-2 infection would be a significant advance in order to improve the management of these pregnancies and to identify the mechanisms involved in a possible vertical transmission. The pathological findings in placentas delivered from 198 SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women were investigated for the presence of lesions associated with placental SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection was investigated in placental tissues through immunohistochemistry, and positive cases were further confirmed by in situ hybridization. SARS-CoV-2 infection was also investigated by RT-PCR in 33 cases, including all the immunohistochemically positive cases. Nine cases were SARS-CoV-2-positive by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and RT-PCR. These placentas showed lesions characterized by villous trophoblast necrosis with intervillous space collapse and variable amounts of mixed intervillous inflammatory infiltrate and perivillous fibrinoid deposition. Such lesions ranged from focal to massively widespread in five cases, resulting in intrauterine fetal death. Two of the stillborn fetuses showed some evidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. The remaining 189 placentas did not show similar lesions. The strong association between trophoblastic damage and placenta SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that this lesion is a specific marker of SARS-CoV-2 infection in placenta. Diffuse trophoblastic damage, massively affecting chorionic villous tissue, can result in fetal death associated with COVID-19 disease.","output":"Diffuse trophoblast damage is the hallmark of SARS-CoV-2-associated fetal demise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last months, as oncology specialists, we have frequently been contacted for estimating prognosis for cancer patients affected by COVID-19 infection. Until now, there have been no clear markers to guide decision making regarding the appropriateness of invasive ventilation in cancer patients affected by COVID-19 infection. We developed a practical tool encompassing a prognostic score, \\"The Milano Policlinico ONCOVID-ICU score.\\" The score is composed of three groups of variables: patient's characteristics such as sex, age, BMI, and comorbidities; oncological variables (treatment intent, life expectancy, on or off-treatment status); and clinical parameters in association with laboratory values (the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and D-dimer). The SOFA score includes six different clinical parameters and during the first few days of ICU admissions has an important prognostic role. The oncological history should never represent, per se, a contraindication to intensive care and must be considered together with other variables, such as laboratory values, clinical parameters, and patient characteristics, in order to make the hardest but best possible choice.

One class of solutions are symptom checkers, which have become very popular in the context of COVID-19. Traditional symptom checkers, however, are based on manually curated expert systems that are inflexible and hard to modify, especially in a quickly changing situation like the one we are facing today. That is why all COVID-19 existing solutions are manual symptom checkers that can only estimate the probability of this disease and cannot contemplate alternative hypothesis or come up with a differential diagnosis. While machine learning offers an alternative, the lack of reliable data does not make it easy to apply to COVID-19 either. In this paper we present an approach that combines the strengths of traditional AI expert systems and novel deep learning models. In doing so we can leverage prior knowledge as well as any amount of existing data to quickly derive models that best adapt to the current state of the world and latest scientific knowledge. We use the approach to train a COVID-19 aware differential diagnosis model that can be used for medical decision support both for doctors or patients. We show that our approach is able to accurately model new incoming data about COVID-19 while still preserving accuracy on conditions that had been modeled in the past. While our approach shows evident and clear advantages for an extreme situation like the one we are currently facing, we also show that its flexibility generalizes beyond this concrete, but very important, example.","output":"COVID-19 in differential diagnosis of online symptom assessments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and policies to control the outbreak such as quarantine, jobs closures, and traffic restrictions on active travel of Central Businesses District (CBD) residents in comparison with the non-CBD residents of Shiraz, Iran;and examine the relationship between perceived built environment factors and active travel in the pre- and post-outbreak. The results indicate that the most effective individuals factors on active travel are bicycle and car ownership, and built environment characteristics are walkability, bikeability, security, aesthetics, traffic calming, intersections safety, land uses diversity and density, destination accessibility, street pattern, and bike-sharing infrastructures. Also, the average walking and cycling time of the CBD residents before and after the outbreak is more than that of the non-CBD residents, which is due to the quality of built environment factors in the CBD. A built environment with mixed, diverse, dense and accessible land uses, as well as safe and secure cycling and walking routes have major effects on active travel in the crisis.

These pathways are tightly regulated by the host to prevent an inappropriate cellular response, but viruses can modulate these pathways to proliferate and spread. In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism in which hepatitis C virus (HCV) evades the immune surveillance system to proliferate by activating microRNA-21 (miR-21). We demonstrated that HCV infection upregulates miR-21, which in turn suppresses HCV-triggered type I IFN production, thus promoting HCV replication. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-21 targets two important factors in the TLR signaling pathway, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), which are involved in HCV-induced type I IFN production. HCV-mediated activation of miR-21 expression requires viral proteins and several signaling components. Moreover, we identified a transcription factor, activating protein-1 (AP-1), which is partly responsible for miR-21 induction in response to HCV infection through PKC/JNK/c-Jun and PKC/ERK/c-Fos cascades. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-21 is upregulated during HCV infection and negatively regulates IFN- signaling through MyD88 and IRAK1 and may be a potential therapeutic target for antiviral intervention.","output":"HCV-Induced miR-21 Contributes to Evasion of Host Immune System by Targeting MyD88 and IRAK1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The open reading frame (ORF) 1b-encoded part of the equine arteritis virus (EAV) replicase is expressed by ribosomal frameshifting during genome translation, which results in the production of an ORF1ab fusion protein (345 kDa). Four ORF1b-encoded processing products, nsp9 (p80), nsp10 (p50), nsp11 (p26), and nsp12 (p12), have previously been identified in EAV-infected cells (L. C. van Dinten, A. L. M. Wassenaar, A. E. Gorbalenya, W. J. M. Spaan, and E. J. Snijder, J. Virol. 70:6625-6633, 1996). In the present study, the generation of these four nonstructural proteins was shown to be mediated by the nsp4 serine protease, which is the main viral protease (E. J. Snijder, A. L. M. Wassenaar, L. C. van Dinten, W. J. M. Spaan, and A. E. Gorbalenya, J. Biol. Chem. 271:4864-4871, 1996). Mutagenesis of candidate cleavage sites revealed that Glu-2370/Ser, Gln-2837/Ser, and Glu-3056/Gly are the probable nsp9/10, nsp10/11, and nsp11/12 junctions, respectively.

The potential use of estimands to improve trial research and reporting has been underpinned by the recent publication of the ICH E9(R1) Addendum on the use of estimands in clinical trials in 2019. We set out to assess how well estimands are described in published trial protocols. METHODS: We reviewed 50 trial protocols published in October 2020 in Trials and BMJ Open. For each protocol, we determined whether the estimand for the primary outcome was explicitly stated, not stated but inferable (i.e. could be constructed from the information given), or not inferable. RESULTS: None of the 50 trials explicitly described the estimand for the primary outcome, and in 74% of trials, it was impossible to infer the estimand from the information included in the protocol. The population attribute of the estimand could not be inferred in 36% of trials, the treatment condition attribute in 20%, the population-level summary measure in 34%, and the handling of intercurrent events in 60% (the strategy for handling non-adherence was not inferable in 32% of protocols, and the strategy for handling mortality was not inferable in 80% of the protocols for which it was applicable). Conversely, the outcome attribute was stated for all trials. In 28% of trials, three or more of the five estimand attributes could not be inferred. CONCLUSIONS: The description of estimands in published trial protocols is poor, and in most trials, it is impossible to understand exactly what treatment effect is being estimated. Given the utility of estimands to improve clinical research and reporting, this urgently needs to change.

Besides theoretical assumptions, there is no evidence that OSA may favor SARS-CoV-2 acquisition or may lead to a more severe disease. Taking the opportunity of the Atahualpa Project cohort, we aimed to assess the relationship between previously diagnosed OSA and SARS-CoV-2 infection in older adults living in rural Ecuador. PATIENTS AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were determined in 180 individuals aged >60 years that underwent polysomnography previously to this novel pandemic. Those with OSA remained untreated due to income limitations. Exposure-effect models were fitted with OSA as the exposure, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and symptomatology as the outcomes, and confounders C age, gender, obesity, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, individuals per house, home confinement C as independent variables. RESULTS: A total of 87 (48%) individuals were seropositive to SARS-CoV-2, 77% of whom were symptomatic. The mean apnea/hypopnea index was 11.111.7 episodes per hour, with 83 (46%) individuals having mild, and 38 (21%) moderate-to-severe OSA. Exposure-effect models demonstrated lack of relationship between OSA and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and symptomatology.

Some animal experiments suggested the possibility of an animal to animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and were seen in some cases of infected animals. Animal to human transmission was considered unlikely until investigations revealed the possibility of mink to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands. OBJECTIVE: Current study aims at highlighting the predominance of SARS-CoV-2 infection in various animal species, reverse zoonotic transmission and proposing possible animal models that might aid in study and development of vaccine against Covid-19. METHODS: The authors have gathered information on various animal species infected with SARS-CoV-2 and possible tests conducted from online news reports, websites and Scopus indexed journals. RESULTS: Studying the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to domestic animals concluded that pigs, chicken, and ducks were not vulnerable to Covid-19; dogs showed less susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and cats as well as ferrets were seen susceptible to Covid-19. SARS-CoV-2 is seen crossing the species barrier, infecting humans from the wild with the source yet unclear, spreading from humans to humans quickly, humans to animals, animals to animals, and is likely to spread from animals to humans even though minimally. Animals appear somewhat resistant to SARS-CoV-2 transmission compared to humans who globally crossed eight million infection cases, and the infected animals mostly do not show many complications and recover quickly. CONCLUSION: Precautions are advised to prevent human to animal transmission of the virus, and in some areas, avoid animal to human spread of the virus. Further monitoring is required to assess the SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals as COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving condition worldwide.

AIMS: The aims of this study were to describe the immediate actions made by chiropractic programs to deliver education for manual therapy techniques and to summarise the experience of academics who teach manual therapy techniques during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive approach was used to describe the immediate actions made by chiropractic programs to deliver manual therapy technique education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chiropractic programs were identified from the webpages of the Councils on Chiropractic Education International and the Council on Chiropractic Education - USA. Between May and June 2020, a convenience sample of academics who lead or teach in manual therapy technique in those programs were invited via email to participate in an online survey with open-ended questions. Responses were entered into the NVivo software program and analysed using a reflexive thematic analysis by a qualitative researcher independent to the data collection. RESULTS: Data from 16 academics in 13 separate chiropractic programs revealed five, interconnected themes: Immediate response; Move to online delivery; Impact on learning and teaching; Additional challenges faced by educators; and Ongoing challenges post lockdown.

Chiropractic programs around the world provided their students with rapid, innovative learning strategies, in an attempt to maintain high standards of chiropractic education; however, challenges included maintaining student engagement in an online teaching environment, psychomotor skills acquisition and staff workload.","output":"COVID-19: how has a global pandemic changed manual therapy technique education in chiropractic programs around the world?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose To quantify the change in heart failure (HF) hospitalizations observed in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic across a large, multi-center health care system Methods MHealth Fairview encompasses four hospitals (one academic, three community-based) in the Minneapolis, Minnesota metro area To compare HF hospitalization trends, two inpatient samples were created using HF discharges in the following time periods: pre COVID-19 (February 28, 2019-February 28, 2020) and post COVID-19 (April 1, 2020- May 15, 2020) March 2020 was excluded as this represented a transition point of the pandemic in the United States Average number of discharges per day as well as demographics, diagnosis related group (DRG) codes, and inpatient mortality was then compared between the two inpatient HF samples Results The pre COVID-19 group had 2,601 patients with an average of 7 1 (+/-3) discharges per day The post COVID-19 group had 210 patients with an average of 4 7 (+/-1 7) discharges per day, which represented a 34% reduction in HF discharges (p &lt;0 001) No statistically significant differences were observed between the pre and post COVID-19 inpatient samples with respect to age (76 vs 75 years, p = 0 25), gender (46% vs 48% male, p = 0 7), and DRG codes (DRG 291: 78% vs 85% p = 0 15) Inpatient HF mortality pre and post COVID-19 was not significantly different (3% vs 2 9%, p = 0 99) Conclusion","output":"Heart Failure Hospitalization Trends During the Early Phase of the COVID 19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anaphylaxis to vaccines is historically a rare event. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic drove the need for rapid vaccine production applying a novel antigen delivery system: messenger RNA vaccines packaged in lipid nanoparticles. Unexpectedly, public vaccine administration led to a small number of severe allergic reactions, with resultant substantial public concern, especially within atopic individuals. We reviewed the constituents of the messenger RNA lipid nanoparticle vaccine and considered several contributors to these reactions: (1) contact system activation by nucleic acid, (2) complement recognition of the vaccine-activating allergic effector cells, (3) preexisting antibody recognition of polyethylene glycol, a lipid nanoparticle surface hydrophilic polymer, and (4) direct mast cell activation, coupled with potential genetic or environmental predispositions to hypersensitivity. Unfortunately, measurement of anti-polyethylene glycol antibodies in vitro is not clinically available, and the predictive value of skin testing to polyethylene glycol components as a coronavirus disease 2019 messenger RNA vaccine-specific anaphylaxis marker is unknown. Even less is known regarding the applicability of vaccine use for testing (in vitro/vivo) to ascertain pathogenesis or predict reactivity risk. Expedient and thorough research-based evaluation of patients who have suffered anaphylactic vaccine reactions and prospective clinical trials in putative at-risk individuals are needed to address these concerns during a public health crisis.","output":"Potential mechanisms of anaphylaxis to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Underlying biological, genetic, or epigenetic characteristics may predispose to health differences and outcomes with COVID-19 associated stroke. Social determinants of health, access and geographical differences pertaining both to population density and other location-based factors may also be important. Methods: We report 69 cases of acute stroke in patients positive for SARS-CoV-2, in a dichotomized analysis of ischemic stroke outcomes between patients of African American background versus all other backgrounds. All patients presented to 14 major hospitals in the United States and Canada, from March 14-April 14, 2020. All patients had nasopharyngeal swab samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on qualitative RT-PCR assays. Results: We found no significant difference in age (64.4 versus 62.9 years) or the proportion of females (51.9% versus 38.1%) (table 1). Diabetes mellitus was present significantly less in African American cases versus others (37% vs. 66.7%). The African American cohort had a similar mean NIHSS score of 16.3 compared with 14.9 in other races (p=0.63). The door-to-CT time was also similar (23 versus 19 minutes). The proportion of patients presenting with a large vessel occlusion was not significantly different (40.7% versus 47%). We noted 14.8% of African American cases received intravenous tPA compared to 31% in other races but was not significantly different. The proportion of thrombectomy cases mirrored this (14.8% versus 31%). Regarding stroke functional outcomes, there was no difference between African Americans and other races with respect to discharge mRS or proportion of favorable outcome (mRS 0-2). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) was significantly higher for African Americans (11.1% versus 3%, p&lt;0.001).Mortality was significantly higher in African Americans compared to other races (51.9% vs. 28.6%,p=0.03). Discussion: The reasons for increased mortality in African Americans with COVID-19-associatedstroke are unknown.

Further studies revealed markedly higher levels of viral RNA in the lungs, heart and serum of low-dose-ricin pretreated, as compared to non-pretreated mice. Notably, the deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection were effectively alleviated by passive transfer of polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies generated against SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Thus, viral cell entry in the sensitized mice seems to involve viral RBD binding, albeit by a mechanism other than the canonical ACE2-mediated uptake route.

A proportional quota-sampling technique was used to obtain equal distributions of participants by age and gender across the 13 regions of Saudi Arabia. Self-reported food allergy, height, weight, health conditions, mental health status, and demographic variables were collected. Of the 6239 participants contacted, 4709 (75.48%) participants responded and completed the interview. Furthermore, 50.1% of the participants were female, with a mean age of 36.4  13.5 years (18C90 years). The prevalence of food allergies was 19.7%. The most self-reported food allergies were egg, shellfish and shrimp, and peanuts, with a prevalence of 3.7%, 3.1%, and 3.0%, respectively. There was an association between the presence of food allergies and reported bariatric surgery, asthma, colon disease, and being at risk of depression. Bariatric surgery was significantly associated with lower likelihood of self-reported allergy (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.22C2.34, p = 0.002). This study revealed, for the first time, a high prevalence of self-reported food allergies among adults in Saudi Arabia in a large nationwide sample, and food allergy association with bariatric surgery, asthma, colon disease, and being at risk of depression.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to discuss the incidence, characteristics, diagnostic criteria, biomarkers, and outcomes of hospitalized patients diagnosed with CAPA. METHODS: A literature search was performed through Pubmed and Web of Science databases for articles published up to March 20th, 2021. RESULTS: In 1,421 COVID-19 patients, the overall CAPA incidence was 13.5% (ranging 2.5-35.0%). The majority required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The time to CAPA diagnosis from illness onset varied between 8.0-16.0 days. However, the time to CAPA diagnosis from ICU admission and IMV initiation ranged between 4.0-15.0 days and 3.0-8.0 days. The most common diagnostic criteria were the modified AspICU-Dutch/Belgian Mycosis Study Group and IAPA-Verweij et al. 77.6% of patients had positive lower respiratory tract cultures, other fungal biomarkers of BAL and serum galactomannan were positive in 45.3% and 18.2% of patients. The CAPA mortality rate was high at 48.4%, despite the widespread use of antifungals. Lengthy hospital and ICU LOS ranging between 16.0-37.5 days and 10.5-37.0 days were observed. CAPA patients had prolonged IMV duration of 13.0-20.0 days. CONCLUSION: The true incidence of CAPA likely remains unknown as the diagnosis is limited by the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria that rely solely on microbiological data with direct or indirect detection of Aspergillus in respiratory specimens, particularly in clinical conditions with a low pretest probability. A well-designed, multi-center study to determine the optimal diagnostic approach for CAPA is required.","output":"The Incidence, Diagnosis, and Outcomes of COVID-19-associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CAPA): A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: This study examined the association between perceived organizational support (POS) and COVID-19 vaccine intention and the influence of the implementation of workplace infection prevention measures. Methods: We analyzed 23,846 workers using data from an Internet survey of workers aged 20-65 years conducted in December 2020, during a period of widespread COVID-19 infection in Japan. Results: A higher POS was associated with a higher intention to vaccinate. The relationship between POS and vaccine intention was attenuated when adjusted for infection prevention measures in the workplace. Conclusions: In workplaces where POS is present, a sense of responsibility to the group and altruistic behavior may arise. This means employees act to acquire herd immunity to protect others, which may result in increased vaccine intention. The association between POS and vaccination intention was attenuated by adjusting for workplace infection prevention measures, which suggested that infection prevention measures may be a confounding factor or that POS created a health climate that promoted infection prevention measures. The results suggest that working to improve employee well-being and implementing appropriate workplace infection prevention measures during infectious disease outbreaks may promote vaccination behavior and contribute to the acquisition of herd immunity in the community.","output":"Cross-sectional study of the association between perceived organizational support and COVID-19 vaccine intention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenge for our healthcare system but at the same time is one of the excellent catalyzers and promoters of successful translational research. The COVID-19 is not only a simple viral infection of the bronchial system but is also a pandemic hyperinflammatory multiorgan disease. The cardiovascular system plays a causal role in this context, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) invades host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), an enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system. Furthermore, cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity play an important role in the severity of the course of the disease. Additional risk factors, such as gender, age, genetics and air pollution modulate both the severity of the SARS-CoV?2 infection as well as cardiovascular diseases. As sequelae of COVID-19, increased thrombosis, myocardial infarction, myocardial inflammation and vasculitis occur, which directly damage the cardiovascular system and substantially contribute to the high morbidity and mortality. Knowledge gained from many studies on the course of the disease in patients infected with SARS-CoV?2 has led to improved treatment possibilities, which now in the second wave are partly standardized and were, and are, in particular adapted to complications of the cardiovascular system. In this review we provide a short overview on the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV?2 in general and also specifically on the cardiovascular system.

Since it is dispensable for HCV RNA replication, the non-structural viral protein NS2 is suggested to play a central role in HCV particle assembly. However, despite genetic evidences, we have almost no understanding about NS2 protein-protein interactions and their role in the production of infectious particles. Here, we used co-immunoprecipitation and/or fluorescence resonance energy transfer with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy analyses to study the interactions between NS2 and the viroporin p7 and the HCV glycoprotein E2. In addition, we used alanine scanning insertion mutagenesis as well as other mutations in the context of an infectious virus to investigate the functional role of NS2 in HCV assembly. Finally, the subcellular localization of NS2 and several mutants was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Our data demonstrate molecular interactions between NS2 and p7 and E2. Furthermore, we show that, in the context of an infectious virus, NS2 accumulates over time in endoplasmic reticulum-derived dotted structures and colocalizes with both the envelope glycoproteins and components of the replication complex in close proximity to the HCV core protein and lipid droplets, a location that has been shown to be essential for virus assembly. We show that NS2 transmembrane region is crucial for both E2 interaction and subcellular localization. Moreover, specific mutations in core, envelope proteins, p7 and NS5A reported to abolish viral assembly changed the subcellular localization of NS2 protein. Together, these observations indicate that NS2 protein attracts the envelope proteins at the assembly site and it crosstalks with non-structural proteins for virus assembly.","output":"NS2 Protein of Hepatitis C Virus Interacts with Structural and Non-Structural Proteins towards Virus Assembly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Higher rates of serious illness and death from coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection among older people and those who have comorbidities suggest that age- and disease-related biological processes make such individuals more sensitive to environmental stress factors including infectious agents like coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

Due to the dynamic development of infections and the time lag between when patients are infected and when a proportion of them enters an intensive care unit (ICU), the need for future intensive care can easily be underestimated. To infer future ICU load from reported infections, we suggest a simple statistical model that (1) accounts for time lags and (2) allows for making predictions depending on different future growth of infections. We have evaluated our model for three heavily affected regions in Europe, namely Berlin (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), and Madrid (Spain). Before extensive containment measures made an impact, we first estimate the region-specific model parameters, namely ICU rate, time lag between infection, and ICU admission as well as length of stay in ICU. Whereas for Berlin, an ICU rate of 6%, a time lag of 6 days, and a stay of 12 days in ICU provide the best fit of the data, for Lombardy and Madrid the ICU rate was higher (18% and 15%) and the time lag (0 and 3 days) and the stay in ICU (3 and 8 days) shorter. The region-specific models are then used to predict future ICU load assuming either a continued exponential phase with varying growth rates (0C15%) or linear growth. By keeping the growth rates flexible, this model allows for taking into account the potential effect of diverse containment measures. Thus, the model can help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU capacity depending on future growth. A sensitivity analysis for an extended time period shows that the proposed model is particularly useful for exponential phases of the disease.","output":"COVID-19: a simple statistical model for predicting intensive care unit load in exponential phases of the disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Energy transformation and sustainability have become a challenge, especially for developing countries, which face broad energy-related issues such as a wide demand-supply gap, extensive fossil fuel dependency, and low accessibility to clean energy.

The present study was carried out to test the hypothesis that dietary flaxseed supplementation before and after an MI regulates the expression of above-mentioned miRNAs to produce its cardioprotective effect. Animals were randomized after inducing MI by coronary artery ligation into: (a) sham MI with normal chow, (b) MI with normal chow, and (c-e) MI supplemented with either 10% milled flaxseed, or 4.4% flax oil enriched in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or 0.44% flax lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.

METHODOLOGY We conducted a cross-sectional survey of emergency department staff and clinicians (response rate = 52%; analytic N = 241) in July 2020. The survey measured psychological safety, feeling heard, overall burnout, worsening burnout, and perceived process adaptation during the COVID-19 crisis. We assessed descriptive statistics and construct measurement properties, and we assessed relationships among the variables using generalized structural equation modeling. RESULTS Psychological safety and feeling heard demonstrated acceptable measurement properties and were correlated at r = .54. Levels of feeling heard were lower on average than psychological safety. Psychological safety and feeling heard were both statistically significantly associated with lower burnout and greater process adaptation. Only psychological safety exhibited a statistically significant relationship with less worsening burnout during crisis. We found evidence that feeling heard mediates psychological safety's relationship to burnout and process adaptation. CONCLUSION Psychological safety is important but not sufficient for feeling heard. Feeling heard may help mitigate burnout and enable adaptation during uncertainty.

The current study investigated the association between parental warmth/coercion and aggression/rule-breaking behaviour, and to determine whether these associations are mediated by callous-unemotional trait dimensions. A sample of 462 adolescents completed a questionnaire assessing callous-unemotional traits and externalising behaviour problems, and their parents completed a parenting style questionnaire. A path model revealed that parental warmth had a negative direct effect on the dimensions callousness and uncaring, which in turn had a positive effect on aggression and rule-breaking behaviour. Parental coercion had a positive direct effect on unemotionality, which was not associated with aggression and rule-breaking behaviour. Only parental warmth had an indirect effect onto externalising behaviour problems via callous-unemotional traits. Our findings demonstrate that even during adolescence, parenting remains an important factor for callous-unemotional traits and externalising behaviour problems.

The modifications introduced are designed to favour minimally invasive surgery. The positive results obtained with intracorporeal resection and anastomosis in the right colon and rectum prompt us to adapt these procedures to the left colon. We describe a 'don't touch the bowel' technique and outline the benefits to patients of the use of less surgically aggressive techniques and also to surgeons in terms of the lower emission of aerosols that might transmit the COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This was an observational study of intracorporeal resection and anastomosis in left colectomy. We describe the technical details of intracorporeal resection, end-to-end stapled anastomosis and extraction of the specimen through mini-laparotomy in the ideal location. RESULTS: We present preliminary results of 17 patients with left-sided colonic pathologies, 15 neoplasia and two diverticular disease, who underwent four left hemicolectomies, six sigmoidectomies and seven high anterior resections. Median operating time was 186 min (range 120-280). No patient required conversion to extracorporeal laparoscopy or open surgery. Median hospital stay was 4.7 days (range 3-12 days). There was one case of anastomotic leak managed with conservative treatment. CONCLUSION: Intracorporeal resection and end-to-end anastomosis with the possibility of extraction of the specimen by a mini-laparotomy in the ideal location may present benefits and also adapts well to the conditions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The synthetic analogue poly I:C is frequently used to mimic anti-viral innate immune responses in models of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders including schizophrenia, autism, Parkinsons disease and Alzheimers disease. Many studies perform limited analysis of innate immunity despite these responses potentially differing as a function of dsRNA molecular weight and age. Therefore fundamental questions relevant to impacts of systemic viral infection on brain function and integrity remain. Here, we studied innate immune-inducing properties of poly I:C preparations of different lengths and responses in adult and aged mice. High molecular weight (HMW) poly I:C (1C6kb, 12 mg/kg) produced more robust sickness behavior and more robust IL-6, IFN-I and TNF responses than poly I:C of <500 bases (low MW) preparations. This was partly overcome with higher doses of LMW (up to 80 mg/kg), but neither circulating IFN nor brain transcription of Irf7 were significantly induced by LMW poly I:C, despite brain Ifnb transcription, suggesting that brain IFN-dependent gene expression is predominantly triggered by circulating IFN binding of IFNAR1. In aged animals, poly I:C induced exaggerated IL-6, IL-1 and IFN-I in the plasma and similar exaggerated brain cytokine responses. This was associated with acute working memory deficits selectively in aged mice. Thus, we demonstrate dsRNA length-, IFNAR1- and age-dependent effects on anti-viral inflammation and cognitive function.

In this study, we found that pterostilbene inhibited proliferation, induced intrinsic mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and caused S phase arrest, inhibited migration and excessive invasion in glioma cells. Pretreatment with the pan-caspase-inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK attenuated the PTE-induced apoptosis of glioma cells. Moreover, PTE significantly increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Inhibition of ROS with N-acetyl-L-cysteine not only rescued PTE-induced reduction of cellular viability but also prevented glioma cell apoptosis. We also discovered ERK 1/2 and JNK signaling pathways were activated by PTE and contributed to induce glioma cell apoptosis.

In a field study, a possible channel of disease transmission between consecutive guests in hotel rooms is revealed. In order to prevent the transmission, an innovative assembly-line housekeeping method is developed. Academic/practical relevance: The transmission of infectious diseases during hotel stays (e.g., by touching unclean towels or bed linens) has been reported globally. Under the current COVID-19 pandemic, having contact with saliva or mucus left by an infected person could cause infection. The standard housekeeping process used by the majority of hotels leaves a channel for new towels and bed linens in refreshed rooms to be contaminated by bacteria or viruses from used towels and bed linens. Eliminating the contamination channel and preventing disease transmission are crucial for protecting the health and safety of hotel guests, especially under a disease outbreak such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: The research was conducted during a field study at a hotel. To design the assembly-line process, the service time distribution of each housekeeping operational step is characterized using data collected from the practice at hundreds of hotel rooms. An optimization model is proposed to optimize the operation. Through a pilot test, the performance of the assembly-line and the traditional housekeeping methods is compared. Results: The pilot test results show that the assembly-line housekeeping method has the potential to improve not only hygienic standards but also, labor efficiency and service quality (error rate). Managerial implications: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic draws tremendous public attention on disease transmission and public hygiene. The principle of the assembly-line method (i.e., eliminating contamination channels through teamwork operational design) can be applied to not only hotel housekeeping practices but also, many other service settings.

Personal health records (PHRs) are suitable for the daily management of physical conditions. Importantly, there are no major differences between the items collected by daily health observation via PHR and the observation of items related to COVID-19. Until now, observations related to COVID-19 have been performed exclusively based on disease-specific items. Therefore, we hypothesize that PHRs would be suitable as a symptom-tracking tool for COVID-19. To this end, we integrated health observation items specific to COVID-19 with an existing PHR-based app. OBJECTIVE: This study is conducted as a proof-of-concept study in a real-world setting to develop a PHR-based COVID-19 symptom-tracking app and to demonstrate the practical use of health observations for COVID-19 using a smartphone or tablet app integrated with PHRs. METHODS: We applied the PHR-based health observation app within an active epidemiological investigation conducted by Wakayama City Public Health Center. At the public health center, a list is made of individuals who have been in close contact with known infected cases (health observers). Email addresses are used by the app when a health observer sends data to the public health center. Each health observer downloads the app and installs it on their smartphone. Self-observed health data are entered daily into the app. These data are then sent via the app by email at a designated time. Localized epidemiological officers can visualize the collected data using a spreadsheet macro and, thus, monitor the health condition of all health observers. RESULTS: We used the app as part of an active epidemiological investigation executed at a public health center. During the investigation, 72 close contacts were discovered. Among them, 57 had adopted the use of the health observation app. Before the introduction of the app, all health observers would have been interviewed by telephone, a slow process that took four epidemiological officers more than 2 hours. After the introduction of the app, a single epidemiological officer can carry out health observations. The app was distributed for free beginning in early March, and by mid-May, it had been used by more than 20,280 users and 400 facilities and organizations across Japan. Currently, health observation of COVID-19 is socially recognized and has become one of the requirements for resuming social activities. CONCLUSIONS: Health observation by PHRs for the purpose of improving health management can also be effectively applied as a measure against large-scale infectious diseases. Individual habits of improving awareness of personal health and the use of PHRs for daily health management are powerful armaments against the rapid spread of infectious diseases. Ultimately, similar actions may help to prevent the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Health Observation App for COVID-19 Symptom Tracking Integrated With Personal Health Records: Proof of Concept and Practical Use Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pharmacotherapies for the treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) are targeted at reducing cellular proliferation (static component) or reducing smooth muscle tone (dynamic component), but response is unpredictable and many patients fail to respond. An impediment to identifying novel pharmacotherapies is the incomplete understanding of paracrine signalling. Oxytocin has been highlighted as a potential paracrine mediator of BPH. To better understand oxytocin signalling, we investigated the effects of exogenous oxytocin on both stromal cell proliferation, and inherent spontaneous prostate contractions using primary models derived from human prostate tissue. We show that the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) is widely expressed in the human prostate, and co-localises to contractile cells within the prostate stroma. Exogenous oxytocin did not modulate prostatic fibroblast proliferation, but did significantly (p < 0.05) upregulate the frequency of spontaneous contractions in prostate tissue, indicating a role in generating smooth muscle tone. Application of atosiban, an OXTR antagonist, significantly (p < 0.05) reduced spontaneous contractions. Individual tissue responsiveness to both exogenous oxytocin (R2 = 0.697, p < 0.01) and atosiban (R2 = 0.472, p < 0.05) was greater in tissue collected from older men. Overall, our data suggest that oxytocin is a key regulator of inherent spontaneous prostate contractions, and targeting of the OXTR and associated downstream signalling is an attractive prospect in the development of novel BPH pharmacotherapies.","output":"Oxytocin receptor antagonists as a novel pharmacological agent for reducing smooth muscle tone in the human prostate."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Developing evidence-based recommendations on how to debunk health-related misinformation and more specific health myths in (online) communication is important for individual health and the society.

Further, the study investigated the effects of different visualisations (machine-technical created image, diagram, image of an expert, message without an image) in the debunking texts. SUBJECT AND METHODS: A representative sample of German Internet users (N = 700) participated in an anonymous online survey experiment with a 4 (myths)  4 (picture) mixed study design. RESULTS: The results show that receiving an online news article that refutes a widespread health myth with or without the use of an image can significantly change the attitudes of the recipients toward this myth.

A functional is elicitable if it is the unique minimiser of an expected scoring function, and identifiable if it is the unique zero of an expected identification function; both notions are essential for forecast ranking and validation, and $M$- and $Z$-estimation. Our framework distinguishes between exhaustive forecasts, being set-valued and aiming at correctly specifying the entire functional, and selective forecasts, content with solely specifying a single point in the correct functional. We establish a mutual exclusivity result: A set-valued functional can be either selectively elicitable or exhaustively elicitable or not elicitable at all. Notably, since quantiles are well known to be selectively elicitable, they fail to be exhaustively elicitable. We further show that the class of prediction intervals and Vorob'ev quantiles turn out to be exhaustively elicitable and selectively identifiable. In particular, we provide a mixture representation of elementary exhaustive scores, leading the way to Murphy diagrams. We give possibility and impossibility results for the shortest prediction interval and prediction intervals specified by an endpoint or a midpoint.

Teleophthalmology is a widely recognised tool that can assist in overcoming resource and distance barriers. Teleophthalmology gained unprecedented traction in NZ during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown. However, its provision is still limited and there are equity issues. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review identifying, describing and contrasting teleophthalmology services in NZ with the comparable countries of Australia, USA, Canada and the United Kingdom. METHODS: The electronic databases Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Google were systemically searched using the keywords: telemedicine, ophthalmology, tele-ophthalmology/teleophthalmology. The searches were filtered to the countries above, with no time constraints. An integrative approach was used to synthesise findings. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-two studies were identified describing 90 discrete teleophthalmology services. Articles spanned from 1997 to 2020. Models were categorised into general eye care (n=21; 16%); emergency/trauma (n=6; 4.5%); school screening (n=25; 19%); artificial intelligence (AI) (n=23; 18%); and disease-specific models of care (MOC) (n=57; 43%). The most common diseases addressed were diabetic retinopathy (n=23; 17%); retinopathy of prematurity (n=9; 7%); and glaucoma (n=8; 6%). Programs were mainly centred in the US (n=72; 54.5%), followed by the UK (n=29; 22%), then Canada (n=16; 12%), Australia (n=13; 10%), with the fewest identified in NZ (n=3; 2%). Models generally involved an ophthalmologist consultative service, remote supervision and triaging. Most models involved local clinicians transmitting fed-forward or live images. CONCLUSION: Teleophthalmology will likely play a crucial role in the future of eye care. COVID-19 has offered a unique opportunity to observe the use of teleophthalmology services globally. Feed-forward and, increasingly, live-based teleophthalmology services have demonstrated feasibility and cost-effectiveness in similar countries internationally. New Zealands teleophthalmology services, however, are currently limited. Investing in strategic partnerships and technology at a national level can advance health equities in ophthalmic care.","output":"A Systematic Review of Current Teleophthalmology Services in New Zealand Compared to the Four Comparable Countries of the United Kingdom, Australia, United States of America (USA) and Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During initial phases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many workplaces were affected by closures and various preventive measures intended to limit infections. Here, we characterize and compare in an ambidirectional cohort study SARS-CoV-2 serology among Norwegian school employees and retail employees at baseline following the first epidemiological wave, and at follow-up after a second wave. Methods: We enrolled a cohort of 238 school and retail employees after the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. Self-reported exposure history and serum samples were collected at 10 schools and 15 retail stores in Oslo, Norway, sampled at two time-points, baseline (May 18. to July 2. 2020) and follow-up (Jan 7. to Mar 17. 2021). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting both spike and nucleocapsid were characterized by multiplex microsphere-based serological methods. Results: At baseline, 6 enrolled workers presented with positive SARS-CoV-2 serology (3%; CI [1, 6]; P=0.019), which was significantly higher than the expected 1% prevalence in the general Oslo-population at this time-point. Five of the positive cases were retail employees. However, school and retail groups distributions at baseline were not significantly different as the number of seropositive observations were limited. Due to a school closure effectuated during the first wave, half of the school employees reported []2 days of physical workplace presence per week, while 65% of the retail employees reported []5 days per week. Eight months later, after passing a second epidemiological wave, school and retail groups presented 11 new seropositive cases altogether, but there was still no significant differences between the groups. Physical attendance at the workplace was similar between the groups during the second wave, but some preventive measures against viral transmission at workplaces were different. Self-reported virus diagnostics (RNA) for the same period were compared to the serological data obtained in this study, showing that all but one positive SARS-CoV-2 serological findings arising between baseline and follow-up had been diagnosed with virus testing. Conclusions: After the first wave, distribution of SARS-CoV-2 positive serology was slightly higher than expected in a cohort of school and retail employees. Distribution of infection was not significantly different between the groups at baseline nor at follow-up, even though physical workplace attendance had been different. Nearly all new seropositive cases discovered in this study between baseline and follow-up, had already been diagnosed due to widespread virus testing during the second wave. This highlights the importance of extensive viral testing among workers.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 serological findings and exposure risk among employees in school and retail after first and second wave COVID-19 pandemic in Oslo, Norway: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fix data are available on the management of pregnant women infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Given the geographic dynamics of disease outbreaks in the region, it seems obvious that research on risk communication needs to contemplate how these countries manage risk communication about simultaneously occurring infectious diseases. Yet, this is missing in risk communication scholarship. I draw on insights from the social amplification of risk framework to assess how three amplification stations responded to risk signals about proximate Ebola and cholera outbreaks in 2014 in Ghana. Based on in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with risk communicators, media workers, and community members, I argue that the differing individual and social experiences of Ebola and cholera in Ghana were shaped by historical, religious, socio-cultural, and institutional processing of risk signals, which guided judgements about risks. This study contributes to the literature on the social amplification of risk framework and risk and crisis communication by showing how the context of an impending crisis can lead to a health crisis for a preventable and treatable disease through the amplification and attenuation of risks signals.

METHODOLOGY: This was an experimental study on healthy human volunteers (n=8 eyes). In an experimental setup, NCT was performed on eyes (n=8) of human volunteers under normal settings, with a single and 2 drops of lubricant. High-speed shadowgraphy, frontal lighting technique, and fluorescein analysis were used to detect the possible generation of any droplets and aerosols. Mathematical computation of the spread of the droplets was then performed. RESULTS: In a natural setting, there was no droplet or aerosol production. Minimal splatter along with droplet ejection was observed when 1 drop of lubricant was used before NCT. When 2 drops of lubricant were instilled, a significant amount of fluid ejection in the form of a sheet that broke up into multiple droplets was observed. Some of these droplets traversed back to the tonometer. Droplets ranging from 100 to 500 m in diameter were measured. CONCLUSIONS: There was no droplet generation during NCT performed in a natural setting.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of case notes of patients seen in one-stop clinic, between January 2017 and January 2019, was conducted. All General Practitioner (GP) referrals were screened by a specialist nurse. RESULTS: After completion of the post-GP referral screening process, 252 patients (median age 68 years, IQR 58.8C77.3 years; M:F ratio 118:134) were allocated to the one-stop clinic.

METHODS: We performed a literature search to answer four key questions. The committee graded the evidence and developed recommendations by using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. QUESTIONS ADDRESSED BY THE GUIDELINE AND RECOMMENDATIONS: We assessed evidence on the risk of bacterial infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the associated bacterial pathogens, how to diagnose bacterial infections and how to treat bacterial infections. Bacterial co-infection upon admission was reported in 3.5% of COVID-19 patients, while bacterial secondary infections during hospitalization occurred up to 15%. No or very low quality evidence was found to answer the other key clinical questions. Although the evidence base on bacterial infections in COVID-19 is currently limited, available evidence supports restrictive antibiotic use from an antibiotic stewardship perspective, especially upon admission. To support restrictive antibiotic use, maximum efforts should be undertaken to obtain sputum and blood culture samples as well as pneumococcal urinary antigen testing. We suggest to stop antibiotics in patients who started antibiotic treatment upon admission when representative cultures as well as urinary antigen tests show no signs of involvement of bacterial pathogens after 48 hours. For patients with secondary bacterial respiratory infection we recommend to follow other guideline recommendations on antibacterial treatment for patients with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia. An antibiotic treatment duration of five days in patients with COVID-19 and suspected bacterial respiratory infection is recommended upon improvement of signs, symptoms and inflammatory markers. Larger, prospective studies about the epidemiology of bacterial infections in COVID-19 are urgently needed to confirm our conclusions and ultimately prevent unnecessary antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Recommendations for antibacterial therapy in adults with COVID-19 C An evidence based guideline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A review was made of 195 peripheral blood smears of 157 neonates who required sepsis work-up in the first month of life.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the utility of the temporal scan statistic for detecting MRSA clusters, validate clusters using molecular techniques and hospital records, and determine significant differences in the rate of MRSA cases using regression models. METHODS: Patients admitted to a community hospital between August 2006 and February 2011, and identified with MRSA > 48 hours following hospital admission, were included in this study. Between March 2010 and February 2011, MRSA specimens were obtained for spa typing. MRSA clusters were investigated using a retrospective temporal scan statistic. Tests were conducted on a monthly scale and significant clusters were compared to MRSA outbreaks identified by hospital personnel. Associations between the rate of MRSA cases and the variables year, month, and season were investigated using a negative binomial regression model. RESULTS: During the study period, 735 MRSA cases were identified and 167 MRSA isolates were spa typed. Nine different spa types were identified with spa type 2/t002 (88.6%) the most prevalent. The temporal scan statistic identified significant MRSA clusters at the hospital (n = 2), service (n = 16), and ward (n = 10) levels (P  0.05). Seven clusters were concordant with nine MRSA outbreaks identified by hospital staff. For the remaining clusters, seven events may have been equivalent to true outbreaks and six clusters demonstrated possible transmission events. The regression analysis indicated years 2009C2011, compared to 2006, and months March and April, compared to January, were associated with an increase in the rate of MRSA cases (P  0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The application of the temporal scan statistic identified several MRSA clusters that were not detected by hospital personnel. The identification of specific years and months with increased MRSA rates may be attributable to several hospital level factors including the presence of other pathogens.

One important question is whether surveillance testing is still needed in order to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission in an increasingly vaccinated population. In this study, we developed a multi-scale mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a vaccinated population and used it to predict the role of testing in an outbreak with alpha and delta variants. We found that, when the alpha variant is dominant, testing is effective when vaccination levels are low to moderate and its impact is diminished when vaccination levels are high. When the delta variant is dominant, widespread vaccination is necessary in order to prevent significant outbreaks. When only moderate vaccination can be achieved, frequent testing can significantly reduce the cumulative size of delta variant outbreak, with the impact of testing having maximum effects when focused on the non-vaccinated population.","output":"Modeling the influence of vaccine administration on COVID-19 testing strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduccin: El objetivo del estudio es describir las caractersticas clnicas, patolgicas, virolgicas y genticas de la respuesta inmune de los pacientes diagnosticados con infeccin por SARS-CoV-2 y su relacin con el curso desfavorable de la enfermedad.

This is in contrast to other pulse oximeters and previous work reported in the literature. A Max30102 sensor, consisting of two light-emitting diodes (LEDs), can serve as a transmission spectrum to enable three synchronous parameter measurements. Hence, the Max30102 sensor facilitates identification of the relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes in a cost-effective manner. Fifty subjects (20 healthy, 20 diabetic, and 10 with COVID-19), aged 18-61 years, were recruited to provide data on heart rate, body temperature, and oxygen saturation, measured in a variety of activities and scenarios. The results showed accuracy of 97% for heart rate, 98% for body temperature, and 99% for oxygen saturation with an enhanced time efficiency of 5-7 seconds in contrast to a commercialized pulse oximeter, which took 10-12 seconds.

The resulting model parameters were used to extrapolate predictions for more recent data. While the Gompertz growth models (mean R2 = 0.998) best fitted the current data, uncertainties in the eventual case limit made future predictions with logistic models prone to errors. Of the other models, the quadratic rate model (mean R2 = 0.992) fitted the current data best for 25 (89 %) countries as determined by R2 values. The simple square and quadratic models accurately predicted the number of future total cases 37 and 36 days in advance respectively, compared to only 15 days for the simple exponential model. The simple exponential model significantly overpredicted the total number of future cases while the quadratic and simple square models did not.

Using a rabbit adhesiogenesis model, this study assessed the efficacy of adhesiolysis and examined how this relates to the tissue composition of adhesions at the time of lysis. METHODS Polypropylene meshes (5 x 3.5 cm) were implanted on the parietal peritoneum of New Zealand white rabbits. Some animals were killed 3, 7, 14, and 90 days postimplantation to obtain adhesion tissue. Adhesion formation/reformation was monitored by sequential laparoscopy in other animals kept for 90 days and in a separate experimental group subjected to adhesiolysis at 3 days postimplantation. Immune and inflammatory response markers were determined by immunohistochemical, Western blotting, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction procedures in adhesion tissue; areas occupied by adhesions were quantified in meshes. RESULTS In animals undergoing adhesiolysis, mesh areas covered by adhesions were significantly decreased at each follow-up time and affected areas became mesothelialized. Increased transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 expression was detected in adhesions at 3 days. Greatest TGF-beta1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein expressions were observed at 7 days, whereas genetic overexpression was noted at 14 days. Active inflammatory cells peaked at the 7-day time point. CONCLUSION Adhesions formed at 3 days; at this critical time, an adhesiolysis was effective in preventing reformation of future adhesions. TGF-beta1 gene and protein expression were increased in 3-day adhesions with respect to the omentum. Levels of active TGF-beta1 and VEGF were increased at 7 days, along with the inflammatory response at this time point related to tissue remodeling, which led to stabilization of adhesions.","output":"Peritoneal adhesion formation and reformation tracked by sequential laparoscopy: optimizing the time point for adhesiolysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3) inflammasome has recently become an intriguing target of several chronic and viral diseases.

Consensus sequences with an accuracy of 100% were achieved within 10 and 30 min from the start of the sequencing run when using RNA extracted from cell culture supernatants and tongue epithelial suspensions, respectively. In contrast, sequencing from swabs required up to 2.5 h. Together these results demonstrated that the MinION sequencer can be used to accurately and rapidly characterise serotypes A, O, and Asia 1 of FMDV using amplicons amplified from a variety of different sample matrices.","output":"Characterising Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus in Clinical Samples Using Nanopore Sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tanacetum cinerariifolium is an endemic species of the eastern Adriatic coast that synthesizes the natural insecticide pyrethrin.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate impact of perception of science, healthcare systems, and government along with sociodemographic, psychosocial, and cultural characteristics on vaccine acceptance. DESIGN: We conducted a global nested analytical cross-sectional study of how the perceptions of healthcare, government and science systems have impacted COVID-19 on vaccine acceptance. SETTING: Global Facebook, Instagram and Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk) users from 173 countries. PARTICIPANTS: 7411 people aged 18 years or over, and able to read English, Spanish, Italian, or French. MEASUREMENTS: We used (2) analysis and logistic regression-derived adjusted Odds Ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs to evaluate the relationship between effectiveness perceptions and vaccine acceptance controlling for other factors. We used natural language processing and thematic analysis to analyse the role of vaccine-related narratives in open-ended explanations of effectiveness. RESULTS: After controlling for confounding, attitude toward science was a strong predictor of vaccine acceptance, more so than other attitudes, demographic, psychosocial or COVID-19-related variables (aOR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.8 to 2.5). The rationale for science effectiveness was dominated by vaccine narratives, which were uncommon in other domains. LIMITATIONS: This study did not include participants from countries where Facebook and Amazon mTurk are not available, and vaccine acceptance reflected intention rather than actual behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: As our findings show, vaccine-related issues dominate public perception of sciences impact around COVID-19, and this perception of science relates strongly to the decision to obtain vaccination once available.","output":"Science, healthcare system, and government effectiveness perception and COVID-19 vaccination acceptance and hesitancy in a global sample: an analytical cross-sectional analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cannabis extracts and products were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with Cold EI for their full content including terpenes, sesquiterpenes, sesquiterpinols, fatty acids, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), other cannabinoids, hydrocarbons, sterols, diglycerides, triglycerides, and impurities. GC-MS with Cold EI is based on interfacing GC and MS with supersonic molecular beams (SMB) along with electron ionization of vibrationally cold sample compounds in the SMB in a fly-through ion source (hence the name Cold EI). GC-MS with Cold EI improves all the performance aspects of GC-MS, enables the analysis of Cannabinoids with OH groups without derivatization, while providing enhanced molecular ions for improved identification, and enables internal quantitation without calibration. We found over 50 cannabinoid compounds including a new one with a Cold EI mass spectrum very similar to delta 9-THC as well as relatively large cannabinoids with molecular weight above m/z = 400. Because the analysis was universal in full scan and not targeted, we found impurities such as bromo CBD and fluticasone propionate and could monitor the formation of oxidized CBD during decarboxylation. In addition, GC-MS with Cold EI enabled nontargeted full analysis of terpenes, sesquiterpenes, and sesquiterpinols in cannabis extracts with good internal quantitation. GC-MS with Cold EI further served with very good sensitivity for the concentration determination of delta 9-THC in CBD-related products. Finally, cannabis drugs such as EP-1 used in Israel for treatment of epilepsy and for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were analyzed for their full cannabinoids content for learning on the entourage effect and for drug activity optimization.","output":"Cannabis and its cannabinoids analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with Cold EI."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is commonly associated with respiratory symptoms. However, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are increasingly recognized in COVID-19 patients. The aim is to study the prevalence and features of gastrointestinal manifestations in severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients and evaluate the outcome among the studied population. RESULTS: We enrolled adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Ain Shams University designated hospitals, Cairo, Egypt, from March 2021 to June 2021. The patients were assigned to a GI group and a non-GI group based on the presence or absence of one or more digestive symptoms. A total of 300 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included, of which 104 (34.7%) had one or more digestive symptoms. They were compared with 196 COVID-19 patients without GI symptoms. The most common reported GI symptom was diarrhea (82.7%). GI symptoms presence was higher in moderate cases. Patients with digestive symptoms presented for care later than those without (7.93.8 vs 7.47.2 days, P=0.5). Moreover, they have lower mortality, though non-significant (7.7 vs 12.8%, P=0.18). Patients with digestive symptoms had lower total leucocytic count (TLC), neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet count, and higher serum sodium than those without digestive symptoms.

These workers are at an increased risk for exposure to infectious disease during a pandemic event, and are more likely to experience events of job displacement and disruption during all types of public health emergencies. Here, I characterized which occupational sectors in the United States are most able to work from home during a public health emergency such as COVID-19. Methods: 2018 national employment and wage data maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with measures from the BLS O*NET survey data. The measures utilized rank the importance of using a computer at work, and the importance of working with or performing for the public, which relate to the ability to complete work at home. Results: About 25% (35.6 M) of the U.S. workforce are employed in occupations which could be done from home, primarily in sectors such as technology, computer, management, administrative, financial, and engineering. The remaining 75% of U.S. workers (including healthcare, manufacturing, retail and food services, et al.) are employed in occupations where working from home would be difficult. Conclusions: The majority of U.S. workers are employed in occupations that cannot be done at home, putting 108.4 M U.S. workers at increased risk for adverse health outcomes related to working during a public health emergency. These workers tend to be lower paid than workers who can work from home.

Yet, information on mental health and psychosocial problems among health care workers and the general population have not been comprehensively reported in Thailand. As such, we conduct a cross-sectional study, a national online survey to describe the short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and psychosocial problems among health care workers and the general population in Thailand. METHODS: This study is a repeated cross-sectional study, an open online voluntary national-based survey during the wave I (April 21-May 4, 2020) follow-up in the wave II (August 3-16, 2020), wave III (November 15-28, 2020), and a 1-year follow-up survey (wave IV: April 21-May 4, 2021) in Thailand. Health care workers at the hospitals and the adult general population will be invited to participate in the online survey via the SurveyMonkey that limits one-time participation per unique internet protocol address. The target sample size of at least 1182 health care workers and 1310 general populations will be required to complete the online survey for each wave of the survey. Sociodemographic characteristics and a set of measurement tools for mental and psychosocial problems for each subcohort including depression, anxiety, stress, resilient copings, neuroticism, perceived social support, wellbeing, somatic symptoms, insomnia, burnout (for healthcare workers), and public stigma toward COVID-19 infection (for the general population) will be collected. For all estimates of prevalence, we will weigh data for all wave analyses under the complex design of the survey. Subgroup analyses stratified by key characteristics will also be done to analyze the proportion differences. For the repeated cross-sectional survey, we will combine the data from the wave I to wave IV survey to analyze changes in the mental health status. We will perform multilevel logistic regression models with random intercepts to explore associations with individual-level and region-level/hospital-level predictors. We also plan to perform an ancillary systematic review and meta-analysis by incorporating data from our findings to all available evidence.

Operational guidelines were developed, based on WHO guidance, to support countries to mitigate the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission within communities and among community distributors when delivering SMC. METHODS: A cross-sectional study to determine adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) measures during two distribution cycles of SMC in Nigeria, Chad and Burkina Faso. Community distributors were observed receiving equipment and delivering SMC. Adherence across six domains was calculated as the proportion of indications in which the community distributor performed the correct action. Focus group discussions were conducted with community distributors to understand their perceptions of the IPC measures and barriers and facilitators to adherence. RESULTS: Data collectors observed community distributors in Nigeria (n = 259), Burkina Faso (n = 252) and Chad (n = 266) receiving IPC equipment and delivering SMC. Adherence to IPC indications varied. In all three countries, adherence to mask use was the highest (ranging from 73.3% in Nigeria to 86.9% in Burkina Faso). Adherence to hand hygiene for at least 30 s was low (ranging from 3.6% in Nigeria to 10.3% in Burkina Faso) but increased substantially when excluding the length of time spent hand washing (ranging from 36.7% in Nigeria to 61.4% in Burkina Faso). Adherence to safe distancing in the compound ranged from 5.4% in Chad to 16.4% in Nigeria. In Burkina Faso and Chad, where disinfection wipes widely available compliance with disinfection of blister packs for SMC was low (17.4% in Burkina Faso and 16.9% in Chad). Community distributors generally found the IPC measures acceptable, however there were barriers to optimal hand hygiene practices, cultural norms made social distancing difficult to adhere to and caregivers needed assistance to administer the first dose of SMC. CONCLUSION: Adherence to IPC measures for SMC delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic varied across domains of IPC, but was largely insufficient, particularly for hand hygiene and safe distancing. Improvements in provision of protective equipment, early community engagement and adaptations to make IPC measures more feasible to implement could increase adherence.

As the pandemic has progressed, the understanding of this disease has evolved. Its impact on the health and welfare of the human population is significant; its impact on the delivery of healthcare is also considerable. OBJECTIVE: This article is another paper in a series addressing COVID-19-related updates to emergency clinicians on the management of COVID-19 patients with cardiac arrest. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. From a global perspective, as of February 23, 2022, 435 million infections have been noted with 5.9 million deaths (1.4%). Current data suggest an increase in the occurrence of cardiac arrest, both in the outpatient and inpatient settings, with corresponding reductions in most survival metrics. The frequency of out-of-hospital lay provider initial care has decreased while non-shockable initial cardiac arrest rhythms have increased. While many interventions, including chest compressions, are aerosol-generating procedures, the risk of contagion to healthcare personnel is low, assuming appropriate personal protective equipment is used; vaccination with boosting provides further protection against contagion for the healthcare personnel involved in cardiac arrest resuscitation. The burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of cardiac arrest care is considerable and, despite multiple efforts, has adversely impacted the chain of survival.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the general medical complications have received the most attention, whereas only a few studies address the potential direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mental health. METHODS: A total of 321 maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients were selected using random sampling from the hemodialysis center of the second people's Hospital of Yibin. They completed Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) for anxiety, Zung's self-rating depression scale (SDS) for depression, and the activity of daily living scale (ADL) for the ability of living. Demographic data and laboratory tests were used to analyze the risk factors. RESULTS: The proportions of the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms were between 34.89% and 30.02%, respectively, among the MHD patients. The SAS and SDS scores of the 321 patients were 45.42( 10.99) and 45.23( 11.59), respectively. The results show that monthly income, medical insurance, vascular access, the duration of dialysis, complication, hemoglobin (HGB), immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and blood phosphorus (P) are factors that influence anxiety among patients (p < 0.05 for all). Vascular access, monthly income, medical insurance, complication, CRP, Alb, are factors that influence depression among patients (p < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that during the pandemic period, the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among MHD patients increased. Some demographic and clinical variables were associated with it. We should, therefore, pay more attention to the patients' psychology, start targeted intervention to alleviate the patients' anxiety and further improve their quality of life.","output":"Analysis of the prevalence and influencing factors of depression and anxiety among maintenance dialysis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of acute viral respiratory tract infections (RTI) is a challenge due to overlapping clinical presentations and lack of availability of robust diagnostic methods. This in turn leads to lack of data regarding incidence and seasonality of viral RTIs which could potentially help to implement efficient strategies of antimicrobial stewardship as well as vaccine administration. Here we utilise a commercial Multiplex PCR assay for the early diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections and discuss their epidemiology. METHODS: A prospective, observational study was conducted over a period of 3 years (2017-2019). Respiratory samples received from outpatients and inpatients with suspected acute RTIs from three multispeciality hospitals located in the twin cities of Hyderabad-Secunderabad were subjected to FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA). Results were tabulated and statistically analysed. RESULTS: Of 513 samples, 261 (50.9%) were positive for one or more pathogens. The viruses detected included influenza A H1 2009 (26.0%), human rhinovirus/enterovirus (21.5%), influenza A H3N2 (17.0%), human metapneumovirus (9.4%), influenza B (6.6%), coronavirus (4.9%), parainfluenza virus (4.5%), respiratory syncytial virus (3.1%) and adenovirus (2.1%). The largest number of samples was positive during the monsoon season (43.8%). Influenza A H1 2009 peaked in the monsoon season with another, smaller peak in February. CONCLUSIONS: There is a bimodal peak of respiratory infections relative to the seasons, and vaccine administration should take place in April-May before the advent of the monsoons in this part of the country. Multiplexed PCR may be used as first line for diagnosis of viral infections so that infection control measures can be prioritised and antibiotic administration can be avoided in those who do not require it.","output":"Seasonal incidence of respiratory viral infections in Telangana, India: utility of a multiplex PCR assay to bridge the knowledge gap"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The aim of this qualitative systematic review is to identify and synthesize qualitative studies of frontline nurses experiences and challenges when caring for patients with COVID\\\\19 in hospitals. BACKGROUND: This review is the first qualitative systematic review of nurses experiences since the beginning of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in 2020. Understanding nurses experiences with COVID\\\\19 is important because nurses are among the most vital of healthcare workers. METHODS: This study used a qualitative systematic review methodology with thematic synthesis to analyse the included studies. Five databases (CINAHL, PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) were searched from January to mid\\\\August 2020, and 25 abstracts were screened. Based on inclusion criteria, this qualitative systematic review included nine studies. RESULTS: Five themes were identified as barriers to COVID\\\\19 care by 133 hospital\\\\based nurses: limited information about COVID\\\\19, unpredictable tasks and challenging practices, insufficient support, concerns about family, and emotional and psychological stress. CONCLUSIONS: The five barriers identified in this review should be overcome to improve nurses experiences and, in turn, the quality of care patients with COVID\\\\19 receive. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: The findings from this review can be used to reform current healthcare and hospital\\\\support systems for populations with COVID\\\\19. They can also be used to point towards areas of research interested in improving frontline nursing.

To better meet immunization programmes' a pressing need to understand what works, particularly in low-resource settings, the World Health Organization commissioned a scoping view. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of interventions designed to increase vaccination uptake, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses of interventional studies. We searched the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, Epistemonikos, Google Scholar, LILACs and TRIP database until 01 July 2021 and hand-searched the reference lists of included articles. We included systematic reviews if they summarized studies with quantitative data on the impact on vaccine uptake for any age group. To assess review quality, we used a modified AMSTAR score. To evaluate the quality of the evidence in included reviews, we used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Results: The final analysis set included 107 full-text reviews. Publication of reviews increased markedly over time, from seven reviews in 2010 to 38 reviews filtered in 2021. We conducted quality assessments for 72 reviews (132 outcomes). Based on the AMSTAR criteria, 40 included reviews (56%) received a quality rating of good, while the remaining 32 (44%) were of moderate quality. Only 13 reviews summarized data primarily for low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The interventions were commonly multi-component, educational or reminder interventions; the description of intervention components was suboptimal and heterogeneous across most reviews. Effect estimates were available for 73 outcomes; in 52 (71%) of these, interventions led to statistically significant higher vaccine uptake compared with controls. Conclusions: The literature has a large number of relevant systematic reviews on interventions to increase vaccine uptake, with an increased publication rate over time.

METHODS: A comprehensive search of the registered COVID-19 trials has been performed on platforms including ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), Chinese Clinical Trials Registry (CHiCTR), Australian Clinical Trials Registry, Britain's National Research Register (BNRR), Current Control Trials (CCT), and Glaxo Smith Kline Register. Trials registered at the first 8 weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak are included, without language restrictions. For each study, the registration information, study design, and administrator information are collected and summarized. RESULTS: A total of 220 registered trials were evaluated as of February 27, 2020. Hospital-initiated trials were the majority and account for 80% of the sample. Among the trials, pilot studies and phase 4 trials are more common and represent 35% and 19.1% of the sample, respectively. The median sample size of the registered trials is 100, with interquartile range 60-240. Further, 45.9% of the trials mentioned information on a data monitoring committee. 54.5% of the trials did not specify the disease severity among patients they intend to recruit. Four types of interventions are most common in the experimental groups across the registered studies: antiviral drugs, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), biological agents, and hormone drugs. Among them, the TCM and biological agents are frequently used in pilot study and correspond to a variety of primary endpoints. In contrast, trials with antiviral drugs have more targeted primary outcomes such as \\"COVID-19 nucleic acid test\\" and \\"28-day mortality.\\" CONCLUSIONS: We provide an evidence mapping and analysis of registered COVID-19 clinical trials in China. In particular, it is critical for ongoing and future studies to refine their research hypothesis and better identify their intervention therapies and the corresponding primary outcomes. It is also imperative for multiple public health divisions and research institutions to work together for integrative clinical data capture and sharing, with a common objective of improving future studies that evaluate COVID-19 interventions.","output":"An evidence mapping and analysis of registered COVID-19 clinical trials in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To ensure the safety of wastewater reuse for irrigation of food crops and drinking water pathogenic viruses must be reduced to levels that pose no significant risk. To achieve this goal minimum reduction of viruses by treatment trains have been suggested. For use of edible crops a 6-log reduction and for production of potable drinking water a 12-log reduction has been suggested. These reductions were based on assuming infective virus concentrations of 10(5) to 10(6) per liter. Recent application of molecular methods suggests that some pathogenic viruses may be occurring in concentrations of 10(7) to 10(9) per liter. Factors influencing these levels include the development of molecular methods for virus detection, emergence of newly recognized viruses, decrease in per capita water use due to conservation measures, and outbreaks. Since neither cell culture nor molecular methods can assess all the potentially infectious virus in wastewater conservative estimates should be used to assess the virus load in untreated wastewater. This review indicates that an additional 2- to 3-log reduction of viruses above current recommendations may be needed to ensure the safety of recycled water. Information is needed on peak loading of viruses. In addition, more virus groups need to be quantified using better methods of virus quantification, including more accurate methods for measuring viral infectivity in order to better quantify risks from viruses in recycled water.","output":"How much reduction of virus is needed for recycled water: A continuous changing need for assessment?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Bipolar Disorder (BD) is one of the most common mental disorders associated with depressive symptoms and impairment in executive functions such as response inhibition. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of medication therapy combined with Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on depression and response inhibition of patients with BD. METHOD: This is a double-blinded randomized clinical trial with pretest, posttest, and follow-up design. Participants were 30 patients with BD randomly assigned to two groups of Medication+tDCS (n = 15, receiving medications plus tDCS with 2 mA intensity over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 10 days, two sessions per day each for 20 min) and Medication (n = 15, receiving mood stabilizers including 2C5 tables of 300 mg (mg) lithium, 200 mg sodium valproate, and 200 mg carbamazepine two times per day). Pretest, posttest and 3-month follow-up assessments were the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and a Go/No-Go test. Collected data were analyzed in SPSS v.20 software. RESULTS: The mean HDRS score in both groups was reduced after both interventional techniques, where the group received combined therapy showed more reduction (P < 0.01), although their effects were not maintained after 3 months. In examining response inhibition variable, only the combined therapy could reduce the commission error of patients under a go/no-go task (p < 0.05), but its effect was not maintained after 3 months. There was no significant difference in the group received medication therapy alone. CONCLUSION: Medication in combination with tDCS can reduce the depressive symptoms and improve the response inhibition ability of people with BD.

Fifty-five captive small Indian civets (Viverricula indica), farmed for perfume production in Eastern Thailand, showed clinical signs of acute bloody diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, circling, and seizures. The disease spread within the farm and resulted in the death of 38 of the 55 civets (69% mortality) within a month. Fecal swabs were collected from the 17 surviving civets, and necropsy was performed on 7 of the dead civets. Pathologic findings were severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis with generalized lymphadenopathy. CPPV-1 was identified in both fecal swabs and postmortem samples by species-specific polymerase chain reaction. Further whole-gene sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis suggested feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) as the causative agent. The viral tropism and tissue distribution were confirmed by immunohistochemistry, with immunolabeling in the cytoplasm and nucleus of small intestinal crypt epithelial cells, villous enterocytes, histiocytes in lymphoid tissues, myenteric nerve plexuses, and cerebral and cerebellar neurons. Phylogenetic analysis of civet-derived CPPV-1 indicated a genetic similarity close to the FPV HH-1/86 strain detected in a jaguar (Panthera onca) in China. To our knowledge, this mass die-off of civets is the first evidence of disease associated with CPPV-1 infection in the subfamily Viverrinae.

Both ACR3s mediated AsIII efflux in yeast, decreasing its As accumulation and enhancing its As tolerance. In addition, PvACR3;2 and PvACR3;3 were expressed in tobacco plant.

Presenting qualitative research with 51 women in a rural region of the U.S., thematic findings reveal an interpretation of barriers to rural health care as moral failings rather than as purely spatial or operational challenges, along with wide communication of negative health care experiences owing to spatially-disparate but trusted social networks.

Using a mouse model closely recapitulating key alterations of chronic human MTLE with hippocampal sclerosis, here we asked whether death of astrocytes contributes to the initiation of the disease and investigated potential underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS Antibody staining was combined with confocal imaging and semiquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis to identify markers of different cellular death mechanisms between 4 h and 3 days after epilepsy induction. RESULTS Four hours after kainate-mediated induction of status epilepticus (SE), we found a significant reduction in the density of astrocytes in the CA1 stratum radiatum (SR) of the ipsilateral hippocampus. This reduction was transient, as within the next 3 days, astrocyte cell numbers recovered to the initial values, which was accompanied by enhanced proliferation. Four hours after SE induction, a small proportion of astrocytes in the ipsilateral CA1 SR expressed autophagy-related genes and proteins, whereas we did not find astrocytes positive for cleaved caspase 3 or terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling, ruling out apoptosis-related astrocytic death. Importantly, at the same early time point post-SE, many astrocytes in the ipsilateral CA1 SR showed strong expression of genes encoding pro-necroptosis factors, including receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). Phosphorylation of MLKL (pMLKL), formation of necrosome complexes composed of RIPK3 and pMLKL, and translocation of pMLKL to the nucleus and to the plasma membrane were often observed in astrocytes of the ipsilateral hippocampus 4 h post-SE. SIGNIFICANCE The present study revealed that astrocytes die shortly after induction of SE. Our expression data and immunohistochemistry suggest that necroptosis and autophagy contribute to astrocytic death.

A prospective, non-interventional follow-up of discharged patients who had SARS-CoV-2 infections by the Delta variant in Guangdong, China, from May 2021 to June 2021 was conducted. The subjects were asked to complete a physical health examination and undergo nucleic acid testing and antibody detection for the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19. In total, 20.33% (25/123) of patients exhibited recurrent positive results after discharge. All patients with infection recurrence were asymptomatic and showed no abnormalities in the pulmonary computed tomography. The time from discharge to the recurrent positive testing was usually between 1-33 days, with a mean time of 9.36 days. The cycle threshold from the real-time polymerase chain reaction assay that detected the recurrence of positivity ranged from 27.48 to 39.00, with an average of 35.30. The proportion of vaccination in the non-recurrent group was higher than that in the recurrently positive group (26% vs. 4%; (2) = 7.902; P < 0.05).

To identify predictors of jaundice resolution after ERCP and whether resolution is associated with improved patient outcomes, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of 124 patients with jaundice and PSC. These patients underwent endoscopic biliary balloon dilation and/or stent placement at an American tertiary center, with validation in a separate cohort of 102 patients from European centers. Jaundice resolved after ERCP in 52% of patients. Median follow-up was 4.8 years. Independent predictors of jaundice resolution included older age (P = 0.048; odds ratio [OR], 1.03 for every 1-year increase), shorter duration of jaundice (P = 0.059; OR, 0.59 for every 1-year increase), lower Mayo Risk Score (MRS) (P = 0.025; OR, 0.58 for every 1-point increase), and extrahepatic location of the most advanced biliary stricture (P = 0.011; OR, 3.13). A logistic regression model predicted jaundice resolution with area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.67 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-0.79) in the validation set. Independent predictors of death or transplant during follow-up included higher MRS at the time of ERCP (P < 0.0001; hazard ratio [HR], 2.33 for every 1-point increase), lower total serum bilirubin before ERCP (P = 0.031; HR, 0.91 for every 1 mg/dL increase), and persistence of jaundice after endoscopic therapy (P = 0.003; HR, 2.30). Conclusion: Resolution of jaundice after endoscopic treatment of biliary strictures is associated with longer transplant-free survival of patients with PSC. The likelihood of resolution is affected by demographic, hepatic, and biliary variables and can be predicted using noninvasive data.

METHODS: Thirty-five subjects with previous COVID-19 and 30 healthy control participants were enrolled in this cross-sectional comparative study. An infrared dynamic pupillometry system (MonPack One; Metrovision, France) was used to quantify pupillary light responses. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) long-COVID questionnaire was used to identify persisting symptoms at least 4 weeks after acute COVID-19. RESULTS: The median time after the diagnosis of acute COVID-19 was 4.0 (2.0C5.0) months. There was an increase in the latency of pupil contraction (P = 0.001) and a reduction in the duration of pupil contraction (P = 0.039) in post-COVID-19 subjects compared to healthy controls. No significant differences were observed in the initial pupil diameter, amplitude and velocity of pupil contraction or latency, velocity and duration of pupil dilation. Long-COVID was present in 25/35 (71%) subjects and their duration of pupil contraction was reduced compared to subjects without long-COVID (P = 0.009). The NICE long-COVID questionnaire total score ( = ? 0.507; P = 0.002) and neurological score ( = ? 0.412; P = 0.014) correlated with the duration of pupil contraction and the total score correlated with the latency of dilation ( = ? 0.352; P = 0.038).

This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with diabetes, admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the southern region of Bangladesh. METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, treatments, complications, and clinical outcomes data were extracted from electronic medical records of 168 COVID-19 patients admitted into ICU of two COVID-19 dedicated hospitals of Chattogram, Bangladesh and compared between diabetes (n = 88) and non-diabetes (n = 80) groups. RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes was high among 51-70 years old patients. All the diabetic patients had at least one other comorbidity, with a significantly higher incidence of hypertension (53.4% vs 27.5%, P < 0.05). Prevalence of male patients (74/88; 84.1%) was slightly higher among diabetic patients than the non-diabetic patients (60/80; 75%). Even though not significant, Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that COVID-19 patients with diabetes had a shorter overall survival time than those without diabetes. In subgroup analysis, diabetic patients were classified into insulin-requiring and non-insulin-requiring groups based on their requirement of insulin during the stay in ICU. COVID-19 infected diabetic patients requiring insulin have high risk of disease progression and shorter survival time than the non-insulin required group. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes is an independent risk factor for the poor prognosis of COVID-19. More attention should be paid to the prevention and prompt treatment of diabetic patients, to maintain good glycaemic control especially those who require insulin therapy.","output":"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 infected diabetic patients admitted in ICUs of the southern region of Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health risks associated with long periods of time in flight are of concern to astronauts, crew members, and passengers.

However, providers do not always follow CPW, and our understanding of their perceptions is limited. Our objective was to examine pediatric hospital medicine (PHM) and pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) physician perspectives of CPW. METHODS: We conducted semistructured, in-depth, one-on-one qualitative interviews with PHM and PEM physicians between February 2017 and August 2017. Interviews were audio-recorded, professionally transcribed, and accuracy verified. Using an inductive analytic strategy, we systematically coded the data to identify themes. RESULTS: We interviewed 15 PHM and 15 PEM physicians. These providers identified many benefits and limitations of CPW, which positively or negatively impact resource utilization, communication, education of personnel, patients, and families, as well as practice behaviors and attitudes. Perceived benefits included (1) reduction of unnecessary utilization, (2) standardization of care, (3) improved communication, (4) education of oneself and others, and (5) confidence and validation when actions align with CPW. Limitations of CPW were (1) resource utilization for revisions, updates, and dissemination; (2) tunnel vision and cognitive biases; (3) loss of autonomy; (4) prescriptive medicine; (5) information overload; (6) pressure to adhere; and (7) guilt if actions do not align with CPW. CONCLUSIONS: CPW are tools with advantages and disadvantages that are used and viewed differently by providers.

In the study, the case study model was used in which 30 lecturers with expertise in mathematics from 20 different universities in Turkey participated. In the study, the opinion form was used as a data collection tool. Descriptive analysis and content analysis methods were used in analyzing the data. It was found that before the pandemic, the use of technology in mathematics education by the lecturers was quite rare and at a basic level. In the pandemic process, it was observed that lecturers conducted their teaching synchronously or asynchronously with the traditional teaching approach, as before the pandemic, with distance education as the teacher-centered approach. It was understood that the main problems encountered during distance education were the difficulties encountered in teacher-student interaction and the inability to carry out assessment and evaluation activities in a healthy manner. It has been observed that the problems encountered especially in assessment and evaluation make it difficult to understand the actual impact of teaching mathematics during the pandemic on student learning. In fact, it was found that at the beginning of the pandemic, universities gave various instructions to their lecturers various trainings on distance education. However, these instructions were usually technical in scope and insufficient to overcome the difficulties encountered in the process, so that mathematics instruction was carried out with an understanding of 'emergency distance education\\" rather than formal distance education. On the other hand, the experience of distance education gained during the pandemic process had a positive influence on the views of a significant proportion of the lecturers on the integration of technology in mathematics education.","output":"Instruction of Mathematics in Higher Education in the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Case of Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most deep neural networks (DNNs) based ultrasound (US) medical image analysis models use pretrained backbones (e.g., ImageNet) for better model generalization. However, the domain gap between natural and medical images causes an inevitable performance bottleneck. To alleviate this problem, an US dataset named US-4 is constructed for direct pretraining on the same domain. It contains over 23,000 images from four US video sub-datasets. To learn robust features from US-4, we propose an US semi-supervised contrastive learning method, named USCL, for pretraining. In order to avoid high similarities between negative pairs as well as mine abundant visual features from limited US videos, USCL adopts a sample pair generation method to enrich the feature involved in a single step of contrastive optimization. Extensive experiments on several downstream tasks show the superiority of USCL pretraining against ImageNet pretraining and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) pretraining approaches. In particular, USCL pretrained backbone achieves fine-tuning accuracy of over 94% on POCUS dataset, which is 10% higher than 84% of the ImageNet pretrained model.

While the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) relationship of chloroquine is well established for malaria, there is sparse information regarding its dose-effect relationship in the context of COVID-19. Here, we explore the PK-PD relationship of chloroquine for COVID-19 by modelling both achievable systemic and pulmonary drug concentrations. Our data indicate that the standard anti-malarial treatment dose of 25mg/kg over three days does not deliver sufficient systemic drug exposures for the inhibition of viral replication. In contrast, PK predictions of chloroquine in the lungs using in-vivo data or human physiologically-based PK models, suggest that doses as low as 3mg/kg/day for 3 days could deliver exposures that are significantly higher than reported antiviral-EC90s for up to a week. Moreover, if pulmonary exposure is a driver for prevention, simulations show that chronic daily dosing of chloroquine may be unnecessary for prophylaxis purposes. Instead, once weekly doses of 5mg/kg would be sufficient to achieve a continuous cover of therapeutically active pulmonary exposures. These findings reveal a highly compartmentalised distribution of chloroquine in man that may significantly affect its therapeutic potential against COVID-19. The systemic circulation is shown as one site where chloroquine exposure is insufficient to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, if therapeutic activity is driven by pulmonary exposure, it should be possible to reduce the chloroquine dose to safe levels. Carefully designed randomized controlled trials are urgently required to address these outstanding issues.","output":"Modelling of Systemic versus Pulmonary Chloroquine Exposure in Man for COVID-19 Dose Selection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sleep is a fundamental behavior in an animal's life influenced by many internal and external factors, such as aging and diet.

Given that diet can influence many aspects of sleep, we investigated whether a high-sucrose diet (HSD) affected aging-induced sleep fragmentation using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila is a valuable model for studying sleep due to its genetic tractability and many similarities with mammalian sleep. Total sleep duration, sleep bout numbers (SBN), and average sleep bout length (ABL) were compared between young and old flies on a normal sucrose diet (NSD) or HSD. On the NSD, old flies slept slightly more and showed increased SBN and reduced ABL, indicating increased sleep fragmentation. Short-term maintenance of flies in HSD (up to 8 days), but not long-term maintenance (up to 35 days), suppressed aging-induced sleep fragmentation.

The indispensable role of the main protease (M(pro)) in viral replication and gene expression makes this enzyme an attractive drug target. Therefore, inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) as a proposition to halt virus ingression is being pursued by scientists globally. Here we carried out a study with two objectives: the first being to perform comparative protein sequence and 3D structural analysis to understand the effect of 12 point mutations on the active site. Among these, two mutations, viz., Ser46 and Phe134, were found to cause a significant change at the active sites of SARS-CoV-2. The Ser46 mutation present at the entrance of the S5 subpocket of SARS-CoV-2 increases the contribution of other two hydrophilic residues, while the Phe134 mutation, present in the catalytic cysteine loop, can cause an increase in catalytic efficiency of M(pro) by facilitating fast proton transfer from the Cys145 to His41 residue. It was observed that active site remained conserved among M(pro) of both SARS-CoVs, except at the entrance of the S5 subpocket, suggesting sustenance of substrate specificity. The second objective was to screen the inhibitory effects of three different data sets (natural products, coronaviruses main protease inhibitors, and FDA-approved drugs) using a structure-based virtual screening approach. A total of 73 hits had a combo score >2.0. Eight different structural scaffold classes were identified, such as one/two tetrahydropyran ring(s), dipeptide/tripeptide/oligopeptide, large (approximately 20 atoms) cyclic peptide, and miscellaneous. The screened hits showed key interactions with subpockets of the active site. Further, molecular dynamics studies of selected screened compounds confirmed their perfect fitting into the subpockets of the active site. This study suggests promising structures that can fit into the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) active site and also offers direction for further lead optimization and rational drug design.","output":"Structure-Based Virtual Screening to Discover Potential Lead Molecules for the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We studied SARS-CoV-2 genomes from travelers arriving in Hong Kong from November-2021 to February-2022.

Such diseases spread among people through contact with contaminated surfaces, bodily fluids, or blood products, or through the air, insect bites, or consuming contaminated food and beverages. Although some communicable diseases can be treated or prevented by taking medication and vaccines, there has been an increase in awareness of adopting a healthy diet to aid in the prevention and reversal of these diseases. One popular diet is a plant-based diet. Plant-based diets generally consist of vegetables, grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, and fruits, without any animal-source foods or artificial ingredients. Over the years, this diet has continuously increased in popularity. Reasons for following a plant-based diet are varied but include health benefits, such as improving immunity, and reducing the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. Scientific evidence even shows that just an increased vegetable intake can decrease the occurrence of chronic diseases caused by viruses, such as hepatitis viruses, and reduce the risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019.

The development of the Pandemic Paranoia Scale (PPS) has provided a reliable assessment of various facets of pandemic paranoia. This study aimed to (i) identify classes of individuals with varying levels of general paranoia and pandemic paranoia, and (ii) examine associations between classification and worry, core beliefs, and pro-health behaviours. METHODS: An international sample of adults (N = 2510) across five sites completed the Revised-Green Paranoid Thoughts Scale and the PPS. Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted using these two paranoia variables. Classes were compared on trait worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire), beliefs about self/others (Brief Core Schema Scales), and pro-health behaviour. RESULTS: Three latent classes emerged: Class 1 with low R-GPTS and PPS scores, Class 2 with a high R-GPTS score and a moderate PPS score, and Class 3 with high R-GPTS and PPS scores. Compared to Class 1, Classes 2-3 were associated with more worry and negative self- and other-beliefs. Class 3 was further characterised by greater positive-self beliefs and less engagement in pro-health behaviours. Engagement in pro-health behaviours was positively correlated with interpersonal mistrust and negatively correlated with paranoid conspiracy and persecutory threat. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with a general paranoia tendency were more likely to respond to the global health threats in a suspicious and distrusting way. Our findings suggested that worry and negative self/other beliefs may contribute to not just general paranoia but also pandemic paranoia.

This new incidence function that captures the reduction in disease transmission due to human behaviour innovatively considers the efficacy and the speed of behaviour change. The model's steady states are determined and suitable Lyapunov functions are built. The proofs of the global stability of equilibrium points are presented. To demonstrate the utility of the model, we fit the model to Ebola virus disease data from Liberia and Sierra Leone. The results which are comparable to existing findings from the outbreak of 2014 ? 2016 show a better fit when the efficacy and the speed of behaviour change are higher.

Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was conducted with BLS/AED performance as outcome variable and demographic data as explanatory variables. RESULTS Mean BLS/AED performance for all lifeguards was 66.5%. Compression rate and depth adhered closely to ERC 2010 guidelines. Ventilation volume and flow rate exceeded the guidelines. A significant regression model, F(6, 415)=25.61, p<.001, ES=.38, explained 27% of the variance in BLS performance (R2=.27).

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings not only highlight the potential of cross-therapeutic application of these GSIs for obesity treatment via inhibition of ?3-secretase-mediated processing of Notch signaling, but also provide important experimental evidence to support further design and development of clinically translatable Notch-inhibiting drug delivery systems.","output":"In Vitro Evaluation of Clinical Candidates of ?3-Secretase Inhibitors: Effects on Notch Inhibition and Promoting Beige Adipogenesis and Mitochondrial Biogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Obesogenic built- and social-environments in low-income and minority communities are often blamed for the higher rates of obesity in this population, but existing evidence is based largely on observational studies. This study leverages a natural experiment created by the redevelopment of a public housing community to examine the impact of major improvements to the housing, built, and social environments on obesity among residents. METHODS/DESIGN: The study design is a natural experiment where residents from the redeveloped community (treatment group) will be compared to those from a similar community (control group) in terms of their pre/post changes in primary outcomes using annual longitudinal data on a cohort of residents. Quasi-experimental variation in the timing of exposure to various redevelopment components within the treated community will be further leveraged within a stepped-wedge research design to assess the impact of the redevelopment components. Primary outcome measures include body mass index, overweight, and obese status. RESULTS: A cohort of 868 adults and 704 children (ages 2C17 years) was recruited during 2018C2019 with up to two waves of baseline data. At baseline, the prevalence of obesity (overweight or obesity) was 57.2% (81.3%) in adults and 33.1% (52.4%) among children, with no significant differences by treatment status. No differential trends in primary outcomes were observed by treatment status during the two years of baseline. DISCUSSION: This natural experiment study offers a unique opportunity to assess whether improvements to housing, built, and social environment in low-income minority communities can lead to reductions in obesity.","output":"Assessing impacts of redeveloping public housing communities on obesity in low-income minority residents: Rationale, study design, and baseline data from the Watts Neighborhood Health Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, the use and demand of bicycles have increased thanks to the growing attention to the environment and due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation. At the same time, the design of the bicycles has remained substantially unchanged, improving in materials and components technology. In the off-road sector, two diametrically opposed categories have emerged in terms of comfort and pedalling efficiency. The goal of this research is to introduce a first methodological approach for the optimization of a mountain bike frame. The behaviour of the developed frame aims to combine the pedalling benefits now available only in different and non-comparable bicycle configurations. The first step concerns the modelling of a generic off-road bicycle frame, then its behaviour has been simulated for specific load cases. Subsequently, the part of the bicycle that best performed the double function of compliance and rigidity has been sought through an analysis of the strain energy using FE simulations. Hence, the reference region has been topologically optimized to provide adequate chassis travel performance. The analysis scheme has been iteratively repeated also on other parts of the frame until an acceptable solution is obtained for the utilize presented. The final configuration permits a rear tube and bottom bracket displacement of 10.4 mm and 2.4 mm compared to the 0.5 mm and 0.4 mm of the original frame respectively. The approach described can be proposed as a support for the search for an innovative design for products with unchanged geometries due to the inertia of the designers. At the same time, this methodology aims to expand the possible use of topological optimization, moving away from the classic constraint schemes present in various software. ? 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

The detection of advanced fibrosis (METAVIR F3) is important to identify patients who are in urgent need of antiviral treatments versus those whose treatment could be deferred (F2). The aim was to assess the diagnostic value of PTX3 as a potential biomarker for clinically significant and advanced fibrosis. PTX3 associations with biochemical and histological parameters of inflammatory activity and fibrosis were investigated in 138 patients with chronic viral hepatitis C (HCV) before antiviral treatment. METAVIR histological scores of activity and fibrosis were obtained. PTX3 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The diagnostic accuracy of serum PTX3 levels was compared to that of other fibrosis markers, including transforming growth factor\\\\(1) (TGF-(1)), hyaluronic acid (HA), aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index (APRI), fibrosis score based on four factors (FIB4), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase to platelet ratio (GPR), and the liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography (FibroScan?). In HCV patients the PTX3 level increased in parallel with the METAVIR histological score of activity, being independently associated with the METAVIR fibrosis score (P < 0.001). Using the receiver operating characteristics analysis, the best marker for detecting F2 and F3 was PTX3 with AUC = 0.802 and AUC = 0.867, respectively. The area under the curve of PTX3 for predicting significant fibrosis (F2) was significantly greater than those for the GPR ratio (AUC = 0.648) and FIB-4 score (AUC = 0.770) and similar to that for APRI index (AUC = 0.831).

Therefore, it is imperative to have evidence with high methodological quality to guide clinical decision making. Objectives To evaluate the methodological quality of the systematic reviews (SRs) focused on breast augmentation. Methods A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews was performed. SRs that have a particular focus on breast augmentation and were published in the top 15 plastic and reconstructive surgery journals were included. Quality assessment was performed using a measurement tool to assess systematic reviews (AMSTAR). Study characteristics were extracted including journal and impact factor, year of publication, country affiliation of the corresponding author, reporting adherence to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, number of citations, and number of studies included. Results Among the 22 studies included for analysis, the mean AMSTAR score was moderate (5.55), with no SR achieving good quality (AMSTAR score of 9). There were no significant associations between AMSTAR score and journal impact factor, number of citations, year of publication, or number of included studies. Studies that reported adherence to PRISMA guidelines on average scored higher on the AMSTAR tool (P = 0.03).

The application of supply chain finance (SCF) solutions to MSMEs can enhance the performance and growth of the sector. But, the implementation of SCF solutions faces various obstacles which restrict the MSMEs' ability to meet their financial requirements. The purpose of this paper is to explore and prioritize the various important barriers hindering SCF application in Indian MSMEs. Design/methodology/approach: Literature on SCF and MSMEs are critically reviewed and barriers affecting the SCF application in Indian MSMEs are scrutinized with the consultation of the experts. The present study applies intuitionistic fuzzy-analytic hierarchy process (IF-AHP) methodology to prioritize the identified barriers and thereafter, the sensitivity analysis is also done to observe the identified barriers under different situations. Findings: The results of the study have revealed that poor cash flow management and working capital management disruption are acting as the most prioritized barriers of SCF. The external factor of cultural challenges has been prioritized as the minimum-influence factor that has least negative influence on the operations of SCF in MSMEs. Practical implications: The present study bears an important practical and managerial implication to solve real world problems of financial constraints of MSMEs. The managers should emphasize upon the importance smooth flow of cash and working capital management across the supply chains by which better SCF solution can be implemented in MSMEs. Originality/value: The study conducted is an effort to address the barriers of SCF in Indian MSMEs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between HbA1c variability, as a measure of long-term glycemic variability, and the risk of all-cause mortality in diabetic patients with PD. METHODS: 325 patients with diabetes and ESRD were followed (2008-2018) in the Swedish Renal Registry. Patients were separated in seven groups according to level of HbA1c variability. The group with the lowest variability was denoted the reference. The ratio of the standard deviation (SD) to the mean of HbA1c, HbA1c (SD)/HbA1c (mean), i.e. the coefficient of variation (CV), was defined as HbA1c variability. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were examined using Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: During follow-up, 170 (52%) deaths occurred. The highest mortality was among patients with the second highest HbA1c variability, CV2.83 [n = 44 of which 68% patients died]. In the multivariate analyses where lowest HbA1c variability (CV0.51) was used as the reference group, HbA1c CV 2.83-4.60 (HR 3.15, 95% CI 1.78-5.55; p<0.001) and CV> 4.6 (HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.21-5.11; p = 0.014) were associated with increased risk of death. CONCLUSION: The high risk of all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes and PD increased significantly with elevated HbA1c variability, as measure of long-term glycemic control. This indicates that stable glycemia is associated with an improvement of survival; whereas more severe glycemic fluctuations, possibly caused by radical changes in dialysis regimes or peritonitis, are associated with a higher risk of mortality in diabetic patients with PD.","output":"Long-term glycemic variability and the risk of mortality in diabetic patients receiving peritoneal dialysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to concerns surrounding travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020-2021 otolaryngology residency application cycle will be conducted virtually for the first time.

THE PRAGMATIC, RAPID, AND ITERATIVE D&I (PRIDI) CYCLE: The PRIDI cycle is based on a double-loop learning process that recognizes the need for responsiveness and iterative adaptation of implementation cycle (inner loop) to the moving landscapes, presented by the outer loops of emerging goals and desired outcomes, emerging interventions and D&I strategies, evolving evidence, and emerging characteristics and needs of individuals and contexts. Stakeholders iteratively evaluate these surrounding landscapes of implementation, and reconsider implementation plans and activities.

Without a flexible and adaptive process of D&I, which is responsive to emerging evidence generation cycles, and closely connected to the needs and priorities of stakeholders and target users through engagement and feedback, the interventions to mitigate public health emergencies (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic), and other emerging issues, will have limited reach and impact on populations that would most benefit.

Data Sources: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library were searched up to February-March 2020 (PROSPERO registration CRD42020170692). Study selection: Published peer-reviewed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the efficacy of ENDS for sustained cessation of combustible tobacco smoking and/or nicotine use, compared with no intervention, placebo or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) by intention-to-treat, with a minimum of four months follow-up. Data Extraction: Data were extracted independently into a pre-specified template. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and evidence quality rated using GRADE. Data Synthesis: From 3,973 titles identified, nine RCTs were identified; 330 of 5,445 smokers randomised quit. Smoking cessation did not differ significantly for randomisation to ENDS versus: no intervention (three studies, random-effects meta-analysis RR 1.95; 95%CI 0.90-4.22); placebo (three studies, 1.61; 0.93-2.78) or NRT (three studies; 1.25; 0.74-2.11).

COVID-19 often causes asymptomatic or mild disease in children; however, delayed routine childhood immunization is a concern, as it could increase the risk of vaccine-preventable disease. No study has evaluated the status of childhood vaccinations in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective observational study evaluated the number of vaccine doses administered to children in 4 Japanese cities (2 cities in the Tokyo metropolitan area and 2 cities far from Tokyo) during the period from 2016 to 2020. Vaccine doses administered between January and September 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared, by month, with those given during 2016-2019. Age-stratified demographic data were collected to determine whether factors other than change in the child population over time affected vaccination trends. RESULTS: In all cities the decrease in vaccine doses administered was most apparent in March and April 2020, i.e., just before or coincident with the declaration of a nationwide COVID-19 emergency on April 7, 2020. The decrease started as early as February in the Tokyo metropolitan area. As child age increased, the decrease became more apparent. Before the lift of national emergency on May 25, catch-up of the vaccination was observed in all age groups in all cities. Vaccine doses persistently increased in older age groups but not in infants. The overall vaccination trends did not differ significantly among the 4 cities. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected routine childhood immunization in Japan.

The most promising direction of modern cardiology is considered to be the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and their complications (CVD). This is due to two factors: an increase in the life expectancy of the worlds population as a whole and the persistent leadership of coronary heart disease and brain stroke as the leading causes of death, and disability. The pathoge-netic aspects of the administration of acetylsalicylic acid are discussed. The most common dosage form of low-dose (ld) preparations of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) for preventive use is an intestinal-soluble tablet  80.6% in the structure of ldASK preparations. Low-dose ASK preparations are mainly presented (84.4%) in the form of monopreparations containing only ASA as the active substance, most often at a dose of 100 mg. However, the side effects of aspirin limit drug intake. This is also due to the high frequency of comorbid diseases such as bronchial asthma and stomach ulcer. The article discusses the issue of prescribing ace-tylsalicylic acid and the possibility of treating patients with concomitant bronchial asthma, gastric ulcer and obesity. The prevalence of gastroduodenal lesions was significantly lower with intestinal-coated ASA than with buffered acetylsalicylic acid. It was demonstrated that endoscopic lesions of the gastroduodenal mucosa were significantly less likely when using intestinal-coated ASA (100 mg / day) than when using conventional cetylsalicylic acid, and the assessment of the lesion when using intestinal-coated ASA was similar to the assessment of placebo without cetylsalicylic acid. In addition, the issue of the possibility of includ-ing cetylsalicylic acid in the treatment regimen for COVID 19 is being discussed. ? 2021, Remedium Group Ltd.

A well-calibrated confidence estimate enables accurate failure prediction and proper risk measurement when given noisy samples and out-of-distribution data in real-world settings. However, this task remains a severe challenge for neural machine translation (NMT), where probabilities from softmax distribution fail to describe when the model is probably mistaken. To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised confidence estimate learning jointly with the training of the NMT model. We explain confidence as how many hints the NMT model needs to make a correct prediction, and more hints indicate low confidence. Specifically, the NMT model is given the option to ask for hints to improve translation accuracy at the cost of some slight penalty. Then, we approximate their level of confidence by counting the number of hints the model uses. We demonstrate that our learned confidence estimate achieves high accuracy on extensive sentence/word-level quality estimation tasks. Analytical results verify that our confidence estimate can correctly assess underlying risk in two real-world scenarios: (1) discovering noisy samples and (2) detecting out-of-domain data. We further propose a novel confidence-based instance-specific label smoothing approach based on our learned confidence estimate, which outperforms standard label smoothing.","output":"Learning Confidence for Transformer-based Neural Machine Translation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Internet and near-instant communication services have had a strong impact on the way people communicate and exchange information since the end of the 1990s. The COVID-19 pandemic shock is likely to provide a dramatic boost to this phenomenon. In the world that will emerge from lockdown, digital communication and videoconferencing will be integral part of daily working and social life to a much higher extent than before. This will have a disproportionally strong impact on knowledge based activities, and therefore on research. This paper presents a theoretical model of endogenous economic growth with the aim of providing hints on the possible consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic shock on income per capita growth and disparities within a system of integrated urban areas. In the model, abstract technological knowledge flows at no cost across space. In contrast, flows of tacit knowledge arise from the interaction between researchers and hence tends to be hampered by distance. Within this framework, the diffusion of broadband technology, high-speed connections and videoconferencing takes the form of a reduction of the cost of distance for flows of tacit knowledge. This reinforces productive specialization that, in turn, yields an increase in the system-wide, common growth rate and an increase in income per capita disparities across areas. On the other hand, social distancing is likely to yield an asymmetric negative impact on the productivity of urban research systems thus leading to a decrease in the growth rate.","output":"Urban Growth and Convergence Dynamics after COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore managers learning-oriented leadership, and what conditions managers face when working with the promotion of employees learning.Design/methodology/approachData was collected through semi-structured interviews with managers in three manufacturing firms.

Most common were activities related to learning opportunities that arose during daily work. The identified activities ranged from being planned to occurring more spontaneously. Depending on the situation or the learning activity, the managers used different behaviours to promote learning. They supported, educated and confronted employees, and they acted as role models. Factors constraining the implementation of learning-oriented leadership included limited resources, and a lack of commitment from top management, employees or the managers themselves.Research limitations/implicationsFuture research should study learning-oriented leadership from the employees perspective.Practical implicationsManagers notions about learning and development constitute an important condition for learning-oriented leadership.

These are often formulated as relative shares of electricity demand or supply. Implementing respective constraints in energy models is a surprisingly delicate issue. They may cause a modeling artifact of excessive electricity storage use. We introduce this phenomenon as unintended storage cycling, which can be detected in case of simultaneous storage charging and discharging. In this paper, we provide an analytical representation of different approaches for implementing minimum renewable share constraints in energy models, and show how these may lead to unintended storage cycling. Using a parsimonious optimization model, we quantify related distortions of optimal dispatch and investment decisions as well as market prices, and identify important drivers of the phenomenon.

METHODS: A retrospective interrupted time-series analysis was conducted. The national database of the Hospital Remuneration System was used to retrieve the number of operations performed between January 2019 and September 2021 including elective and non-elective cases with the exception of malign diseases. Three episodes were compared on a weekly basis: before, during, and after the first national lockdown (March 16CMay 3, 2020). We also analysed the number of outpatient doctor contacts of sore throat patients in 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 144,069 surgical cases were included in the analysis. The first lockdown resulted in an abrupt and significant decrease of all types of tonsil surgery (p < 0.01). The incidence of tonsillectomy decreased from 556 (before) to 111 (during) and 326 (after) cases per week (relative risk 0.24; 95% CI 0.19C0.30, and 0.82; 95% CI 0.73C0.92). After the lockdown, the incidence persisted on a lower level compared to 2019. The number of doctor contacts decreased from 2,967,322 in 2019 to 1,976,617 in 2020 (? 33.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The first lockdown was associated with a significant decrease of all types of tonsil surgery. A return to pre-pandemic surgical activity was not identified. The findings were accompanied by a significant decrease of outpatient doctor contacts of sore throat patients in primary care, particularly in the subgroup of children and adolescents. The impact of the second lockdown, starting in December 2020, was by far not comparable.

Our objective is to evaluate the efficacy of GC in the CSS by COVID-19. PATIENTS: We included 92 patients with CSS associated to COVID-19 who received GC, GC, and tocilizumab and only tocilizumab. We determine CSS markers. We evaluated mortality, intubation, and a combined variable. RESULTS: In all cases the percentages of events were lower in the group of patients with GC was administered. The hazard ratio of the final variables with GC versus the group in which only tocilizumab was administered was lower as CGs were considered, with statistical significance for survival.

As we are facing growing numbers of COVID-19 cases caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, an understanding of the impact of air pollutants and meteorological variables on the incidence of respiratory infections is crucial. The incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) can be used as a close proxy for the circulation of influenza viruses. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in patients with ILI. Using distributed lag nonlinear models, we analyzed the association between ILI, meteorological variables and particulate matter concentration in Bialystok, Poland, from 2013-2019. We found an exponential relationship between cumulative PM2.5 pollution and the incidence of ILI, which remained significant after adjusting for air temperatures and a long-term trend. Pollution had the greatest effect during the same week, but the risk of ILI was increased for the four following weeks. The risk of ILI was also increased by low air temperatures, low absolute humidity, and high wind speed. Altogether, our results show that all measures implemented to decrease PM2.5 concentrations would be beneficial to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections.","output":"Cumulative Effects of Particulate Matter Pollution and Meteorological Variables on the Risk of Influenza-Like Illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: ADG20 is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody engineered to have potent and broad neutralization against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other SARS-like CoVs with pandemic potential and an extended half-life. ADG20 is administered intramuscularly (IM). A QSP/PBPK model was constructed to support dose selection for a Phase 2/3 trial of ambulatory patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 (STAMP: NCT04805671). METHODS: A QSP/PBPK model was used to simulate receptor occupancy (RO) and drug exposure in the upper airway (nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal epithelial lining fluid [ELF] compartment). RO was linked to an existing viral dynamic model to enable the prediction of the natural time course of viral load and the effect of ADG20 on viral clearance and infectivity rate. RO was calculated using: 1) in vitro ADG20CSARS-CoV-2 binding kinetics (association rate constant (k(on)) of 1.52E+06 M(-1)?s(1) and dissociation rate constant (k(off)) of 2.81E-04 s(-1) from a Biacore assay; 2) time course of ADG20 concentrations in ELF; and 3) time course of viral load following ADG20 administration. Molar SARS-CoV-2 viral binding site capacity was calculated assuming 40 spike proteins per virion, 3 binding sites per spike, and an initial viral load of log 10(7) copies/mL for all patients. The QSP/PBPK model and a 2018 CDC reference body weight distribution (45C150 kg) were used to simulate 1000 concentration-time profiles for a range of candidate ADG20 regimens. ADG20 regimens were evaluated against 2 criteria: 1) ability to attain near complete ( >90%), and durable (28-day) SARS-CoV-2 RO in the ELF; and 2) ability to maintain ELF ADG20 concentrations relative to a concentration (0.5 mg/L) associated with 100% viral growth suppression in an in vitro post-infection assay. RESULTS: A single 300 mg IM ADG20 dose met the dose selection criteria in terms of RO (Figure A) and viral growth suppression (Figure B). CONCLUSION: These data support the evaluation of an ADG20 300 mg IM dose for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. ADG20 is forecasted to attain near complete ( >90%) SARS-CoV-2 RO in the ELF and maintain ELF ADG20 concentrations above that associated with 100% viral growth suppression in vitro. Figure.

METHODS A multicenter retrospective study of 50 patients who underwent reversal of RYGB conducted between 2006 and 2015 was reviewed to describe the usual indications and outcomes of gastric bypass reversal surgeries. RESULTS Of 50 patients, 7 (14 %) were males and 43 (86 %) were females. The mean age of the patient population was 40.4  11.6 years (range 19-66). Reasons for reversal included anastomotic ulcers (n = 27), anastomotic complications (n = 9), malnutrition (n = 2), and functional disorder (n = 12). The mean BMI before the reversal was 29  9.4 kg/m(2) (range 16-60). The mean time between the primary procedure and reversal was 60  65.5 months (range 2-300). Fourteen of the reversals were done via laparotomy. Mean hospital stay was 8.4  7.3 days (range 3-34 days). There was no peri-operative death 30 days after reversal. Following gastric bypass reversal, 92.6 % (n = 25) of the patient population had resolution from ulcers, 77.8 % (n = 7) of the patient population had resolution from anatomic complications, 100 % (n = 2) of the patient population had resolution from malnutrition, and 66.7 % (n = 8) of the patient population had resolution from functional disorders.

The current study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the ECS is abnormal in grief, using circulating eCB concentrations as a biomarker of central ECS. A predominantly older sample of grief participants, within 13 months following the death of a loved one, and healthy comparison (HC) participants were studied. Associations of circulating eCBs with symptom variance in grievers were also examined. A total of 61 (grief: n = 44; HC: n = 17) adults completed cross-sectional clinical assessments and a fasting blood draw. Assessments included the Inventory of Complicated Grief scale; the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; and the Hamilton Anxiety scale. Serum eCB concentrations (i.e., N-arachidonoylethanolamine [AEA] and 2-arachidonoylglycerol [2-AG]) were quantified using isotope dilution, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Relative to HC participants, grievers had significantly elevated serum AEA but similar 2-AG concentrations. In grievers, serum AEA concentrations were positively associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, but only in those with low grief symptoms. These novel findings indicate that elevated circulating eCB concentrations are found following bereavement. The eCB signaling response varies based on the degree of grief severity.

METHODS The questionnaire asked about the demographics of dental hygienists, characteristics of practice, patient load, career intentions, opinion about dental hygienists workforce and the need of governmental workforce regulation. The study consisted of all licensed dental hygienists in Lithuania in 2018 (N=1109). RESULTS The final response rate was 52.1% (n=578). 64% (n=370) of respondents lived in the country's five main cities and 73.5% (n=425) worked in these population centres, with 94.3% (n=545) worked in private sector. Over two thirds of respondents said there was an excess of dental hygienists in Lithuania. Nearly 80% 'always' or 'sometimes' reported that they had insufficient patients, which may account for the prevalence of supplementary work (48.4%, n=280), i.e. work as a dental assistant (67.9%, n=190).

The antimicrobial loading was varied from 0.5, to 1.0, and 2.0 phr to monitor the effective inhibition of Gram-negative bacteria and fungi growth. For MPP and PVP-I antimicrobial agents, a loading of 2.0 phr showed good antimicrobial efficacy with the largest zone of inhibition. Simultaneously, ZnO NP demonstrated excellent antimicrobial activity at low concentrations. The addition of antimicrobial agents shows a comparable effect on the mechanical properties of NR latex films. In comparison to control NR latex film (29.41 MPa, 48.49 N/mm), antimicrobial-filled films have significantly greater tensile and tear strengths (MPP (33.84 MPa, 65.21 N/mm), ZnO NP (31.79 MPa, 52.77 N/mm), and PVP-I (33.25 MPa, 50.75 N/mm).

Vastly different results can be obtained amongst observers which can greatly affect the resulting joint kinematics. The aim of this study is to introduce an objective method for calculating functional CS definitions for bones in joints that observe three-cylindrical-joint kinematic chain decomposition methods and to apply the method on tibiofemoral joint specimens. This method is driven by low resistance joint motion during loading profiles and not from anatomical landmark selection. Two anatomical CS definitions were established from points collected by five observers, for twelve knees. The knees underwent passive flexion and internal/external rotation using the anatomical CSs. The kinematics from these profiles were used in linear least squares minimization of off-axis motions to redefine the tibia and femur origins, the femur flexion axis and the tibia internal rotation axis. Significant improvements in reproducibility of 7.4 mm (tibia origin, p < 0.001), 3.4 mm (femur origin, p < 0.001), and 2.9 (femur FE-axis, p < 0.001) between the two functional CSs compared to the two anatomical CSs were observed. Functional CSs led to significant decreases in off-axis motion during discrete passive flexion profiles. This new strategy for establishing functional CSs provides an objective approach that will reduce the effects of observer error in establishing CSs.

We calculate the needs of vaccines and healthcare staff for the program, then simulate the model for the initial 4-month and one-year scenarios. A one-year vaccination program would require 232,000 inoculations per day by 4833 vaccinators. Targeted vaccine allocation based on the burden of COVID-19 cases could benefit the COVID-19 vaccination program by lowering at least 5000 active cases. The benefits would increase by improving the number of vaccines and healthcare staff.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We continuously collected clinical data from severe COVID-19-related pneumonia patients from the West Campus of Union Hospital in Wuhan and Dongguan Peoples Hospital in Dongguan to explore the prevalence of myocardial injury and hemodynamic characteristics after circulatory failure. Doppler ultrasound and PiCCO2 were used to evaluate the hemodynamics of each patient, and arterial blood gas analysis was performed at the same time. Pearson correlation analysis was used to clarify the relationship between the parameters. RESULTS: A total of 376 patients were observed during the study period. Eighty-seven patients had myocardial injury after admission, and the mean time of myocardial injury after admission was 6 (2, 30) days, from which 16 patients developed hemodynamic instability and 15 died of cardiogenic shock or combined with MODS. Cardiac echocardiography found that the LVEF of all patients was in the normal range and that diastolic function was slightly to moderately impaired. The PiCCO2 data showed that the GEF was significantly decreased in all patients. The dpmx was in normal range. EVLWI, SVRI and GEDI were significantly increased in most patients. Pearson correlation analysis showed that cTNI was significantly related to BNP at hemodynamic instability (r = 0.662, p = 0.005); GEF was related to EVLWI (r = ?0.572, p = 0.021) and LAC (r = 0.692, p = 0.003); and EVLWI was affected by LVEF (r = ?0.564, p = 0.023), LVDF (r = ?0.734, p = 0.001) and PVPI (r = ?0.524, p = 0.037).

Thus, there is value in culturally adapting existing interventions from other settings. One such intervention for PwD involves hearing rehabilitation, which may improve dementia-related outcomes. Objective: To culturally adapt and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a multi-faceted hearing support intervention to enhance quality of life in PwD for a LMIC setting, Pakistan. Design: This was a study in three phases: (1) training and capacity building to deliver the study, including Patient and Public Involvement (PPI); (2) cultural adaptation of the intervention; and (3) delivery of a single-group feasibility study with a pre-test post-test design. Setting: Home-based intervention, in two cities of Pakistan. Participants: Adults aged  60 with mild-moderate dementia and uncorrected or partially corrected hearing impairment, and their study partners (n = 14). Intervention: An adapted hearing support intervention (HSI) comprising a full assessment of hearing function, fitting of hearing aids, and home-based support from a hearing support practitioner. Outcomes: Ratings of the feasibility of the study procedures, and acceptability/tolerability of the adapted intervention were ascertained through questionnaires, participant diaries, therapist logbooks and semi-structured interviews. A signal of effectiveness of the intervention was also explored using a battery of dementia-related outcome measures. Results: Following cultural adaptation and capacity building for study conduct and delivery, we successfully implemented all intervention components in most participants, which were well-received and enacted by participant dyads. Acceptability (i.e., understanding, motivation, sense of achievement) and tolerability (i.e., effort, fatigue) ratings and safety of the intervention were within a priori target ranges. Recruitment and retention targets required improvement, due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, as well as the lack of a clear clinical diagnostic pathway for dementia in both sites. Areas for future modification were clearly identified, including: the assessment/delivery logistics circuit; procedures for arranging visits; communication among referring clinicians and the study team. Conclusion: This is the first study in a LMIC of sensory enhancement to improve dementia outcomes.

In this work, we report that Hsp70 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation, chaperones FUS, another ALS-linked pathogenic protein, in stress granules (SGs), and prevents condensed FUS from amyloid aggregation. Knock-down of Hsp70 does not influence SG assembly but results in the liquid-to-solid transition in SGs. NMR experiments further reveal Hsp70 predominantly uses its C-terminal substrate-binding domain to interact with the low complexity domain of FUS, which represents a mechanism distinct from that interacting with TDP-43.

Currently, NA inhibitors are extensively used to treat influenza, but their efficacy is compromised by the emergence of drug resistant variants. Neutralizing antibodies targeting influenza A virus surface glycoproteins are critical components of influenza therapeutic agents and may provide alternative strategies to the existing countermeasures. However, the major hurdle for the extensive application of antibody therapies lies in the difficulty of generating non-immunogenic antibodies in large quantities rapidly. Here, we report one human monoclonal antibody (mAb), 53C10, isolated from transchromosomic (Tc) cattle exhibits potent neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition titers against different clades of H1N1 subtype influenza A viruses. In vitro selection of antibody escape mutants reveals that 53C10 recognizes a novel non-continuous epitope in the HA head domain involving three amino acid residues, glycine (G), Serine (S) and glutamic acid (E) at positions172, 207 and 212, respectively. The results of our experiments supported a critical role for substitution of arginine at position 207 (S207R) in mediating resistance to 53C10, while substitutions at either G172E or E212A did not alter antibody recognition and neutralization. The E212A mutation may provide structural stability for the epitope, while the substitution G172E probably compensates for loss of fitness introduced by S207R. Our results offer novel insights into the mechanism of action of mAb 53C10 and indicate its potential role in therapeutic treatment of H1 influenza virus infection in humans.IMPORTANCE Respiratory diseases caused by influenza viruses still pose a serious concern to global health and neutralizing antibodies constitute a promising area of antiviral therapeutics. However, the potential application of antibodies is often hampered by the challenge in generating non-immunogenic antibodies in large scale. In the present study, the transchromosomic (Tc) cattle were used for the generation of non-immunogenic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and characterization of such mAbs revealed one monoclonal antibody 53C10, exhibiting a potent neutralization activity against H1N1 influenza viruses. Further characterization of the neutralization-escape mutant generated using this mAb, showed that three amino acid substitutions in the HA head domain contributed to the resistance. These findings emphasize the importance of Tc cattle in the production of non-immunogenic mAbs and highlight the potential of 53C10 mAb in the therapeutic application against H1 influenza virus infection in humans.","output":"Human Monoclonal Antibody Derived from Transchromosomic (Tc) Cattle Neutralizes Multiple H1 Clades of Influenza A Virus by Recognizing a Novel Conformational Epitope in the HA Head Domain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background Several animal studies, and one inoculation study in adult asthmatics have shown that interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a major contributor to type-2 inflammation in acute asthma. However, the link between IL-33 and type-2 inflammation has not been shown in naturally occurring asthma exacerbations. Objectives To determine if airway IL-33 is associated with type-2 inflammation measured by type-2 cytokines, FeNO and sputum eosinophils in patients presenting to the Emergency Department with an asthma exacerbations. Methods Adult patients hospitalized due to acute asthma were enrolled. Upper airways were sampled with nasal swabs and lower airways with induced sputum. Cytokines were measured at protein level using a Luminex? assay and mRNA expression level using droplet-digital-PCR. Airway sampling was repeated four weeks after exacerbation. Results At the time of exacerbation, upper airway IL-33 correlated with upper airway IL-5 and IL-13 (R = 0.84, p < 0.01 and R = 0.76, p < 0.01, respectively) and with lower airway IL-13 (R = 0.49, p = 0.03). Similar associations were observed for mRNA expression. Lower airway IL-33 positively correlated with lower airway IL-13 (R = 0.84, p < 0.01). IL-13 and IL-33 were positively correlated with FeNO, and IL-5 with eosinophils. The association between IL-33 and type-2 cytokines were still present four weeks after exacerbation. Conclusion This is the first study to demonstrate that airway IL-33 is associated with type-2 cytokines in naturally occurring asthma exacerbations in adults, providing in vivo evidence supporting that IL-33 may be driving type-2 inflammation in acute asthma. Thus supporting IL-33 as a potential future drug target due to its role, upstream in the immunological cascade.","output":"Airway Interleukin-33 and type 2 cytokines in adult patients with acute asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) is a composite score which can detect the first signs of cognitive impairment, which can be of importance for research and clinical practice. It is designed to be administered in person; however, in-person assessments are costly, and are difficult during the current COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of performing the PACC assessment with videoconferencing, and to compare the validity of this remote PACC with the in-person PACC obtained previously. METHODS: Participants from the HEalth and Ageing Data IN the Game of football (HEADING) Study who had already undergone an in-person assessment were re-contacted and re-assessed remotely. The correlation between the two PACC scores was estimated. The difference between the two PACC scores was calculated and used in multiple linear regression to assess which variables were associated with a difference in PACC scores. FINDINGS: Of the 43 participants who were invited to this external study, 28 were re-assessed. The median duration in days between the in-person and the remote assessments was 236.5 days (7.9 months) (IQR 62.5). There was a strong positive correlation between the two assessments for the PACC score, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 082 (95% CI 066, 098). The multiple linear regression found that the only predictor of the PACC difference was the time between assessments. INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence on the feasibility of performing cognitive tests online, with the PACC tests being successfully administered through videoconferencing.

Much of the additional burden has been shouldered by women, particularly in countries with a traditionally uneven division of household labor. Yet the dramatic increase in remote work from home since the pandemic also has the potential to increase paternal involvement in family life and thus to redress persistent domestic gender role inequalities. This effect depends on the working arrangements of each partner, whether working remotely, working at their usual workplace or ceasing work altogether. We examine the role of working arrangements during the pandemic on the traditional division of household labor in Italy using survey data from interviews with a representative sample of working women conducted during the two waves of COVID-19 (April and November 2020). Our data show that the gender gap in household care related activities was widest during the first wave of the pandemic, and although it was less pronounced during the second wave, it was still higher than pre-COVID-19. The time spent by women on housework, childcare, and assisting their children with distance learning did not depend on their partners' working arrangements. Conversely, men spent fewer hours helping with the housework and distance learning when their partners were at home. It is interesting, however, that although men who worked remotely or not at all did devote more time to domestic chores and child care, the increased time they spent at home did not seem to lead to a reallocation of couples' roles in housework and child care. Finally, we find that working arrangements are linked to women's feelings of uncertainty, with heterogeneous effects by level of education.","output":"Did Covid-19 Affect the Division of Labor within the Household?

From human sequence databases, we identified 9 ACE2 variants at ACE2-S-protein binding sites. We used both experimental assays and protein structure analysis to evaluate the effect of each variant on the binding affinity of ACE2 to S-protein. We found one variant causing complete binding disruption, two and three variants, respectively, strongly and mildly reducing the binding affinity, and two variants strongly enhancing the binding affinity. We then collected the ACE2 gene sequences from 57 non-human primates. Among the six apes and 20 Old World monkeys (OWMs) studied we found no new variants. In contrast, all 11 New World monkeys (NWMs) studied share four variants each causing a strong reduction in binding affinity, the Philippine tarsier also possesses three such variants, and 18 of the 19 prosimian species studied share one variant causing a strong reduction in binding affinity. Moreover, one OWM and three prosimian variants increased binding affinity by > 50%. Based on these findings we proposed that the common ancestor of primates was strongly resistant to and that of NWMs was completely resistant to SARS-CoV-2 and so is the Philippine tarsier, whereas apes and OWMs, like most humans, are susceptible.

The Kleinknechts Dental Fear Survey (DFS) is one of the used scales to assess dental fear. The present study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Lebanese Arabic version of the DFS (DFS-A) and to determine the optimal cut-off to identify dental fear as well as the correlates of dental fear in a group of Lebanese adults dental patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among a group of 442 dental patients (18C65 years) recruited at 29 dental clinics from March to June 2019. Patients completed a questionnaire including questions about demographic characteristics, previous bad dental experience, traumas experience period, the sensation of nausea during dental treatment, the DFS-A scale, the Lebanese Arabic version of the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS-A), and a general question about dental fear. RESULTS: DFS-A revealed evidence of adequate psychometric properties. DFS-A scale demonstrated high internal consistency (cronbachs alpha = 0.93). TestCretest reliability assessment demonstrated strong reproducibility of the DFS-A scale score (ICC = 0.92 with 95% CI (0.83C0.96), p value < 0.0001 (N = 30). Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a three-factor structure of the DFS-A reflecting fear associated with specific dental stimuli and procedures, patterns of dental avoidance and anticipatory anxiety, and physiologic arousal during dental treatment. A significant correlation was found between DFS-A and the MDAS-A indicating a good convergent validity. The optimal cut-off point to identify patients with and without dental fear is 41. Considering this cut-off score, the prevalence of dental fear in our sample was reported at 33.8%.

However, no paediatric data are available that shows the necessity of adding of pressure support during such tests. We sought to measure the WOBimp during an ERT with and without added pressure support and to study its clinical correlate. This was a prospective study in spontaneously breathing ventilated children < 18 years undergoing ERT. Using tracheal manometry, WOBimp was calculated by integrating the difference between positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and tracheal pressure (Ptrach) over the measured expiratory tidal volume (VTe) under two paired conditions: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with and without PS. Patients with post-extubation upper airway obstruction were excluded. RESULTS A total of 112 patients were studied. Median PS during the ERT was 10 cmH2O. WOBimp was significantly higher without PS (median 0.27, IQR 0.20-0.50 J/L) than with added PS (median 0.00, IQR 0.00-0.11 J/L). Although there were statistically significant changes in spontaneous breath rate [32 (23-42) vs. 37 (27-46) breaths/min, p < 0.001] and higher ET-CO2 [5.90 (5.38-6.65) vs. 6.23 (5.55-6.94) kPa, p < 0.001] and expiratory Vt decreased [7.72 (6.66-8.97) vs. 7.08 (5.82-8.08) mL/kg, p < 0.001] in the absence of PS, these changes appeared clinically irrelevant since the Comfort B score remained unaffected [12 (10-13) vs. 12 (10-13), P = 0.987].

METHODS We searched studies published in PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE from December 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020 to identify relevant observational study that investigated the prevalence of diabetes among COVID-19 patients or its impact on clinical outcomes. We used a random-effects or fixed-effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence of diabetes and risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) of diabetes on outcomes. Funnel plots were used to evaluate the publication bias and the heterogeneity was evaluated by I 2 statistic. RESULTS Twenty-three eligible articles including 49564 COVID-19 patients (1573 with and 47991 without diabetes) were finally included. The pooled prevalence of diabetes was 10% (95%CI: 7%-15%) in COVID-19 patients. In the subgroup analyses, the pooled prevalence of diabetes was higher in studies with patients aged > 50 years (13%; 95%CI: 11%-16%) than in studies with patients aged  50 years (7%; 95%CI: 6%-8%), in severe patients (17%; 95%CI: 14%-20%) than in non-severe patients (6%; 95%CI: 5%-8%), and in dead patients (30%; 95%CI: 13%-46%) than in survivors (8%; 95%CI: 2%-15%) (P < 0.05 for all).

I then quantified the effect of peer review on manuscripts by examining differences between the preprint and published versions using the normalised Levenshtein distance, cosine similarity, and word count ratios for titles, abstracts, document sections and full-texts. I also examined changes in references used between versions and linked changes to reviewers' comments. Reviewers' comments were nearly equally split between issues of methodology (30.7%), theory (30.0%), and writing quality (29.2%). Titles, abstracts, and the semantic content of documents remained similar, although publications were typically longer than preprints. Two-thirds of citations were unchanged, 20.9% were added during review and 13.1% were removed. These findings indicate reviewers equally attended to the theoretical and methodological details and communication style of manuscripts, although the effect on quantitative measures of the manuscripts was limited.","output":"Peer reviewers equally critique theory, method, and writing, with limited effect on manuscripts' content"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Somos Dign@s, a collective, composed by students, professors, and human rights activists, concerned about the crisis of human rights and civil liberties in Puerto Rico designed a successful national campaign for human rights known as: Trayecto Dignidad or The Journey toward Dignity.

Although their primary mode of transmission is through contaminated respiratory droplets from infected carriers, the deposition of expelled virus particles onto surface and fomites could contribute to viral transmission. Here, we use replication-deficient murine leukemia virus (MLV) pseudoviral particles expressing SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV Spike (S) protein on their surface. These surrogates of native coronavirus counterparts serve as a model to analyze the S-mediated entry into target cells. Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) nanofibers that are combined with copper (Cu) exhibit strong antimicrobial properties. S-pseudovirions that are exposed to CMC-Cu nanoparticles (30 s) display a dramatic reduction in their ability to infect target Vero E6 cells, with 97% less infectivity as compared to untreated pseudovirions. In contrast, addition of the Cu chelator tetrathiomolybdate protects S- pseudovirions from CMC-Cu-mediated inactivation. When S-pseudovirions were treated with a hydrogen peroxide-based disinfectant (denoted SaberTM) used at 1:16 dilution, their infectivity was dramatically reduced by 98%. However, the combined use of SaberTM and CMC-Cu is the most effective approach to restrict infectivity of SARS-CoV-2-S, SARS-CoV-S, and MERS-CoV-S pseudovirions in Vero E6 cell assays. Together, these results show that cellulosic Cu nanoparticles enhance the effectiveness of diluted SaberTM sanitizer, setting up an improved strategy to lower the risk of surface- and fomite-mediated transmission of enveloped respiratory viruses.","output":"Cellulosic copper nanoparticles and a hydrogen peroxide-based disinfectant protect Vero E6 cells against infection by viral pseudotyped particles expressing SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV Spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In detecting infectious diseases, such as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is one of the most important technologies for RNA detection and disease diagnosis.

In particular, this report offers opportunities to build on experience gained in managing the COVID-19 emergency in the Departments of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHAs) in Lombardy, the wealthiest Italian region, which has approximately 10 million inhabitants. Observations Italy has a National Mental Health System divided into 134 DMHAs, 27 of which are in Lombardy. In the 4 weeks after the epidemic started, important changes occurred in the management of DMHAs in Lombardy. Many challenges have occurred in the management of health services. In many hospitals, entire wards, including some psychiatric wards, have been reorganized to admit patients with COVID-19, and many physicians and nurses have been diverted to wards managing patients with COVID-19. Most day facilities for patients with psychiatric needs have been temporarily closed, whereas in residential facilities, patients who usually are free to come and go during the day have had to be confined in the facilities with very limited or no leave. These changes have produced considerable stresses on people with severe mental disorders. Many outpatient clinics have limited appointments to those with the most urgent cases, and home visits, a common practice in most DMHAs, have been drastically reduced with potentially detrimental consequences for patients' well-being. Another potential detrimental consequence of being forced to stay at home has been an increase in the hours spent face to face with families with high amounts of conflict. Conclusions and Relevance Departments of Mental Health need to be equipped with appropriate e-health technologies and procedures to cope with situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, interventions are needed to mitigate the potentially harmful consequences of quarantine. Departments of Mental Health should be able to assume a leadership position in the psychosocial management of disasterlike situations, and this requires the acquisition of new skills, notably how to correctly inform the population about risk, train and disseminate effective preventive and management procedures for disasters, support health personnel and rescuers, and support those experiencing bereavement.","output":"Mental Health in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Emergency-The Italian Response."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hydroxychloroquine has been promoted for its use in treatment of COVID-19 patients based on in-vitro evidences.

Our review aims to analyse data on the incidence and prognostic value of LFT alterations, the underlying mechanisms and the management of pre-existing liver disease in COVID-19 affected patients. Methods We searched available literature through online PubMed database using terms as ?SARS-CoV-2,? ?Liver damage,? ?Liver Function tests,? ?COVID-19,? ?pre-existing liver disease,? ?drug-induced liver injury.? Results Available evidence suggest that there could be a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and liver damage, although the underlying involved mechanism remains unclear. Cohort studies have shown that high ALT levels, low platelet counts and low albumin levels at admission and during hospitalisation are associated with a high mortality rate. Unfortunately, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on pre-existing liver damage. While chronic viral infections or NAFLD are associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 progression, patients with cirrhosis may have increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their systemic immunocompromised status.

Children have spent more time at home from school, while many parents try to balance working from home and childcare. Additionally, the amount of electronics powered by BB has increased. Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) secondary to a retained aerodigestive BB is a devastating development. Management is challenging, and the clinical timeline of watchful waiting versus surgical intervention for TEF is poorly defined in the literature. METHODS: In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, databases searched include PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL from database date of inception through August 13, 2021. All study designs were included, and no language, publication date, or other restrictions were applied. Case series and reports of TEFs secondary to BBs were included. Clinical risk factors and outcomes were compared between the spontaneous closure and surgical repair groups. RESULTS: A total of 79 studies with 105 total patients were included. Mortality was 11.4%. There were 23 (21.9%) TEFs that spontaneously closed and 71 (67.6%) that underwent surgical repair. Median time to spontaneous closure compared to surgical repair was significantly different (8.0 weeks [IQR 4.0-18.4] vs. 2.0 weeks [IQR 0.1-3.3], p<0.001). Smaller TEFs were more likely to spontaneously close versus being surgically repaired (9.3 mm  3.5 vs. 14.9 mm  8.3, p=0.022). Duration of symptoms before BB discovery, BB size, time between BB removal and TEF discovery, and location of the TEF were not statistically different between the spontaneous closure and surgical repair groups. CONCLUSION: A TEF secondary to BB ingestion is a potentially deadly complication. Timing of reported TEF spontaneous closure varies significantly. While smaller TEFs may be amenable to healing without surgical repair, no other significant factors were identified that may be associated with spontaneous closure. If clinical status permits, these data suggest a period of observation of at least 8 weeks prior to surgical intervention may be practical for many BB-induced TEFs.","output":"Evaluating the management timeline of tracheoesophageal fistulas secondary to button batteries: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CASE REPORT - INTRODUCTION: Behcets disease is a rare chronic multi-organ inflammatory disorder characterized by oral aphthous and genital ulceration, often associated with several systemic manifestations. These include skin lesions, arthritis, ocular disease, CNS, GI, and vascular involvement. Arterial disease can affect medium and large sized arteries, leading to aneurysm development with the potential to rupture. We report a case of Behcets disease presenting in such a manner, with multiple aneurysms at imminent risk of arterial rupture. The presentation occurred at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020 with the patient contracting the virus complicating cyclophosphamide immunosuppression therapy post operatively. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 54-year-old man had been under rheumatology follow up for numerous years. He reported recurrent oral ulcers, and episodic fevers. He previously had confirmed cerebral sinus thrombosis, aseptic endocarditis, multiple pulmonary emboli and was investigated for inflammatory bowel disease. He presented acutely to AE with a painful, tender left calf and a large pulsatile mass in the calf. He reported paraesthesia in his left leg/foot suggestive of nerve compression. CT angiogram performed, revealed a large 6.5cm x 4cm left tibioperoneal trunk (TPT) pseudoaneurysm (Fig.1), and 1.2cm right anterior tibial (ATA) pseudoaneurysm (Fig 2). There was also a 3.8cm infrarenal inflammatory abdominal aortic pseudoaneurysm (Fig 3), and finally a 2.3cm right lower lobe pulmonary artery aneurysm. Laboratory investigations revealed raised inflammatory markers, with ESR of 120 and CRP 73. A diagnosis of vascular Behcets was suspected. Urgent surgical intervention was deemed necessary to prevent limb and life-threatening complications of arterial rupture. He underwent open surgical decompression and graft repair of the left TPT aneurysm. Endovascular stenting of infrarenal AAA was performed and the right ATA aneurysm was ligated and excised. The pulmonary artery aneurysm was managed conservatively, but interval CT Imaging post immunosuppression treatment showed complete resolution. This undoubtedly was due to immunosuppression therapy. The first cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone infusion were given day 1 post-op. The following day he developed a fever and a dry cough. He subsequently tested positive for SARS-COV-2. This was at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. He required supplementary oxygen, but his condition did not deteriorate further, and he made a complete recovery. A difficult dilemma was posed between immunosuppression and the risk of infection having been diagnosed with COVID-19. An MDT approach was adopted, and input was sought from the Birmingham Bechets centre of excellence. He continued immunosuppressive treatment once recovered from the virus. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: Bechets disease is considered a form of systemic vasculitis and is unique in its ability to involve blood vessels of all sizes from the arterial and venous systems. Vascular manifestations in Bechets disease are associated with increased mortality and morbidity with manifestations more common in men. Arterial rupture is the leading cause of sudden death in patients with Bechets disease. Endovascular and perivascular inflammation of large vessels can lead to haemorrhage, aneurysm formation with risk of rupture, stenosis, and thrombus development. To prevent potential life-threatening complications of vascular Bechets, a combination of surgical/radiological and medical management is often required. High dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide infusions are typically used, with aim to achieve disease remission. It is recommended that if surgical/radiological interventions are indicated, it should ideally be performed when the disease is quiescent. However, urgent intervention is required if the aneurysm is at high risk of rupture, rapidly enlarging or if there is organ threatening ischemia. This was the approach used in this patient. Potent immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide and high dose corticosteroids is indicated in arterial disease of Bechets. The inherent risk of infection with these agents, being used at the peak of a global pandemic created a challenging clinical dilemma. To complicate matters further, the patient developed fever and cough following the 1st cyclophosphamide/steroid treatment and tested positive for COVID-19. His condition was relatively mild however and made a full recovery from the virus. Behcets disease can be a difficult and challenging condition to diagnose. There is often a delay in diagnosis. Our patient was previously referred to a tertiary Bechets centre but felt there was insufficient clinical grounds to make the diagnosis at that stage. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: This case provides a rare example of an immunosuppressed patient with rheumatic disease contracting COVID-19 after extensive vascular intervention. A poor outcome may have been expected but in contrary the patients disease course was mild. This perhaps supports the theory that immunosuppression may play a protective role during COVID-19. The role of immunosuppression in a hyperinflammatory COVID-19 state is an area of much research interest. Suppression of the cytokine storm with immune therapy has been hypothesised as a potential therapy target for some COVID-19 patients. However, this is still unproven. Corticosteroid treatment with dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients in hospital, through the Recovery Trial. In addition, encouraging evidence continues to emerge for the role of IL1 and IL6 inhibitors in the cytokine storm. It is rare for a patient to present with such extensive aneurysmal disease. Vascular complications of Bechets although rare need to be considered. The management for vascular manifestations of Bechets disease requires co-ordination and collaborative work between Rheumatologists, Vascular surgery, and Radiologists. Guidance from expert centres is highly recommended. Prompt medical and surgical intervention is needed to prevent serious limb and life-threatening complications of arterial Bechets disease. Our case raises the clinical conundrum of immunosuppression therapy in serious organ threatening rheumatic disease with concomitant COVID-19 infection. A patient-centred approach with patient involvement in clinical decisions is required. Patients and clinicians alike should balance the risks associated with organ threatening rheumatic disease and infection risks. The current global coronavirus pandemic makes such decisions more difficult with an additional communicable disease prevalent in the community. With few clinically proven therapies and no vaccine available for COVID-19, Rheumatologists will have to grapple with this dilemma for the foreseeable future.","output":"O05 Active Bechet's with life threatening arterial disease, complicated by concurrent COVID-19 infection at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic: did immunosuppression help or hinder?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To describe our buried penis repair technique that includes penile release, tissue resection, wound closure, and penile reconstruction. PATIENTS AND METHODS In all, 73 patients were treated from 2007 to 2017. Patients can be categorised into five stages: Stage I, involves only a phimotic band; Stage 2, required excision of diseased penile skin with split-thickness skin grafting (STSG); Stage 3, requires scrotal excision; Stage 4, requires escutcheonectomy; and Stage 5, requires panniculectomy. Successful treatment hinges on adequate excision of diseased skin and de-bulking followed by replacement of deficient skin with STSG. RESULTS In all, 36 of 73 (49%) patients had Stage 1-3 disease, whilst 37 of 73 (51%) were Stage 4-5. There were complications within the first 30 days in 44 of 73 (60%) patients. In all, 62 of 73 (85%) patients either had no complications or Clavien-Dindo grade I-II complications and nine (12%) had complications beyond 30 days. Only five of 36 (14%) patients with Stage 1-3 disease had complications. One patient developed recurrent phimosis. CONCLUSION The buried penis is a challenging surgical entity where conservative treatment will most likely lead to failure. Surgery is the only means for a lasting cure in these patients and should be used as a first-line treatment. One should expect complications postoperatively, especially within the first 30 days; however, these are mostly limited to Clavien-Dindo grade I-II complications.","output":"Contemporary management of adult-acquired buried penis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been a lot of speculation that patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may be at increased risk for adverse outcomes.

A better understanding of the ferroptotic death mechanism could lead to the development of new therapeutics for degenerative diseases, and a better understanding of how to induce ferroptosis in specific tumor contexts. We performed an unbiased genome-wide siRNA screen to find genetic suppressors of ferroptosis. We determined that loss of CARS, the cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase, suppresses ferroptosis induced by erastin, which inhibits the cystineCglutamate antiporter known as system x(c)(?). Knockdown of CARS inhibited erastin-induced death by preventing the induction of lipid reactive oxygen species, without altering iron homeostasis.

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing dyslipidaemia. METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched MEDLINE and Scopus to locate all the articles published up to January 31, 2021, reporting data on dyslipidaemia among COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors. The pooled prevalence of dyslipidaemia was calculated using a random effects model and presenting the related 95% confidence interval (CI), while the mortality risk was estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio (OR) and related 95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity was measured using the Higgins I2 statistic. RESULTS: Eighteen studies, enrolling 74.132 COVID-19 patients [mean age 70.6 years], met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of dyslipidaemia was 17.5% of cases (95% CI: 12.3-24.3%, p < 0.0001), with high heterogeneity (I2=98.7%). Pre-existing dyslipidaemia was significantly associated with higher risk of short-term death (OR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.19-2.41, p = 0.003), with high heterogeneity (I2=88.7%). Due to publication bias, according to the Trim-and-Fill method, the corrected random-effect ORs resulted 1.61, 95% CI 1.13-2.28, p < 0.0001 (one studies trimmed).

Tens of millions of confirmed cases and more than hundreds of thousands of confirmed deaths are reported worldwide according to the World Health Organisation. News about the virus is spreading all over social media websites. Consequently, these social media outlets are experiencing and presenting different views, opinions and emotions during various outbreak-related incidents. For computer scientists and researchers, big data are valuable assets for understanding people's sentiments regarding current events, especially those related to the pandemic. Therefore, analysing these sentiments will yield remarkable findings. To the best of our knowledge, previous related studies have focused on one kind of infectious disease. No previous study has examined multiple diseases via sentiment analysis. Accordingly, this research aimed to review and analyse articles about the occurrence of different types of infectious diseases, such as epidemics, pandemics, viruses or outbreaks, during the last 10 years, understand the application of sentiment analysis and obtain the most important literature findings. Articles on related topics were systematically searched in five major databases, namely, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore and Scopus, from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2020. These indices were considered sufficiently extensive and reliable to cover our scope of the literature. Articles were selected based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria for the systematic review, with a total of n = 28 articles selected. All these articles were formed into a coherent taxonomy to describe the corresponding current standpoints in the literature in accordance with four main categories: lexicon-based models, machine learning-based models, hybrid-based models and individuals. The obtained articles were categorised into motivations related to disease mitigation, data analysis and challenges faced by researchers with respect to data, social media platforms and community. Other aspects, such as the protocol being followed by the systematic review and demographic statistics of the literature distribution, were included in the review. Interesting patterns were observed in the literature, and the identified articles were grouped accordingly. This study emphasised the current standpoint and opportunities for research in this area and promoted additional efforts towards the understanding of this research field.","output":"Sentiment analysis and its applications in fighting COVID-19 and infectious diseases: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"c The swift and vast spread of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) was caused, to a significant extent, by aviation itself This virus proliferated worldwide not only due to its ability to be transmitted from one human to another easily, but also due to the unprecedent volume of travel, especially by air, at a time of unprecedented globalization In the wake of COVID-19, various novel practices have been and are being proposed In this light, an examination of a number of these proposed practices is undertaken, this in order to determine whether they are legally sound or not An examination of the laws underlying those practices follows, not least because such practices are virtually all erected upon a legal foundation By examining the relevant laws on both an industry and State level, an attempt is made at determining whether or not such laws are adequate in allowing the corresponding practices to be effective This article conclusively discusses whether the proposed practices and the underlying laws already in existence have the potential to prevent a future disease from spreading as swiftly and as vastly, and from disrupting the aviation industry as severely as COVID-19 has","output":"Evolution or Devolution: Aviation Law and Practice After COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Hypoxia and inflammation are hallmarks of critical illness, related to multiple organ failure. A possible mechanism leading to multiple organ failure is hypoxia- or inflammation-induced downregulation of the detoxifying glyoxalase system that clears dicarbonyl stress. The dicarbonyl methylglyoxal (MGO) is a highly reactive agent produced by metabolic pathways such as anaerobic glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. MGO leads to protein damage and ultimately multi-organ failure. Whether detoxification of MGO into D-lactate by glyoxalase functions appropriately under conditions of hypoxia and inflammation is largely unknown. We investigated the effect of inflammation and hypoxia on the MGO pathway in humans in vivo. METHODS After prehydration with glucose 2.5% solution, ten healthy males were exposed to hypoxia (arterial saturation 80-85%) for 3.5 hours using an air-tight respiratory helmet, ten males to experimental endotoxemia (LPS 2 ng/kg i.v.), ten males to LPS+hypoxia and ten males to none of these interventions (control group). Serial blood samples were drawn, and glyoxalase-1 mRNA expression, MGO, methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone-1 (MG-H1), D-lactate and L-lactate levels, were measured serially. RESULTS Glyoxalase-1 mRNA expression decreased in the LPS ( (95%CI); -0.87 (-1.24; -0.50) and the LPS+hypoxia groups; -0.78 (-1.07; -0.48) (p<0.001). MGO was equal between groups, whereas MG-H1 increased over time in the control group only (p=0.003). D-lactate was increased in all four groups. L-lactate was increased in all groups, except in the control group. CONCLUSION Systemic inflammation downregulates glyoxalase-1 mRNA expression in humans. This is a possible mechanism leading to cell damage and multi-organ failure in critical illness with potential for intervention.","output":"Systemic inflammation downregulates glyoxalase-1 expression: an experimental study in healthy males."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We previously reported that a single immunization with an adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector-based vaccine expressing an optimized SARS-CoV-2 spike (Ad26.COV2.S) protected rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

Activated memory B cells as well as binding and neutralizing antibody titers following vaccination correlated with protective efficacy. At suboptimal vaccine doses, viral breakthrough was observed but did not show evidence of virologic, immunologic, histopathologic, or clinical enhancement of disease compared with sham controls. These data demonstrate that a single immunization with a relatively low dose of Ad26.COV2.S effectively protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques.

Type II was likely evolved from Type I and predominant in the infections. Our results suggest that Type II SARS-CoV-2 was the source of the outbreak in the Wuhan Huanan market and it was likely originated from a super-spreader. The outbreak caused by the Type I virus should have occurred somewhere else, because the patients had no direct link to the market. Furthermore, by analyzing three genomic sites that distinguish Type I and Type II strains, we found that synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II strains are predominant, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than Type I.

SARS-CoV-2 has infected several millions of people, resulting in a huge socioeconomic cost and over 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Though the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not fully understood, data have consistently shown that SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Nevertheless, accumulating evidence has implicated the central nervous system in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unfortunately, however, the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced impairment of the central nervous system are not completely known. Here, we review the literature on possible neuropathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced cerebral damage. The results suggest that downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with increased activity of the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin L in SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion may result in upregulation of proinflammatory mediators and reactive species that trigger neuroinflammatory response and blood brain barrier disruption. Furthermore, dysregulation of hormone and neurotransmitter signalling may constitute a fundamental mechanism involved in the neuropathogenic sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The viral RNA or antigenic peptides also activate or interact with molecular signalling pathways mediated by pattern recognition receptors (e.g., toll-like receptors), nuclear factor kappa B, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, complement cascades, and cell suicide molecules.

Here, we review the basic principles governing LIDAR and its potential to be used in three notable use cases in the context of remote patient monitoring: geriatric fall prevention, postoperative recovery monitoring, and home safety assessment. For assisting geriatric populations, LIDAR can create 3D renderings of their home environments and classify which objects may be associated with risk for falls. These risk factors can then be forwarded to both patients and providers in order for them to discuss how to make the patients environment safer. LIDAR is also capable of mapping the range of extremity motion in patients undergoing postoperative recovery. Such LIDAR data is simple to acquire and record for these patients and could enable unique metrics to be developed to assess patient outcomes in postoperative recovery. Finally, LIDAR can also reproduce 3D home models to identify attributes of their environments that could be harmful to infants.

Compared to CjeCas9, native Cas9 of Streptococcus pyogenes (SpyCas9) is more suitable for guide-dependent editing. However, in human cells, native SpyCas9 may still cause some DNA damage, most likely because of its ssDNA cleavage activity. This side effect can be completely prevented by saturation of SpyCas9 with an appropriate guide RNA, which is only partially effective for CjeCas9. We conclude that CjeCas9 plays an active role in attacking human cells rather than in viral defense.

Vitamin D and calcium supplements haves shown to increase bone density and reduce fracture risk. Therefore, The Danish Health Authority recommends all nursing home residents a daily supplement of 20 g vitamin D and 800C1000 mg calcium. However, adherence to the recommendation and knowledge of it is unknown. The aims of this study were to investigate adherence, knowledge, and potential barriers to this recommendation in Denmark. METHODS: A cross-sectional electronic survey was conducted in MayCJune 2020 among 50 randomly selected nursing homes widely distributed in Denmark. Questions included degree of adherence to the recommendation at each nursing home as well as respondents knowledge and attitudes towards it, and experienced barriers in relation to adherence. RESULTS: Respondents from 41 nursing homes answered the questionnaire, and these were mainly nurses (63%) or nursing home leaders (20%). Low adherence ( 40% of residents receiving both supplements) was reported at 35% of nursing homes, and only 8% of the nursing homes had a high adherence (> 80% of residents receiving both supplements). Most respondents (88%) had knowledge of the recommendation and 62% rated importance of increased implementation as high. Common explanations of low implementation were a lack of prescription by the general practitioner in the central electronic database (60%), resident-refusal to eat tablets (43%), chewing-swallowing difficulties (40%), and a high number of tablets given to the residents daily (34%). CONCLUSIONS: The recommendation of daily vitamin D and calcium supplements to Danish nursing home residents is poorly implemented even though knowledge of the recommendation is relatively high. Barriers relate to an ambiguity of responsibility between the general practitioners and the nursing home staff, as well as the high number of tablets to be consumed in total by the residents.

This work simulates how the coronavirus (COVID-19) spreads and infects healthy people. The initial values of PID controller parameters consider the zero patient, who infects new patients (other values of PID controller parameters). The model aims to simulate as accurately as possible the coronavirus activity. The CVOA has two major advantages compared to other similar strategies. First, the CVOA parameters are already adjusted according to disease statistics to prevent designers from initializing them with arbitrary values. Second, the approach has the ability to finish after several iterations where the infected population initially grows at an exponential rate. The proposed CVOA was investigated with well-known optimization techniques such as the genetic algorithm (GA) and Harmony Search (HS) optimization. A multi-objective function was used to allow the designer to select the desired rise time, the desired settling time, the desired overshoot, and the desired steady-state error. Several tests were performed to investigate the obtained proper values of PID controller parameters. In the first test, the BLDC motor was exposed to sudden load at a steady speed. In the second test, the continuous sinusoidal load was applied to the rotor of the BLDC motor. In the third test, different operating points of reference speed were selected to the rotor of the BLDC motor. The results proved that the CVOA-based PID controller has the best performance among the techniques. In the first test, the CVOA-based PID controller has a minimum rise time (0.0042 s), minimum settling time (0.0079 s), and acceptable overshoot (0.0511%).

Under the current marketized coal and planned electricity price systems, barriers to price shifting between coal and electricity are created and conflicts between the two sectors are aggravated. The stable trading matching between coal mining and power generation companies is not only an effective means to resolve the conflict in the coal trading market, but also a ballast stone for price stabilization and supply guarantees in coal trading. Based on the two-sided matching theory, this paper starts from the micro market preference and matching willingness of coal mining and power generation companies, puts forward the conceptual framework of the pairwise stable matching of both sides, innovates a mechanism for trading between coal mining and power generation companies, and designs a stable trading matching algorithm. The algorithm has certain theoretical innovation significance from the matching problem of non-separable commodities to that of separable commodities considering the trading volume between coal mining and power generation companies. Furthermore, it is a complement and perfection of the existing coalCpower trading platform in its transaction mechanism and trading function. The results reveal that the trading relations between coal mining and power generation companies under the stable matching mechanism are resistant to disintegration and that the pairwise stable matching result is sensitive.","output":"Mechanism and Algorithm for Stable Trading Matching between Coal Mining and Power Generation Companies in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the respiratory system and the most common symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, and fever.

PROPOSAL Addressing calls in the literature, we introduce three examples of contemporary organizational theory which can be used to understand and operationalise change within medical education. These theories - institutional logics, paradox theory, and complexity leadership theory - are relatively unknown in medical education. However, they provide a way of making sense of the complexity of change creatively. Specifically, they cross-cut different levels of analysis and allow us to 'zoom in' to the micro levels as well as 'zoom out' and connect what is happening at the individual level (the micro-level) to what happens at a wider institutional and even national/international level (the macro-level), thus providing a means of understanding the interactions between individuals, teams, organizations and systems. We highlight the potential value of these theories, provide a brief discussion of the few studies that have used them in medical education, and then briefly critique each theory. CONCLUSIONS We hope that by drawing attention of readers to the potential of these management theories we can unlock some of the complexity of change in medical education, support new ways of thinking and open new avenues for research.","output":"Change is never easy: how management theories can help operationalise change in medical education."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic created new challenges in health care, and pathology departments have led with innovations in testing and education While the medical community and public showed great interest in gross and histologic findings in COVID-affected patients, paradoxically many autopsy services nationwide closed due to uncertainties surrounding the proximity to infected patient tissue, shortages in personal protective equipment, and pressures to discontinue perceived nonessential hospital operations These disruptions furthermore negatively impacted pathology trainee education The autopsy division at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, with the belief that a fully functioning autopsy service is especially crucial at this time, adopted a framework for continuing at full capacity for both clinical care and education New operations were modeled on national protocols by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the College of American Pathologists, and the service continually adjusted policies to reflect rapidly changing guidelines and feedback from trainees and staff Between January and December 2020, we performed 182 adult autopsies including 45 COVID-19 autopsies Twelve residents, 4 staff, and 5 attendings rotated through the service In exit interviews, participants expressed: (1) improved comfort managing both COVID-related and general autopsies;(2) sense of personal safety on service (despite the increased risk of exposure);(3) belief that both COVID-related and general autopsies contributed to their personal education and to the medical community There have been zero known autopsy-related COVID-19 infections to date We hope that our innovative autopsy service restructuring can serve as a framework for other academic programs during the current and in future pandemics","output":"A Framework for Maintaining a Fully Operational Autopsy Service at a Large Academic Teaching Institution During a Global Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of November 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases was increasing rapidly in many countries In Europe, the virus spread slowed considerably in the late spring due to strict lockdown, but a second wave of the pandemic grew throughout the fall In this study, we first reconstruct the time evolution of the effective reproduction numbers R(t) for each country by integrating the equations of the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model We cluster countries based on the estimated R(t) through a suitable time series dissimilarity The clustering result suggests that simple dynamical mechanisms determine how countries respond to changes in COVID-19 case counts Inspired by these results, we extend the simple SIR model for disease spread to include a social response to explain the number X(t) of new confirmed daily cases In particular, we characterize the social response with a first-order model that depends on three parameters &nu;1,&nu;2,&nu;3 The parameter &nu;1 describes the effect of relaxed intervention when the incidence rate is low;&nu;2 models the impact of interventions when incidence rate is high;&nu;3 represents the fatigue, i e , the weakening of interventions as time passes The proposed model reproduces typical evolving patterns of COVID-19 epidemic waves observed in many countries Estimating the parameters &nu;1,&nu;2,&nu;3 and initial conditions, such as R0, for different countries helps to identify important dynamics in their social responses One conclusion is that the leading cause of the strong second wave in Europe in the fall of 2020 was not the relaxation of interventions during the summer, but rather the failure to enforce interventions in the fall","output":"Intervention Fatigue is the Primary Cause of Strong Secondary Waves in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND To investigate the use of physical activity monitors (PAMs) for the elderly, the scientific literature should be systematically reviewed and the effect quantified, as the evidence seems inconclusive.

RESULTS: The estimated ratio of the rates of non-synonymous to synonymous changes (Ka/Ks) of SARS-CoV-2 was 1.008 or 1.094 based on 622 or 3624 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and nine key specific sites of high linkage, and four major haplotypes were found: H1, H2, H3 and H4.

The experimental and control groups performed balance training by using the newly developed Spine Balance 3D system and the well-known Biodex Balance System 30 minutes per day, three times a week for 7 weeks. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS), 10-m walking test (10mWT), Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), Functional Reach Test (FRT), the Korean version of the Fall Efficacy Scale-International (KFES-I), trunk muscle strength and stability were evaluated before and after 7 weeks of intervention.

Objectives: The aim of the present study was to explore this peculiar phenomenon, in order to identify people's emotions and cognitions during and after the process, and to better understand the possible psychological function cinema can have during moments of intense and generalized crisis like the present COVID-19 pandemic. Participants: Fifteen Italian adults took part in the study C eight women and seven men (average age = 30 years, SD = 10.54). Participants were recruited through social media via a specific announcement, and subsequently, through a snowball sampling. Method: For the present study a qualitative approach was adopted, and more specifically, the principles of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) have been followed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone or through online meeting platforms (Zoom or Skype). The written texts obtained from the transcription of each interview were analyzed using thematic analysis with the support of the software Atlas.ti, in order to highlight their fundamental contents. Results: From the data analysis, four main areas of thematic prevalence emerged, which reflected the participants' condition during the pandemic that actually led them to watch epidemic-themed movies or TV series: the need to document themselves concerning the theme of epidemics, the need to exorcize contagion anxiety, the desire to find a character with which they could identify, and the casual condition of finding a peculiar movie related to the theme of pandemics and being interested in it because of the striking resemblance with real life. Conclusions: The findings suggest that cinema could indeed represent a powerful tool to help people face the intense uncertainty of the new COVID-19 epidemic, since it allows spectators to both obtain more insight into the current situation, and to project their fears and uncertainties into the movie or TV series, thus reaching a sort of cathartic liberation that offers them hope toward the future.","output":"Catharsis Through Cinema: An Italian Qualitative Study on Watching Tragedies to Mitigate the Fear of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] During an immune response, cathepsin G (CatG) takes on the role of adaptive and innate immunity and the outcome depends on the localization of CatG.

Recent studies showed that XMRV is a recombinant mouse retrovirus; hence, its association with human diseases has become questionable. Here, we demonstrated that XMRV envelope (Env)-mediated pseudoviral infection is not blocked by lysosomotropic agents and cellular protease inhibitors, suggesting that XMRV entry is not pH-dependent. The full length XMRV Env was unable to induce syncytia formation and cell-cell fusion, even in cells overexpressing the viral receptor, XPR1. However, truncation of the C-terminal 21 or 33 amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of XMRV Env induced substantial membrane fusion, not only in the permissive 293 cells but also in the nonpermissive CHO cells that lack a functional XPR1 receptor. The increased fusion activities of these truncations correlated with their enhanced SU shedding into culture media, suggesting conformational changes in the ectodomain of XMRV Env. Noticeably, further truncation of the CT of XMRV Env proximal to the membrane-spanning domain severely impaired the Env fusogenicity, as well as dramatically decreased the Env incorporations into MoMLV oncoretroviral and HIV-1 lentiviral vectors resulting in greatly reduced viral transductions. Collectively, our studies reveal that XMRV entry does not require a low pH or low pH-dependent host proteases, and that the cytoplasmic tail of XMRV Env critically modulates membrane fusion and cell entry. Our data also imply that additional cellular factors besides XPR1 are likely to be involved in XMRV entry.","output":"Membrane Fusion and Cell Entry of XMRV Are pH-Independent and Modulated by the Envelope Glycoprotein's Cytoplasmic Tail"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an increasingly common condition observed in developing countries.

Host defense peptides (HDPs), previously known as antimicrobial peptides, are emerging as a group of promising antimicrobial candidates for combatting AMR due to their rapid and unique antimicrobial action. Decades of research have advanced our understanding of the relationship between the physicochemical properties of HDPs and their underlying antimicrobial and non-antimicrobial functions, including immunomodulatory, anti-biofilm, and wound healing properties. However, the mission of translating novel HDP-derived molecules from bench to bedside has yet to be fully accomplished, primarily attributed to their intricate structure-activity relationship, toxicity, instability in host and microbial environment, lack of correlation between in vitro and in vivo efficacies, and dwindling interest from large pharmaceutical companies.

Strategies such as residues substitution with natural and/or unnatural amino acids, hybridization, L-to-D heterochiral isomerization, C- and N-terminal modification, cyclization, incorporation with nanoparticles, and \\"smart design\\" using artificial intelligence technology, will be discussed.

Amid the pandemic, one simulation game, Plague Inc., has received substantial attention. This game has indirectly drawn greater public attention to public health issues by simulating pathogen transmission and disease symptoms. OBJECTIVE: Against this backdrop, this research investigates whether the gameful experience of Plague Inc. has indirectly affected public knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding COVID-19. METHODS: An online survey was conducted through social networking services in Taiwan from May 6-28, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 486 subjects participated in this study, of which 276 (56.8%) had played Plague Inc. This study had several findings. First, participants who had played Plague Inc. demonstrated higher levels of knowledge (P=.03, median 7, IQR 7-8) and attitudes (P=.007, median 8, IQR 7-8) than participants who had not played Plague Inc. (knowledge: median 7, IQR 6-8; attitude: median 7, IQR 6-8). Second, there was a significant correlation between creative thinking (&#961;=.127, P=.04) and dominance (&#961;=.122, P=.04) in attitude. Finally, there was a significant correlation between creative thinking (&#961;=.126, P<.001) and dominance (&#961;=.119, P=.049) in practice. CONCLUSIONS: Serious games highlighting the theme of pathogen transmission may enhance public knowledge and attitudes regarding COVID-19.

This in-vitro study (part 1) aimed to fabricate a novel mucoadhesive silver nanoparticle-based local drug delivery chip, evaluate its antimicrobial efficacy against P. aeruginosa, and its safety for the treatment of peri-implantitis. Materials and methods: Silver nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The local drug delivery chip was fabricated using gelatin, glycerol, silver nanoparticle solution (2.5 g/ml, 5 g/ml, 7.5 g/ml, and 10 g/ml), glutaraldehyde, and sodium alginate solution. These chips were evaluated for physical parameters, effect on viability of murine macrophage cell line J774A.1, and antimicrobial activity (using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method with 18 h incubation period) against P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Results: Silver nanoparticle antimicrobial chip exhibited dimensions of 4 mm  5 mm x 0.4 mm, 5.8 mg weight, pH 5-6, folding endurance 1.04, and one-year stability. P. aeruginosa was susceptible to  7.5 g/ml concentration of silver nanoparticles (spherical shape with particle size ranging from 10 to 100 nm).

Building on previous work to improve viral glycoprotein production in plants, we investigated the production of a soluble SARS-CoV-2 spike comprising the ectopic portion of the glycoprotein. This was successfully transiently expressed in N. benthamiana by co-expressing the human lectin-binding chaperone calreticulin, which substantially increased the accumulation of the glycoprotein. The spike was mostly unprocessed unless the protease furin was co-expressed which resulted in highly efficient processing of the glycoprotein. Co-expression of several broad-spectrum protease inhibitors did not improve accumulation of the protein any further. The protein was successfully purified by affinity chromatography and gel filtration, although the purified product was heterogenous and the yields were low. Immunogenicity of the antigen was tested in BALB/c mice, and cellular and antibody responses were elicited after low dose inoculation with the adjuvanted protein.

However, these approaches appear different from each other, so it is not clear how these seemingly different approaches can be combined for better performance. Inspired by the recent StarGANv2 for multi-domain image translation, here we propose a novel segmentation framework via AdaIN-based knowledge distillation, where a single generator with AdaIN layers is trained along with the AdaIN code generator and style encoder so that the generator can perform both domain adaptation and segmentation. Specifically, our framework is designed to deal with difficult situations in chest X-ray (CXR) segmentation tasks where segmentation masks are only available for normal CXR data, but the trained model should be applied for both normal and abnormal CXR images. Since a single generator is used for abnormal to normal domain conversion and segmentation by simply changing the AdaIN codes, the generator can synergistically learn the common features to improve segmentation performance. Experimental results using CXR data confirm that the trained network can achieve the state-of-the art segmentation performance for both normal and abnormal CXR images.","output":"Unifying domain adaptation and self-supervised learning for CXR segmentation via AdaIN-based knowledge distillation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hope is defined as to want or expect something to happen or be true.

Many outpatient encounters are now conducted virtually via telehealth. Whether virtual visit for HF results in similar type of interventions as when the patient is seen in person is not known. Methods Starting on March 15, 2020, all non-time sensitive outpatient in-person appointments at our institution were cancelled and transitioned to virtual appointments where possible. We included all patients seen in a tertiary care HF clinic from February 18 to March 13 (pre-Covid) and from March 16 to May 15 (post-COVID). We examined the volume of in-person and virtual visits and compared medication titration rates pre- and post-COVID. Results The study cohort included 745 patients, mean age 60.7+/-15.3 years, 65.2% male, 80.9% Caucasian, 7.7% Hispanic/Latino. Of these, 227 patients were seen pre-COVID and 518 post-COVID. All appointments were in-person pre-COVID. After the change, only 18% of appointments were in-person while 82% were virtual. Outpatient volume decreased after March 15, but gradually increased, eventually to volumes that exceeded pre-COVID (Figure). Detailed results on medication titration are shown in Table. Diuretic titration took place in 33/227 (14.5%) of patients pre-COVID and 83/518 (16.0%) post-COVID (p=NS). Among 567 patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), titration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) took place in 86/172 (50.0%) of patients pre-COVID and 159/395 (40.2%) post-COVID (p=0.03). Among the 395 HFrEF patients seen post-COVID, GDMT was titrated in 33/68 (48.5%) patients seen in person and 126/327 (38.5%) seen virtually - p=0.13. Barriers to medication titration in virtual visits were lack of blood pressure readings and lack of recent laboratory results. Conclusion Telehealth has become an essential method of outpatient care delivery for chronic HF. Once implemented, it offered efficiencies including improved access to the HF clinic thanks to higher throughput capacity compared to physical clinic space. However, we identified that GDMT titration took place less frequently than during in-person visits. Since it is anticipated that telehealth use will continue into the future, approaches to maximize GDMT in the absence of traditional direct physical contact with HF patients are needed.","output":"Virtual Outpatient Heart Failure Care - Lessons From the Covid-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Flexible laryngoscopy, the gold-standard evaluation of the larynx and the pharynx, is one of the most commonly performed procedures in otolaryngology.

It is also secreted by neutrophils in infection and inflammation sites. This glycoprotein possesses antimicrobial activity due to its capability to chelate two ferric ions per molecule, as well as to interact with bacterial and viral anionic surface components. The cationic features of Lf bind to cells, protecting the host from bacterial and viral injuries. Its anti-inflammatory activity is mediated by the ability to enter inside the nucleus of host cells, thus inhibiting the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokine genes. In particular, Lf down-regulates the synthesis of IL-6, which is involved in iron homeostasis disorders and leads to intracellular iron overload, favoring viral replication and infection. The well-known antiviral activity of Lf has been demonstrated against DNA, RNA, and enveloped and naked viruses and, therefore, Lf could be efficient in counteracting also SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this purpose, we performed in vitro assays, proving that Lf exerts an antiviral activity against SARS-COV-2 through direct attachment to both SARS-CoV-2 and cell surface components. This activity varied according to concentration (100/500 g/ml), multiplicity of infection (0.1/0.01), and cell type (Vero E6/Caco-2 cells). Interestingly, the in silico results strongly supported the hypothesis of a direct recognition between Lf and the spike S glycoprotein, which can thus hinder viral entry into the cells.

Anxiety can be seen as a manifestation of a nocebo context. The psychological stress of the COVID-19 pandemic led some people to experience COVID-19 symptoms, which were not actually related to a COVID-19 infection. A fundamental goal during the COVID-19 pandemic is to limit the COVID-19 related demand on healthcare systems and to minimize COVID-19 related deaths. This exploratory study aims to determine to what extent the anxiety in the population is related to the number of covid-19 related hospitalizations and deaths. METHODS We will quantify the magnitude of the relationship between population anxiety and hospitalizations / deaths. Anxiety will be assessed using the results of the most frequently used anxiety measuring scale. Official websites of governments will be screened to determine hospitalizations and deaths. Studies will be included if they had at least 100 respondents, used a validated anxiety scale, reported on the general population of a country, and were conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic. A search strategy will take into account the limited resources for this study and will be used to search Pubmed, MedRXiv and PsychRXiv. Screening will take place at two levels: abstracts and titles, followed by full text reports. One researcher will extract data which will be double checked by a second researcher. We will perform weighted OLS regression to quantify the relationship of anxiety and covid-19 related hospitalizations / deaths. DISCUSSION Covid-19 related measures can carry a significant social cost and risk of unwanted effects; it is therefore important to assess the extent to which anxiety in the population is related to covid-19 related hospitalizations or deaths. If anxiety can be properly reduced in the population, health care will be safeguarded. Thus, any strategy that reduces anxiety can then be included in evidence-based decision making.","output":"Is population anxiety associated with COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths?

Indole is widely used as a medical material owing to its astounding biological activities. Indole and its derivatives belong to a significant category of heterocyclic compounds that have been used as a crucial component for several syntheses of medicine. A straightforward one-pot three-component synthesis of indole, coupled with Mannich base derivatives 1a-1j, was synthesized without a catalyst. The products were confirmed by IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, mass spectra, and elemental analysis. The indole derivatives were tested for cytotoxic activity, using three cancer cell lines and normal cell lines of Human embryonic kidney cell (HEK293), liver cell (LO2), and lung cell (MRC5) by MTT assay using doxorubicin as the standard drug. The result of cytotoxicity indole compound 1c (HepG2, LC50-0.9 mum, MCF-7, LC50-0.55 mum, HeLa, LC50-0.50 mum) was found to have high activity compared with other compounds used for the same purpose.

Moreover, the extent to which these symptoms may be associated with neurological, pulmonary, or psychiatric difficulties is unclear. OBJECTIVE: This ongoing cohort study aims to carefully assess neurocognitive function in the context of the neurological, psychiatric, and pulmonary sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with asymptomatic/mild and severe cases of COVID-19 after remission, including actively recruited healthy controls. METHODS: A total of 150 participants will be included in this pilot study. The cohort will comprise patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection with either an asymptomatic course or a mild course defined as no symptoms except for olfactory and taste dysfunction (n=50), patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection with a severe disease course (n=50), and a healthy control group (n=50) with similar age and sex distribution based on frequency matching. A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment will be performed comprising nuanced aspects of complex attention, including language, executive function, verbal and visual learning, and memory. Psychiatric, personality, social and lifestyle factors, sleep, and fatigue will be evaluated. Brain magnetic resonance imaging, neurological and physical assessment, and pulmonological and lung function examinations (including body plethysmography, diffusion capacity, clinical assessments, and questionnaires) will also be performed. Three visits are planned with comprehensive testing at the baseline and 12-month visits, along with brief neurological and neuropsychological examinations at the 6-month assessment. Blood-based biomarkers of neurodegeneration will be quantified at baseline and 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: At the time of submission, the study had begun recruitment through telephone and in-person screenings. The first patient was enrolled in the study at the beginning of April 2021. Interim data analysis of baseline information is expected to be complete by December 2021 and study completion is expected at the end of December 2022. Preliminary group comparisons indicate worse word list learning, short- and long-delayed verbal recall, and verbal recognition in both patient cohorts compared with those of the healthy control group, adjusted for age and sex. Initial volumetric comparisons show smaller grey matter, frontal, and temporal brain volumes in both patient groups compared with those of healthy controls. These results are quite robust but are neither final nor placed in the needed context intended at study completion. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to include objective and comprehensive longitudinal analyses of neurocognitive sequelae of COVID-19 in an extreme group comparison stratified by disease severity with healthy controls actively recruited during the pandemic.

METHODS: Elderly (60 years or older) stroke survivors with depression were assigned into the PSD group, and elderly stroke survivors without depression and elderly healthy controls (HCs) were assigned into the non-depressed group. Urinary metabolite signatures obtained from gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomic platform were collected. Both univariate and multivariate statistical analysis were used to find the differential urinary metabolites between the two groups. RESULTS: The 78 elderly HCs, 122 elderly stroke survivors without depression and 124 elderly PSD subjects were included. A set of 13 differential urinary metabolites responsible for distinguishing PSD subjects from non-depressed subjects were found. The Phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, Phenylalanine metabolism and Galactose metabolism were found to be significantly changed in elderly PSD subjects. The phenylalanine was significantly negatively correlated with age and depressive symptoms. Meanwhile, a biomarker panel consisting of 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, tyrosine, phenylalanine, sucrose, palmitic acid, glyceric acid, azelaic acid and -aminobutyric acid was identified.

Initial velocity kinetic studies monitored the appearance of product ferric ions in the presence of catalytic quantities of cells. Cell-catalyzed iron oxidation obeyed the Michaelis-Menten equation with values for KM and Vmax of 71 M and 0.29 fmol/min/cell, respectively. Limited-turnover kinetic studies were conducted with higher concentrations of cells to detect and monitor changes in the absorbance properties of cellular redox proteins when the cells were exposed to limited quantities of soluble reduced iron. A single a-type cytochrome with reduced absorbance peaks at 448 and 605 nm was the only redox-active chromophore that was visible as the cells respired aerobically on iron. The reduced cytochrome 605 exhibited mathematical and correlational properties that were consistent with the hypothesis that oxidation of the cytochrome constituted the rate-limiting step in the aerobic respiratory process with a turnover number of 35  2 s-1 Genomic and proteomic analyses showed that Fm. acidiphilum could and did express only two a-type heme copper terminal oxidases.

The significance of these measurements is that they permitted a direct spectrophotometric examination of the extents and rates of biological electron transfer events in situ under non-invasive physiological conditions without disrupting the complexity of the live cellular environment. One thing is certain: one way to understand how a protein functions in an intact organism is to actually observe that protein as it functions in the intact organism. This paper provides an example of just such an observation.","output":"Oxidation of cytochrome 605 is the rate limiting step when Ferrimicrobium acidiphilum respires aerobically on soluble iron."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to explore metaphoric perceptions of patients with COVID-19 including treatment process, family relationships, and mental health via using metaphors.

Many lives are lost, the labor markets are affected and the people lifestyle are changed in order to limit the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. As of now, it seems that the COVID vaccine is the only solution for the world to be safe again. In the United Kingdom and the United States, many studies have been conducted on the sentiment analysis where the emotions of participants before vaccination and after vaccination are observed. The first batch of vaccines has been launched at the end of 2020 while some developed countries started early vaccination campaigns, and others are still in the process of ordering vaccines and remained unvaccinated until early 2021. The vaccinations are prioritized on the high-risk groups, such as medical workers and the elderly population. Vaccination for people under age 18 are still not available in the initial stage. Despite the executions of vaccinations, there are various opinions on whether the COVID-19 vaccines are safe, and a number of the population remain skeptical of taking the vaccine. In this research, we analyze tweets to understand public perception on the COVID-19 vaccine by classifying the sentiments and attitudes towards the vaccination and the available types of vaccine [1]. Social media is an appropriate source of research to analyze public attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine and what they feel about the various brands of the vaccine in the market. For this research, tweets written in two languages, English and Japanese, have been collected. In Japan, some related surveys on public willingness for vaccinations and the sentiment analysis are already conducted. This study randomly surveys on the users' tweets about COVID-19 vaccination and their emotions expressed in their tweets. Due to the certain vaccination accidents, people in various countries become more concerned about the side effects and safety of the vaccine due to local deaths of various circumstances and unknown causes. In an attempt to help assess and understand public sentiment towards the initial stage of the vaccination campaign, sentiment analysis tools are utilized. It can discover that there are different sentiment patterns observed in different regions and time points as well as in different vaccine brands. It is expected that the text categorization process will be conducted using NLTK's dedicated Twitter corpus. In social media data, users enter multiple punctuation marks, acronyms and emotions to express their emotions. TextBlob tool will be used for analysis, which computationally identifies and classifies text into three emotions: positive, negative or neutral. TextBlob is used because it processes data by including various letters, symbols, etc. in its dictionary. In this method, each word in the dictionary is based on whether it is positive or negative, while adding an emotional analysis of commonly used expressions. In this way, people's attitudes towards vaccines in the UK, the US and Japan can be analyzed. The accuracy of the method is 73.3% in English and 71.9% in Japanese. The results show that the British and Americans are more neutral and positive about vaccines, while the Japanese are more pessimistic about vaccines [2]. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Public Perception of COVID-19 Vaccine by Tweet Sentiment Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has posed significant challenges for health science librarians.

To explore the factors important in LSC-mediated resistance, we use mass spectrometry to screen the factors related to LSC chemoresistance and defined IFN--inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) as a candidate. We found that the GILT expression was upregulated in chemoresistant CD34+ AML cells. Loss of function studies demonstrated that silencing of GILT in AML cells sensitized them to Ara-C treatment both in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanistic findings revealed that the ROS-mediated mitochondrial damage plays a pivotal role in inducing apoptosis of GILT-inhibited AML cells after Ara-C treatment. The inactivation of PI3K/Akt/ nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway, causing reduced generation of antioxidants such as SOD2 and leading to a shifted ratio of GSH/GSSG to the oxidized form, contributed to the over-physiological oxidative status in the absence of GILT. The prognostic value of GILT was also validated in AML patients. Taken together, our work demonstrated that the inhibition of GILT increases AML chemo-sensitivity through elevating ROS level and induce oxidative mitochondrial damage-mediated apoptosis, and inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/NRF2 pathway enhances the intracellular oxidative state by disrupting redox homeostasis, providing a potentially effective way to overcome chemoresistance of AML.","output":"Targeting IFN--inducible lysosomal thiol reductase overcomes chemoresistance in AML through regulating the ROS-mediated mitochondrial damage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic causes significant strain on healthcare infrastructure and medical resources. So, it becomes crucial to identify reliable predictor biomarkers for COVID-19 disease severity and short term mortality. Many biomarkers are currently investigated for their prognostic role in COVID-19 patients. Our study is retrospective and aims to evaluate role of semi-quantitative CT-severity scoring versus LDH as prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19 disease severity and short-term clinical outcome. Results: Two hundred sixty-six patients between April 2020 and November 2020 with positive RT-PCR results underwent non-enhanced CT scan chest in our hospital and were retrospectively evaluated for CT severity scoring and serum LDH level measurement. Data were correlated with clinical disease severity. CT severity score and LDH were significantly higher in severe and critical cases compared to mild cases (P value &lt; 0.001). High predictive significance of CT severity score for COVID-19 disease course noted, with cut-off value  13 highly predictive of severe disease (96.96% accuracy);cut-off value  16 highly predictive of critical disease (94.21% accuracy);and cut-off value  19 highly predictive of short-term mortality (92.56% accuracy). CT severity score has higher sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values as well as overall accuracy compared to LDH level in predicting severe, critical cases, and short-term mortality. Conclusion: Semi-quantitative CT severity scoring has high predictive significance for COVID-19 disease severity and short-term mortality with higher sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy compared to LDH.

Aims To explore the patient characteristics and treatment patterns in those who were treated for HCV during the COVID pandemic. Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted at one site of utilizing the British Columbia Hepatitis C Network. Only patients included into the database were analyzed. Patients started on treatment between 03/17/2020-03/16/2021 were included as the pandemic group and patients from the 03/17/2019-03/16/2020 were included as a comparison pre-pandemic group. Data were extracted for clinicodemographic variables, laboratory investigations, treatment start date, regimen, and sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12). Results 97 patients were treated during the pandemic compared to 143 patients the year prior, representing a 32% decline. Patients treated during the pandemic were predominantly new referrals (n=70, 72% vs n=64, 45% pre-pandemic, p<0.01) and had fewer total appointments (median 2 per patient vs 4 per patient pre-pandemic, p<0.01). There was a median of 1 in-person visit and 1 telehealth appointment per patient during the pandemic (vs median 2 per patient of each type pre-pandemic). Pandemic patients were younger (mean age 56.0 years vs 59.6 pre-pandemic, p=0.04), and a greater proportion were on opioid agonist therapy (28% vs 13% pre-pandemic, p<0.01). Less transient elastography (TE) was performed during the pandemic (69% vs 89% pre-pandemic). Amongst those with TE scores, a lower proportion of those treated during the pandemic were cirrhotic (13% vs 21% pre-pandemic). During the pandemic, treatment patterns shifted towards more prescriptions for glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (56% of all prescriptions vs 44% pre-pandemic) and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (37% vs 29% pre-pandemic). There was slightly less use of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir at (2% vs 4% pre-pandemic). The proportion of patients who completed lab work for SVR was similar during the pandemic (n=83/97, 85.6%) compared to pre-pandemic (n=120/143, 83.9%). Similarly, SVR12 remained high during the pandemic at 98.7% (vs 99.3% pre-pandemic). Of all 97 patients prescribed DAAs during the pandemic, 92 (94.8%) completed treatment. Conclusions Less persons were treated during the COVID pandemic, which may deter progress towards HCV elimination targets. Very high SVR12 and treatment completion rates during the pandemic suggest that patients can be effectively treated with less pre-treatment investigations and fewer appointments.

Clinical data were collected and the general information, clinical symptoms, blood test and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. According to the relevant diagnostic criteria, the patients were divided into three groups: mild (15 cases), severe (9 cases) and critical (5 cases). The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers in the serum of each group were detected, and the changes of these indicators of the three groups were compared and analyzed, as well as their relationship with the clinical classification of the disease. Results: (1) The main symptoms of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was fever (28/29) with or without respiratory and other systemic symptoms. Two patients died with underlying disease and co-bacterial infection, respectively. (2) The blood test of the patients showed normal or decreased white blood cell count (23/29), decreased lymphocyte count (20/29), increased hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) (27/29), and normal procalcitonin. In most patients,serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was significantly increased (20/29), while albumin was decreased(15/29). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Tbil), serum creatinine (Scr) and other items showed no significant changes. (3) CT findings of typical cases were single or multiple patchy ground glass shadows accompanied by septal thickening. When the disease progresses, the lesion increases and the scope expands, and the ground glass shadow coexists with the solid shadow or the stripe shadow. (4) There were statistically significant differences in the expression levels of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and IL-6 in the serum of the three groups (P<0.05), among which the critical group was higher than the severe group and the severe group was higher than the mildgroup. However, there were no statistically significant differences in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;), IL-1, IL-8, IL-10, hs-CRP, lymphocyte count and LDH among the three groups (P>0.05).

Although detection of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater may be prompted with good recoveries during periods of high community prevalence, in the early stages of population outbreaks concentration procedures are required to overcome low viral concentrations. Several methods have become available for the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 from raw wastewater, generally involving filtration. However, these methods are limited to small sample volumes, possibly missing the early stages of virus circulation, and restrained applicability across different water matrices. The aim of this study was thus to evaluate the performance of three methods enabling the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 from large volumes of wastewater: i) hollow fiber filtration using the inuvai R180, with an enhanced elution protocol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation; ii) PEG precipitation; and iii) skimmed milk flocculation.

METHODS: We use a random-effects panel data model and a Difference-in-Differences in Reverse (DDR) model to examine how air and rail transport links with Wuhan as well as the suspension of these transport links influenced the development of the epidemic in China. RESULTS: We find high-speed rail (HSR) and air connectivity with Wuhan resulted in 25.4% and 21.2% increases in the average number of daily new confirmed cases, respectively, while their suspension led to 18.6% and 13.3% decreases in that number. We also find that the suspension effect was dynamic, growing stronger over time and peaking 20C23 days after the Wuhan lockdown, then gradually wearing off. It took approximately four weeks for this effect to fully materialize, roughly twice the maximum incubation period, and similar dynamic patterns were seen in both HSR and air models.

Eight female peafowl from one zoological institution were used. A control blood sample was obtained before administration of either 10 mg/kg (n = 4) or 20 mg/kg (n = 4) alfaxalone. Blood was collected at 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min after alfaxalone injection, with monitoring of sedation score, heart rate, and respiratory rate at each time point. Four peahens receiving a 10 mg/ kg dose had subjectively smoother inductions and recoveries, although sedation level was generally scored as low, with no adverse reactions noted. They were considered fully recovered by the 60-min postinjection time point, although measurable alfaxalone plasma concentrations remained present. Four peahens receiving 20 mg/kg IM experienced adverse effects including seizure-like episodes and hypersensitivity to stimuli throughout the study. This dosing group experienced prolonged recoveries consistent with high plasma concentrations (>3,000 ng/ml). Based on these results, use of 20 mg/kg IM alfaxalone as the sole anesthetic agent is not recommended in this species. Further studies should determine whether alfaxalone in conjunction with other anesthetic or analgesic agents could provide better sedation and smoother induction and recovery for peafowl and to assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alfaxalone in other avian species.","output":"PLASMA CONCENTRATION AND PHARMACODYNAMICS OF INTRAMUSCULAR ADMINISTRATION OF ALFAXALONE IN INDIAN PEAFOWL (PAVO CRISTATUS)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many methods have been used to model epidemic spreading. They include ordinary differential equation systems for globally homogeneous environments and partial differential equation systems to take into account spatial localisation and inhomogeneity. Stochastic differential equations systems have been used to model the inherent stochasticity of epidemic spreading processes. In our case study, we wanted to model the numbers of individuals in different states of the disease, and their locations in the country. Among the many existing methods we used our own variant of the well known Gillespie stochastic algorithm, along with the sub-volumes method to take into account the spatial localisation. Our algorithm allows us to easily switch from stochastic discrete simulation to continuous deterministic resolution using mean values. We applied our approaches on the study of the Covid-19 epidemic in France. The stochastic discrete version of Pand?sim showed very good correlations between the simulation results and the statistics gathered from hospitals, both on day by day and on global numbers, including the effects of the lockdown.

The aim of the study was to describe clinical and surgical characteristics of a group of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 who presented ALI in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic at Lima, Peru. METHODS: A multicenter, observational, and retrospective study was performed in six general hospitals, from March to July 2020. The variables considered were the pathological history and associated habits, laboratory tests, the severity of COVID-19 infection and ALI, the anatomic location of the lesion, treatment, evolution, and discharge conditions. RESULTS: Thirty patients with ALI infected with COVID-19 were evaluated. Their mean age was 60  15 years, the condition being more frequent in men (76.6%). The main comorbidities were arterial hypertension (33.3%), obesity (33.3%), and diabetes mellitus 2 (26.6%). There were 23.3% asymptomatic patients, and their only manifestation was ALI. Rutherford IIA and IIB stage included 93.2% of patients. The most frequent location of the thrombosis was the lower limbs (73.3% vs. 26.6%). Thrombectomy was performed in 76.6% of the patients, and amputation (primary and secondary) was performed in 30% of the patients. The mortality rate was 23.3%, all of it because of acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: ALI is a vascular pathology associated with embolic and thrombotic processes. COVID-19 infection can cause severe alterations in coagulation mechanisms, leading some patients to present severe acute arterial complications such as thrombosis, as the only associated manifestation.

Home health professionals face unique challenges related to preventing and controlling infections, which are likely to amplify during an infectious disease outbreak (e.g. SARS-CoV-2). Little is known about the current state of infection prevention and control-related policies and outbreak preparedness at U.S. home health agencies. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we conducted a national survey to assess infection prevention and control-related policies, infrastructure, and procedures prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Using a stratified random sample of 1506 U.S. home health agencies, we conducted a 61-item survey (paper and online) from November 9, 2018 to December 31, 2019. METHODS: Survey data were linked to publicly-available data on the quality of patient care, patient satisfaction, and other agency characteristics. Probability weights were developed to account for sample design and nonresponse; Pearson's &#967;2, Fisher's exact, t-tests or linear regression were used to compare the universe of agencies/respondents and urban/rural agencies. RESULTS: 35.6% of agencies responded (n = 536). Most home health personnel in charge of infection prevention and control have other responsibilities; one-third have no formal infection prevention and control training. Rural agencies are more likely to not have anyone in charge of infection prevention and control compared to those in urban areas. About 22% of agencies implement recommended guidelines when administering antibiotics. Less than a third (26.4%) report that their staff vaccination rates were higher than 95% during the last flu season. Only 48.1% of agencies accept patients requiring ventilation, and of those, 40.9% located in rural areas do not have specific infection prevention and control policies for ventilated patients, compared to 20.8% in urban areas (p < 0.001). Only 39.7% of agencies provide N95 respirators to their clinical staff; rural agencies are significantly more likely to provide those supplies than urban agencies (50.7% vs. 37.7%, p = 0.004). Lastly, agencies report their greatest challenges with infection prevention and control are collecting/reporting infection data and adherence to/monitoring of nursing bag technique. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we found that infection prevention and control was suboptimal among U.S. home health care agencies. Consequently, most agencies have limited capacity to respond to infectious disease outbreaks. Staff and personal protective equipment shortages remain major concerns, and agencies will need to quickly adjust their existing infection prevention and control policies and potentially create new ones. In the long-term, agencies also need to improve influenza vaccination coverage among their staff.

Hence, prophylactic and therapeutic strategies are promptly needed. In this study we report an epitope, ITLCFTLKR, which is biochemically fit to HLA allelic proteins. We propose that this could be used as a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-COV-2. A selected putative epitope and HLA-allelic complexes show not only better binding scores, but also RMSD values in the range of 0-1a??. This epitope was found to have a 99.8% structural favorability as per Ramachandran-plot analysis. Similarly, a suitable range of IC50 values and population coverage was obtained to represent greater validation of T-cell epitope analysis.

The Sabah state elections in Malaysia were used as an example for our proposed methodology and we investigate the event's spatial and temporal impacts on COVID-19 transmission. Results indicate an estimated (i) 70.0% of COVID-19 case counts within Sabah post-state election were attributable to the election's direct effect; (ii) 64.4% of COVID-19 cases in the rest of Malaysia post-state election were attributable to the election's spill-over effects. Sensitivity analysis was further conducted by examining epidemiological pre-trends, surveillance efforts, varying synthetic control matching characteristics and spill-over specifications. We demonstrate that our estimates are not due to pre-existing epidemiological trends, surveillance efforts, and/or preventive policies. These estimates highlight the potential of mass gatherings in one region to spill-over into an outbreak of national scale.

However, pain management is challenging because the pathophysiology of pain is complex and not completely understood. Widely used analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) have been associated with adverse events. Adverse event rates are of concern, especially in long-term treatment or at high doses. Paracetamol and NSAIDs are available by prescription, over the counter, and in combination preparations. Patients may be unaware of the risk associated with high dosages or long-term use of paracetamol and NSAIDs. Clinicians should encourage patients to disclose all medications they take in a \\"do ask, do tell\\" approach that includes patient education about the risks and benefits of common pain relievers. The ideal pain reliever would have few risks and enhanced analgesic efficacy. Fixed-dose combination analgesics with two or more agents may offer additive or synergistic benefits to treat the multiple mechanisms of pain. Therefore, pain may be effectively treated while toxicity is reduced due to lower doses. One recent fixed-dose combination analgesic product combines tramadol, a centrally acting weak opioid analgesic, with low-dose paracetamol. Evidence-based guidelines recognize the potential value of combination analgesics in specific situations. The current guideline-based paradigm for pain treatment recommends NSAIDs for ongoing use with analgesics such as opioids to manage flares. However, the treatment model should evolve how to use low-dose combination products to manage pain with occasional use of NSAIDs for flares to avoid long-term and high-dose treatment with these analgesics. A next step in pain management guidelines should be targeted therapy when possible, or low-dose combination therapy or both, to achieve maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity.","output":"Tramadol/paracetamol fixed-dose combination in the treatment of moderate to severe pain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research on tourism has gradually focused on the study of well-being, but relatively little attention has been paid to the psychological well-being of tourism practitioners.

Preventive and control measures have been adopted to reduce the spread of COVID-19. To date, the publics knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding COVID-19 across Bangladesh have been poorly understood. Therefore, it is important to assess peoples knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward the disease and suggest appropriate strategies to combat COVID-19 effectively. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the KAP of Bangladeshi people toward COVID-19 and to identify their determinants. METHODS: We conducted a country-wide cross-sectional telephonic survey from May 7 to 29, 2020. A purposive sampling method was applied, and adult Bangladeshi citizens who have mobile phones were approached to participate in the survey. Interviews were conducted based on verbal consent. Multiple logistic regression analyses and several tests were performed to identify the factors associated with KAP related to COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 492 of 576 Bangladeshi adults aged 18 years and above completed the interview, with a response rate of 85.4% (492/576). Of the 492 participants, 321 (65.2%) were male, and 304 (61.8%) lived in a rural area. Mean scores for knowledge, attitudes, and practices were 10.56 (SD 2.86), 1.24 (SD 0.83), and 3.17 (SD 1.5), respectively. Among the 492 respondents, 273 (55.5%) had poor knowledge, and 251 (49%) expressed a negative attitude; 192 out of 359 respondents (53.5%) had poor practices toward COVID-19. Mean scores of knowledge, attitudes, and practices differed significantly across various demographic and socioeconomic groups. Rural residents had lower mean scores of knowledge (mean 9.8, SD 3.1, P<.001) and adherence to appropriate practice measures (mean 4, SD 1.4, P<.001) compared to their urban counterparts. Positive and statistically strong correlations between knowledge and attitudes (r=0.21, P<.001), knowledge and practices (r=0.45, P<.001), and attitudes and practices (r=0.27, P<.001) were observed. Television (53.7%) was identified as the major source of knowledge regarding COVID-19. Almost three-quarters of the respondents (359/492, 73%) went outside the home during the lockdown period.

METHODS: A randomized, single-blind, group sequential, active-controlled trial was performed at JinYinTan Hospital, Wuhan, China. Between February 2020 and March 2020, 17 patients with critically ill COVID-19 were enrolled in our study. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ALA (1200 mg/d, intravenous infusion) once daily plus standard care or standard care plus equal volume saline infusion (placebo) for 7 days. All patients were monitored within the 7 days therapy and followed up to day 30 after therapy. The primary outcome of this study was the Sequential Organ Failure Estimate (SOFA) score, and the secondary outcome was the all-cause mortality within 30 days. RESULT: Nine patients were randomized to placebo group and 8 patients were randomized to ALA group. SOFA score was similar at baseline, increased from 4.3 to 6.0 in the placebo group and increased from 3.8 to 4.0 in the ALA group (P = 0.36) after 7 days. The 30-day all-cause mortality tended to be lower in the ALA group (3/8, 37.5%) compared to that in the placebo group (7/9, 77.8%, P = 0.09).

pediatric case of COVID-19 presented initially with gastrointestinal symptoms and then developed MIS-C with cholestatic hepatitis and synthetic dysfunction CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: An 11yo Caucasian male with no significant past medical history presented with fever, headache, and right-sided abdominal pain after multiple family members tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 Initial work-up was positive for Group A strep and SARSCoV-2 He was sent home with amoxicillin and directions to return daily for clinical follow-up and serial labs On Day 5 of illness he had marked elevation of D-dimer, new onset transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia He began Lovenox prophylaxis with transfer to tertiary care The patient remained febrile with decline in respiratory status by Hospital Day (HD) 2 Labs revealed increasing cholestatic hepatitis All liver tests came back negative except US which showed an echogenic, mildly enlarged liver with fatty infiltrate and no biliary dilatation, cholelithiasis, or cholecystitis Patient deteriorated on HD 4 with non-bloody diarrhea, hypotension, pulmonary edema, lactic acidosis, and oliguric acute kidney injury, prompting transfer to PICU On HD 5, he began Remdesivir therapy PICU course was complicated by immune-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy including maculopapular rash Supportive management stabilized him without the use of vasoactive medications, mechanical ventilators, or dialysis He received 5 days of IV steroids and IVIG On HD 12 he was discharged home with normal liver enzymes DISCUSSION: Gastrointestinal symptoms and abdominal pain are more prominent in pediatric COVID-19 patients at initial presentation and may possibly allude to development of more severe disease including MIS-C with cholestatic liver injury Elevated liver enzymes and coagulation dysfunction are seen in severe cases of pediatric COVID-19, although cholestasis has not been reported previously A correlation between abnormal liver function

spread through respiratory droplets, and wearing a mask correctly can effectively prevent the virus from spreading However, the current detection algorithms are based on unobstructed faces, which affects the detection task when wearing a mask To solve these problems, a facial feature detection algorithm based on Mtcnn+Mobilenet+GDBT in complex scenes is proposed First, it can detect whether to wear a mask and the fatigue state of the face Second, it can set different thresholds according to the facial characteristics of different people, and initialize the characteristics of different

of the product Then train a dataset of masks and feature points containing 708 images The experimental results show that compared with the traditional detection network, the new network can effectively detect facial features in the context of the epidemic The loss we adopt is Focal loss The lowest loss of net is 0 01 nearly The feature of this paper is that before the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, the relevant model only designed the detection method of whether or not to wear the mask On the basis of wearing the mask on the face, there is no research on the algorithm for judging the facial movements such as fatigue and drowsiness This work adopts a two-step method, using the mature face detection network mtcnn, first detects the face, and then sends it into the mobilenet network for classification and monitoring status This makes the model parameters smaller and the accuracy higher Even if it is divided into two steps, the lightweight network of mobilenet can run

Therefore, our team's innovation in fatigue detection based on facial occlusions such as masks has realized more dimensional detection, with stronger robustness and smaller limitations In the future, it can be used in areas with severe influenza virus, factories, and sterile environments It will be able to make judgments on the mask wearing conditions of on-site personnel through real-time images

diabetes mellitus (DM) due to COVID-19, which determines the high relevance of risk factor analysis for outcomes in DM patients to substantiate the strategy for this category of patients. AIM: To assess the effect of clinical and demographic parameters (age, gender, body mass index (BMI), glycemic control (HbA1c), and antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs, including ACE inhibitors and ARBs) on clinical outcomes (recovery or death) in patients with type 2 DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the Russian Register of Diabetes database was performed, including patients with type 2 DM (n=309) who suffered pneumonia/COVID-19 in the period from 01.02.2020 to 27.04.2020 and the indicated outcome of the disease (recovery or death) RESULTS: The percentage of lethality was determined to be 15.2% (47 of 309 people). The degree of lethality was found to be significantly higher in males (OR=2.08; 95% CI 1.1&ndash;3.9; p=0.022) and in patients on insulin therapy (OR=2.67; 95% CI; 1.42&ndash;5.02; p=0.002), while it was significantly lower in patients with an age &lt;65 years (OR=0.34; 95% CI 0.18&ndash;0.67; p=0.001) and in patients receiving metformin (OR=0.26; 95% CI 0.14&ndash;0,5; p&lt;0.0001), antihypertensive therapy (OR=0.43; 95% CI 0.22&ndash;0.82; p=0.009), &beta;-blockers (OR=0.26; 95% CI 0.08&ndash;0.86; p=0.018), diuretics (OR=0.4; 95% CI 0.17&ndash;0.93; p=0.028) and renin-angiotensin system blockers (ACE inhibitors or ARBs) (OR=0.36; 95% CI 0.18&ndash;0.74; p=0.004). A tendency to an increase in lethality at higher rates of HbA1c and BMI was present, but it did not reach a statistical significance. Differences between patients receiving insulin therapy and those who were not receiving the insulin therapy were observed as follows: a significantly longer duration of type 2 DM (13.4 vs. 6.8 years, respectively; p&lt;0.0001), worse overall glyacemic control (HbA1c: 8.1% vs. 7.0%, resp.; p&lt;0.0001), and three times more frequent failure to achieve the HbA1c goal by more than 2.5% (14.7% vs. 5.9%, resp.; p=0.04). CONCLUSION: The identified risk factors for lethality in patients with type 2 DM indicate that good glycemic control and previous treatment with metformin and antihypertensive drugs (including RAS blockers) could reduce the frequency of deaths. In patients on insulin therapy, a higher lethality degree was associated with worse glycemic control.","output":"[Diabetes and COVID-19: analysis of the clinical outcomes according to the data of the russian diabetes registry]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nipah virus (NiV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) possess two surface glycoproteins involved in cellular attachment and membrane fusion, both of which are potential targets for vaccines. The majority of vaccine development is focused on the attachment (G) protein of NiV, which is the immunodominant target. In contrast, the fusion (F) protein of RSV is the main target in vaccine development. Despite this, neutralising epitopes have been described in NiV F and RSV G, making them alternate targets for vaccine design. Through rational design, we have developed a vaccine strategy applicable to phylogenetically divergent NiV and RSV that comprises both the F and G proteins (FxG). In a mouse immunization model, we found that NiV FxG elicited an improved immune response capable of neutralising pseudotyped NiV and a NiV mutant that is able to escape neutralisation by two known F-specific antibodies. RSV FxG elicited an immune response against both F and G and was able to neutralise RSV; however, this was inferior to the immune response of F alone. Despite this, RSV FxG elicited a response against a known protective epitope within G that is conserved across RSV A and B subgroups, which may provide additional protection in vivo. We conclude that inclusion of F and G antigens within a single design provides a streamlined subunit vaccine strategy against both emerging and established pathogens, with the potential for broader protection against NiV.","output":"Combinatorial F-G Immunogens as Nipah and Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccine Candidates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Pandemics are claimed to result in certain stressors However, the potential psychological impact of a pandemic is often overlooked The current study aimed to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Jordanians and to evaluate the influence of the socio-demographic variables on this impact Method: The current study employed a descriptive cross-sectional design using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) via a web-based questionnaire The researchers utilized convenience sampling which led to a total of 2,854 participants from the 12 governorates of Jordan","output":"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic Among the General Population in Jordan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the outbreak of emerging infectious diseases, information dissemination dynamics significantly affects the individuals psychological and behavioral changes, and consequently influences on the disease transmission. To investigate the interaction of disease transmission and information dissemination dynamics, we proposed a multi-scale model which explicitly models both the disease transmission with saturated recovery rate and information transmission to evaluate the effect of information transmission on dynamic behaviors. Considering time variation between information dissemination, epidemiological and demographic processes, we obtained a slow-fast system by reasonably introducing a sufficiently small quantity. We carefully examined the dynamics of proposed system, including existence and stability of possible equilibria and existence of backward bifurcation, by using the fast-slow theory and directly investigating the full system. We then compared the dynamics of the proposed system and the essential thresholds based on two methods, and obtained the similarity between the basic dynamical behaviors of the slow system and that of the full system. Finally, we parameterized the proposed model on the basis of the COVID-19 case data in mainland China and data related to news items, and estimated the basic reproduction number to be 3.25. Numerical analysis suggested that information transmission about COVID-19 pandemic caused by media coverage can reduce the peak size, which mitigates the transmission dynamics during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Linking the disease transmission to information dissemination dynamics :an insight from a multi-scale model study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emotional intelligence is a main area in educational psychology and a key factor in the academic life of students. It deals with deviant behavior through self-awareness and self-motivation, regulates emotional and social skills, and converts emotional energy into positive energy. This study examined direct and indirect relationships between emotional intelligence and study habits in blended learning environments. Blended learning is conceptualized as a hybrid learning approach that combines online learning opportunities and the traditional classroom approach. Furthermore, the study explored the mediating role of cognitive engagement in the relationship between emotional intelligence and study habits. We used 26 items in a paper-based questionnaire in a quantitative study to collect data on emotional intelligence, cognitive engagement and study habits from health sciences students (N = 338) enrolled in blended learning courses in universities in the Hunan province of China. Emotional intelligence included self-awareness, self-motivation, and the regulation of emotion; social skills were also examined. A partial least squares structural-equation modeling approach was applied through SmartPLS software to explore the relationships. The results indicate that self-awareness and self-motivation have direct, significant, and positive connections with study habits. Similarly, the results indicate that all four dimensions of emotional intelligence (self-awareness, self-motivation, emotion regulation and social skills) had indirect, significant, and positive relationships with study habits using cognitive engagement as a mediator variable. It was concluded that students face higher-than-usual challenges in building study habits in blended learning environments during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that emotional intelligence helps them to develop their study habits to greater effect. Similarly, it was concluded that cognitive engagement strengthens the connection between emotional intelligence and study habits. Therefore, it is recommended that universities take specific measures to enhance students emotional intelligence and cognitive engagement, which will ultimately improve their study habits.

Insomnia is common in patients with COVID-19 admitted to mobile cabin hospitals. Insomnia may lead to immune dysfunction, a condition not conducive to recovery from COVID-19. The use of sedative-hypnotic drugs is limited by their inhibitory effect on the respiratory system. A paucity of research is available regarding psychotherapy interventions to improve insomnia symptoms among patients with COVID-19. In the general population, sleep problems are more common in women than in men; insomnia in women patients requires special attention. The aim of this study was to develop simplified-cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (S-CBTI) for patients with COVID-19 and comorbid insomnia symptoms and to verify its effectiveness through a self-control trial. A second aim was to compare the effectiveness of S-CBTI between acute and chronic insomnia among women with COVID-19 and comorbid insomnia symptoms in Wuhan Jianghan Cabin Hospital. METHODS: S-CBTI consisted of education on COVID-19 and sleep hygiene, stimulus control, sleep restriction, and self-suggestion relaxation training over a period of two consecutive weeks. Of 67 women, 66 completed psychological intervention and baseline and post-intervention assessments. There were 31 women with acute insomnia and 35 with chronic insomnia. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score and self-compiled sleep data were assessed at baseline and post-intervention, and subjective sleep evaluations were assessed at days 4, 7, 12, and 14. RESULTS: The ISI score, sleep latency, night sleep time, and sleep efficiency were statistically significantlly improved from baseline to post-intervention by paired T-test. After the intervention, the mean ISI score of the acute insomnia group was lower than that of the chronic insomnia group. The reduction of the ISI score and the improvement of sleep time from baseline to post-intervention in the acute insomnia group were greater than those in the chronic insomnia group. Utilization of sedative-hypnotic drugs in the acute insomnia group was less than that in the chronic insomnia group, and the difference was statistically significant.

Patients admitted after the onset of COVID-19 restrictions (March 16, 2020CJune 30, 2020) were compared with those admitted during the same period in 2019. We compared (1) rate of patients with GSW and (2) characteristics of patients with GSW, by period using (2) tests or Fishers exact tests, as appropriate. RESULTS: There were 6996 trauma admissions across the study period; 3707 (53%) in 2019 and 3289 (47%) in 2020. From 2019 to 2020, there was a significant increase in GSW admissions (4% vs. 6%, p=0.001); 4 weeks specifically had significant increases (March 16CMarch 23: 4%, April 1CApril 8: 5%, April 9CApril 16: 6%, and May 11CMay 18: 5%).

Increased immune and inflammatory responses, and procoagulant profile have characterized COVID patients. All these responses may induce endothelial dysfunction, myocardial injury, plaque instability, and AMI. Disease severity and mortality are increased by cardiovascular comorbidities.

Nonetheless, a significant reduction in patient admissions following containment initiatives has been observed, including for AMI. The reasons for this phenomenon are largely unknown, although a real decrease in the incidence of cardiac events seems highly improbable.

We report that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1, which activates the small GTPase Arf1 to induce COPI transport processes, is required for rotavirus replication since knocking down GBF1 expression by RNA interference, or inhibiting its activity by treatment with Brefeldin A (BFA) or Golgicide A (GCA) significantly reduce the yield of infectious viral progeny. This reduction in virus yield was related to a block in virus assembly since in the presence of either BFA or GCA the assembly of infectious mature triple-layered virions was significantly prevented and only doubled layered-particles were detected. We report that the catalytic activity of GBF1, but not the activation of Arf1, is essential for the assembly of the outer capsid of rotavirus. We show that both BFA and GCA, as well as interfering with the synthesis of GBF1, alter the electrophoretic mobility of glycoproteins VP7 and NSP4 and block the trimerization of the virus surface VP7, a step required for its incorporation into virus particles. Although a post-translational modification of VP7 (other than glycosylation) could be related to the lack of trimerization, we found that NSP4 might also be involved in this process, since knocking-down its expression reduces VP7 trimerizarion. In support, recombinant VP7 protein overexpressed in transfected cells formed trimers only when co-transfected with NSP4. Rotavirus, a member of the family Reoviridae, is the major cause of severe diarrhea in children and young animals worldwide. Despite the significant advances in the characterization of the biology of this virus, the mechanisms involved in morphogenesis of the virus particle are still poorly understood. In this work, we show that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1, relevant for the COPI/Arf1-mediated cellular vesicular transport, participates in the replication cycle of the virus, influencing the correct processing of viral glycoproteins VP7 and NSP4, and the assembly of the virus surface proteins VP7 and VP4.","output":"The guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1 participates in rotavirus replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Apps that enable contact-tracing are instrumental in mitigating the transmission of COVID-19, but there have been concerns among users about the data collected by these apps and their management. Contact tracing is of paramount importance when dealing with a pandemic, as it allows for rapid identification of cases based on the information collected from infected individuals about other individuals they may have had recent contact with. Advances in digital technology have enabled devices such as mobile phones to be used in the contract-tracing process. However, there is a potential risk of users personal information and sensitive data being stolen should hackers be in the near vicinity of these devices. Thus, there is a need to develop privacy-preserving apps. Meanwhile, privacy policies that outline the risk associated with the use of contact-tracing apps are needed, in formats that are easily readable and comprehensible by the public. To our knowledge, no previous study has examined the readability of privacy policies of contact-tracings apps. Therefore, we performed a readability analysis to evaluate the comprehensibility of privacy policies of 7 contact-tracing apps currently in use. The contents of the privacy policies of these apps were assessed for readability using Readability Test Tool, a free web-based reliability calculator, which computes scores based on a number of statistics (ie, word count and the number of complex words) and indices (ie, Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Reading Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index, and Simplified Measure of Gobbledygook index). Our analysis revealed that explanations used in the privacy policies of these apps require a reading grade between 7 and 14, which is considerably higher than the reading ability of the average individual. We believe that improving the readability of privacy policies of apps could be potentially reassuring for users and may help facilitate the increased use of such apps.","output":"COVID-19 Contact-Tracing Apps: Analysis of the Readability of Privacy Policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The paper tries to analyse empirically the impact of India's economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index on different macro-economic variables of India, like import, export, interest rate, exchange rate, inflation rate and stock market during pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 era. Design/methodology/approach Although there exist several works where relationship and volatility among the stock markets and macro-economic indicators during the COVID-19 pandemic have been estimated, but till now none of the studies examined the effect of EPU index on different macro-economic variables in the Indian context along with the stock market due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. This is considered a noteworthy gap and hence opens up a new dimension for examination. To get a clear picture, monthly data from January, 2012 to September, 2021 have been considered where January, 2012-February, 2020 is taken as the pre-COVID-19 period and March, 2020-September, 2021 as COVID-19 period. All the data are converted into log natural. The authors applied DCC-GARCH model to investigate the impact of EPU index on volatility of selected variables over the study period across a multivariate framework and Markov regime-switching model to examine the switching over of the variables. Findings The results of dynamic conditional correlation - multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (DCC-MGARCH) model indicates the presence of volatility in the dependent variables arising out of economic policy uncertainty considering the segmentation of the study period into pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19. The results of Markov regime-switching model show the variables make a significant move from low-volatility regime to high-volatility regime due to the presence of COVID-19. Research limitations/implications It can be implied that impact of EPU in terms of volatility on the Indian Stock Market will lead to unfavourable investment conditions for the prospective investors. Even, the different macro-economic variables are to suffer from the volatility arising out of EPU across a long time horizon as confirmed from the DCC-MGARCH model. Originality/value The study is original in nature. It adds superior values from the new and significant findings from the study empirically.

In the pre-cancerous state of cirrhosis, there is an accumulation of neoantigens that may be specifically targetable through immunotherapy. We asked if immune checkpoint inhibition could prevent tumorigenesis in a mouse model of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced HCC. We found that initiation of anti-PD-1 therapy prior to tumorigenesis could prevent up to 46% of liver tumors. This significant reduction in tumor burden was accompanied by infiltration of CD4+ T helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells into the liver parenchyma. Importantly, Anti-PD-1 therapy did not exacerbate liver dysfunction or worsen overall health in this liver disease model. Given the safety and preservation of quality of life observed with long-term immunotherapy use, an immunotherapy chemoprevention strategy is likely associated with a low risk-to-benefit ratio and high value care in select patients.

One variant may escape immunity elicited by another, and the delta VOC has been reported to escape beta elicited immunity (1). Systematic mapping of the serological distance of current and emerging variants will likely guide the design of vaccines which can target all variants. Here we isolated and serologically characterized SARS-CoV-2 which evolved from an ancestral strain in a person with advanced HIV disease and delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance. This virus showed evolving escape from self antibody neutralization immunity and decreased Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine neutralization sensitivity. We mapped neutralization of evolved virus and ancestral, beta and delta variant viruses by antibodies elicited by each VOC in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals. Beta virus showed moderate (7-fold) and delta slight escape from neutralizing immunity elicited by ancestral virus infection. In contrast, delta virus had stronger escape from beta elicited immunity (12-fold), and beta virus even stronger escape from delta immunity (34-fold). Evolved virus had 9-fold escape from ancestral immunity, 27-fold escape from delta immunity, but was effectively neutralized by beta immunity. We conclude that beta and delta are serologically distant, further than each is from ancestral, and that virus evolved in prolonged infection during advanced HIV disease is serologically close to beta and far from delta.

The proposed approach utilizes three different steps: pre-processing or pre-emphasis, feature extraction as well as classification to evaluate the patients affected by PTSD or not. The input speech signal is initially provided to the pre-processing phase where the speech gets segmented into frames. The speech frame is then extracted and classified using XGBoost based Teamwork optimization (XGB-TWO) algorithm. In addition to this, we utilized two different types of datasets namely TIMIT and FEMH to evaluate and classify the PSTD from the speech signals. Furthermore, based on the evaluation of the proposed model to diagnose PTSD patients, various evaluation metrics namely accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and recall are evaluated.

The reliable monitoring of respiratory rate (RR) is very important for the treatment and management of COPD. Based on inkjet printing technology, we have developed a stretchable and wearable sensor that can accurately measure RR on normal subjects. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation of stretchable sensors in the monitoring of RR on COPD patients. We aimed to investigate the measurement accuracy of our sensor on COPD patients. Methodology: Thirty-five patients (Mean  SD of age: 55.25  13.76 years) in different stages of COPD were recruited. The measurement accuracy of our inkjet-printed (IJPT) sensor was evaluated at different body postures (i.e., standing, sitting at 90, and lying at 45) on COPD patients. The RR recorded by the IJPT sensor was compared with that recorded by the reference e-Health sensor using paired T-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Analysis of variation (ANOVA) was performed to investigate if there was any significant effect of individual difference or posture on the measurement error. Statistical significance was defined as p-value less than 0.05. Results: There was no significant difference between the RR measurements collected by the IJPT sensor and the e-Health reference sensor overall and in three postures (p > 0.05 in paired T-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests). The sitting posture had the least measurement error of ?0.0542  1.451 bpm. There was no significant effect of posture or individual difference on the measurement error or relative measurement error (p > 0.05 in ANOVA).

As the pandemic evolves with no certainty of a herd immunity threshold, universal vaccination of at-risk populations is desirable.

Unfortunately, voluntary vaccination has been suboptimal among HCWs in the United States, a priority group for whom immunization is essential for maintaining health system capacity and the safety of high-risk patients in their care. Consequently, some health systems have implemented mandates to improve compliance.

Unlike daily disposable CLs, reusables require cleaning and disinfecting after every use, along with storage in a CL case. These additional requirements add a number of steps to the daily wear and care routine, increasing the opportunities for CL wearers to exhibit non-compliant behaviour. The impact of non-compliance ranges from poor lens comfort through to potentially sight-threatening infective keratitis. The coronavirus pandemic has refocused the profession on the importance of hand hygiene in particular, and the need for promoting safe CL wear in general. This review summarises typical non-compliant behaviour related to reusable CLs, and examines strategies and opportunities to better support wearers. Patient education has a central role in encouraging compliant behaviour, although patient recall of information is low, and personal belief systems may result in continuation of non-compliant behaviour despite awareness of the risks. CL care solutions are required for the daily disinfection of lenses, however misuse of multipurpose solutions (MPS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-based care systems can challenge their ability to be fully efficacious. Standard efficacy testing is reviewed, with consideration of how well current protocols model real-world use of CL solutions. Although some recommendations are in place for the inclusion of additional variables such as lens cases, CL materials, organic soil and efficacy against Acanthamoeba, opportunity still exists to reevaluate global standards to ensure consistency of testing in all markets.

Previous studies have investigated the clinical manifestations, histopathology, and to some extent, microbiological findings; however, these studies were either inconclusive or suggested that Enterococci, possibly in interaction with Escherichia coli, contribute to the aetiology of NNPD. This study examined ileal and colonic luminal contents of 50 control piglets and 52 NNPD piglets by means of the qPCR-based Gut Microbiotassay and 16 samples by 454 sequencing to study the composition of the bacterial gut microbiota in relation to NNPD. RESULTS: NNPD was associated with a diminished quantity of bacteria from the phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes while genus Enterococcus was more than 24 times more abundant in diarrhoeic piglets. The number of bacteria from the phylum Fusobacteria was also doubled in piglets suffering from diarrhoea. With increasing age, the gut microbiota of NNPD affected piglet and control piglets became more diverse. Independent of diarrhoeic status, piglets from first parity sows (gilts) possessed significantly more bacteria from family Enterobacteriaceae and species E. coli, and fewer bacteria from phylum Firmicutes. Piglets born to gilts had 25 times higher odds of having NNPD compared with piglets born to multiparous sows. Finally, the co-occurrence of genus Enterococcus and species E. coli contributed to the risk of having NNPD. CONCLUSION: The results of this study support previous findings that points towards genus Enterococcus and species E. coli to be involved in the pathogenesis of NNPD. Moreover, the results indicate that NNPD is associated with a disturbed bacterial composition and larger variation between the diarrhoeic piglets.

Selective macroautophagy/autophagy is the major way to clear protein aggregates in eukaryotic cells. While multiple types of autophagy receptors have been reported to mediate autophagic clearance of protein condensates with liquidity, it has been unclear if and how solid aggregates could be degraded by autophagy. Our recent work identifies the chaperonin subunit CCT2 as a new type of aggrephagy receptor specifically facilitating the autophagic clearance of solid protein aggregates, and indicates that multiple aggrephagy pathways act in parallel to remove different types of protein aggregates. In addition, this work reveals a functional switch of the chaperonin system by showing that CCT2 acts both as a chaperonin component and an autophagy-receptor via complex and monomer formation.","output":"A switch of chaperonin function regulates the clearance of solid protein aggregates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the source of COVID-19, causes numerous clinical findings including respiratory and gastrointestinal findings.

The first confirmed COVID-19 case in the region was reported on February 14, but what lies ahead in terms of the course and magnitude of infection remains speculative. To the best of our knowledge, no study, using a robust methodology, provides the immediate and long-term trajectory of COVID-19 for the entire region or accounts for its local context. This paper is the first systematic attempt to provide estimates on how many people would contract the virus and how many would die in the coming few months across Africa. Methods: The forecasts on caseloads and incidences are from a co-variate-based instrumental variable regression model. Fatality rates from Italy and China were further applied to generate mortality estimates after adjustments were made for differences in age-structure, health service quality, and living standards between each of the African countries and those of the reference population. We cover all countries that reported a confirmed case as of March 31, 2020. Results: By the end of June, 16,283,085 people will contract COVID-19 (95% CI 718,403 to 98, 358, 799). With a cumulative caseload of 5,413,4517 (95% CI 1,332,953 to 8,489,940) and 906,625 (95% CI 173, 821 to 4,742,917) Northern and Eastern Africa will respectively be the most and least affected sub-regions in the continent. Cumulative COVID-19 cases on June 30, 2020 are expected to reach 2,912, 864 (95% CI 465,028 to 18,286,358) in Southern Africa, 2,787, 913 (95% CI 517, 489 to 15,056,314) in Western Africa, and 1,185,742 (95% CI 229, 111 to 6,138,692) in Central Africa. New infections (incidence) for the month of April are expected to be the highest in Djibouti, 32.8 per 1000 (95% CI 6.25 to 171.77), while Morocco 1045 (95% CI 167 to 6,547) will register the highest number of deaths. Conclusion: Our study shows that countries that are least urbanized and have a low level of socio-economic development, hence least connected to the outside world, are likely to register lower and slower transmissions, at least at the early stage of the epidemic. However, the same set of enabling factors that worked for their benefit are likely to go against them in implementing interventions that have lessened the impact of the disease elsewhere.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic in the African continent: forecasts of cumulative cases, new infections, and mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: As the risk of infection in a pandemic is determined by both the individual's behavior and the object being interacted with, understanding how information-seeking behaviors and risk perceptions is critical for public health outcomes Materials and Methods: This study aimed to analyze interrelated digital footprint data on the internet between January 1 and May 1, 2020 in Turkey The first data were about search on measures to reduce the spread of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on Google The second data were obtained from web research using terms related to COVID-19 such as \\"Coronavirus\\" and \\"Koronavirus\\" on Google In addition, this study aimed to examine whether there was a correlation between Google search volumes on measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths Results: Until the virus was detected in Turkey, it is observed that many COVID-19 related web searches were conducted The apex point was seen around March 11, 2020, when the first case was announced in the country The continuous high search volumes about COVID-19 were 28 days from March 11 to April 8, 2020, and a diminishing trend in web searches was observed after April 8 A strong positive correlation was found between the search terms \\"Corona\\" and measures to reduce the spread of the virus On the other hand, there is a strong negative correlation between search volumes and the number of COVID-19 Conclusions: As countries endeavor to flatten the pandemic curve and reduce deaths and long-term restrictions, understanding how individuals respond to this situation has become more important than ever for the ultimate solution to the current crisis Therefore, authorities should further strengthen/raise national awareness of COVID-19 and keep the public informed","output":"The Effect of Public Awareness on the COVID-19 Pandemic in Turkey: Analysis of Google Trends Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. As evidence shows that vaccine immunity to COVID-19 wanes with time and decreases due to variants, several countries are implementing booster vaccination campaigns. The objective of this study was to analyze the morbidity and mortality burdens of different primary and booster vaccination strategies against COVID-19, using France as a case study. Methods. We used a deterministic, age-structured, compartmental model fitted to hospital admission data and validated against sero-prevalence data in France to analyze the impact of primary and booster vaccination strategies on morbidity and mortality assuming waning of immunity and increased virus transmissibility during winter. Findings. Strategies prioritizing primary vaccinations were systematically more effective than strategies prioritizing boosters. Regarding booster strategies targeting different age groups, their effectiveness varied with the levels of virus transmissibility, and according to the assumed loss of immunity for each age group. If the immunity reduction affects all age groups, people aged 30 to 49 years should be boosted in priority, even for low transmissibility levels. If the immunity reduction is restricted to people older than 65 years, boosting younger people becomes effective only above certain levels of transmissibility. Interpretation. Increasing the primary vaccination coverage should remain a priority to reduce morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. If a plateau of primary vaccination has been reached, boosting immunity in younger age-groups could prevent more hospitalizations and deaths than boosting the immunity of older people, especially under conditions increasing SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, or when facing new variants.

The primary outcome was to report the correlation of the different clinical pathological characteristics including the expression of epithelial-cadherin (E-cadherin) in invasive lobular breast cancer in Mexican women with recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: After 11 years of follow-up of patients with invasive lobular breast cancer, RFS was 89.4% and OS of 96.1%. The best prognosis in RFS was in patients with negative nodes 95.2% (P = 0.0001) and OS was 98.6-100% (P = 0.0001). Regarding tumor size, an RFS of 98.3% was observed in those measuring  2 cm (P = 0.0001) and OS of 99.2% (P = 0.0001).

METHODS Dogs were randomly assigned to one of two protocols: protocol 1 required the left ovary resected using SCUD and the right ovary using LVSD; protocol 2 required the left ovary resected using LVSD and the right ovary using SCUD. Duration of ovary excision, complications, surgical smoke production, and collateral thermal damage were compared between SCUD and LVSD. Total surgery duration, postoperative convalescence, obesity, mesovarial fat score, and technique-associated costs were also recorded. RESULTS Ovary excision was significantly faster with LVSD than SCUD. Surgical smoke production was significantly greater for SCUD than LVSD. Minor pedicle hemorrhage occurred 3 times with SCUD and one time with LVSD (not significantly different) and was easily corrected intraoperative. Presence of hemorrhage significantly increased ovary excision time. Technique-associated costs were lower for SCUD than LVSD. No significant differences were found in collateral thermal damage between SCUD and LVSD. Total surgery duration and convalescence time were similar to previous reports of Lap OVE in dogs at the authors' institution.

Adolescent patients expressed interest in using smartphone mental health interventions if they recognize them as helpful, relevant for their life situation and easy to use.

The current pandemic, followed by a nationwide emergency lockdown to slow the unprecedented spread of the virus, will have a serious impact on people living with visual disabilities and even endangers their lives in the long run. Many restrictive and control measures, including the adoption of new behavioural changes (for example, social distance during outdoor movement, limiting touch or tactile contact) recommended by the government will pose immense challenges to individuals with a visual loss. This serious impact, including challenges in healthcare access, can be minimized through inclusive service approaches, involving persons with visual disabilities, caregivers, family members, and healthcare providers, along with the community to a large extent, and finally, support to improve the overall outcomes. The government, along with profit or non-profit private sectors, should consider initiating such inclusive approaches while planning responses to the pandemic. Indeed, the present COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity for health care planners and decision-makers of various organizations across India for a reformation of disabilities care.

However, the substantial gains achieved since entry into force of MLC in August 2013 appear to have been severely dented by the COVID-19 global pandemic. The aim of the study was to examine, on a pilot basis, the disruptions and challenges to the observance of seafarers' rights to shore leave, repatriation and medical assistance as an immediate consequence of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The impact of COVID-19 on seafarers' rights was examined in three dimensions - shore leave, repatriation and medical assistance. Questionnaires were administered online from June to August 2020 to 450 seafarers, top 10 ship-management companies, 35 shipping companies and maritime administrations of top 5 seafarer supplying countries. The paper discusses the results of the survey. RESULTS: The research revealed a previously unknown majority preference for shore leave, that diminished sharply during COVID-19. Impact on work-performance and well-being of seafarers was revealed with only a fifth of the seafarers having willingly agreed to an extension of contract. This study revealed incidence rates at 6 months into the pandemic of several parameters - delayed repatriations (21.44%) that includes crew with contract extensions (12.48%), crew with completed contract awaiting repatriation (8.96%) and crew that had exceeded 12-month continuous service (0.82%). Compensation, if provided, is meagre and was affecting ratings the most. Deprivation of medical assistance was also revealed. CONCLUSIONS: The well being of seafarers would likely remain vulnerable to breaches, unless measures are put in place to safeguard the rights assured under MLC in the face of uncertainties caused by a pandemic such as COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 and seafarers' rights to shore leave, repatriation and medical assistance: a pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The TMPRSS protein serves as a host co-receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 and is present in both prostate and lung tissue. This protein is known to be androgen regulated in the prostate, however, there is conflicting data on whether it is also androgen regulated in the lung, an important site for COVID-19 infection. Two randomized controlled trials have shown 5a-reductase inhibitors (5aRI) reduced the severity of COVID-19 symptoms in infected men, and reduced the likelihood of hospitalization. In the present study, we assessed the effect of 5aRI use on risk of community acquired COVID-19 infection. METHODS: All men without prostate cancer included in an institutional prospective registry of all patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 8, 2020 and February 15, 2021 were included. Patients in the 5ARI cohort were matched at a 1:1 ratio to those not on 5ARI based on demographics and comorbidities that are known to increase the risk of infection. Exact matching was performed on race, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease and immune suppressive disease. The main outcome measures were the effect of 5aRI use on the rate of SARS-Cov-2 positivity and disease severity as measured by hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. RESULTS: 60,474 males without prostate cancer diagnosis were initially selected, of which 1,079 were on 5ARI (1.8%). The matched cohorts included 1,075 on 5ARI and 1,075 non-5ARI, aged 21 to 99 years (Fig. 1). Of all the demographics and risk factors none were significantly different between the 5ARI groups in the matched cohorts. Risk for SARS-CoV-2 was significantly lower in the 5ARI group (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69-0.97, p=0.024, Table).

Table 1: Patients characteristics [Image: see text] Table 2: Concomitant infections [Image: see text] METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of a single large transplant center was performed. Data of multiplex qualitative PCR-based respiratory viral panel (RVP) samples collected between January 2017 and December 2019 were included. It is important to mention that our institution generally performs the RSV/influenza rapid detection assay as an initial test; if negative, the multiplex PCR panel is usually done. We did not include results from the RSV/influenza rapid test in this study. RESULTS: One hundred transplant patients with a single positive RVP were included (table 1). Transplanted organs include kidney (40%), followed by lung (33%) and liver (9%). Most common presenting symptoms were cough (52%), shortness of breath (28%) and rhinorrhea (26%). Of note fever was seen in only 24%. Most common RVI was Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (RHV/ENT) (59%), followed by non-SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus (19%) and Parainfluenza (PIV) (14%). None of the patients had neutropenia, however, 52% had lymphocytopenia. Lung transplant patients developed LRTI in 70% of cases compared to non-lung transplant 64% (p=0.412). Multivariate analysis showed patients with PIV 3 were less likely to develop LRTI (p= 0.038). Significant Cytomegalovirus DNAemia (>137 IU/mL) was noted in 9.8% of the recipients. No proven or probable pulmonary fungal infection were noted within 3 months after diagnosis of RVI. Five patients were admitted to the Intensive care unit due to septic shock. Three patients died at 4, 5 and 35 days after diagnosis of RHV/ENT, PIV-3 and RHV/ENT respectively. CONCLUSION: Most of the cases of RVI were due to RHV/ENT. Patients with PIV 3 were less likely to develop LRTI. Lung transplant recipients developed LRTI with similar incidence to non-lung recipients.

Clinical and laboratory data were extracted to determine test performance characteristics and length of stay in the ED. Findings: Analysis of 1762 paired RAT/RT-PCR samples demonstrated an overall sensitivity of 75.5% (95% CI: 699-804) for the Abbott Panbio?

The authors assumed the consumption of foods containing salmiak (NH4Cl) was a common and peculiar cause of the reduced COVID-19 related death rates in these countries, because NH4Cl is a known lysosomotropic agent, which has been indicated to inhibit or prevent SARS-CoV infection. To check the possible effectiveness of salmiak consumption against COVID-19 related death, the authors used a linear regression model with the death rate as the dependent variable and BCG-policy and salmiak consumption score as independent variables.RESULTSUsing least squares regression and a robust standard error algorithm, the authors found a significant effect exerted by the independent variables (P &lt; 0.0005 for BCG and P = 0.001 for salmiak).

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe patterns of inpatient visitation policies during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and the communication of these policies to the general public, as well as to identify communication strategies that maximize positive impressions of the facility despite visitation restrictions. METHODS: We conducted a sequential, exploratory, mixed methods study including a qualitative analysis of COVID-19 era visitation policies published on Pennsylvania-based facility websites, as captured between April 30 and May 20, 2020 (ie, during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States). We also conducted a factorial survey-based experiment to test how key elements of hospitals visitation policy communication are associated with individuals willingness to seek care in October 2020. For analysis of the policies, we included all inpatient facilities in Pennsylvania. For the factorial experiment, US adults were drawn from internet research panels. The factorial survey-based experiment presented composite policies that varied in their justification for restricted visitation, the degree to which the facility expressed ownership of the policy, and the inclusion of family-centered care support plans. Our primary outcome was participants willingness to recommend the hypothetical facility using a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS: We identified 104 unique policies on inpatient visitation from 363 facilities websites. The mean Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level for the policies was 14.2. Most policies prohibited family presence (99/104, 95.2%). Facilities justified the restricted visitation policies on the basis of community protection (59/104, 56.7%), authorities guidance or regulations (34/104, 32.7%), or scientific rationale (23/104, 22.1%). A minority (38/104, 36.5%) addressed how restrictive visitation may impair family-centered care. Most of the policies analyzed used passive voice to communicate restrictions. A total of 1321 participants completed the web-based survey. Visitation policy elements significantly associated with willingness to recommend the facility included justifications based on community protection (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.24-1.68) or scientific rationale (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.12-1.51), rather than those based on a governing authority. The facility expressed a high degree of ownership over the decision (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.04-1.29), rather than a low degree of ownership; and inclusion of family-centered care support plans (OR 2.80, 95% CI 2.51-3.12), rather than no such support.

METHODS: Three truncated segments (S(1-291), S(277-794) and S(548-868)) of the S gene of PHEV and the NCAM gene were cloned individually into the Escherichia coli expression vectors and yeast two-hybrid expression vectors. The interaction between S(1-291), S(277-794), S(548-868) and NCAM were detected by a GST pull-down experiment and yeast two-hybrid assay. RESULTS: Three fusion proteins (S(1-291), S(277-794) and S(548-868)) were screened for their interactions with NCAM by protein-protein interaction assays. The results of these assays clarified that S(277-794) interacted with NCAM, while S(1-291) and S(548-868) did not. CONCLUSIONS: A small fragment (258-amino-acid fragment, residues 291-548) on the PHEV S protein was posited to be the minimum number of amino acids necessary to interact with NCAM.

Patient-reported anxiety, depression and sleep quality might have changed due to these special circumstances. Therefore, we analyzed the symptom burden of patients treated with palliative radiotherapy at our center. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective study was performed of 50 consecutive patients and the results were compared to those obtained in a previous pre-COVID study. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale was employed to assess the preradiotherapy symptoms. RESULTS The highest mean scores were reported for pain in activity (3.2) and dry mouth (3.1). Regarding anxiety, sadness/depression and sleep, the corresponding scores were 1.5, 1.2 and 2.7, respectively. Compared to the previous study, no significant increases were found. Most items had numerically lower mean values, e.g. anxiety (1.5 vs. 2.7). Both study populations had comparable median age (70.5 vs. 70 years), gender distribution and proportion of patients with bone metastases. However, there were two significant imbalances, namely a lower proportion of patients with prostate cancer (12 vs. 30%, p=0.02) and breast cancer (0 vs. 12%, p=0.02). CONCLUSION In patients who showed up for radiation treatment planning, the suspected increase in anxiety, sadness/depression and sleep disturbance was not demonstrable. It is not known whether or not patients with substantial worries chose to decline referral to palliative radiotherapy. Therefore, comprehensive large-scale studies of patterns of care are needed to fully understand the impact of COVID-19-related measures.","output":"Symptom Burden in Patients Treated With Palliative Radiotherapy Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The over-purchasing and hoarding of necessities is a common response to crises, especially in developed economies where there is normally an expectation of plentiful supply. This behaviour was observed internationally during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the absence of actual scarcity, this behaviour can be described as 'panic buying' and can lead to temporary shortages. However, there have been few psychological studies of this phenomenon. Here we propose a psychological model of over-purchasing informed by animal foraging theory and make predictions about variables that predict over-purchasing by either exacerbating or mitigating the anticipation of future scarcity. These variables include additional scarcity cues (e.g. loss of income), distress (e.g. depression), psychological factors that draw attention to these cues (e.g. neuroticism) or to reassuring messages (eg. analytical reasoning) or which facilitate over-purchasing (e.g. income). We tested our model in parallel nationally representative internet surveys of the adult general population conducted in the United Kingdom (UK: N = 2025) and the Republic of Ireland (RoI: N = 1041) 52 and 31 days after the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 were detected in the UK and RoI, respectively. About three quarters of participants reported minimal over-purchasing. There was more over-purchasing in RoI vs UK and in urban vs rural areas. When over-purchasing occurred, in both countries it was observed across a wide range of product categories and was accounted for by a single latent factor. It was positively predicted by household income, the presence of children at home, psychological distress (depression, death anxiety), threat sensitivity (right wing authoritarianism) and mistrust of others (paranoia). Analytic reasoning ability had an inhibitory effect. Predictor variables accounted for 36% and 34% of the variance in over-purchasing in the UK and RoI respectively. With some caveats, the data supported our model and points to strategies to mitigate over-purchasing in future crises.","output":"Pandemic buying: Testing a psychological model of over-purchasing and panic buying using data from the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The management of patients with COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome focuses on identifying the causes for respiratory failure and on following best practices for supportive care with oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation.

In this environment, obtaining a quantitative grasp of heterogeneous interactions of firms and customers, which have attracted interest of management scientists and economists, requires the analysis of extremely high-dimensional data. Existing approaches in quantitative research could not handle such data without any reliable prior knowledge nor strong assumptions. Alternatively, we propose a novel method called complex Hilbert principal component analysis (CHPCA) and construct a synchronization network using Hodge decomposition. CHPCA enables us to extract significant comovements with a time lead/delay in the data, and Hodge decomposition is useful for identifying the time-structure of correlations. We apply this method to the Japanese beer market data and reveal comovement of variables related to the consumer choice process across multiple products. Furthermore, we find remarkable customer heterogeneity by calculating the coordinates of each customer in the space derived from the results of CHPCA.

We investigated a dysfunctional phenotype of vascular endothelial cells in the lungs during COVID-19. METHODS: We obtained the lung specimens from the patients who died of COVID-19. The phenotype of endothelial cells and immune cells was examined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. We tested the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the endothelium using IHC and electron microscopy. FINDINGS: The autopsy lungs of COVID-19 patients exhibited severe coagulation abnormalities, immune cell infiltration, and platelet activation. Pulmonary endothelial cells of COVID-19 patients showed increased expression of procoagulant von Willebrand factor (VWF) and decreased expression of anticoagulants thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR). In the autopsy lungs of COVID-19 patients, the number of macrophages, monocytes, and T cells was increased, showing an activated phenotype. Despite increased immune cells, adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, and P-selectin were downregulated in pulmonary endothelial cells of COVID-19 patients. Notably, decreased thrombomodulin expression in endothelial cells was associated with increased immune cell infiltration in the COVID-19 patient lungs. There were no SARS-CoV-2 particles detected in the lung endothelium of COVID-19 patients despite their dysfunctional phenotype. Meanwhile, the autopsy lungs of COVID-19 patients showed SARS-CoV-2 virions in damaged alveolar epithelium and evidence of hypoxic injury. INTERPRETATION: Pulmonary endothelial cells become dysfunctional during COVID-19, showing a loss of thrombomodulin expression related to severe thrombosis and infiltration, and endothelial cell dysfunction might be caused by a pathologic condition in COVID-19 patient lungs rather than a direct infection with SARS-CoV-2.

We created three vulnerability indices to identify areas and people who require greater support while elucidating health inequities to inform emergency response in Kenya. METHODS: Geospatial indicators were assembled to create three vulnerability indices; Social VulnerabilityIndex (SVI), Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (EVI) and a composite of the two, that is, Social Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (SEVI) resolved at 295 subcounties in Kenya. SVI included 19 indicators that affect the spread of disease; socioeconomic deprivation, access to services and population dynamics, whereas EVI comprised 5 indicators describing comorbidities associated with COVID-19 severe disease progression. The indicators were scaled to a common measurement scale, spatially overlaid via arithmetic mean and equally weighted. The indices were classified into seven classes, 1C2 denoted low vulnerability and 6C7, high vulnerability. The population within vulnerabilities classes was quantified. RESULTS: The spatial variation of each index was heterogeneous across Kenya. Forty-nine northwestern and partly eastern subcounties (6.9 million people) were highly vulnerable, whereas 58 subcounties (9.7 million people) in western and central Kenya were the least vulnerable for SVI. For EVI, 48 subcounties (7.2 million people) in central and the adjacent areas and 81 subcounties (13.2 million people) in northern Kenya were the most and least vulnerable, respectively. Overall (SEVI), 46 subcounties (7.0 million people) around central and southeastern were more vulnerable, whereas 81 subcounties (14.4 million people) were least vulnerable. CONCLUSION: The vulnerability indices created are tools relevant to the county, national government and stakeholders for prioritisation and improved planning.

People with close contact with animals are at high risk for contracting and transmitting the zoonotic diseases. OBJECTIVES: To determine health literacy of livestock farmers toward biosecurity to prevent zoonotic diseases. METHODS: This cross-sectional mixed-methods study was conducted in Thai Nguyen Province, Vietnam, where livestock and farming are the main occupation. The questionnaire survey was submitted to 218 farmers who have close contact with livestock. In addition, 8 farmers were invited to an in-depth interview to further explore the health literacy. RESULTS: Half of the participants were men. The average age (standard deviation) of the participants was 49.3(11.5) years. The median years with experience in farming was 15 years. The majority (82.0%) of the participants had moderate health literacy level regarding zoonoses. Improper use of antibiotics was referred by 58.0% of participants, including antibiotic use as feeding supplements (34.0%) and the use of human antibiotics to treat sick animals (24.0%). Many participants were unaware of zoonotic prevention measures and due to this had practices such as not wearing protective equipment (60.0%), an absence of acaricides to prevent vector infestations (52.0%), an absence of disinfection measures (42.0%), low rate of rabies vaccination (54.0%), and do not quarantining sick animals (38.0%). In-depth interviews revealed great concern among farmers about a collective lack of participation from local veterinarians, health workers, and government authorities in zoonoses-prevention efforts. Statistical models showed that farm scale, ethnic groups, and perceived income were associated with the overall health literacy about zoonoses. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive health education related to zoonotic diseases is recommended to improve overall knowledge, including routes of transmission, symptoms and consequences of diseases, and antibiotic usage. In addition, guidance should be provided to farmers on how to treat sick animals, the appropriate use of antibiotics, and waste management.

This immediate clinical driver, combined with the general quest for more personalised health data, means that pulse oximetry measurement of capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) will likely expand into both the clinical and consumer market of wearable health technology in the near future. In this study, we set out to establish the feasibility of SpO2 measurement from the ear canal as a convenient site for long term monitoring, and perform a comprehensive comparison with the right index finger - the conventional clinical measurement site. During resting SpO2 estimation, we found a root mean square difference of 1.47% between the two measurement sites, with a mean difference of 0.23% higher SpO2 in the right ear canal. Through the simultaneous recording of pulse oximetry from both the right ear canal and index finger during breath holds, we observe a substantial improvement in response time between the ear and finger that has a mean of 12.4 seconds and a range of 4.2 - 24.2 seconds across all subjects. Factors which influence this response time, termed SpO2 delay, such as the sex of a subject are also explored. Furthermore, we examine the potential downsides of ear canal blood oxygen saturation measurement, namely the lower photoplethysmogram amplitude, and suggest ways to mitigate this disadvantage. These results are presented in conjunction with previously discovered benefits such as robustness to temperature, making the case for measurement of SpO2 from the ear canal being both convenient and superior to conventional finger measurement sites for continuous non-intrusive long term monitoring in both clinical and everyday-life settings.","output":"In-Ear Measurement of Blood Oxygen Saturation: An Ambulatory Tool Needed To Detect The Delayed Life-Threatening Hypoxaemia in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nurses hold pivotal role during COVID-19 pandemic through providing care toward the infected patients.

To better understand how these SARS-CoV-2 lineage turnovers occurred in Brazil, we analyzed 11,724 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes of samples collected in different country regions between September 2020 and April 2021. Our findings indicate that the spatial dispersion of both variants in Brazil was driven by short and long-distance viral transmission. The lineage P.2 harboring Spike mutation E484K probably emerged around late July 2020 in the Rio de Janeiro (RJ) state, which contributed with most ([~]50%) inter-state viral disseminations, and only became locally established in most Brazilian states by October 2020. The VOC Gamma probably arose in November 2020 in the Amazonas (AM) state, which was responsible for 60-70% of the inter-state viral dissemination, and the earliest timing of community transmission of this VOC in many Brazilian states was already traced to December 2020. We estimate that variant Gamma was 1.56-3.06 more transmissible than variant P.2 co-circulating in RJ and that the median effective reproductive number (Re) of Gamma in RJ and SP states (Re = 1.59-1.91) was lower than in AM (Re = 3.55). In summary, although the epicenter of the lineage P.2 dissemination in Brazil was the heavily interconnected Southeastern region, it displayed a slower rate of spatial spread than the VOC Gamma originated in the more isolated Northern Brazilian region.

The aim of this study was to analyse the incidence of infectious events in patients with IBD and the association to concomitant medical therapy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective medical chart review of patients with IBD aged 18C65 years included in the Swedish Registry of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in the catchment area of Ume? University Hospital, Sweden. Data were collected from the period 01 January 2006, to 31 January 2019. An infectious event was defined as an outpatient prescription of antimicrobials or a positive diagnostic test for infection. RESULTS: During a period of 5,120 observation-years, we observed 1,394 events in 593 patients. The mean number of infectious events per 100 person-years was 27.2 (standard deviation [SD]: 0.46). There were no differences in mean incidence rates between patients treated with no immunosuppression (23.0 events per 100 person-years, SD: 50.4), patients treated with IM monotherapy (27.6 events per 100 person-years, SD: 49.9), patients treated with anti-TNF monotherapy (34.3 events per 100 person-years, SD: 50.1) and patients on combination therapy (22.5 events per 100-person-years, SD: 44.2).

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. We previously identified a novel lncRNA signature related to immunity and progression in bladder cancer. Here we further explored the function of RP11-89, a lncRNA discovered in the previous signature. Loss- and gain-of function experiments were performed using CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, Transwell assays, scratch tests and subcutaneous nude mouse models. High-throughput RNA sequencing was conducted to identify dysregulated genes in bladder cancer cells with RP11-89 knockdown or overexpression. Regulation of RP11-89 on miR-129-5p and PROM2 was explored through luciferase reporter assay, RIP assay and RNA pull-down assay. RP11-89 promoted cell proliferation, migration and tumorigenesis and inhibited cell cycle arrest via the miR-129-5p/PROM2 axis. We found that RP11-89 sponges miR-129-5p and upregulates PROM2. Elevated PROM2 in cells was associated with attenuated ferroptosis through iron export, formation of multivesicular bodies and less mitochondrial abnormalities. We demonstrated that RP11-89 is a novel tumorigenic regulator that inhibits ferroptosis via PROM2-activated iron export.

Recent studies propose an active role of coagulation disorders in disease progression. This hypercoagulability has been displayed by marked increase in D-dimer in hospitalized patients. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, generation of cytokine storm, the interdependence between inflammation and coagulation, its consequences and the possible management options for coagulation complications like venous thromboembolism (VTE), microthrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and systemic and local coagulopathy. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for relevant reports using COVID-19, cytokine storm, and coagulation as keywords. EXPERT OPINION: A prophylactic dose of 5000C7500 units of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been recommended for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in order to prevent VTE. Treatment dose of LMWH, based on disease severity, is being contemplated for patients showing a marked rise in levels of D-dimer due to possible pulmonary thrombi.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, is causing the greatest global social and economic disruption since world war II. Lack of a vaccine, lack of successful treatment and limitations of the healthcare workforce and resources needed to safeguard patients with severe COVID-19 on the edge of life, demands radical preventive measures.

The TLR9 COVID-19 hypothesis describes a mechanism of action that could explain a wide spectrum of manifestations observed in patients with severe COVID-19. The introduced hypothesis proposes biomarkers for identification of vulnerable individuals and positions TLR9 as a promising multifaceted intervention target for prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19. TLR9 agonists might have value as prophylactic vaccine adjuvants and therapeutic immune stimulators at the early onset of disease. Additionally, in this current manuscript it is proposed for the first time that TLR9 could be considered as a target of inhibition aimed to dampen hyperinflammation and thrombotic complications in vulnerable patients that are at risk of developing late stages of COVID-19.

These structures are highly dependent on cholesterol. Hence, this study investigates the impact of HEV on cholesterol-metabolism, the effect of intracellular cholesterol content on HEV-release and the potential of cholesterol-modulators to serve as antivirals. METHODS: Intracellular cholesterol-content of cells was modulated and impacts on HEV were monitored using qPCR, Western blot, microscopy, virus-titration and density-gradient centrifugation. Blood-lipids and HEV-RNA were routinely quantified in chronically infected patients during follow-up visits. RESULTS: In HEV-infected cells, decreased levels of cholesterol are found. In patients, HEV infection decreases serum-lipid concentrations. Importantly, statin treatment herein increases viral titers. Similarly, reduction of intracellular cholesterol via simvastatin treatment increases viral release in vitro. On the contrary, elevating intracellular cholesterol via LDL or 25-hydroxycholesterol strongly reduces viral release due to enhanced lysosomal degradation of HEV. Drug-induced elevation of intracellular cholesterol via fenofibrate or PSC833 impairs HEV release via the same mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: This study analyses the crosstalk between HEV and intracellular cholesterol. The results highlight the importance of an intact cholesterol homeostasis for HEV-release and thereby identify a potential target for antiviral strategies. Especially fenofibrate is considered a promising novel antiviral against HEV.

The majority of incarcerated women are mothers. Their children represent a particularly vulnerable group, often subject to adverse experiences due to their family's disadvantaged circumstances involving inadequate housing, food insecurity, poverty, poor health, a lack of personal safety due to violence and resulting trauma. This qualitative study explores parenting experiences of incarcerated mothers separated from their children. Interviews involved 65 mothers in three Australian prisons and 19 stakeholders providing correctional services and support for incarcerated women. Data were analysed using interpretive description. Mothers' accounts highlighted frustrations resulting from trying to maintain relationships with their children, often exacerbating their separation and compounding parenting difficulties. Two major themes emerged from the data: 'protecting their children' and 'at the mercy of the system'. Mothers described how they tried to protect their children from the consequences of their incarceration, yet many of the correctional system processes and procedures made it even harder to maintain connection. Incarcerated mothers need support in their parenting role. Ideally, this support should commence during incarceration. Further, changes within prison routines could enhance mothers' efforts to keep in contact with their children, through visits and phone calls.","output":"Maternal incarceration: Impact on parent-child relationships."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Microvascular abnormalities and impaired 129Xe gas transfer have been observed in patients with COVID 19. The progression of pathophysiological pulmonary changes during the post acute period in these patients remains unclear. Methods: Patients who were hospitalised due to COVID 19 pneumonia underwent a pulmonary 1H and 129Xe MRI protocol at 6, 12, 25 and 50 weeks after hospital admission. The imaging protocol included: ultra short echo time, dynamic contrast enhanced lung perfusion, 129Xe lung ventilation, 129Xe diffusion weighted and 129Xe 3D spectroscopic imaging of gas exchange. Results: 9 patients were recruited and underwent MRI at 6 (n=9), 12 (n=9), 25 (n=6) and 50 (n=3) weeks after hospital admission. At 6 weeks after hospital admission, patients demonstrated impaired 129Xe gas transfer (RBC:M) but normal lung microstructure (ADC, LmD). Minor ventilation abnormalities present in four patients were largely resolved in the 6 to 25 week period. At 12 week follow up, all patients with lung perfusion data available (n=6) showed an increase in both pulmonary blood volume and flow when compared to 6 weeks, though this was not statistically significant. At 12 and 25 week follow up, significant improvements in 129Xe gas transfer were observed compared to 6 week examinations, however 129Xe gas transfer remained abnormally low. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that multinuclear MRI is sensitive to functional pulmonary changes in the follow up of patients who were hospitalised with COVID 19.

The interaction between COVID-19 and the drop in economic activity will lead to increased food insecurity within and across countries. Higher food insecurity may act as a multiplier for the epidemic due to its negative health effects and increased migration. Research has shown that food insecurity affects within-country and cross-border migration. Besides the mean prevalence rate, the distribution of food insecurity affects the migration decision. The impacts of COVID-19 are particularly strong for people in the lower tail of the food-insecurity distribution. In the current context, the effect of food insecurity therefore could be increased migration, including both rural-urban migration and international migration. Importantly, the crisis might lead to a structural break in migration patterns. People might avoid heavily affected COVID-19 destination countries (e.g., United States, Italy, or Spain) and move to other countries.

Factor replacement, eliminating HIV and hepatitis C transmission, and more recently, longer-acting coagulation factors and immune treatments play a role in allowing patients with hemophilia to experience a longer and healthier life. Previous studies show that invasive procedures like colonoscopies, bronchoscopies or biopsies can safely be performed in patients with hemophilia if an appropriate factor replacement is given. However, because of their risk of bleeding, patients with hemophilia may be reluctant to undergo such invasive procedures or get recommended health maintenance, and these fears may have been worsened by the outbreak of COVID19. Therefore, we wondered if older patients with hemophilia have been impacted by the COVID19 pandemic and have received the recommended vaccinations and cancer screenings. METHODS: The data for this study originates in the hemophilia clinics of two academic centers in Kentucky (University of Louisville and University of Kentucky). IRB approval was obtained in both institutions. Surveys were mailed or emailed to patients 50 years of age or older in our database. Follow-up phone calls were made to patients who did not respond. The surveys had 17 health related questions focusing on general well-being, pain, smoking, cancer screening, vaccinations and COVID19. The original survey was performed between 11/2020 and 3/2021 and COVID19 vaccination status was updated in 7/2021. Overall, 50 patients in our database met the study criteria (hemophilia and age 50 years or older) and 36 responded (72%). Some patients did not answer all questions. Patient details are given in Table 1. Median age was 61 years, most patients had mild to moderate hemophilia, three patients were positive for HIV (all with a negative viral load), and 12 had been infected with hepatitis C. Questions related to the impact of COVID19 explored anxiety of leaving the house, meeting with other people, availability of medical appointments, and getting necessary medications. Patients were asked if they received an influenza vaccination and, if older than 60 years, if they had received a pneumonia vaccination. RESULTS: Overall, most patients reported a good quality of life (Table 2). Nevertheless, most were often or always in pain. About half of the patients were on opioid pain medication. A minority took only over the counter pain medication or no pain medication. 57% of respondents had received both vaccinations for COVID19, two-thirds of the unvaccinated planned to get it. 55% of respondents had undergone a colonoscopy in the previous 5 years. Only 18% identified themselves as current smokers. Few men had undergone screening for prostate cancer. Finally, 5 of 32 patients reported a previous diagnosis of cancer (3 patients with localized skin cancer, 2 patients with head and neck cancers). CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life in patients with hemophilia is self-reported as good or excellent in most older patients. However, chronic pain problems persist and are not always sufficiently controlled. One reason may be that many of our patients did not have consistent factor replacements early in their life. Only a minority of patients reported a psychological or physical impact of the COVID19 lockdown. Most patients as of June or July 2021 have been vaccinated against COVID19, however this is probably lower than in an age-matched group. Mayo Clinic's vaccine tracker reported a vaccination rate of 92.3% for the 65 and older age group in Kentucky (as of July 31 st of 2021). The rate of influenza vaccination is probably comparable to rates in other rural communities. The same applies to cancer screening by colonoscopy and PSA screening. The rate of smoking of 18% is relatively low but may suffer from under-reporting. Overall, health maintenance in older patients with hemophilia appears acceptable but can certainly be improved. Limitations of our study are small sample size and that most patients have mild to moderate hemophilia. We plan to expand our study to other centers to get more insight into health issues in older patients with hemophilia.

Thus, it is a potential target for designing and developing antiviral agents. Inhibition of RBD activity of the S protein may be achieved by blocking RBD interaction with hACE2. In this context, inhibitors with large contact surface area are preferable as they can form a potentially stable complex with RBD of S protein and would not allow RBD to come in contact with hACE2. Peptides represent excellent features as potential anti-RBD agents due to better efficacy, safety, and tolerability in humans compared to that of small molecules. The present study has selected 645 antiviral peptides known to inhibit various viruses and computationally screened them against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. In primary screening, 27 out of 645 peptides exhibited higher affinity for the RBD of S protein compared to that of AH of the hACE2 receptor. Subsequently, AVP1795 appeared as the most promising candidate that could inhibit hACE2 recognition by SARS-CoV 2 as was predicted by the molecular dynamics simulation. The critical residues in RBD found for protein-peptide interactions are TYR 489, GLY 485, TYR 505, and GLU 484. Peptide-protein interactions were substantially influenced by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. This comprehensive computational screening may provide a guideline to design the most effective peptides targeting the spike protein, which could be studied further in vitro and in vivo for assessing their anti-SARS CoV-2 activity.","output":"Computational screening of 645 antiviral peptides against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As with many countries around the world, Thailand is currently experiencing restrictions to daily life as a consequence of the worldwide transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

We sought to estimate the impact of COVID-19 booster doses on SARS-CoV-2 infection in a vaccinated and actively surveilled population of young adults during an Omicron-predominant period. Methods and FindingsWe implemented a cohort study of young adults in a college environment (Cornell Universitys Ithaca campus) from December 5, 2021 through December 31, 2021 when Omicron was deemed the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant on campus. Participants included 15,102 university students fully vaccinated with an FDA-authorized or approved vaccination (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or Ad26.COV2.S) who were enrolled in mandatory at-least-weekly surveillance PCR testing, and having no positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test within 90 days before the start of the study period. Multivariable logistic regression considering those with full vaccination (a 2-dose series of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, or 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.S) with a booster dose versus those without a booster dose. 1,870 SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified in the study population. Controlling for gender, student group membership, full vaccination date and initial vaccine type, our analysis estimates that receiving a booster dose reduces the odds of having a PCR-detected SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to full vaccination by 52% (95% confidence interval [37%, 64%]). This result is robust to the choice of the delay over which a booster dose becomes effective (varied from 1 day to 14 days).

When there is little information about the symptoms of a novel disease, interventions to contain the spread of the disease would be suboptimal because people experiencing symptoms that are not yet known to be related to the disease may not limit their social activities. Our goal was to understand whether users social media postings about the symptoms of novel diseases could be used to develop a complete list of the disease symptoms in a shorter time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the Twitter API to download tweets that contained coronavirus, COVID-19, and symptom. After data cleaning, the resulting dataset consisted of over 95,000 unique, English tweets posted between January 17, 2020 and March 15, 2020 that contained references to the symptoms of COVID-19. We analyzed this data using network and time series methods. RESULTS: We found that a complete list of the symptoms of COVID-19 could have been compiled by mid-March 2020, before most states in the U.S. announced a lockdown and about 75 days earlier than the list was completed on CDCs website. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION: We conclude that national and international health agencies should use the crowd-sourced intelligence obtained from social media to develop effective symptom surveillance systems in the early stages of pandemics. We propose a high-level framework that facilitates the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information that are posted in various languages and on different social media platforms about the symptoms of novel diseases.","output":"Miscommunication in the age of communication: A crowdsourcing framework for symptom surveillance at the time of pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundHesitancy about COVID-19 vaccination threatens comprehensive vaccination. It is important to examine vaccination acceptance when people are making real rather than hypothetical decisions, to identify whether targeted support is needed, and to identify implications for communications. MethodsCross-sectional online and telephone survey with probability-based sample (n=4,978) of British adults, conducted January-February 2021. Measures: socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, education, financial status), COVID-19 status, vaccine acceptance, trust in COVID-19 vaccination information sources, perceptions of vaccination priority groups, and perceptions of importance of second dose. FindingsAmong 5,931 individuals invited, survey response rate was 84%. COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (83%) was associated with increasing age, higher level of education and having been invited for vaccination. Acceptance decreased with unconfirmed past COVID-19, greater financial hardship, and non-White British ethnicity; Black/Black British participants had lowest acceptance. Overall, healthcare and scientific sources of information were most trusted. Compared with White British participants, other ethnicities had lower trust in healthcare and scientific sources. Those with lower educational attainment or financial hardship had lower trust in healthcare and scientific sources. Those with no qualifications had higher trust in media and family/friends. While trust was low overall in community or faith leaders it was higher among those with Asian/Asian British and Black/Black British ethnicity compared with White British participants. Views of vaccine prioritisation were mostly consistent with UK official policy but there was support for prioritising additional groups. There was high support for having the second vaccine dose. ConclusionsTargeted engagement is needed to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in non-White British ethnic groups, in younger adults, and among those with lower education, greater financial hardship and unconfirmed past infection. Healthcare professionals and scientific advisors should play a central role in communications and tailored messaging is needed for hesitant groups. Careful communication around vaccination prioritisation continues to be required.","output":"A national survey of attitudes towards and intentions to vaccinate against COVID-19: implications for communications"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(O,[["render",V]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/59.md","filePath":"drive/59.md"}'),R={name:"drive/59.md"},z=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{E as __pageData,z as default};
