SARS-CoV-2 uses two distinct entry pathways: 1) a surface, serine protease-dependent or 2) an endosomal, cysteine protease-dependent pathway. In investigating serine protease-independent cell-cell fusion, we found that the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), MMP2/9, can activate SARS-CoV-2 S fusion activity, but not that of SARS-CoV-1. Importantly, metalloproteinase activation of SARS-CoV-2 S represents a third entry pathway in cells expressing high MMP levels. This route of entry required cleavage at the S1/S2 junction in viral producer cells and differential processing of variants of concern S dictated its usage. In addition, metalloproteinase inhibitors reduced replicative Alpha infection and abrogated syncytia formation. Finally, we found that the Omicron S exhibit reduced metalloproteinase-dependent fusion and viral entry. Taken together, we identified a MMP2/9-dependent mode of activation of SARS-CoV-2 S.

METHODS The literature search was executed in the databases of Scopus and Espacenet. Overall, 120 patents and 49 articles have been reviewed and categorized. RESULTS The identified treatment tools were divided into three treatment modalities: compression, resection, and conversion. A further subdivision was made based on the force direction, i.e., axial, radial, tangential, or energy conversion process (dissolving or state change). CONCLUSION The working principles of the identified treatment tools relate strongly to the (biomechanical) properties of the occlusion and environment. In order to increase procedural success, especially in chronic occlusions, the applied force should be increased by applying buckling prevention methods, the penetration force decreased by smart tip design or dynamic loading, and the energy dissipation to the environment minimized.

In a large cohort of critically ill patients including septic and non-septic patients, we assessed the relationship between baseline IL-6 or CRP and mortality, organ dysfunction, and the need for organ support. METHODS: This was an ancillary analysis of the prospective French and euRopean Outcome reGistry in Intensive Care Units (FROG-ICU) study including patients with a requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation and/or vasoactive drug support for more than 24 h following intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The primary objective was to determine the association between baseline IL-6 or CRP concentration and survival until day 90. Secondary outcomes included organ dysfunction as evaluated by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and the need for organ support, including vasopressors/inotropes and/or renal replacement therapy (RRT). RESULTS: Median IL-6 and CRP concentrations (n = 2,076) at baseline were 100.9 pg/ml (IQR 43.5C261.7) and 143.7 mg/L (IQR 78.6C219.8), respectively. Day-90 mortality was 30%. High IL-6 or CRP was associated with worse 90-day survival (hazard ratios 1.92 [1.63C2.26] and 1.21 [1.03C1.41], respectively), after adjustment on the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS-II). High IL-6 was also associated with the need for organ-support therapies, such as vasopressors/inotropes (OR 2.67 [2.15C3.31]) and RRT (OR 1.55 [1.26C1.91]), including when considering only patients independent from those supports at the time of IL-6 measurement. Associations between high CRP and organ support were inconsistent. CONCLUSION: IL-6 appears to be preferred over CRP to evaluate critically ill patients prognoses.","output":"Systemic Inflammation Evaluated by Interleukin-6 or C-Reactive Protein in Critically Ill Patients: Results From the FROG-ICU Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Strict quarantine measures were placed throughout China to prevent the spread of COVID-19 We anticipated that the ongoing restrictions in mobility and daily activities would lead to interpersonal conflicts in families, especially between children and those parents who worked away from home year-round By using telephonic follow-up, we aimed to assess the impact of the outbreak on the patients daily functioning and to reduce relapse rates Methods: The Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA) and the Childrens Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) were administered to families of adolescents with recent mental health admissions at a participating hospital in Henan province, China Interviews were conducted telephonically at 3 time points during the 3-month lockdown Paired and unpaired t tests were employed to compare the functionality of children whose parents worked locally and lived with their children (G1) vs those whose parents worked outside the province and do not live in the home (G2) Results: The study cohort consists of 48 adolescent patients in G1 and 93 patients in G2 The re-hospitalization rate was 2 2% compared to 4 5% in 2019 during the same period CGAS total scores did not show group differences at each of the time points There were significant changes in emotional difficulty subscores of HoNOSCA between the 2 time points, T1-T3 (p = 0 006) and T2-T3 (p &lt; 0 0001), in group G2 The parent-child conflict scores in G2 between T1-T2 (p &lt; 0 001) and T2-T3 (p = 0 007) were different significantly On the other hand, group G1 did not experience significant emotional difficulty, but their online learning behavior deteriorated over time, at T1-T2 (p &lt; 0 0001) and T2-T3 (p &lt; 0 0001) Intergroup differences were seen in learning difficulties at T1 between the G1 and G2 groups (p = 0 016) Conclusions: In China, this is the first study providing telephonic intervention to a population of discharged adolescent patients who have no access to follow-up clinic visits We found a significant change in adolescent emotional control, parent-child conflict, and online learning compliance in those adolescents whose parents left for work outside the province during the extended quarantine This study can provide reference for future studies on COVID-19Crelated adolescent mental health DS, FAM, TVM","output":"51.22 Using Telephonic Follow-up to Assess Adolescent Functioning during the Covid-19 Shutdown in Henan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The study aimed to investigate the effects of 2% hyaluronic acid (HA) on corneal epithelial defect after pterygium surgery in comparison with the control group, measured in terms of the healing rate of corneal epithelial defect and pain score after surgery. Methods: In this double-blind randomized clinical trial, fifty patients with primary pterygium were randomized into 2 groups: a control group or the group treated with a single topical application of 2% HA. Comprehensive ophthalmological examinations included measuring the area of corneal epithelium defect using ImageJ freeware and the pain score assessment after the operation. Results: The mean and SD of the area of epithelial defect measured on postoperative Day 0, 1, and 2 were 10.89  1.33 mm2, 5.04  0.87mm2, and 2.44  0.74 mm2 for the HA group, and 11.14  1.11 mm2, 7.74  1.17 mm2, and 5.31  1.15 mm2 for the control group, respectively. While the initial area of the defect on Day 0 was essentially the same for both groups (p = 0.478), the area of the defect in the HA group was significantly smaller on both Day 1 and Day 2 (p < 0.001, p < 0.001), respectively.

It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism among healthcare workers with dependent children, but there remains a need for spatially granular analyses of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. METHODS: We provide national- and county-level simulations of school closures and unmet child care needs across the USA. We develop individual simulations using county-level demographic and occupational data, and model school closure effectiveness with age-structured compartmental models. We perform multivariate quasi-Poisson ecological regressions to find associations between unmet child care needs and COVID-19 vulnerability factors. RESULTS: At the national level, we estimate the projected rate of unmet child care needs for healthcare worker households to range from 7.4 to 8.7%, and the effectiveness of school closures as a 7.6% and 8.4% reduction in fewer hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds, respectively, at peak demand when varying across initial reproduction number estimates by state. At the county level, we find substantial variations of projected unmet child care needs and school closure effects, 9.5% (interquartile range (IQR) 8.2-10.9%) of healthcare worker households and 5.2% (IQR 4.1-6.5%) and 6.8% (IQR 4.8-8.8%) reduction in fewer hospital and ICU beds, respectively, at peak demand. We find significant positive associations between estimated levels of unmet child care needs and diabetes prevalence, county rurality, and race (p<0.05). We estimate costs of absenteeism and child care and observe from our models that an estimated 76.3 to 96.8% of counties would find it less expensive to provide child care to all healthcare workers with children than to bear the costs of healthcare worker absenteeism during school closures. CONCLUSIONS: School closures are projected to reduce peak ICU and hospital demand, but could disrupt healthcare systems through absenteeism, especially in counties that are already particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Child care subsidies could help circumvent the ostensible trade-off between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism.","output":"Projected geographic disparities in healthcare worker absenteeism from COVID-19 school closures and the economic feasibility of child care subsidies: a simulation study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pregnant women have reported using cannabis to relieve stress and anxiety, and during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, the stress and prenatal cannabis use increased, according to a recent research letter published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.","output":"Prenatal cannabis use increased during the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exosomes are 40C100 nm nanovesicles participating in intercellular communication and transferring various bioactive proteins, mRNAs, miRNAs, and lipids.

According to current knowledge, the only method to stop the virus from spreading is prophylactic vaccination of the population. However, to achieve herd immunity, 60C72% of the population needs to be vaccinated, which is a significant challenge for current healthcare systems. As it has already been proven, having an effective vaccine is not the same as using it. Public acceptance is essential here. The study aimed to assess the changes in the attitudes of online respondents toward vaccination against COVID-19 over time. In the research, a questionnaire designed by the author of the study was used and it was distributed via the Internet in two stages. The questionnaire included a section assessing a sociodemographic status as well as the questions, designed by the author, evaluating the willingness of the respondents to get vaccinated and their main concerns associated with it. The first stage covered the period before the commencement of the population vaccination programme in Poland, i.e., 14C27 December 2020. Then, the survey was redistributed 2 months after the vaccination programme was started, i.e., 1C19 March 2021. Participation in the study was fully anonymous, voluntary and there was a possibility to opt out at any stage of the research. A total of 2048 respondents were surveyed and 26 persons refused to be involved in the research. A total number of 2022 responses were analysed. Stage I of the research involved 22.9% of the respondents (463 persons). The questions were answered by 1559 persons (72.9%) after the survey was redistributed. Among the participants of stage II of the study, 422 (27.1%) persons have already been vaccinated against COVID-19. A comparison of the responses that were collected from both stages of the study showed a slight increase in the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 over time. It turned out that women, residents of large cities, people with a higher level of education and healthcare workers showed a more favourable attitude toward vaccination. According to the results of the survey, chronic diseases do not have a significant impact on the attitude toward vaccinations (p = 0.155). As the social vaccination promotion campaign continued, a slight increase in the willingness to get vaccinated was observed. According to the survey, women, residents of large cities and those with higher education demonstrated more favourable attitudes toward getting vaccinated against COVID-19. It should be stressed that despite the passage of time and the increasing experience with the new types of vaccines against COVID-19, the percentage of people who are afraid of the complications after the vaccination has not decreased significantly and the concern related to the ineffectiveness of vaccination has dramatically increased. This demonstrates the limited effectiveness of the current information system regarding passing the knowledge on of the safety and efficiency of vaccination and it indicates a necessity to modernise it as soon as possible.","output":"Attitudes toward Vaccination against COVID-19 in Poland.

However, the application of circular mRNA is still at an initiation stage, proof of concept for its usage as future medicine or vaccine is necessary. In the current study, we established a novel kind of circular mRNA, termed C-RNA, based on Echovirus 29 (E29)-derived internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) and newly designed homology arms and RNA spacers. Our results demonstrated that this kind of circular mRNA is able to mediate strong and durable protein expression, compared to typical linear mRNA. Moreover, for the first time, our study demonstrated that direct intratumoral administration of C-RNA encoding a mixture of cytokines achieved successful modulation of intratumoral and systematic anti-tumor immune responses and finally leading to an enhancement of anti-PD-1 antibody-induced tumor repression in syngeneic mouse model. Additionally, after an optimization of the circular mRNA formulation, a significant improvement of C-RNA mediated protein expression was observed. With this optimized formulation, C-RNA induced enhanced anti-tumor effect via intratumoral administration and elicited significant activation of tumor-infiltrated total T cells and CD8+ T cells.

It is likely that reduced expression levels of MafA and PDX-1 and/or incretin receptor in -cells are closely associated with -cell failure in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Individuals from the country at risk of COVID-19 infection have been included in the Korean home-quarantine program, but the efficacy of the program is uncertain. Methods: To estimate the possible number of infected individuals within the large influx of international students from China, we used a deterministic compartmental model for epidemic and performed a simulation-based search of different rates of compliance with home-quarantine. Results: Under the home-quarantine program, the number of the infected individuals would reach 40-72 from 12 March-24 March with the arrival of 0.2% of pre-infectious individuals. Furthermore, the number of isolated individuals would peak at 40-64 from 13 March-27 March in Seoul, South Korea. Our findings indicated when incoming international students showed strict compliance with quarantine, epidemics by the international student from China were less likely to occur in Seoul, South Korea. Conclusions: To mitigate possible epidemics, additional efforts to improve the compliance of home-quarantine of the individuals from countries with the virus risk are warranted along with other containment policies.","output":"Estimation of the Excess COVID-19 Cases in Seoul, South Korea by the Students Arriving from China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unprecedented pressure on public health and healthcare.

The aim of this study was to verify the consistency of these three information systems. RESULTS We observed disparities between the number of cases of hospitalization of SPF and the data from ES/ARS/DSP. We did not observe any differences in patients hospitized in intensive care/critical care units.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of IL-1 blocking agents compared with standard care alone or with placebo on effectiveness and safety outcomes in people with COVID-19. We will update this assessment regularly. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 L-OVE Platform (search date 5 November 2021). These sources are maintained through regular searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, trial registers and other sources. We also checked the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, regulatory agency websites, Retraction Watch (search date 3 November 2021). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating IL-1 blocking agents compared with standard care alone or with placebo for people with COVID-19, regardless of disease severity. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed Cochrane methodology. The protocol was amended to reduce the number of outcomes considered. Two researchers independently screened and extracted data and assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the critical outcomes of clinical improvement (Day 28;  D60); WHO Clinical Progression Score of level 7 or above (i.e. the proportion of participants with mechanical ventilation +/- additional organ support OR death) (D28;  D60); all-cause mortality (D28;  D60); incidence of any adverse events; and incidence of serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We identified four RCTs of anakinra (three published in peer-reviewed journals, one reported as a preprint) and two RCTs of canakinumab (published in peer-reviewed journals). All trials were multicentre (2 to 133 centres). Two trials stopped early (one due to futility and one as the trigger for inferiority was met).

The period of strict quarantine restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring and early summer of 2020 led to a rapid and statistically significant decrease in the Moscow UHII, probably due to both natural factors (increased cloudiness) and human activities (rapidly decreased anthropogenic heat fluxes and a weakened urban industrial haze creating an additional counterradiation).","output":"About the Annual Course of Moscow Heat Island and the Impact on It of the Quarantine Measures to Prevent the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 greatly involves the resources of the global healthcare system, as it affects newborns, adults, and elders.

Orthopaedic podcasts, a burgeoning e-learning platform, continue to gain traction; however, there is a paucity of information regarding their coverage of topics and their distribution over time. Therefore, our analysis sought to (1) characterize podcast content related to orthopaedic surgery, and (2) evaluate the changes in the prevalence of orthopaedic podcasts over the past 15 years. METHODS: Three common podcasting platforms (Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, and Spotify) were queried using the key terms \\"orthopaedic,\\" \\"orthopedic,\\" and \\"ortho\\" in order to identify a list of podcasts that are related to orthopaedic surgery. For each unique orthopaedic podcast, the title, the show description, the number of episodes, the date of the first episode, the date of the most recent episode, and episode frequency were collected. Podcasts were then classified based on a predetermined list of podcast domains. The number of existing active (released within the last 3 months) orthopaedic podcasts was then trended on a monthly basis from 2011 to 2020. RESULTS: Ninety-four unique podcasts met inclusion criteria, 62 of which remained active as of October 25, 2020. The most common podcast domains were \\"general\\" (38 [40.4%]) and \\"clinical knowledge\\" (20 [21.3%]). Among the assessed podcasts, 90 (95.7%) utilized an exclusively audio format. The majority of podcasts were based in the United States (89.4%), included introductory music (72.3%), and included interviews (63.8%). Most podcast hosts were practicing orthopaedic surgeons (52.1%). Between January 2016 and October 2020, the number of active orthopaedic surgery podcasts grew more than twelvefold (1,240%) at an average rate of roughly 1 new podcast each month (average, 1.0 podcast; standard deviation, 1.8). DISCUSSION: The past decade has seen sizable growth in the number of readily available podcasts related to orthopaedic surgery.

The paper begins with a clear statement for the new public health approach that includes self-protection and the protection of civil rights.

On this background, the paper examines from an ethical perspective to what extent people with HIV have a responsibility in HIV prevention. The paper argues that a person with HIV has a responsibility to protect his/her partner in the case of a relationship of love. On the other hand, in the case of \\"purely\\" sexual encounters, each person is responsible for his/her own security and should not rely on the other.

It argues that reforms to instruments and bodies, notably the European Financial Stability Facility, the European Stability Mechanism, and the current Covid-19 recovery fund, are best explained by a re-occurring pattern of negotiations between potential creditors and debtors based on common Eurozone interests and national cost-benefit considerations. Building on a liberal inter-governmentalist approach, this article shows how this pattern influenced the step-by-step reform of financial assistance in the Eurozone. The threat to Eurozone stability served as a constant factor encouraging Member States to expand and deepen the assistance formula. Creditors' cost-benefit considerations were key for retaining disincentives, a limited liability for common debt, and intermediary borrowing and lending within the financing design. However, on the back of common Eurozone interests, debtors were able to push for an increase in assistance, an expansion of assistance into areas of banking sector support, and a softening of moral hazard elements in the more recent Covid-19 pandemic. Due to creditors' continuous insistence on safeguards and limited burden-sharing, reform outcomes were repeatedly unable to resolve the difficulties at hand.","output":"Tug of War over Financial Assistance: Which Way Forward for Eurozone Stability Mechanisms?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed health systems around the globe, and intensified the lethality of social and political inequality.

Even though replication and translation of their genome take place in the cytoplasm, these viruses evolved different strategies to disturb nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of host proteins and RNA. The major targets of picornavirus are the phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-nucleoporins, which form a mesh in the central channel of the nuclear pore complex through which protein cargos and karyopherins are actively transported in both directions. Interestingly, while enteroviruses use the proteolytic activity of their 2A protein to degrade FG-nucleoporins, cardioviruses act by triggering phosphorylation of these proteins by cellular kinases. By targeting the nuclear pore complex, picornaviruses recruit nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm, where they increase viral genome translation and replication; they affect nuclear translocation of cytoplasmic proteins such as transcription factors that induce innate immune responses and retain host mRNA in the nucleus thereby preventing cell emergency responses and likely making the ribosomal machinery available for translation of viral RNAs.","output":"Nucleocytoplasmic Trafficking Perturbation Induced by Picornaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected people globally, and people with chronic diseases are suffering more in maintaining their mental and physical health.

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and SYS share several phenotypic features, including muscular hypotonia, developmental delay/intellectual disability, and short stature. Evidence exists that similar to PWS, Growth Hormone (GH) deficiency is also a feature of SYS. Since 2000, GH therapy has been approved by the Federal Drug Agency (FDA) for PWS, which poses the question if GH therapy is a suitable treatment for children with SYS. Objective: To assess the prevalence of GH therapy in SYS children, its effect on the clinical endpoints height and body mass index (BMI), possible side effects and parents perception of changes during the therapy. Methods: Twenty-eight individuals diagnosed with SYS were recruited through CP Schaaf and the closed Facebook group for SYS. Patients were sent a consent form, a clinical questionnaire, and asked for growth charts of the affected children. Feedback on muscle strength, endurance and satisfaction was measured on a 5-level Likert scale. Height and BMI Z Scores (defined as the standard deviation of average height or BMI compared to children of the same sex and age) were calculated using WHO/CDC data and the PedZ calculator. The effect size of GH therapy was assessed by calculating the change in Height and BMI Z Scoreover the first 6 months of treatment. Data was(figure presented)(figure presented)linearly interpolated if no measurement on exactly 90 and 180 days after treatment start was taken. Results: Of the 28 individuals enrolled, 14 were on GH therapy. Thirteen of the 14 patient families provided feedback for the changes during therapy. Detailed growth charts were available for 8 patients with GH therapy, as well as for 5 patients without GH therapy. GH treatment was initiated at an average age of 2.6 years (range: 5 months up to 8 years). No patient has had to discontinue or interrupt GH therapy. Parental perception of changes after the onset of treatment was unanimously positive: All families noted either an increase (7 patients) or strong increase (6 patients) in muscle strength. For endurance, feedback was exactly the same. Overall, general satisfaction with the treatment was high, with 8 families stating they were very satisfied, 3 families stating they were satisfied and 2 families being neutral. Additional reported benefits were improved cognitive and social skills (6 patients) and improved motor development (5 patients). Negative side effects included worsening of sleep apnea in one individual which did not require further treatment or intervention, and worsening of scoliosis/kyphosis in further two individuals. In both cases of scoliosis, treatment start coincided with local Covid19 restrictions, and physical therapy and new back braces were no longer accessible for both patients.After three months of GH treatment, Height Z Score of the treated group increased on average by +0.70. After six months of treatment, the average increase in Height Z Score was +0.99 (Fig. 1A and 1B). The BMI Z Score of the treated group decreased by ?0.48 after three months and by ?0.71 after six months of treatment, on average (Fig. 2A and 2B). We calculated Height Z Scores and BMI Z Scores of the treated and nontreated groups, which revealed average Height Z Scores of ?1.1 in the treated group, and ?3.5 in the non-treated group (Fig. 1C). The average BMI Z Score in the treated group was +0.47, while the average BMI Z Score in the untreated group was +0.93 (Fig. 2C). Conclusion: We present a retrospective, questionnaire-based assessment of GH treatment in individuals with SYS. Our findings suggest that GH therapy should be considered as treatment for SYS. In this cohort, it led to an increase of body height and parental reports suggested an improvement of endurance and muscle strength. Furthermore, several families also noted additional beneficial sideeffects like im roved cognition and motor development.

Chest radiograph (CXR) has been playing a crucial role in COVID-19 patient triaging, diagnosing and monitoring, particularly in the United States. Considering the mixed and unspecific signals in CXR, an image retrieval model of CXR that provides both similar images and associated clinical information can be more clinically meaningful than a direct image diagnostic model. In this work we develop a novel CXR image retrieval model based on deep metric learning. Unlike traditional diagnostic models which aim at learning the direct mapping from images to labels, the proposed model aims at learning the optimized embedding space of images, where images with the same labels and similar contents are pulled together. The proposed model utilizes multi-similarity loss with hard-mining sampling strategy and attention mechanism to learn the optimized embedding space, and provides similar images, the visualizations of disease-related attention maps and useful clinical information to assist clinical decisions. The model is trained and validated on an international multi-site COVID-19 dataset collected from 3 different sources. Experimental results of COVID-19 image retrieval and diagnosis tasks show that the proposed model can serve as a robust solution for CXR analysis and patient management for COVID-19. The model is also tested on its transferability on a different clinical decision support task for COVID-19, where the pre-trained model is applied to extract image features from a new dataset without any further training. The extracted features are then combined with COVID-19 patient's vitals, lab tests and medical histories to predict the possibility of airway intubation in 72 hours, which is strongly associated with patient prognosis, and is crucial for patient care and hospital resource planning. These results demonstrate our deep metric learning based image retrieval model is highly efficient in the CXR retrieval, diagnosis and prognosis, and thus has great clinical value for the treatment and management of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Deep metric learning-based image retrieval system for chest radiograph and its clinical applications in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Case identification, isolation and contact tracing are fundamental strategies used to control the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The median duration of hospitalization, at the time of sampling, was 13 days (IQR 10-16 days). Overall concordance between the prototype and control swabs was 80.8% (Cohen's kappa coefficient = 0.61). Most discrepant results were due to prototype-positive control-negative results. When considering all positive results to be true positives, the prototype swab had a higher sensitivity (90.6% vs 80.8%, 95%CI 85.7-94.0% and 74.7-85.7%, respectively, p < 0.015).

The reduced aerosols have impacted the strength of the incoming solar radiation as evidenced by enhanced warming, more-over the land than the oceans. The differential warming over the land and the ocean has resulted in the amplification of the meridional ocean-land thermal contrast and strengthening of the monsoon flow. These intense features have supported the surplus transport of moisture from the oceans towards the main lands. Some similarity between the anomalous rainfall pattern and the anomalous AOD pattern is discernable. In particular, the enhancement of rainfall, the reduction in AOD and the surface temperature warming match very well over two regions one over West-Central India and the other over the Yangzte River Valley. Results further reveal that the heavy rains over the Yangzte River Valley could be associated with the preceding reduced aerosols, while the heavy rains over West-Central India could be associated with reduced aerosols and also due to the surface temperature warming.","output":"Erratic Asian summer monsoon 2020: COVID-19 lockdown initiatives possible cause for these episodes?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For the prevention and spread of COVID-19, people are currently used to screen temperature and identify masks in public spaces.

As a result, an automated system that monitors temperature and mask is required. To address this problem, a completely automated temperature scanner and entry provider system has been presented. A contactless temperature scanning and a camera are used in the system to take images. The scanner is attached to a gate-like mechanism that blocks admission if a feverishness or no mask is detected. The gadget employs a temperature sensor and camera attached to a Raspberry Pi system to monitor the entire operation.

The Criteria are currently used widely in Brazil. However, since they expand the net of the transplant-eligible population, and that transplantation is shown to improve clinical outcomes in HCC patients relative to other treatments, they are inherently attractive and may be adopted by other countries in determining whether HCC patients should receive liver transplantation. I argue that the Criteria unjustifiably disregard the number of tumour nodules found in the patient. This number may be indicative of the recurrence potential of the disease, since these nodules can originate from different clonal populations. The greater the number, the higher the risk these nodules are associated with clones which contain genetic mutations conferring even greater potential for proliferation and dissemination. Clusters of tumour cells may be micro-disseminated to vascular structures surrounding the liver, as well as extrahepatic systems. This increases recurrence potential and reduces the benefit of liver transplantation in these patients. Thus, HCC patients harbouring fewer but larger tumour nodules may present with a more favourable genomic and epigenomic profile than those with more, albeit smaller, tumour nodules. Patients with more tumour nodules may reap greater clinical benefit if initiated on systemic therapy early, rather than wait for a suitable donor liver. Although the Criteria are reached by consensus, with reference to findings from recent studies, as well as scientific theory, it is ripe for review.","output":"Stick to Milan: Infeasibility of the Brazil-Milan Criteria in recommending patients with hepatocellular carcinoma for liver transplantation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The economic impact of the lock down and social distancing policy of the governments has been devastating on business Should business look out for its own interest or deploy its resources and capabilities to fight the coronavirus even at the expense of short-term losses?

This study aims to identify the perceptions and behavior of recreational anglers during the COVID-19 pandemic along with identifying the factors that determine attitudes. This study is essential for understanding the complex economic, social, and environmental implications associated with a pandemic. Perceptions of pandemic stress reduction were confirmed by 63.8% of anglers, and nearly 98% felt there was no risk of infection from fishing. These feelings were most strongly positively associated and explained by a preference for fishing with friends and family and the frequency of fishing. Over 26% of respondents fished more frequently during the pandemic. Additional free time and the need to escape the pandemic media hype were the main factors for the increase in angler activity. The balance of benefits from changes in angler pandemic behavior was ambiguous. This was determined by considering the potential increase in pressure on the environmental resources that anglers use. Given the positive effects of angling on stress reduction, it is not advisable for policymakers to restrict recreational fishing access. Instead, best management practices should reduce sanitary bottlenecks to increase safety on fishing grounds.","output":"The Significance of Angling in Stress Reduction during the COVID-19 PandemicEnvironmental and Socio-Economic Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the COVID-19 spreads, global food prices have continued to rise and become more volatile because of food security panic, global food supply chain disruption, and unfavorable weather conditions for cultivation. This paper aims to study and compare the dependence structure in price volatility among agricultural commodity futures before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, with different vine copulas, namely the R-vine, C-vine, and D-vine. The daily closing prices of the agricultural commodity futures are used in the investigation, including Corn, Wheat, Oat, Soybean, Rice, Sugar, Coffee, Cocoa, and Orange, traded in the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) from January 2016 to July 2021. The conditional volatilities were estimated using the best fit GARCH model with the student-t distribution. The empirical results highlight the dependence structures captured by the C-vine, D-vine, and R-vine copula-based models before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the C-vine copula structures of the two different periods are unchanged, the details of the copula family in such a structure differ. In the case of D-vine and R-vine copulas, the details of the copula families and their vine structures of two different periods are significantly different, meaning that COVID-19 impacts the price volatility dependence structure among the agricultural commodity futures examined. Based on the AIC, the most appropriate dependence structure for pre-COVID-19 period is the C-vine copula, while the during-COVID-19 period is the D-vine copula. The dependence structure of agricultural commodity futures prices can be used in other risk analysis and management methods such as value at risk (VaR), portfolio optimization, and hedging. ? 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Price Volatility Dependence Structure Change Among Agricultural Commodity Futures Due to Extreme Event: An Analysis with the Vine Copula"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the setting of the current novel coronavirus pandemic, this document has been generated to provide guiding statements for the adult cardiac surgeon to consider in a rapidly evolving national landscape.

New entities, issues, and ideas continuously emerge, while the semantics of the existing conversation topics gradually shift. In recent years, pre-trained language models like BERT greatly improved the state-of-the-art for a large spectrum of content understanding tasks. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to study how these language models can be adapted to better handle continuously evolving web content. In our study, we first analyze the evolution of 2013 - 2019 Twitter data, and unequivocally confirm that a BERT model trained on past tweets would heavily deteriorate when directly applied to data from later years. Then, we investigate two possible sources of the deterioration: the semantic shift of existing tokens and the sub-optimal or failed understanding of new tokens. To this end, we both explore two different vocabulary composition methods, as well as propose three sampling methods which help in efficient incremental training for BERT-like models. Compared to a new model trained from scratch offline, our incremental training (a) reduces the training costs, (b) achieves better performance on evolving content, and (c) is suitable for online deployment. The superiority of our methods is validated using two downstream tasks.

There is a paucity of data about risk factors for under-immunization for COVID-19 among refugees. Methods Refugees were surveyed in two phases that corresponded to before and after wide availability of COVID-19 vaccines. Participants were asked about their attitudes, and perceptions about COVID-19, previous acceptance of vaccines, sources utilized to obtain trusted health information, and intent to get vaccinated. The overall participant vulnerability was assessed using the social vulnerability index. In-depth semi-structured interviews were completed with key stakeholders through snowball sampling. Results Of 247 refugees, 244 agreed to participate in the initial survey. Among those, 140 (57.4%) intended to get vaccinated, 43 (17.6%) were unsure, and 61 (25%) did not intend to get vaccinated. In the follow up survey, all 215 who were reached, agreed to provide information about their vaccination status. Among those respondents, 141 (65.6%) were either vaccinated or expressed intent to do so, and 74 (34.4%) remained hesitant. We did not observe any significant correlation between socio-demographic variables, country of origin, and vaccination status/intent. Among those who initially intended to get vaccinated, nearly 1 in 5 changed their mind and decided to forego vaccination, and among those who initially did not plan getting vaccinated, 1 in 3 changed their mind and got vaccinated. Fears related to the vaccine, concerns that the vaccine is religiously prohibited, wait and see how others did with the vaccine, communication and transportation barriers were commonly cited as reason not to get vaccinated. Conclusions Over a third of refugees in our study were hesitant to get vaccinated.

Three adolescents (ages 14C17 years) experiencing postconcussion symptoms 2 weeks postinjury participated with a parent. The Tele-AR intervention was a 6-week programme supervised by a rehabilitation clinician through weekly videoconferencing appointments and included (1) aerobic exercise, (2) coordination drills and (3) comprehensive education and support. Feasibility indicators included rates of recruitment, retention, adherence, as well as adolescent and parent ratings of technology usability using an adapted Telehealth Usability Questionnaire and satisfaction using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8. Prechanges to postchanges in postconcussion symptoms, illness perceptions, and occupational performance and satisfaction were also assessed. RESULTS: Rates of recruitment (n=3/4) and retention (n=3/3) achieved success criteria. Adherence was high among all participants (77%C100%), and there were no adverse events. Participant ratings of technology usability and satisfaction approached 90%. All participants reported improvements in postconcussion symptoms and illness perception.

Less is known about how care patterns differed by patient groups. We sought to determine whether areas with higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation or larger ethnic minority populations saw larger falls in emergency and planned admissions in England. METHODS: We conducted a national observational study of hospital care in the English National Health Service (NHS) in 2019C2020. Weekly volumes of elective (planned) and emergency admissions in 2020 compared with 2019 were calculated for each census area. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to estimate the reductions in volumes for areas in different quintiles of socioeconomic deprivation and ethnic minority populations after controlling for national time trends and local area composition. RESULTS: Between March and December 2020, there were 35.5% (3.0 million) fewer elective admissions and 22.0% (1.2 million) fewer emergency admissions with a non-COVID-19 primary diagnosis than in 2019. Areas with the largest share of ethnic minority populations experienced a 36.7% (95% CI 24.1% to 49.3%) larger reduction in non-primary COVID-19 emergency admissions compared with those with the smallest. The most deprived areas experienced a 10.1% (95% CI 2.6% to 17.7%) smaller reduction in non-COVID-19 emergency admissions compared with the least deprived. These patterns are not explained by differential prevalence of COVID-19 cases by area. CONCLUSIONS: Even in a healthcare system founded on the principle of equal access for equal need, the impact of COVID-19 on NHS hospital care for non-COVID patients has not been spread evenly by ethnicity and deprivation in England.

However, by considering the open border or trade policy approach of the bloc, this study applies a battery of econometrics analysis that consists of mean group, augmented mean group, common correlated effect mean group estimators, and Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality analysis for direction of causality. These techniques are superior to first-generation methods to substantiate the relationship between real income, energy intensity, and carbon emission between annual frequency data from 1990 to 2017. Empirical results from series of cointegration tests reveal the long-run equilibrium relationship between the highlighted variables in the EU.

This implies that EU growth trajectory comes with an environmental trade-off and consequences. However, few countries in the region have made substantial strides of carbon reduction but not as a bloc. This position is resonated by the regression from all estimators in harmony where energy intensity dampens environmental quality in the blocs investigated. On the direction of causality, feedback Granger causality is observed running from GDP growth and carbon emission. A similar direction of causality is seen between energy intensity and carbon emission. These outcomes have far-reaching consequences on the environment.

Treating neurosurgical patients with the restrictions imposed by the pandemic is challenging in institutions with shared patient areas. The present study was performed to assess the changing patterns of neurosurgical cases, the efficacy of repeated testing before surgery, and the prevalence of COVID-19 in asymptomatic neurosurgical inpatients. METHODS Cases of non-trauma-related neurosurgical patients treated at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were reviewed. During the pandemic, all patients underwent a nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test to detect COVID-19 at admission. Patients who needed immediate intervention were surgically treated following a single COVID-19 test, while stable patients who initially tested negative for COVID-19 were subjected to repeated testing at least 5 days after the first test and within 48 hours prior to the planned surgery. The COVID-19 positivity rate was compared with the local period prevalence. The number of patients who tested positive at the second test, following a negative first test, was used to determine the probable number of people who could have become infected during the surgical procedure without second testing. RESULTS Of the total 1769 non-trauma-related neurosurgical patients included in this study, a mean of 337.2 patients underwent surgery per month before COVID-19, while a mean of 184.2 patients (54.6% of pre-COVID-19 capacity) underwent surgery per month during the pandemic period, when COVID-19 cases were on the rise in India. There was a significant increase in the proportion of patients undergoing surgery for a ruptured aneurysm, stroke, hydrocephalus, and cerebellar tumors, while the number of patients seeking surgery for chronic benign diseases declined. At the first COVID-19 test, 4 patients (0.48%) tested were found to have the disease, a proportion 3.7 times greater than that found in the local community. An additional 5 patients tested positive at the time of the second COVID-19 test, resulting in an overall inpatient period prevalence of 1%, in contrast to a 0.2% national cumulative caseload. It is possible that COVID-19 was prevented in approximately 67.4 people every month by using double testing. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 has changed the pattern of neurosurgical procedures, with acute cases dominating the practice. Despite the fact that the pandemic has not yet reached its peak in India, COVID-19 has been detected 3.7 times more often in asymptomatic neurosurgical inpatients than in the local community, even with single testing. Double testing displays an incremental value by disclosing COVID-19 overall in 1 in 100 inpatients and thus averting its spread through neurosurgical services.","output":"COVID-19: changing patterns among neurosurgical patients from North India, efficacy of repeat testing, and inpatient prevalence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To assess the impact of public health messaging on the COVID-19 deaths METHODS: Review of all government, Public Health England, NHS England messages during the pandemic to see how they influenced public activity and thereby influenced hospital admissions and death.

Within three months, it evolved to 10 additional subtypes. Two evolved subtypes (A2 and A2a) carry a non-synonymous Spike protein mutation (D614G). We conducted phylodynamic analysis of over 70,000 SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses worldwide, sequenced until July2020, and found that the mutant subtype (614G) outcompeted the pre-existing type (614D), significantly faster in Europe and North-America than in East Asia. Bioinformatically and computationally, we identified a novel neutrophil elastase (ELANE) cleavage site introduced in the G-mutant, near the S1-S2 junction of the Spike protein. We hypothesised that elevation of neutrophil elastase level at the site of infection will enhance the activation of Spike protein thus facilitating host cell entry for 614G, but not the 614D, subtype. The level of neutrophil elastase in the lung is modulated by its inhibitor &#945;1-antitrypsin (AAT). AAT prevents lung tissue damage by elastase. However, many individuals exhibit genotype-dependent deficiency of AAT. AAT deficiency eases host-cell entry of the 614G virus, by retarding inhibition of neutrophil elastase and consequently enhancing activation of the Spike protein. AAT deficiency is highly prevalent in European and North-American populations, but much less so in East Asia. Therefore, the 614G subtype is able to infect and spread more easily in populations of the former regions than in the latter region. Our analyses provide a molecular biological and evolutionary model for the higher observed virulence of the 614G subtype, in terms of causing higher morbidity in the host (higher infectivity and higher viral load), than the non-mutant 614D subtype.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 mutation 614G creates an elastase cleavage site enhancing its spread in high AAT-deficient regions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which resulted in the worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic of 2020, has particularly affected Latin America.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by either quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from nasopharyngeal swabs or presence of circulating immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies and who underwent chest radiograph or CT or both were included in this retrospective multicenter study. Three pediatric radiologists independently reviewed radiographs and CTs to identify the presence, localization, distribution and extension of pulmonary lesions. RESULTS: We included 140 children (71 female; median age 6.3 years, interquartile range 1.6C12.1 years) in the study. Peribronchial thickening (93%), ground-glass opacities (79%) and vascular engorgement (63%) were the most frequent findings on 131 radiographs. Ground-glass opacities (91%), vascular engorgement (84%) and peribronchial thickening (72%) were the most frequent findings on 32 CTs. Peribronchial thickening (100%), ground-glass opacities (83%) and pulmonary vascular engorgement (79%) were common radiograph findings in asymptomatic children (n=25).

Articles published from Dec 2019 to April 2020 were included. All cross-sectional, retrospective or prospective observational cohort and case-control studies were selected which reported the incidence or prevalence of myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Based on the inclusion criteria, 12 articles were selected. The incidence of cardiac injury was reported in 8 articles and 8 articles focused on the cardiovascular outcomes of COVID-19 infection. The incidence of new cardiac injury was reported to be 7.2-77% in live and dead patients, respectively. The results showed that patients with cardiac injury had worse outcomes including higher mortality than those without cardiac injury. The most common cardiac injury outcomes were shock and malignant arrhythmias. The most common radiographic findings in patients with cardiac injury were multiple mottling and ground-glass opacities in the lungs (64.6%). A significant number of patients with cardiac injury required noninvasive mechanical ventilation (46.3%) or invasive mechanical ventilation (22.0%). Acute respiratory distress syndrome was seen in 58.5%, acute kidney injury in 8.5%, electrolyte disturbances in 15.9%, hypoproteinemia in 13.4%, and coagulation disorders in 7.3% of patients with cardiac injuries. In addition, survival days were negatively correlated with cardiac troponin I levels (r = -0.42, 95%, p = 0.005).

Methods: 50 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively compared to 50 patients with AH1N1 pneumonia diagnosed during the 2009 pandemic. Two radiologists reviewed chest CT scans independently and blindly, with discordance resolved by consensus. Dilated or tortuous vessels within hyperdense lesions were recorded. Results: COVID-19 pneumonia presented with bilateral (96%), peripheral areas of GGO (22%), consolidation (4%) or combined GGO-consolidation (74%). The vascular enlargement sign in COVID-19 pneumonia was much more commonly present in COVID-19 (45/50, 90%) versus AH1N1 pneumonia (12/50, 24%) (p<0.001). Vascular enlargement was more often present in lower lobes with a peripheral distribution. Conclusions: Vascular enlargement in consolidative / GGO areas may represent a reasonably common early CT marker in COVID-19 patients and is of uncertain etiology. Although speculative, theoretical mechanisms could potentially reflect acute inflammatory changes, pulmonary endothelial activation, or acute stasis.

Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of observational cohort studies reporting on the occurrence and/or outcomes of patients with cerebrovascular events in association with their SARSCoV- 2 infection status. We used a random-effects model. Summary estimates were reported as odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: We identified 16 cohort studies including 44,004 patients. Among patients with SARS-CoV- 2, 1.3% (95%CI: 0.9-1.8%;I =88%) were hospitalized for cerebrovascular events, 1.2% (95%CI: 0.8-1.5%;I =85%) for ischemic stroke, and 0.2% (95%CI: 0.1-0.4%;I =69%) for hemorrhagic stroke.

Health workers (HWs) are a key resource for health systems worldwide, and have been affected heavily by the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence is consolidating on incidence and associated drivers of infections, predominantly in high-income settings. It is however still unclear what the risk factors may be for specific health professions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in a representative sample of 1,183 medical doctors registered with Brazils Federal Council of Medicine in one developed (Sao Paulo) and one disadvantaged state (Maranhao). Between February-June 2021, we administered a telephone questionnaire to collect data on physicians demographics, deployment to services, vaccination status, and self-reported COVID-19 infections. We performed descriptive, univariate, and multilevel clustered analysis to explore the association between physicians infection rates, and their sociodemographic and employment characteristics. A generalized linear mixed model with a binomial distribution was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio. Results. We found that 35.8% of physicians in our sample were infected with COVID-19 in the first year of the pandemic. The infection rate in Maranhao (49.2%) [95% CI 45.0-53.4] was almost twice that in Sao Paulo (24.1%) [95% CI 20.8-27.5]. Being a physician in Maranhao [95% CI 2.08-3.57], younger than 50 years [95% CI 1.41-2.89], and having worked in a COVID-19 ward [95% CI 1.28-2.27], were positively associated with the probability of infections.

Based on data from Brazil, COVID-19 infections in LMICs may be more likely in those health systems with lower physician-to-patient ratios, and younger doctors working in COVID-19 wards may be infected more frequently.

Over the past 29 years, Penn Medicine has systematically built a care delivery system based on three core values: innovation, integration, and impact. The operating strategy is designed to meet the patient's needs in a traditional brick-and-mortar hospital as well as in an increasingly virtual world. Today's patient is demanding an omnichannel experience with superior outcomes. Although long discussed in healthcare, such a comprehensive, seamless patient experience is only possible when all four channels of care delivery-hospital, ambulatory, home, and virtual-are sustainably integrated to improve the health of the population through digital innovation and analytics.The COVID-19 pandemic forced healthcare systems around the world to pour resources into telemedicine and other telehealth tools. This shift is fueling a dramatic shift from a piecemeal digital strategy to a comprehensive approach to the digital world where increased communication among clinicians, caregivers, and patients can lead to improved outcomes at a lower cost.In this article, we present an illustrative case study focusing on two of four channels of care: the Pavilion at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, where the latest in digital innovation has been built into the walls of our most ambitious capital project to date, and Penn Medicine at Home, which provides home care services, home infusion, and hospice care to patients throughout the region.

While much of the literature on sex tourism relates to the commercial sex worker industry, sex tourism also finds expression in non-transactional sexual encounters. This narrative review explores current concepts related to travel and sex, with a focus on trans-national sex tourism. METHODS: The PubMed database was accessed to source relevant literature, using combinations of pertinent search terms. Only articles published in the English language were selected. Reference lists of published articles were also examined for relevant articles. RESULTS: With regard to preferred destinations, South/Central America and the Caribbean were more likely to receive tourists looking for casual sex. Longer duration of travel, travelling alone or with friends, alcohol or drug use, being younger and being single were factors associated with higher levels of casual sex overseas. The majority of literature retrieved on sex workers focused on risk behaviours, sexually transmitted infections (STI), mobility of sex workers and how these factors affected their lives. Sex tourists require better access to effective methods of preventing HIV, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis, and better education on HIV prevention. Drugs and alcohol play a major role as risk factors for and cofactors in casual sexual behaviour while abroad. CONCLUSIONS: Travellers need to be informed of the increased risks of STI before travel.

Although the government of Nepal keeps a detailed record of daily coronavirus infections and deaths throughout the country, and publishes the result every day, genomic surveillance of mutants in the country has lagged behind. Sequencing of COVID-19 samples has been conducted sporadically during the pandemic. From the GISAID database, 127 high-quality sequences deposited by different health authorities in Nepal were collected and analyzed. From the analysis, it can be concluded that at least two variants of concern, alpha and delta, and one variant of interest, kappa, were detected in Nepal in 2021. As in other countries, the delta variant outcompeted the kappa and alpha variants and by July 2021 had established itself as the dominant variant. It can be hypothesized that the second wave in Nepal was primarily caused by the delta variant. Further, phylogenetic tree analysis suggests cases of local transmission and global transmission of coronavirus. This analysis reveals the global nature of the disease, where variants arising in one part of the world can quickly spread to other parts of the world and can also spread through individual communities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between June 2015 and December 2016, three consecutive oncologic patients (mean age 58 years; range 48-67 years) with acetabular bone metastasis underwent percutaneous image-guided thermal ablation procedures along with hip joint cartilage thermal monitoring. Due to the close proximity of the metastatic lesion to the acetabular articular cartilage, a thermosensor device was placed under CT and fluoroscopic guidance near the acetabular roof and next to the ablation zone in order to monitor the local temperature around the articular cartilage. Stand-alone thermal ablation (n = 1) and combined thermal ablation with cementoplasty (n = 2) were performed to optimize local palliation or disease control. Clinical and radiological outcomes at follow-up were assessed. RESULTS Three acetabular metastatic lesions were treated with thermal ablation, and temperature monitoring of the acetabular articular cartilage was conducted during the ablation procedure. Mean size of lesions was 1.6 cm (range 1.5-2 cm). Technical success was achieved in all cases (100%) without any immediate complications. No hip cartilage damage occurred clinically and radiologically. Good palliation and local disease control were achieved in two cases, and in the other case, there was local recurrence and distant progression of hip metastatic disease after 7 months of follow-up.

Traditional strong consistency maintains the same total order of operations across replicas. This total order is the source of multiple desirable consistency properties: integrity, convergence and recency. However, maintaining the total order has proven to inhibit availability and performance. Weaker notions exhibit responsiveness and scalability; however, they forfeit the total order and hence its favorable properties. This project revives these properties with as little coordination as possible. It presents a tool called [Formula: see text] that given a sequential object with the declaration of its integrity and recency requirements, automatically synthesizes a correct-by-construction replicated object that simultaneously guarantees the three properties. It features a relational object specification language and a syntax-directed analysis that infers optimum staleness bounds. Further, it defines coordination-avoidance conditions and the operational semantics of replicated systems that provably guarantees the three properties. It characterizes the computational power and presents a protocol for recency-aware objects. [Formula: see text] uses automatic solvers statically and embeds them in the runtime to dynamically decide the validity of coordination-avoidance conditions.

This study aimed to explore these issues. METHODS: This large retrospective cohort study included 2073 patients with COVID-19 having definite outcomes in Wuhan, China. Longitudinal liver function tests were conducted and determined their associated factors and death risk by multivariate regression analyses. A prognostic nomogram was formulated to predict the survival of patients with COVID-19. The characteristics of liver abnormalities and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 with and without hepatitis B were compared after 1:3 propensity score matching. RESULTS: Of the 2073 patients, 1282 (61.8%) had abnormal liver chemistries during hospitalization, and 297 (14.3%) had a liver injury. The mean levels of AST and D-Bil increased early after symptom onset in deceased patients and showed disparity compared with that in discharged patients throughout the clinical course of the disease. Abnormal admission AST (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.39, 95%CI: 1.04-1.86, P=0.027) and D-Bil (adjusted HR: 1.66, 95%CI: 1.22-2.26, P=0.001) levels were independent risk factors for mortality due to COVID-19. A nomogram was established based on the results of multivariate analysis and showed sufficient discriminatory power and good consistency between the prediction and the observation. HBV infection in patients did not increase the risk of COVID-19-associated poor outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal AST and D-Bil levels at admission were independent predictors of COVID-19 mortality.

The situation is worsening in Iraq, as a result of a lack of attention to safety in the building industry and the poor implementation of safety programs. This research aims to identify the critical safety factors (CSFs) of safety program implementation in the Iraqi construction industry. The CSFs were first identified from a review of literature before being verified by construction practitioners, using semi-structured interviews. A questionnaire, based on the verified CSFs, was distributed to construction practitioners in Iraq. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to analyze the quantitative data, and the results show that the CSFs can be categorized into four constructs: worker involvement, safety prevention and control system, safety arrangement, and management commitment. Following that, partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was executed to establish the connection between safety program implementation and overall project success. The result confirms that safety program implementation has a significant, positive impact on project success. This article contributes to knowledge and practice by identifying the CSFs for implementing safety programs in the Iraqi construction industry.

However, cisplatin often loses effectiveness because most tumors acquire drug resistance over time. As EGFR is the most important pro-survival/proliferation signal receptor in NSCLC cells, we aimed at investigating whether cisplatin resistance is related to EGFR activation and further evaluating the combined effects of cisplatin/gefitinib (EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, EGFR-TKI) on cisplatin-resistant wtEGFR NSCLC cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EGFR activation was analysed in parental and cisplatin-resistant wtEGFR NSCLC cell lines (H358 and H358(R), A549 and A549(R)). Cellular proliferation and apoptosis of H358(R)/A549(R) cells treated with cisplatin or gefitinib, alone or in combination were investigated, and the related effector protein was detected by western blot analysis. Anti-tumor effect of two drugs combined was evaluated in animal models of H358(R) xenografts in vivo. RESULTS: EGFR was significantly phosphorylated in cisplatin-resistant wtEGFR NSCLC cells H358(R) and A549(R) than their parental cells. In H358(R) and A549(R) cells, anti-proliferative ability of gefitinib was further improved, and gefitinib combined with cisplatin enhanced inhibition of cellular survive/proliferation, and promotion of apoptosis in vitro. The combined effects were also associated with the inhibition of EGFR downstream effector proteins. Similarly, in vivo, gefitinib and cisplatin in combination significantly inhibited tumor growth of H358(R) xenografts. CONCLUSION: Abnormal activation of EGFR may induce wtEGFR NSCLC cell resistance to cisplatin. The combined effects of cisplatin/gefitinib suggest that gefitinib, as a combination therapy for patients with cisplatin-resistant wtEGFR NSCLC should be considered.","output":"Gefitinib sensitization of cisplatin-resistant wild-type EGFR non-small cell lung cancer cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chloroquine (CQ) and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have recently emerged as potential antiviral and immunomodulatory options for the treatment of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To examine the safety profiles of these medications, we systematically evaluated the adverse events (AEs) of these medications from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane library, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the ClinicalTrials.gov for all the RCTs comparing CQ or HCQ with placebo or other active agents, published before June 20, 2020. The random-effects or fixed-effects models were used to pool the risk estimates relative ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the outcomes. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 23 and 19 studies for CQ and HCQ, respectively, that satisfied our inclusion criteria. Of these studies, we performed meta-analysis on 6 studies for CQ and 18 studies for HCQ. We did not limit our analysis to published records involving viral treatment alone; data also included the usage of either CQ or HCQ for the treatment of other diseases. The trials for the CQ consisted of a total of 2,137 participants (n = 1,077 CQ, n = 1,060 placebo), while the trials for HCQ involved 2,675 participants (n = 1,345 HCQ and n = 1,330 control). The overall mild and total AEs were significantly higher in CQ-treated nonCCOVID-19 patients, HCQ-treated nonCCOVID-19 patients, and HCQ-treated COVID-19 patients. The AEs were further categorized into four groups and analyses revealed that neurologic, gastrointestinal (GI), dermatologic, and sensory AEs were higher in participants taking CQ compared to placebo, while GI, dermatologic, sensory, and cardiovascular AEs were higher in HCQ-treated COVID-19 patients compared to control patients. Moreover, subgroup analysis suggested higher AEs with respect to dosage and duration in HCQ group. Data were acquired from studies with perceived low risk of bias, so plausible bias is unlikely to seriously affect the main findings of the current study. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we found that participants taking either CQ or HCQ exhibited more AEs than participants taking placebo or control.

Jinzhen granule (JZ) is a traditional eight ingredients-Chinese medicine with prominent efficacy for treating viral-induced diseases. However, little is known about the antiviral effect and mechanism of JZ against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E. PURPOSE: This study aimed to reveal the antiviral effects of JZ against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E, and to further explore the underlying mechanisms regulating the host immune response. METHODS: The chromatographic separation of JZ was performed using a Shimadzu analytical high-performance liquid chromatograph with UV detection and Alltech ELSD 2000ES. We conducted cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque reduction assays to evaluate the antiviral effect of JZ. A lethal human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 was established to determine the protective effect of JZ on mortality and lung virus titers. Real-time quantitative PCR assays were used to analyze the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in vitro and in vivo. Western blotting was further performed to determine the activities on regulating the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B)/MAPK pathway. Finally, mitochondrial membrane potential assays, flow cytometry analysis and western blotting were used to assess the anti-apoptotic potency toward HCoV-229E infection. RESULTS: The results showed that 13 chemical components were identified and five peaks were determined and quantitated (gallic acid 1.97 mg/g, baicalin 20.69 mg/g, glycyrrhizic acid 4.92 mg/g, hyodeoxycholic acid 4.86 mg/g, cholic acid 4.07 mg/g). We found that JZ exerted inhibitory potency against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E in vitro by using CPE and plaque reduction assays, and it was further found that JZ protected mice infected by SARS-CoV-2 from death and inhibited lung virus titers. JZ also significantly decreased the induction of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, CCL-5 and MIP-1), similar to the observed in vitro effect. Moreover, JZ suppressed the release of inflammatory cytokines in vitro and it decreased the protein expression of p-p38 MAPK, p-JNK, p-NF-B p65 and p-IB induced by HCoV-229E and increased the expression of IB. Notably, JZ significantly protected HCoV-229E-infected Huh-7 cells from mitochondrial damage and decreased apoptotic cells. The activation of the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway was inhibited by JZ, as shown by the reduced expression of cleaved caspase-9, caspase-3 and p-PARP. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, JZ (gallic acid 1.97 mg/g, baicalin 20.69 mg/g, glycyrrhizic acid 4.92 mg/g, hyodeoxycholic acid 4.86 mg/g, cholic acid 4.07 mg/g) exhibited antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E by regulating the NF-B/MAPK pathway and the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. These findings demonstrated the efficacy of JZ against CoVs and suggested JZ treatment as a novel clinical therapeutic strategy for COVID-19.","output":"Effect of Jinzhen granule on two coronaviruses: The novel SARS-CoV-2 and the HCoV-229E and the evidences for their mechanisms of action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virtual models of care are seen as a sustainable solution to the growing demand for health care.

METHODS: The OxWell school surveya cross-sectional online surveycollected data from 18 642 children and adolescents (aged 8C19 years, 60% female, school year 4C13) from 230 schools in southern England, in JuneCJuly 2020. Participants completed self-report measures of the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on sleep quality, happiness, and social relationships. Sleep timing was compared with data collected from 4222 young people in 2019. RESULTS: Females and older adolescents were more likely to report deteriorations in sleep during the national lockdown. Regression analysis revealed that changes in happiness ( = .34) and how well students were getting on with others in their household ( = .07) predicted change in sleep quality. Students bedtimes and wake times were later, and sleep duration was longer in 2020 compared to the 2019 survey. Secondary school students reported the greatest differences, especially later wake times.

Herein, we hypothesized that CT-measured cardiac indices are correlated with severity of lung involvement and can predict survival in patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-seven patients with confirmed COVID-19 who underwent chest CT were enrolled. Cardiac indices including pulmonary artery-to-aorta ratio (PA/A), cardiothoracic ratio (CTR), epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) thickness and EAT density, inferior vena cava diameter, and transverse-to-anteroposterior trachea ratio were measured by non-enhanced CT. Logistic regression and Cox-regression analyses evaluated the association of cardiac indices with patient's outcome (death vs discharge). Linear regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between the extent of lung involvement (based on CT score) and cardiac indices. RESULTS: Mean ( SD) age of patients was 54.55 ( 15.3) years; 65.5% were male. Increased CTR (> 0.49) was seen in 52.9% of patients and was significantly associated with increased odds and hazard of death (OR=12.5, P=0.005; HR=11.4, P=0.006). PA/A >1 was present in 20.7 % of patients and displayed a non-significant increase in odds of death (OR=1.9, P=0.36). Furthermore, extensive lung involvement was positively associated with elevated CTR and increased PA/A (p= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CT-measured cardiac indices might have predictive value regarding survival and extent of lung involvement in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and could possibly be used for the risk stratification of these patients and for guiding therapy decision-making. In particular, increased CTR is prevalent in patients with COVID-19 and is a powerful predictor of mortality.","output":"The Association of CT-measured Cardiac Indices with Lung Involvement and Clinical Outcome in Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the resulting containment measures, such as lockdown and social distancing, have had important consequences on peoples mental and physical health.ObjectivesWe aimed to study the effect of social isolation and subsequent re- exposure and eventual changes in general and ED-specific psychopathology in people with Eating Disorders (EDs).MethodsThree-hundred twelve Italian people with EDs (179 Anorexia Nervosa, 83 Bulimia Nervosa, 48 Binge Eating Disorder and 22 Other Specific Feeding Eating Disorder) were asked to fill-in an online survey to explore several dimensions such as: anxiety, depression, panic, insomnia, suicide ideation, stress, post-traumatic stress and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Differences in ED specific and general symptoms among the 3 investigated time periods (before, during and after the end of lockdown) were assessed with a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Subsequently, ED diagnosis was introduced as covariate in the analysis in order to investigate the possible contribution on psychopathological changes.ResultsED core symptoms increased during the lockdown but most of them returned to pre-COVID19 levels at re-opening. The severity of general psychopathology also increased during the lockdown and persisted high in the following phase, except for depression and suicide ideation.

These concerns reflect the industry's emissions, land disturbance, water use and the resulting impacts to Indigenous Rights. Effective environmental management is essential to address and ultimately manage these concerns. Like other large monitoring initiatives, a series of ambient regional monitoring programs in the oil sands region have struggled with scope and governance. In the last ten years, monitoring has evolved from a regulatory driven exercise implemented by industry into a focused, collaborative, multi-stakeholder program that attempts to integrate rigorous science from a multitude of disciplines and ways of knowing. Monitoring in the region continues to grapple with governance, data management, scope, and effective analysis and reporting. This special issue, \\"A Decade of Research and Monitoring in the Oil Sands Region of Alberta, Canada,\\" provides a series of critical reviews which synthesize ten years of published monitoring results to identify patterns of consistent ecological responses or effects, significant gaps in knowledge and recommendations for improved monitoring, assessment and management of the region. The special issue considered over 300 peer-reviewed papers and represents the first integrated critical review of the published literature from the region. This introductory paper of the special issue introduces the history of ambient environmental monitoring in the oil sands region and discusses historic and ongoing challenges with the environmental monitoring effort. While significant progress has been made in areas of governance, expanded geographical scope, and inclusion of Indigenous communities in monitoring in the region, significant issues remain regarding a lack of integrated reporting on environmental conditions, public access to data, and continuity of monitoring efforts over time.

Nevertheless, an objective approach to benchmark the performances of different CRISPR sensing systems is lacking due to the heterogeneous experimental setup. Here, we developed a quantitative CRISPR sensing figure of merit (FOM) to compare different CRISPR methods and explore performance improvement strategies. The CRISPR sensing FOM is defined as the product of the limit of detection (LOD) and the associated CRISPR reaction time (T). A smaller FOM means that the method can detect smaller target quantities faster. We found that there is a tradeoff between the LOD of the assay and the required reaction time. With the proposed CRISPR sensing FOM, we evaluated five strategies to improve the CRISPR-based sensing: preamplification, enzymes of higher catalytic efficiency, multiple crRNAs, digitalization, and sensitive readout systems. We benchmarked the FOM performances of 57 existing studies and found that the effectiveness of these strategies on improving the FOM is consistent with the model prediction. In particular, we found that digitalization is the most promising amplification-free method for achieving comparable FOM performances (1 fMmin) as those using preamplification.

However, determining a pathogens transmission dynamics is complicated by challenges often encountered in zoonotic disease surveillance, including unobserved sources of transmission (both human and zoonotic), limited spatial information, and unknown scope of surveillance. In this work, we present a model-based inference method that addresses these challenges for subcritical zoonotic pathogens using a spatial model with two levels of mixing. After demonstrating the robustness of the method using simulation studies, we apply the new method to a dataset of human monkeypox cases detected during an active surveillance program from 1982-1986 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Our results provide estimates of the reproductive number and spillover rate of monkeypox during this surveillance period and suggest that most human-to-human transmission events occur over distances of 30km or less. Taking advantage of contact-tracing data available for a subset of monkeypox cases, we find that around 80% of contact-traced links could be correctly recovered from transmission trees inferred using only date and location. Our results highlight the importance of identifying the appropriate spatial scale of transmission, and show how even imperfect spatiotemporal data can be incorporated into models to obtain reliable estimates of human-to-human transmission patterns. Surveillance datasets are often the only sources of information about the ecology and epidemiology of zoonotic infectious diseases. Methods that can extract as much information as possible from these datasets therefore provide a key advantage for informing our understanding of the disease dynamics and improving our ability to choose the optimal intervention strategy. We developed and tested a likelihood-based inference method based on a mechanistic model of the spillover and human-to-human transmission processes. We first used simulated datasets to explore which information about the disease dynamics of a subcritical zoonotic pathogen could be successfully extracted from a line-list surveillance dataset with non-localized spatial information and unknown geographic coverage. We then applied the method to a dataset of human monkeypox cases detected during an active surveillance program in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 1982 and 1986 to obtain estimates of the reproductive number, spillover rate, and spatial dispersal of monkeypox in humans.","output":"Quantifying transmission of emerging zoonoses: Using mathematical models to maximize the value of surveillance data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The Promoting Activity, Independence and Stability in Early Dementia (PrAISED) is delivering an exercise programme for people with dementia.

Pregnancy poses a good opportunity to help women to stop; around 80% of women in the UK have a baby, most of whom are less than 40 years of age. Smoking prevalence during pregnancy is high: 17%C23% in the UK. Smoking during pregnancy causes low birth weight and increases the risk of premature birth. After birth, passive smoking is linked to sudden infant death syndrome, respiratory diseases and increased likelihood of taking up smoking. These risks impact the long-term health of the child with associated increase in health costs. Emerging evidence suggests that offering financial incentives to pregnant women to quit is highly cost effective. This protocol describes the economic evaluation of a multi-centre randomised controlled trial (Cessation in Pregnancy Incentives Trial III, CPIT III) designed to establish whether offering financial incentives, in addition to usual care, is effective and cost effective in helping pregnant women to quit. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The economic evaluation will identify, measure and value resource use and outcomes from CPIT III, comparing participants randomised to either usual care or usual care plus up to 400 financial incentives. Within-trial and long-term analyses will be conducted from a National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective; the outcome for both analyses will be quality adjusted life-years measured using EQ-5D-5L.

We aimed to assess the preventive potential of regular bromhexine hydrochloride intake for COVID-19 risk reduction in medical staff actively involved in the evaluation and treatment of patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In a single-center randomized open-label study medical staff managing patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled and followed-up for 8 weeks. The study began at the initiation of COVID-19 management in the clinic. We enrolled 50 participants without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection: 25 were assigned to bromhexine hydrochloride treatment (8 mg 3 times per day), and 25 were controls. The composite primary endpoint was a positive nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to SARS-CoV-2 or the signs of clinical infection within 28 days and at week 8. Secondary endpoints included the symptomatic infection rate and positive nasopharyngeal swab (PCR) tests. Results: The rate of the combined primary endpoint did not differ significantly between the active treatment group (2/25 [8%]) and control group (7/25 [28%]); P = 0.07. A fewer number of participants developed symptomatic infection (confirmed COVID-19) in the treatment group compared to controls (0/25 vs 5/25; P = 0.02).

Abstract The cumulative incidence of urticaria in children is close to 10%. Two forms are described: the superficial form and the deep form, or angioedema. In young children aged under 3 years, urticaria is commonly annular and ecchymotic, and is mistaken for erythema multiforme or acute hemorrhagic edema. Serum sickness-like reaction is a particular form of urticaria characterized by angioedema of the extremities, fever and arthralgia, and it is chiefly drug-induced (cephalosporins). With children, questioning and clinical examination are essential and, in most cases, reveal an etiology. The main causes of acute or recurrent urticaria are viral infections and/or drugs (non-specific histamine release), whereas chronic urticaria is mostly due to physical causes. In developed countries, parasitic infections are rarely the cause. Arguments in favor of a food allergy are as follows: a setting of atopy, onset within one hour of taking the suspect food, absence of fever or infection, a duration of less than 24hours, possible association with other signs of anaphylaxis, and further recurrence with each new intake of the suspect food. First-line treatment of urticaria without signs of severity consists solely of non-sedating antihistamine (associated with removal of the cause where the latter has been determined). Nearly one-third of cases of urticaria in children progress over a prolonged period of more than 6 weeks, thus constituting chronic urticaria (most often a form of mild recurrent urticaria during episodes of infection and/or medication). Chronic urticaria is very rarely due to an underlying inflammatory disease or a genetic disease such as cryopyrinopathy, and first-line etiological assessment is usually limited to the following tests: CBC, sedimentation speed and/or CRP, and transaminases.","output":"Urticaire de lenfant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients who survive influenza A (H7N9) virus infection are at risk of physical and psychological complications of lung injury and multi-organ dysfunction.

In Piedmont, one of the most affected areas in Italy, 4550 healthcare workers were assessed online in May-June 2020, after the acute outbreak of March-April 2020, that compelled the Italian government to enforce, what was then, the first total lockdown in the Western world. METHODS: : Socio-demographic information of healthcare workers was gathered along with responses to: General Anxiety Disorder-7, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Beck Depression Inventory-II, Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire. Information about the need for psychological support was also gathered. RESULTS: : The regression models predicted the presence of moderate to severe symptoms for all the conditions assessed. Almost half of healthcare workers presented at least one clinically relevant symptom, and among them one in every four expressed the need of receiving psychological support. CONCLUSIONS: : Evidence calls for an increase of psychological services within the National Health System in Italy so as to guarantee for healthcare workers the psychological support necessary to cope with the long shadow of COVID-19, whose long-term impact is likely to reveal itself more strongly the more the acute stage of it is passed.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying protection measures have placed heavy demands on parents and their children. Both groups have been shown to experience stress, as families have been forced to adjust their daily routines under rapidly changing circumstances. Method: Data are based on an Austrian qualitative longitudinal study, relying on interviews and diary entries of 98 parents of kindergarten-and school-aged children who have been contacted repeatedly since the first week of the first country-wide lockdown (nine waves of data collection between March and December 2020). Data analysis employs a combination of thematic analysis and the grounded theory coding scheme. Results: Results show that parents see the pandemic as having many detrimental effects, and very few positive effects, on their children's emotional, physical and social well-being as well as their educational performance. Parents have experienced a wide variety of challenges (explaining the pandemic and the measures;handling emotions;managing new roles;accompanying children through repeated adaptation processes). To deal with these challenges, respondents developed four distinct strategies (structure, cohesion, information, and independence). Conclusion: We conclude that parents are making substantial contributions to society, and are shouldering large burdens in accompanying their children through the crisis. However, their capacity to meet all of their children's needs is limited. Thus, to prevent the pandemic from having devastating long-term consequences, it is essential to provide sufficient support for children, parents, and families.","output":"What will the coronavirus do to our kids?

HIV testing rates remain low among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China. Digital network-based secondary distribution is considered as an effective model to enhance HIV self-testing (HIVST) among key populations. Digital platforms provide opportunities for testers to apply for HIVST kits by themselves, and secondary distribution allows them to apply for multiple kits to deliver to their sexual partners or members within their social network. We describe a three-arm randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of monetary incentives and peer referral in promoting digital network-based secondary distribution of HIVST among MSM in China. METHODS: Three hundred MSM in China will be enrolled through a digital platform for data collection. The eligibility criteria include being biological male, 18 years of age or over, ever having had sex with another man, being able to apply for kits via the online platform, and being willing to provide personal telephone number for follow-up. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated into one of the three arms: standard secondary distribution arm, secondary distribution with monetary incentives arm, and secondary distribution with monetary incentives plus peer referral arm. Participants (defined as \\"index\\") will distribute actual HIV self-test kits to members within their social network (defined as \\"alter\\") or share referral links to encourage alters to apply HIV self-test kits by themselves. All index participants will be requested to complete a baseline survey and a 3-month follow-up survey. Both indexes and alters will complete a survey upon returning the results by taking a photo of the used kits with the unique identification number. DISCUSSION: HIV testing rates remain suboptimal among MSM in China. Innovative interventions are needed to further expand the uptake of HIV testing among key populations. The findings of the trial can provide scientific evidence and experience on promoting secondary distribution of HIVST to reach key populations who have not yet been covered by existing testing services.

Primary care physicians initially encounter the majority of chronic cough patients, yet their role in proper management can prove challenging due to limited access to advanced diagnostic testing. A multidisciplinary approach involving otolaryngologists and chest physicians, allergists, and gastroenterologists, among others, is central to the optimal diagnosis and treatment of conditions which underly or worsen cough. These include infectious and inflammatory, upper and lower airway pathologies, or gastro-esophageal reflux. Despite the wide armamentarium of ancillary testing conducted in cough multidisciplinary care, such management can improve cough but seldom resolves it completely. This can be due partly to the limited data on the role of tests (eg, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide), as well as classical pharmacotherapy conducted in multidisciplinary specialties for chronic cough. Other important factors include presence of multiple concomitant cough trigger mechanisms and the central neuronal complexity of chronic cough. Subsequent management conducted by cough specialists aims at control of cough refractory to prior interventions and includes cough-specific behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy with neuromodulators, among others. Preliminary data on the role of neuromodulators in a proof-of-concept manner are encouraging but lack strong evidence on efficacy and safety. OBJECTIVES: The World Allergy Organization (WAO)/Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) Joint Committee on Chronic Cough reviewed the recent literature on management of chronic cough in primary, multidisciplinary, and cough-specialty care. Knowledge gaps in diagnostic testing, classical and neuromodulator pharmacotherapy, in addition to behavioral therapy of chronic cough were also analyzed. OUTCOMES: This third part of the WAO/ARIA consensus on chronic cough suggests a management algorithm of chronic cough in an integrated care pathway approach. Insights into the inherent limitations of multidisciplinary cough diagnostic testing, efficacy and safety of currently available antitussive pharmacotherapy, or the recently recognized behavioral therapy, can significantly improve the standards of care in patients with chronic cough.","output":"WAO-ARIA consensus on chronic cough C Part III: Management strategies in primary and cough-specialty care.

RESULTS: Nine trials involving 4,112 patients were included in present meta-analysis. It was seen that hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin (HCQ-AZI) combination regimen increased the mortality rate in COVID-19 (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.63-3.36) patients, however, it also showed benefits associated with the viral clearance in patients (OR 27.18, 95% CI 1.29-574.32). HCQ-alone when used as a therapy in COVID-19 did not reveal significant changes in mortality rate, clinical progression, viral clearance and cardiac QT prolongation. Subsequent subgroup analysis showed that HCQ treatment could decrease mortality rate and progression to severe illness in severely-infected COVID-19 patients (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13-0.58). A lower risk of mortality rate was also noted in the stratified group of >14 days follow-up period (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13-0.58) compared to a?|14 days follow-up period group that conversely showed an increased mortality rate (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.41-3.10).

Compared to subjects who had other viral ARTI, HRSV-positive subjects had less fever (p =0.01) and tended to have more bronchiolitis (p =0.07). Ten subjects (11 visits) developed HRSV infection, although only one was hospitalized. HRSV was detected after a median of 5.5 palivizumab doses and a median of 14 days after the last dose. One of the 11 HRSV strains tested had a F mutation located in the palivizumab-binding site. Conclusion HRSV is still a major cause of ARTI in children receiving palivizumab, although the outcome of infected children appears mild.","output":"Human respiratory syncytial virus and other viral infections in infants receiving palivizumab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The excessive amount of information (infodemic) about SARS-COV2 is a global challenge for healthcare authorities in tackling misinformation Aim of the study was to investigate SARS-COV2 global and Italian web search amount made through a reliable information source during 2019-20 SARS-COV2 epidemic Methods From December 15th, 2019 to February 23rd, 2020, we used Google Trends to analyze global changes in the volume of searches about Coronavirus in relation to reliable sources: World Health Organization, WHO and the Italian equivalents of Ministry of Health and National Institute of Health Primary searches and associated queries (AQs) were analyzed by nation and Italian Region Results Global interest on Coronavirus progressively rose from mid-January, with 2 peaks on days 28th and 31st, fell on February 20th and rose again until day 23rd WHO searches fluctuated with no clear pattern but increased on January 26th and February 3rd 'WHO' term was among the most frequent Coronavirus AQs and viceversa Singapore, Italy and New Zealand were the most interested nations in Coronavirus, while China was at first place in Coronavirus+WHO searches In Italy from January 21st interest in Coronavirus gradually increased, with peaks on days 28th and 31st and a higher peak on February 21st The other terms showed a fluctuating trend, with peaks on January 31st for WHO and Ministry of Health and on February 21st for all of them Coronavirus was most frequently AQ to Italy and China, while AQs for the other terms were Coronavirus and WHO official website The most interested Italian Regions for Coronavirus and Coronavirus+WHO were Lazio and Friuli Venezia-Giulia, respectively Conclusions Interest in SARS-COV2 globally increased during the considered period, especially within most affected areas The associations between terms thus highlighted seems to confirm that the general population relies on trustworthy information sources Key messages Infodemic can be at the same time a danger and an opportunity during global and local health emergencies Health systems should take advantage of current search flow in order to foster reliable information sharing","output":"Infodemic: analysis of global and local 2019-20 Coronavirus epidemic search flow"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the main microvascular complications presented in the Mexican population is diabetic retinopathy which affects 27.50% of individuals with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to construct a predictive model to find out the risk factors of this complication. The dataset contained a total of 298 subjects, including clinical and paraclinical features. An analysis was constructed using machine learning techniques including Boruta as a feature selection method, and random forest as classification algorithm. The model was evaluated through a statistical test based on sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The results present significant values obtained by the model obtaining 69% of AUC. Moreover, a risk evaluation was incorporated to evaluate the impact of the predictors. The proposed method identifies creatinine, lipid treatment, glomerular filtration rate, waist hip ratio, total cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein as risk factors in Mexican subjects. The odds ratio increases by 3.5916 times for control patients which have high levels of cholesterol.

Treatments utilized in clinical practice include fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). Our aim was to compare case fatality with different reversal strategies. METHODS We pooled individual ICH patient data from 16 stroke registries in 9 countries (n = 10 282), of whom 1,797 (17%) were on VKA. After excluding 250 patients with international normalized ratio < 1.3 and/or missing data required for analysis, we compared all-cause 30-day case fatality using Cox regression. RESULTS We included 1,547 patients treated with FFP (n = 377, 24%), PCC (n = 585, 38%), both (n = 131, 9%), or neither (n = 454, 29%). The crude case fatality and adjusted hazard ratio (HR) were highest with no reversal (61.7%, HR = 2.540, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.784-3.616, p < 0.001), followed by FFP alone (45.6%, HR = 1.344, 95% CI = 0.934-1.934, p = 0.112), then PCC alone (37.3%, HR = 1.445, 95% CI = 1.014-2.058, p = 0.041), compared to reversal with both FFP and PCC (27.8%, reference). Outcomes with PCC versus FFP were similar (HR = 1.075, 95% CI = 0.874-1.323, p = 0.492); 4-factor PCC (n = 441) was associated with higher case fatality compared to 3-factor PCC (n = 144, HR = 1.441, 95% CI = 1.041-1.995, p = 0.027). INTERPRETATION The combination of FFP and PCC might be associated with the lowest case fatality in reversal of VKA-ICH, and FFP may be equivalent to PCC.

We conducted eight focus groups with Hmong adolescents (n = 12) and parents (n = 13) to learn about barriers, facilitators, and decision-making processes regarding general vaccinations and the HPV vaccine. The focus group results were analyzed using thematic analysis, informed by the socioecological model and asset lens. Findings showed that at the individual level, Hmong adolescents and parents had low HPV and HPV vaccine awareness levels (barrier) and strong desires to learn about HPV and the HPV vaccine (facilitator). Community-level barriers included salient narratives about traumatic experiences with vaccines and vaccine research, while facilitators included strong community connections. At the institutional level, barriers included structural constraints in health care settings, while facilitators included ease of obtaining vaccines at school-based clinics and provider authoritative decision-making. Additionally, a range of decision-making processes between parents, adolescents, and providers were present, with parents expressing a strong appeal to engage in more shared decision-making with providers. A linguistically and culturally specific HPV educational program for Hmong adolescents and parents could address the barriers and build on facilitators and assets to promote HPV vaccine uptake in this growing Asian-American community.","output":"We will do whatever it takes: Understanding Socioecological Level Influences on Hmong-American Adolescents and Parents Perceptions of the Human Papillomavirus Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: With the unprecedented challenges imposed on the modern healthcare system due to the COVID-19 pandemic, innovative solutions needed to be swiftly implemented to maintain clinical oversight on patient care Telemedicine was introduced in Singapore in community-based haemodialysis (HD) centres to comply with the Ministry of Health's directives on movement restriction of healthcare workers and related measures to minimise the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare facilities Methods: We describe here our experience of 26 community haemodialysis centres in Singapore, analysing clinical audit data, as well as comparing hospitalisation and mortality rates as outcomes in the time frames of preand post-introduction of telemedicine Results: We found that the hospitalisation rate was 13 9% (95% CI: 5 6%-21 5%, P&lt;0 001) lower in the period after telemedicine rounds were introduced The mortality rates per 100 person-years (95% CI) were 11 04 versus 7 99 in the compared groups, respectively, with no significant increase in mortality during the months when telemedicine was performed Conclusion: Patients received appropriate care in a timely manner, with telemedicine implementation, and such measures did not lead to suboptimal healthcare outcomes Telemedicine was a successful tool for physician oversight under movement control measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic and may continue to prove useful in the 'new normal' era of healthcare delivery for HD patients in community-based dialysis centres, operated by the National Kidney Foundation in Singapore","output":"Impact of Telemedicine on Hospitalisation and Mortality Rates in Community-Based Haemodialysis Centres in Singapore During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are major causes of nosocomial infections globally. They are the current World Health Organization critical priority pathogens for resistance, Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance and discovery of new antibiotics. However, there is paucity of data on nosocomial infections (NIs) caused by such superbugs in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study determined the magnitude and profile of nosocomial MDR A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa infections among patients hospitalized at Felegehiwot referral hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Felegehiwot referral hospital from April 1 to July 31, 2018. A total of 238 patients with blood stream, urinary tract and surgical site NIs were enrolled conveniently. Either blood, urine and wound swab specimens were collected and processed using standard bacteriological procedures. A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates were identified using standard bacteriological techniques and confirmed by automated Vitek2 Compact. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing on isolates was performed using the disk diffusion technique. The results were interpreted as per the standard zone sizes of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.Chi-square test was done to determine associations among variables. P value < 0.05 was considered statistical significant. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 29 years. Overall,20(8.4%) of patients had nosocomial MDR A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa infections. The proportion of nosocomial MDR blood stream, urinary tract and surgical site infections were 13(8.9%), 5(8.3%) and 2 (6.3%), respectively. Patients with NI had lower mean age (24.9 years) (P = 0.035). All isolates of NIs were from patients with intravenous catheterization. The frequency of NI was 9(3.8%) for MDR A. baumannii and 11(4.6%) for MDR P.aeruginosa. A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates were 100% MDR. All isolates of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were 100% resistant to ampicillin and piperacillin.A. baumannii isolates were 33.3 and 44.5% resistance against meropenem and ciprofloxacin, respectively while P.aeruginosa isolates revealed 36.4 and 45.5% resistance against ciprofloxacin and meropenem, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Health care associated infections of MDR A.baumannii and P. aeruginosa are critical problems in the study area. Therefore, urgent focused interventions required to contain the spreading of MDR NIs.

The objectives of this online survey that included both national and international families were to capture changes in access to healthcare and educational services for individuals with IDDs that occurred shortly after restrictions were initiated and to survey families on resources that could improve services for these individuals. METHODS: This was an online survey for caregivers of individuals with (1) a genetic diagnosis and (2) a neurodevelopmental diagnosis, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder or epilepsy. The survey assessed (1) demographics, (2) changes in access to educational and healthcare services and (3) available and preferred resources to help families navigate the changes in service allocation. RESULTS: Of the 818 responses (669 within the USA and 149 outside of the USA), most families reported a loss of at least some educational or healthcare services. Seventy-four per cent of parents reported that their child lost access to at least one therapy or education service, and 36% of respondents lost access to a healthcare provider. Only 56% reported that their child received at least some continued services through tele-education. Those that needed to access healthcare providers did so primarily through telemedicine. Telehealth (both tele-education and telemedicine) was reported to be helpful when available, and caregivers most often endorsed a need for an augmentation of these remote delivery services, such as 1:1 videoconference sessions, as well as increased access to 1:1 aides in the home.

The aim of this study was to assess the added value of p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the homogeneity within a group of dedicated gastrointestinal (GI) pathologists. METHODS AND RESULTS Sixty-single haematoxylin and eosin (HE) slide referral BO cases [20 low-grade dysplasia (LGD); 20 high-grade dysplasia (HGD); and 20 non-dysplastic BO reference cases] were digitalised and independently assessed twice in random order by 10 dedicated GI pathologists. After a 'wash-out' period, cases were reassessed with the addition of a corresponding p53 IHC slide. Outcomes were: (i) proportion of 'indefinite for dysplasia' (IND) diagnoses; (ii) interobserver agreement; and (iii) diagnostic accuracy as compared with a consensus 'gold standard' diagnosis defined at an earlier stage by five core expert BO pathologists after their assessment of this case set. Addition of p53 IHC decreased the mean proportion of IND diagnoses from 10 of 60 to eight of 60 (P = 0.071). Mean interobserver agreement increased significantly from 0.45 to 0.57 (P = 0.0021). The mean diagnostic accuracy increased significantly from 72% to 82% (P = 0.0072) after p53 IHC addition. CONCLUSION Addition of p53 IHC significantly improves the histological assessment of BO biopsies, even within a group of dedicated GI pathologists. It decreases the proportion of IND diagnoses, and increases interobserver agreement and diagnostic accuracy.

However, routine standardized questions about firearm access are uncommon, particularly among adult populations, who are more often asked at the discretion of health care clinicians. Because standard questions are rare, patterns of patient-reported access are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether and how patients self-report firearm access information on a routine mental health monitoring questionnaire and additionally to examine sociodemographic and clinical associations of reported access. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of patients receiving care for mental health and/or substance use in primary care or outpatient mental health specialty clinics of Kaiser Permanente Washington, an integrated health insurance provider and care delivery system. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Electronic health records were used to identify patients who completed a standardized self-reported mental health monitoring questionnaire after a single question about firearm access was added from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2019. Primary analyses evaluated response (answered vs not answered) and reported access (yes vs no) among those who answered, separately for patients seen in primary care and mental health. These analyses also evaluated associations between patient characteristics and reported firearm access. Data analysis took place from February 2020 through May 2021. RESULTS: Among patients (n = 128 802) who completed a mental health monitoring questionnaire during the study period, 74.4% (n = 95 875) saw a primary care clinician and 39.3% (n = 50 631) saw a mental health specialty clinician. The primary care and mental health samples were predominantly female (63.1% and 64.9%, respectively) and White (75.7% and 77.0%), with a mean age of 42.8 and 51.1 years. In primary care, 83.4% of patients answered the question about firearm access, and 20.9% of patients who responded to the firearm question reported having access. In mental health, 91.8% of patients answered the question, and 15.3% reported having access. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of adult patients receiving care for mental health and substance use, most patients answered a question about firearm access on a standardized mental health questionnaire. These findings provide a critical foundation to help advance understanding of the utility of standardized firearm access assessment and to inform development of practice guidelines and recommendations. Responses to standard firearm access questions used in combination with dialogue and decision-making resources about firearm access and storage may improve suicide prevention practices and outcomes.","output":"Self-reported Access to Firearms Among Patients Receiving Care for Mental Health and Substance Use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is a causative agent of Johnes disease, which is a chronic and debilitating disease in ruminants. MAP is also considered to be a possible cause of Crohns disease in humans. However, few studies have focused on the interactions between MAP and human macrophages to elucidate the pathogenesis of Crohns disease. We sought to determine the initial responses of human THP-1 cells against MAP infection using single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Clustering analysis showed that THP-1 cells were divided into seven different clusters in response to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) treatment. The characteristics of each cluster were investigated by identifying cluster-specific marker genes. From the results, we found that classically differentiated cells express CD14, CD36, and TLR2, and that this cell type showed the most active responses against MAP infection. The responses included the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as CCL4, CCL3, IL1B, IL8, and CCL20. In addition, the Mreg cell type, a novel cell type differentiated from THP-1 cells, was discovered. Thus, it is suggested that different cell types arise even when the same cell line is treated under the same conditions. Overall, analyzing gene expression patterns via scRNA-seq classification allows a more detailed observation of the response to infection by each cell type.","output":"Revealing immune responses in the Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected THP-1 cells using single cell RNA-sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to examine the socio-economic impacts on the freelance tour guides experiencing economic breakdown during the COVID-19 outbreak in Phuket The T","output":"Life Under Economic Uncertainty of Freelance Tour Guides During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Case of Phuket Tourism, Thailand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although a number of international diet and lifestyle guidelines during pregnancy (DLGP) exist in the literature, contextualization to low\\\\ and middle\\\\income settings is less common.

It is implicated in the aetiology of different neurodegenerative diseases and can induce liver injury. In addition, insulin resistance (IR) plays an essential role in the pathogenesis and the progression of liver disorders. The increased consumption of fructose contained in soft drinks and western pattern diet results in IR that along with the wide distribution of aluminium make the concurrent exposure conceivable and increase the risk of liver injury. Therefore, the present study explores the hepatotoxic effects of aluminium and fructose administered concurrently and evaluates the possible protection by monoammonium glycyrrhizinate (MAG). Liver injury was induced by the administration of aluminium chloride (34 mg/kg/day) plus 10% (w/v) fructose in drinking water. Male rats were treated with either MAG (40 mg/kg/day) or silymarin (SIL, 100 mg/kg/day). The concurrent administration of aluminium and fructose (FRUAL) induced liver injury manifested as a significant elevation of serum liver enzymes and bilirubin, as well as reduction of albumin level and prothrombin time. On the other hand, the administration of MAG improved the FRUAL-induced aberrations of liver function tests and hepatic cytoarchitecture. We assume that the MAG-induced suppression of oxidative stress, toll-like receptor 4 pathway activation, inflammation, and apoptosis play a crucial role in the hepatoprotective effect of MAG in this model. Intriguingly, the hepatoprotective effect MAG against FRUAL-induced liver injury surpasses that of the gold standard SIL, suggesting MAG as a better alternative to SIL.","output":"The concurrent exposure to aluminium and fructose induces liver injury in rats: Protection by monoammonium glycyrrhizinate."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several case reports and studies suggest that partially thrombosed large and giant aneurysms are potential sources of distal embolic events. However, there are limited data on small thrombosed aneurysms as a possible cause of ischemic events.

In each case, the aneurysm location was confirmed by a conventional angiogram. In all cases, the aneurysms were found on the proximal middle cerebral artery, in the territory corresponding to the clinical symptoms of the stroke. The mechanism of middle cerebral artery embolic event was thought to be related to the thrombus within the aneurysm, causing subsequent embolization into distal related vascular territory.

The -ketoamide derivatives represent an important class of inhibitors against the M(pro) of the SARS-CoV. While there is 99% sequence similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases, anti-SARS-CoV compounds may have a huge demonstration's prospect of their effectiveness against the SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we applied various computational approaches to investigate the inhibition potency of novel designed -ketoamide-based compounds. In this regard, a set of 21 -ketoamides was employed to construct a QSAR model, using the genetic algorithm-multiple linear regression (GA-MLR), as well as a pharmacophore fit model. Based on the GA-MLR model, 713 new designed molecules were reduced to 150 promising hits, which were later subject to the established pharmacophore fit model. Among the 150 compounds, the best selected compounds (3 hits) with greater pharmacophore fit score were further studied via molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations along with the Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) analysis.

Our aim was to investigate which clinical and laboratory parameters affect measures of TP and to validate its diagnostic accuracy in an independent cohort of patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHODS Seventy-five patients from a prospectively maintained database with proximal occlusions of the middle cerebral artery (M1) were retrospectively analyzed. Thrombi were segmented on coregistered noncontrast computed tomography and CT angiography to determine the thrombus attenuation increase and void fraction (attenuation increase relative to contralateral side). RESULTS TP measures were significantly higher in patients with cardioembolic stroke compared to patients with stroke attributed to large artery atherosclerosis (median thrombus attenuation increase [interquartile range], 2.79 [-3.54 to 8.85] versus -5.11 [-11.23 to -1.47]; P=0.001). In linear regression analysis for TP including age, time to scan, prior medication with antiplatelets or anticoagulants, and selected laboratory parameters, only stroke cause was significantly associated with TP. In multivariable binary logistic regression analysis for dichotomized stroke cause (ie, cardioembolic versus noncardioembolic stroke), only thrombus attenuation increase was independently associated with cardioembolic stroke (odds ratio of 1.12 [95% CI, 1.04-1.22]; P=0.004). Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that TP can identify cardioembolic stroke with an area under the curve of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.63-0.87) for thrombus attenuation increase. With a cutoff value of 6.23 Hounsfield units, cardioembolic strokes were identified with 100% specificity. Results for void fraction were similar.

We included 320 nasopharyngeal samples: 150 PCR negative samples to assess the specificity and 170 PCR positive samples to evaluate the sensitivity. We also evaluated their sensitivity according to cycle threshold (Ct) values and the time from the onset of symptoms. Tests were compared using the McNemars test and agreement was evaluated using the kappa score (k). RESULTS: Both Ag-RDTs showed a specificity of 100 %. Overall sensitivity was 53.5 % for CerTest and 60.0 % for Panbio. For samples with [Formula: see text] 25, sensitivity was 94.0 % for CerTest and 96.4 % for Panbio (p = 0.500). Regarding samples with Ct>25, sensitivity was 14.0 % for CerTest and 24.4 % for Panbio (p = 0.004). Sensitivity for samples within the first 5 days after the onset of symptoms were 84.8 % for CerTest and 91.3 % for Panbio (p = 0.250) and notably decreased for samples taken after the fifth day.

Consequently, ongoing research has focused on better understanding the mechanisms underlying the symptoms of this disease. Although COVID-19 symptoms span a range of organ systems, the specific changes in gene regulation that lead to the variety of symptoms are still unclear. In our study, we used publicly available transcriptome data from previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 to identify commonly regulated genes across cardiomyocytes, human bronchial epithelial cells, alveolar type II cells, lung adenocarcinoma, human embryonic kidney cells, and patient samples. Additionally, using this common core transcriptome, we could identify the genes that were specifically and uniquely regulated in bronchial epithelial cells, embryonic kidney cells, or cardiomyocytes. For example, we found that genes related to cell metabolism were uniquely upregulated in kidney cells, providing us with the first mechanistic clue about specifically how kidney cells may be affected by SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our results uncover connections between the differential gene regulation in various cell types in response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection and help identify targets of potential therapeutics.","output":"Identifying The Core Transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 Infected Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) mediated Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has affected millions of individuals around all corners of the globe.

The primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Certain variants of ACE2 are known to be associated with COVID-19 comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular complications, diabetes, chronic lung disease, etc. In this study, we looked into the geographic distribution of disease-associated variants of ACE2 as well as closely located PIR gene to explore any possible correlation with the disparities in COVID-19 severities and casualties across ethnic groups. Frequencies of the ACE2 variants associated with COVID-19 comorbidities are higher in the European and the admixed American populations. These variants are also present with stronger pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the European and the admixed American populations. On the other hand, the variants with protective role are more prevalent in the East and the South Asian populations. Strong pairwise LD exists among the activity modifying (modifier) variants of the PIR and ACE2 genes only in the European super-population.

All mice inoculated i.c. with a large dose of virus died regardless of age, although a smaller dose caused fatal infection only in suckling mice. By intranasal, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous inoculation, the virus also killed suckling mice under 16 days old, but not older mice, even with a large dose. The susceptibility of mice for the MB-67N strain was influenced by age and inoculation routes. High titres of virus were re-isolated from the brain of diseased mice after inoculation by any route, but not from other organs. Histologically, numerous areas of severe tocal necrosis were produced in the cerebral cortex. Specific immuno-fluorescence and numerous viral particles were found in the cytoplasm of nerve cells by immuno-fluorescence staining and electron microscopy.

Initial reports on the use of endoscopic vacuum therapy (EVT) of Boerhaave's syndrome are now available. This article describes the experiences gained from the clinical application in two patients using this new surgical endoscopic procedure. The current literature regarding treatment of Boerhaave's syndrome is presented. MATERIAL AND METHODS Open-pore drainage is endoscopically placed either through the transmural defect in the extraluminal wound cavity (intracavitary EVT) or overlapping the defect into the esophageal lumen (intraluminal EVT). The application of a negative pressure results in active drainage directed to the lumen and simultaneously in defect closure. Through these therapeutic measures the perforation defect and the septic focus can be healed. Open-pore drains are manufactured from drainage tubes and open-pore foam or an open-pore film. RESULTS In both patients the distal esophageal perforation defects were completely healed using EVT. In 1 patient the treatment with EVT alone lasted 8 days. For the second patient EVT was combined with an open thoracotomy for decortication of pleural empyema. The treatment with EVT lasted 23 days and 1 cycle of EVT was carried out with an new open-pore film drainage (OFD). Surgical treatment to close the defect or an esophageal resection was not necessary for both patients. In the currently available studies and single case reports of ETV for Boerhaave's syndrome, 11 patients (84 %) of a total of 13 patients have been successfully treated. CONCLUSION First clinical experiences have demonstrated that with EVT draining of the septic focus and closure of the Boerhaave defect at the gastroesophageal junction can be achieved. The EVT is an organ-preserving endoscopic surgical treatment, which can be an alternative and complementary to traditional surgery.","output":"[Endoscopic vacuum therapy for Boerhaave's syndrome]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak on mental health was of widespread concern recently.

Present study analyzes a total of 332 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from 114 asymptomatic and 218 deceased patients from twenty-one different countries to assess the mutation profile therein in order to establish the correlation between the clinical status and the observed mutations. METHODS: The mining of mutations was carried out using the GISAID CoVSurver (www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/covsurver-mutations-app) with the reference sequence hCoV-19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 present in NCBI with Accession number NC-045512.2. The impact of the mutations on SARS-CoV-2 proteins mutation was predicted using PredictSNP1(loschmidt.chemi.muni.cz/predictsnp1) which is a meta-server integrating six predictor tools: SIFT, PhD-SNP, PolyPhen-1, PolyPhen-2, MAPP and SNAP. The iStable integrated server (predictor.nchu.edu.tw/iStable) was used to predict shifts in the protein stability due to mutations. RESULTS: A total of 372 variants were observed in the 332 SARS-CoV-2 sequences with several variants present in multiple patients accounting for a total of 1596 incidences. Asymptomatic and deceased specific mutants constituted 32% and 62% of the repertoire respectively indicating their partial exclusivity. However, the most prevalent mutations were those present in both. Though some parts of the genome are more variable than others but there was clear difference between incidence and prevalence. Non-structural protein 3 (NSP3) with 68 variants had a total of only 105 incidences whereas Spike protein had 346 incidences with just 66 variants. Amongst the Deleterious variants, NSP3 had the highest incidence of 25 followed by NSP2 (16), ORF3a (14) and N (14). Spike protein had just 7 Deleterious variants out of 66. CONCLUSION: Deceased patients have more Deleterious than Neutral variants as compared to the asymptomatic ones. Further, it appears that the Deleterious variants which decrease protein stability are more significant in pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Differential mutation profile of SARS-CoV-2 proteins across deceased and asymptomatic patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To explore and describe families' and professionals' perspectives about building and maintaining engagement in telepractice early intervention (EI). METHODS Individual semi-structured reflexive interviews were conducted with Australian families of young children with communication disability receiving telepractice EI and their treating professionals. These interviews were conducted within one day of a telepractice EI session and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS Thematic analysis of 72 interviews resulted in five themes that emphasised collaboration as an overarching enabler of engagement. The themes were: (1) the delivery of family-centred telepractice was essential for engaging children and families; (2) engagement in telepractice was variable and was affected by child, parent and professional factors; (3) engagement was an investment that required time, consistency and technology; (4) maximising communication interactions during telepractice sessions encouraged children and families to engage with professionals; and (5) joint planning and preparation facilitated child and family engagement in telepractice. CONCLUSIONS In the midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the present study shed light that in many ways, engagement in in-person and telepractice intervention is similar.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of our study was to describe the uptake and impact of pharmacist-led virtual medication tours during telehealth visits in the CF clinic setting. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the cystic fibrosis pharmacist participated in in-person multidisciplinary team visits to complete medication history reconciliation, assess adherence, assess efficacy and address possible side effects of medications, and work collaboratively with the CF care team and patient to create therapeutic plans. The virtual medication tour described in this study was completed in addition or as a complement to these pre-existing pharmacist roles and responsibilities. PRACTICE INNOVATION Patients seen via telehealth visit were asked to provide a virtual tour of their medications. The pharmacist completed medication history and evaluated whether or not storage conditions were appropriate in regards to temperature, humidity, light exposure, and accessibility to children. EVALUATION METHODS The pharmacist recorded findings from the virtual medication tours, and made interventions when appropriate. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis. RESULTS Of 20 patients seen via telehealth for a quarterly visit during the first 3 months after implementation, 13 were willing to participate in a virtual medication tour. Prior to the visit, 25% had information missing from their medication list. Virtual medication tour allowed for resolution of this information 80% of the time. Three of the four participating patients with a child under 12 years old had medications stored in a location accessible to children.

The purpose of this study is to describe the cultural factors during the COVID-19 pandemic that shaped protective health behaviours in the Chinese-Canadian community, one of the largest Chinese diasporas outside of Asia. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive design was employed. Content analysis was used to analyze the data from semi-structured virtual interviews conducted with 83 adult Chinese-Canadian participants residing in a metropolitan area in the Province of Ontario, Canada. FINDINGS: The cultural factors of collectivism, information seeking behaviour, symbolism of masks, and previous experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged as themes driving the early adoption of personal protective behaviours within the Chinese-Canadian community during the first wave of COVID-19. These protective behaviours that emerged prior to the first nation-wide lockdown in Canada included physical distancing, mask use, and self-quarantine beyond what was required at the time.

Recently, because of its positive results in clinical trials, remdesivir was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19 through Emergency Use Authorization. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations and free energy perturbation methods to study the inhibition mechanism of remdesivir to its target SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We first constructed the homology model of this polymerase based on a previously available structure of SARS-CoV NSP12 RdRp (with a sequence identity of 95.8%). We then built a putative preinsertion binding structure by aligning the remdesivir + RdRp complex to the ATP bound poliovirus RdRp without the RNA template. The putative binding structure was further optimized with molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting stable preinsertion state of remdesivir appeared to form hydrogen bonds with the RNA template when aligned with the newly solved cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The relative binding free energy between remdesivir and ATP was calculated to be -2.80  0.84 kcal/mol, where remdesivir bound much stronger to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp than the natural substrate ATP. The a100-fold improvement in the Kd from remdesivir over ATP indicates an effective replacement of ATP in blocking of the RdRp preinsertion site. Key residues D618, S549, and R555 are found to be the contributors to the binding affinity of remdesivir. These findings suggest that remdesivir can potentially act as a SARS-CoV-2 RNA-chain terminator, effectively stopping its RNA replication, with key residues also identified for future lead optimization and/or drug resistance studies.","output":"Structural Basis of the Potential Binding Mechanism of Remdesivir to SARS-CoV-2 RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that mainly affects the upper airways.

In describing the experience Australians have had with working from home across 2020, via three waves of data collection, we find that WFH become a positive unintended consequence in contributing to the future management of the transport network, especially in larger metropolitan areas. Evidence suggests that support for WFH will be continuing in the form of a hybrid work model with more flexible working times and locations, linked to largely positive experiences of WFH during 2020, an improved wellbeing of employees, and no loss of productivity to the economy. We highlight potential future benefits of WFH to society, including significant implications for congestion and crowding, concluding that WFH is a formidable transport policy lever that must become embedded in the psyche of transport planners and decision makers so that we can gain some benefit from the pandemic.","output":"Working from home in Australia in 2020: Positives, negatives and the potential for future benefits to transport and society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Displacement of refugees from highly endemic areas of leishmaniasis to adjacent countries is associated with the spread of Leishmania. Syria is a country with a known high endemicity for cutaneous leishmaniasis and the presence of Syrian refugees in Lebanon has contributed to the re-emergence of the disease. The aim of this article is to evaluate the burden of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Lebanon in view of the presence of a large number of Syrian refugees. METHODS: Data regarding all cases of leishmaniasis were collected from reports by the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health-Epidemiology Surveillance (LMPH-ESU), and the World Health Organization (WHO) between 2005 and 2018. All cases were reviewed in terms of area of residence, age and gender, clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome. An extensive literature review was conducted using PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar. RESULTS: The annual number of leishmaniasis cases recorded in Lebanon between 2005 and 2011 ranged between 0 and 6 cases. In 2012, this number increased to 1275 cases and dropped to 263 in 2018, where all those infected were Syrian refugees from Aleppo, with zero cases of local transmission. Seventy-two percent of cases were seen in patients aged < 20 years. The predominant species of Leishmania was L. tropica followed by L. major. CONCLUSION: Lebanon was affected by leishmaniasis following the Syrian crisis, and the influx of refugees to the country. Accurate disease monitoring and strategic training of healthcare personnel based within refugee camps are essential for proper containment. Preventative measures remain the best way to avoid both local and adjacent spread of leishmaniasis.","output":"The Association Between the Syrian Crisis and Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Lebanon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus anginosus group (SAG) strains are common pathogens causing abscesses and bacteraemia. They are generally susceptible to ?-lactams, which constitute first-line treatment. EUCAST recommends testing penicillin G susceptibility to screen for ?-lactam resistance. Isolates categorized as susceptible (negative screening) can be reported as susceptible to aminopenicillins and third-generation cephalosporins. OBJECTIVES: To assess the reliability of penicillin G resistance screening in predicting ?-lactam resistance in SAG blood culture isolates, and to investigate isolates for which this test would be unreliable. METHODS: We determined the susceptibility to penicillin G, amoxicillin and ceftriaxone of 90 SAG blood culture isolates, all with negative penicillin G resistance screening. ?-Lactam-resistant strains were sequenced and compared with susceptible reference SAG strains. RESULTS: We detected two isolates displaying ?-lactam resistance, especially to third-generation cephalosporins, despite negative screening for penicillin G resistance. For these isolates, amino acid substitutions were identified next to the essential PBP motifs SxxK, SxN and/or KS/TGS/T. Changes in these motifs have been previously linked to ?-lactam resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that aminopenicillin and third-generation cephalosporin susceptibility should be determined for SAG strains in the event of severe infection as screening for penicillin G resistance might not be sufficient to detect resistance mechanisms that predominantly affect cephalosporins. The PBP sequencing of resistant SAG strains allowed us to detect amino acid changes potentially linked to ?-lactam resistance.","output":"Screening for ?-lactam resistance by penicillin G in the Streptococcus anginosus group challenged by rare strains with altered PBPs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The key parameter that characterizes the transmissibility of a disease is the reproduction number R If it exceeds 1, the number of incident cases will inevitably grow over time, and a large epidemic is possible To prevent the expansion of an epidemic, R must be reduced to a level below 1 To estimate the reproduction number, the probability distribution function of the generation interval of an infectious disease is required to be available;however, this distribution is often unknown In this paper, given the incomplete information for the generation interval, we propose a maximum entropy method to estimate the reproduction number Based on this method, given the mean value and variance of the generation interval, we first determine its probability distribution function and in turn estimate the real-time values of the reproduction number of COVID-19 in China and the United States By applying these estimated reproduction numbers into the susceptible-infectious-removed epidemic model, we simulate the evolutionary tracks of the epidemics in China and the United States, both of which are in accordance with that of the real incident cases","output":"Maximum entropy method for estimating the reproduction number: An investigation for COVID-19 in China and the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of the global increase in displaced people, spiking to nearly 80 million in these corona times, Japan has also seen a dramatic increase in the number of applications for refugee asylum since 2010 Despite increasing numbers of applications, Japan has not increased its refugee recognition rate Unable to return home to sure persecution when rejected, many refugees end up in Japanese detention centers once their visa expires Like jails, hospitals and detention centers everywhere, detention centers in Japan are crowded and dangerous and unable to protect the detainees inside Japan has been slower than many other countries to take precautions, including temporary release This paper outlines some of the policy shifts that have led to this dangerous situation, the conditions of anxiety inside the detention centers themselves in Tokyo and Ibaraki and the problematic situation of \\"provisional release\\" of some detainees into a corona-infested Japan without any safety net or protection We hope to not only point out the immediate danger of infection under COVID-19, but also the larger dynamic of using detention to manage a refugee asylum system that has proven to be ineffective and unjust","output":"The Whole Block Goes Down: Refugees in Japan's detention centers during the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) embodies a mixture of clinical manifestations, including elevated circulating cytokine levels, acute systemic inflammatory symptoms and secondary organ dysfunction, which was first described in the context of acute graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and was later observed in pandemics of influenza, SARS-CoV and COVID-19, immunotherapy of tumor, after chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) therapy, and in monogenic disorders and autoimmune diseases.

However, because of epidemiology of disease and regional differences in approaches to patient care, global application of PoCUS might not be possible. Before creating a PoCUS teaching course, it is critical to perform a needs analysis and recognize the training obstacles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A validated online questionnaire was given to final-year medical students at our institution to evaluate their perceptions of the applicability of specific clinical findings, and their own capability to detect these signs clinically and with PoCUS. The skill insufficiency was assessed by deducting the self-reported clinical and ultrasound skill level from the perceived usefulness of each clinical finding. RESULTS: The levels of expertise and knowledge in the 229 students who participated were not up to the expected standard. The applicability of detection of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (3.9  standard deviation [SD] 1.4) was the highest. However, detection of interstitial syndrome (3.0  SD 1.1) was perceived as the least applicable. The deficit was highest in the detection of AAA (mean 0.95  SD 2.4) and lowest for hepatomegaly (mean 0.57  SD 2.3). Although the majority agreed that training of preclinical and clinical medical students would be beneficial, 52 (22.7%) showed no interest, and 60% (n = 136) reported that they did not have the time to develop the skill. CONCLUSION: Although medical students in Saudi Arabia claim that PoCUS is an important skill, there are significant gaps in their skill, indicating the need for PoCUS training.

METHODS Enrolled patients with ASBO were randomly assigned to receive LT or NGT-G between July 2016 and November 2018.Thereafter, the cumulative surgery rate, cumulative recurrence rate, and overall survival (OS) rate were analyzed. In addition, subset analysis was conducted to determine the cumulative recurrence rate according to colonic contrast with Gastrografin at 24 h. RESULTS A total of 223 patients (LT group, n = 111; NGT-G group, n = 112) were analyzed over a median follow-up duration of 550 days. The cumulative one-year surgery rates, cumulative one-year recurrence rates, and one-year OS rates in the LT and NGT-G groups were 18.8% and 18.1%, 30.0% and 31.7%, and 99.1% and 96.6%, respectively; no significant differences were observed between both groups. In the NGT-G group, a negative colonic contrast at 24 h demonstrated a higher tendency for future recurrence compared with a positive colonic contrast at 24 h (one-year recurrence rate: negative contrast, 46.9% vs. positive contrast, 27.6%).

Overall, diversity decreased during the first quarter of 2021, with the B.1.1.7 lineage (first identified in Kent) predominant, driven by a 0.3 unit higher reproduction number over the prior wild type. During January, positive samples were more likely B.1.1.7 in younger and middle-aged adults (aged 18 to 54) than in other age groups. Although individuals infected with the B.1.1.7 lineage were no more likely to report one or more classic COVID-19 symptoms compared to those infected with wild type, they were more likely to be antibody positive 6 weeks after infection. Viral load was higher in B.1.1.7 infection as measured by cycle threshold (Ct) values, but did not account for the increased rate of testing positive for antibodies. The presence of infections with non-imported B.1.351 lineage (first identified in South Africa) during January, but not during February or March, suggests initial establishment in the community followed by fade-out.

Within a newly founded trial platform, we plan to assess the efficacy of the first two mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that reached market authorization in Switzerland in the frame of a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) while at the same time assessing the functionality of the trial platform. METHODS: We will conduct a multicenter randomized controlled, open-label, 2-arm sub-study pilot trial of a platform trial nested into two Swiss cohorts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective, multicenter group trial was approved by each institutional review board. Participants were enrolled between November 1, 2001, and April 6, 2006. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects, and patient confidentiality protocols were followed in compliance with HIPAA. Computed tomography (CT)-guided RF ablation and contrast material-enhanced 1-month follow-up CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging were performed in 49 subjects (24 men, 25 women; age range, 34-83 years) with a confirmed malignant solitary bone lesion of maximum dimension of 8 cm or smaller that was causing intractable pain. Pain intensity and patient mood were measured before and after RF ablation. Tumor imaging features were recorded. Unadjusted and adjusted linear mixed-effects models, with a random intercept for each subject, were used to model patient mood, pain relief, and pain intensity scores at three times after ablation as a function of each tumor characteristic. RESULTS Decreased postablation tumor pain correlated with preablation tumor volume (P = .02) and pathologic fracture (P = .01), while pain relief correlated with pathologic fracture (P = .03) and percentage of bone-tumor interface (BTI) ablated (P = .02). Conversely, presence of an irregular rim after ablation (P = .02) and rim thickness (P = .01) correlated with increased pain. There was no evidence in this study that RF ablation of larger tumor percentage or larger volume leads to better pain relief or decreased pain (P > .05). CONCLUSION Existing pathologic fracture and smaller tumor size appear to be predictive parameters of success when selecting patients for palliative RF ablation of painful solitary osseous metastases. Successful palliation also appears to be related to the percentage of BTI ablated.","output":"Solitary painful osseous metastases: correlation of imaging features with pain palliation after radiofrequency ablation--a multicenter american college of radiology imaging network study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic forced several countries to establish sanitary and lockdown measures to prevent the spreading of the virus. Only necessary workers were allowed to work, including health workers in hospitals. Objectives: This study explores the association between some variables and sanitary measures compliance among health workers during a pandemic. Method: A total of 299 Health workers were recruited online using social networks. Participants completed questionnaires evaluating personality, coping, Anxiety and depression, psychological flexibility and sanitary measures compliance. Results: Correlations indicated most observant participants were more likely to present efficient coping and more based on problem solving. Also, Honesty-Humility as a personality trait was positively correlated to a better compliance. Regressions indicated the perceived utility of sanitary measures was the strongest predictor for compliance among health workers. Honesty-Humility and sanitary risks perception were predictors for compliance. Conclusions: This study conducted among health workers points indicates variables associated with higher compliance. Our results suggest compliance and non-compliance as health behaviours or risk behaviours are linked to perceived threats. This perception is linked to health workers knowledges, their coping strategies, and personality.","output":"Determinants of sanitary measures and lockdown compliance among health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at increased risk for severe illness compared with nonpregnant women. Data to assess risk factors for illness severity among pregnant women with COVID-19 are limited. This study aimed to determine risk factors associated with COVID-19 illness severity among pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by molecular testing were reported during March 29, 2020CMarch 5, 2021 through the Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Network (SET-NET). Criteria for illness severity (asymptomatic, mild, moderate-to-severe, or critical) were adapted from National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization criteria. Crude and adjusted risk ratios for moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness were calculated for selected demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Among 7,950 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness was associated with age 25 years and older, healthcare occupation, pre-pregnancy obesity, chronic lung disease, chronic hypertension, and pregestational diabetes mellitus. Risk of moderate-to-severe or critical illness increased with the number of underlying medical or pregnancy-related conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Older age and having underlying medical conditions were associated with increased risk of moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness among pregnant women.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impact of physician-pharmacist collaborative health coaching on rates of hesitancy and resistance for a COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: After an initial assessment of rates of hesitancy and resistance for a COVID-19 vaccine was conducted, hesitant and resistant participants were approached, recruited, and randomized into an active and control group. Pharmacists-physicians collaborative coaching intervention was delivered to active group subjects over two months through Facebook live sessions. The outcome measures were assessed in both groups before coaching, directly after coaching, and a month after coaching. RESULTS: The proportions of hesitancy and resistance for a COVID-19 vaccine among subjects in the active group were significantly reduced from 64.3% and 35.7% before coaching to 20.1% and 7.8% directly after coaching, respectively. These proportions were further reduced to 11.1% and 3.3% a month after coaching, respectively. Furthermore, the mean scores for knowledge on, and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine were significantly increased from 4.6  1.8 and 4.1  1.7 before coaching to 7.5  3.1 and 8.9  3.8 directly after coaching, respectively. However, the change in mean score of beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines among active group subjects was not significant. CONCLUSION: High rates of hesitancy and resistance for a COVID-19 vaccine were found in Jordan.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was conducted. This included patients hospitalised with pneumonia and investigated for suspected PE with computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). Cases were defined as patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from 1 March 2020 to 17 May 2020; controls were patients with CAP from 5 July 2019 to 31 January 2020. The primary outcome was to determine the risk of developing PE in both groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio for PE. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-four patients were included; 72 cases (47% male; mean age 59 (15) years), and 72 controls (56% male; mean age 58 (20) years). PE was diagnosed in 23.6% of the cases versus 6.9% of the controls. The adjusted odds ratio for PE in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia compared with those with CAP was 3.23 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-10.04, p=0.04).

In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is currently a major threat to public health worldwide. The spike (S) homotrimers bind to their receptors via the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is a major target to block viral entry. In this study, we selected Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) as models. Their RBDs exist two different conformational states (lying or standing) in the prefusion S-trimer structure. Then, the differences in the immune responses to RBDs from these coronaviruses were analyzed structurally and immunologically. Our results showed that more RBD-specific antibodies (antibody titers: 1.28105; 2.75105) were induced by the S-trimer with the RBD in the \\"standing\\" state (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) than the S-trimer with the RBD in the \\"lying\\" state (HCoV-229E, antibody titers: <500), and more S-trimer-specific antibodies were induced by the RBD in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (antibody titers: 6.72105; 5105) than HCoV-229E (antibody titers:1.125103). Besides, we found that the ability of the HCoV-229E RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies was lower than S-trimer, and the intact and stable S1 subunit was essential for producing efficient neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-229E. Importantly, our results reveal different vaccine strategies for coronaviruses, and S-trimer is better than RBD as a target for vaccine development in Alpha-coronavirus Our findings will provide important implications for future development of coronavirus vaccines.Importance Outbreak of coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2, poses a serious threat to global public health. Development of vaccines to prevent the coronaviruses that can infect humans has always been a top priority. Coronavirus spike (S) protein is considered as a major target for vaccine development. Currently, structural studies have shown that Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) RBDs are in \\"lying\\" and \\"standing\\" states in the prefusion S-trimer structure. Here, we evaluated the ability of S-trimer and RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that the S-trimer and RBD are both candidates for subunit vaccines in Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) with a RBD \\"standing\\" state. However, for Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) with a RBD \\"lying\\" state, the S-trimer may be more suitable for subunit vaccines than the RBD.

Cancer patients are one of the most vulnerable groups in the current (COVID-19) pandemic. To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients remain widely not well understood. Patients and methods A retrospective study was conducted in Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust for COVID-19 Cancer patients. Hospitalised cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection were identified between 30th March 2020 to 30th June 2020. Patients already have been diagnosed with cancer and had a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Clinical retrospective data were collected from hospital medical records, including demographic features, clinical features, laboratory findings, and chest radiograph and chest computed tomography (CT) images. Statistical analysis was done to assess the risk factors associated with severe events which required admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death Results Forty Cancer patients with Covid 19 infection during the period from 30th March 2020 to 30th June 2020 were enrolled. (52.6%) 22 of patients were females. Median age was 65 years .All patients were local residents of Wolverhampton. Among the cancer patients, Breast cancer was the most frequent type of cancer (n= 9;21.1%), followed by Gl cancers (n= 8;21%) and lymphoma (n = 6;15.8%).Twenty two patients (52.6%) were diagnosed with stage I-III cancer.18 patients (47.4%) were on active chemotherapy, 3 patients were on target therapy and 3 patients(7.9%) were on active immunotherapy. In addition to cancer, 31 (81.6%) patients had at least one or more coexisting chronic diseases. The most common clinical features on admission were fever (92.1%), dry cough (86.8%), and fatigue (92%);29 (76.3%) patients developed dyspnoea along with lymphopaenia (n = 32, 84.2%), high level C-reactive protein (n = 40, 100%), anaemia (n = 22, 57.9 %), and hypoproteinaemia (n = 21, 55.3%). The common chest computed tomography (CT) findings were ground-glass opacity (n = 13) and patchy consolidation (n= 4) .It is important to note that CT chest not done in 17 patients. A total of 19 patients had severe events and the mortality rate was (44.7%) .Median days of hospital admission was (12.5).It is noted that all patients with active immunotherapy had recovered despite disease progression.

Because of a concern for reemergence or a deliberate release of the SARS coronavirus, vaccine development was initiated. Evaluations of an inactivated whole virus vaccine in ferrets and nonhuman primates and a virus-like-particle vaccine in mice induced protection against infection but challenged animals exhibited an immunopathologic-type lung disease. DESIGN: Four candidate vaccines for humans with or without alum adjuvant were evaluated in a mouse model of SARS, a VLP vaccine, the vaccine given to ferrets and NHP, another whole virus vaccine and an rDNA-produced S protein. Balb/c or C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated IM on day 0 and 28 and sacrificed for serum antibody measurements or challenged with live virus on day 56. On day 58, challenged mice were sacrificed and lungs obtained for virus and histopathology. RESULTS: All vaccines induced serum neutralizing antibody with increasing dosages and/or alum significantly increasing responses. Significant reductions of SARS-CoV two days after challenge was seen for all vaccines and prior live SARS-CoV. All mice exhibited histopathologic changes in lungs two days after challenge including all animals vaccinated (Balb/C and C57BL/6) or given live virus, influenza vaccine, or PBS suggesting infection occurred in all. Histopathology seen in animals given one of the SARS-CoV vaccines was uniformly a Th2-type immunopathology with prominent eosinophil infiltration, confirmed with special eosinophil stains. The pathologic changes seen in all control groups lacked the eosinophil prominence. CONCLUSIONS: These SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS-CoV. However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of Th2-type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components was induced.

While preemptive school closures can effectively reduce influenza transmission, they are disruptive and currently recommended only for pandemics. We assessed the feasibility of implementing other social distancing practices in K-12 schools as a first step in seeking an alternative to preemptive school closures. METHODS: We conducted 36 focus groups with education and public health officials across the United States. We identified and characterized themes and compared feasibility of practices by primary versus secondary school and region of the United States. RESULTS: Participants discussed 29 school practices (25 within-school practices implemented as part of the school day and 4 reduced-schedule practices that impact school hours). Participants reported that elementary schools commonly implement several within-school practices as part of routine operations such as homeroom stay, restriction of hall movement, and staggering of recess times. Because of routine implementation and limited use of individualized schedules within elementary schools, within-school practices were generally felt to be more feasible for elementary schools than secondary schools. Of reduced-schedule practices, shortening the school week and the school day was considered the most feasible; however, reduced-schedule practices were generally perceived to be less feasible than within-school practices for all grade levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that schools have many options to increase social distance other than closing.

As found by several authors, air quality can inherently exacerbate the risks linked to respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. In this study, we explore patterns of air pollution for ten of the most affected countries in the world, in the context of the 2020 development of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that the concentrations of some of the principal atmospheric pollutants were temporarily reduced during the extensive lockdowns in the spring. Secondly, we show that the seasonality of the atmospheric pollutants is not significantly affected by these temporary changes, indicating that observed variations in COVID-19 conditions are likely to be linked to air quality.

CICI causes a range of impairments that can have a significant negative impact on quality of life. Knowledge of the prevalence of this condition is required to inform survivorship plans, and ensure adequate resource allocation and support is available for sufferers, hence a systematic review of prevalence data was performed. Medline, Scopus, CINAHL and PSYCHInfo were searched for eligible studies which included prevalence data on CICI, as ascertained though the use of self-report, or neuropsychological tests. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed. Findings were synthesised narratively, with meta-analyses being used to calculate pooled prevalence when impairment was assessed by neuropsychological tests. The review included 52 studies.

To investigate this critical question, we conducted a clinical meta-analysis including all available currently reported cases of potential COVID-19 reinfections. METHODS We searched for all peer-reviewed articles in the search engine of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. While there are over 30.000 publications on COVID-19, only about 15 specifically target the subject of COVID-19 reinfections. Available patient data in these reports was analyzed for age, gender, time of reported relapse after initial infection and persistent COVID-19 positive PCR results. RESULTS Following the first episode of infection, cases of clinical relapse are reported at 34 (mean)  10,5 days after full recovery. Patients with clinical relapse have persisting positive COVID-19 PCR testing results until 39  9 days following initial positive testing. For patients without clinical relapse, positive testing was reported up to 54  24 days. There were no reports of any clinical reinfections after a 70-day period following initial infection. CONCLUSIONS Reports of COVID-19 reinfections all appear within a vulnerable timeframe, where affected patients are still tested positive for COVID-19 via PCR. According to our data, it is most likely that all reported cases of COVID-19 reinfections are in fact protracted initial infections.

Moreover, recent studies show that SARS-CoV-2 may have multiple receptors that need to be further revealed. SARS-CoV-2 shares similar sequences of the spike protein with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which can invade host cells by binding to either DPP4 or sialic acids. Sialic acids can be linked to the terminal of glycoproteins and gangliosides are used as one of the receptors of many types of viruses. Therefore, it is very interesting to determine whether sialic acid is a potential receptor of SARS-CoV-2. To address this question, we took N-Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), a type of predominant sialic acid found in human cells, as the molecular probe to computationally search the surface of the spike protein to locate the potential binding sites of Neu5Ac. SPR analysis and mass spectrum analysis confirmed the interaction between Neu5Ac and spike protein. This study shows that sialic acids can moderately interact with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 by binding between the two RBDs of the spike protein, indicating it could be a potential secondary or auxiliary receptor of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Identification of Potential Binding Sites of Sialic Acids on the RBD Domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (CoronaVac,Sinovac, or SV) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Vaxzevria,Oxford-Astra Zeneca, or AZ) vaccines have been administered to the health care workers (HCWs) in Thailand.

At 4 weeks after completing the SV vaccination, 60.6% (95%CI:50.0-70.6%) had seroconversion evaluated by sVNT([]68%inhibition), comparable to the patients recovered from mild COVID-19 infection(69.0%), with a rapid reduction to 12.2%(95%CI:6.3-20.8) at 12 weeks. In contrast, 85.7%(95%CI:76.8-92.2%) HCWs who completed the second dose of the AZ for 4 weeks had seroconversion, comparable to the COVID-19 pneumonia patients(92.5%). When using the anti-SAR-CoV-2 total antibody level([]132 U/ml) criteria, only 71.3% HCWs in the SV group had seroconversion, compared to 100% in the AZ group. Conclusion: A rapid decline of short-term immune response in the HCWs after the SV vaccination indicates the need for a vaccine booster, particularly during the ongoing spreading of the SAR-CoV-2 variants of concern.","output":"Short-Term Immune Response After Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (CoronaVac, Sinovac) And ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Vaxzevria, Oxford-AstraZeneca) Vaccinations in Thai Health Care Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There has been increasing recognition that certain vulnerable populations in the United States of America struggle to meet their menstruation-related needs, including people experiencing homelessness. Media and policy attention on this subject has focused on the provision of free menstrual products to vulnerable populations, including a New York City legislative bill, which guarantees access to menstrual products for Department of Homeless Services shelter residents (Intros 1123-A). METHODS: This qualitative study explored the challenges people experiencing homelessness in New York City face in accessing menstrual products. Data collection was conducted from June to August 2019 and included: Semi-structured key informant interviews with staff from relevant government agencies and homeless service providers (n = 15), and semi-structured in-depth interviews with individuals with experience living on the street and in shelters (n = 22). Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Key themes that emerged included: (1) insufficient and inconsistent access to menstrual products; (2) systemic challenges to providing menstrual products; and (3) creative solutions to promote access to menstrual products. Both shelter- and street-living individuals reported significant barriers to accessing menstrual products. While both populations struggle, those in shelters were more likely to be able to purchase menstrual products or access free products at their shelter, while those living on the streets were more likely to have to resort to panhandling, theft, or using makeshift materials in place of menstrual products. Across both populations, individuals described barriers to accessing free products at shelters and service providers, primarily due to distribution systems that rely on gatekeepers to provide a few pads or tampons at a time, sometimes of inadequate quality and only upon request. Shelters and service providers also described challenges providing these products, including inconsistent supply. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the critical importance of expanding and improving initiatives seeking to provide access to menstrual products for vulnerable populations. Despite policy level efforts to support menstrual product access, individuals experiencing homelessness in New York City, whether living in shelters or on the street, are often not able to access the menstrual products that they need to manage their monthly menstrual flow.","output":"Seeking menstrual products: a qualitative exploration of the unmet menstrual needs of individuals experiencing homelessness in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, every public health system faced the potential challenge of medical capacity shortages. Infections without timely diagnosis or treatment may facilitate the stealth transmission and spread of the virus. Using infection and medical capacity information reported in Wuhan in China, New York State in the United States, and Italy, we developed a dynamic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to estimate the impact of medical capacity shortages during the COVID-19 outbreak at the city, state, and country levels. After accounting for the effects of travel restrictions and control measures, we find that the number of infections in Wuhan could have been 39% lower than the actual number if the medical capacity were doubled in this city. Similarly, we find the less shortages in medical capacity in both New York state and Italy, the faster decline in the daily infection numbers and the fewer deaths. This study provides a method for estimating potential shortages and explains how they may dynamically facilitate disease spreading during future pandemics such as COVID-19.","output":"Medical Capacity Shortages Facilitated the Rapid Dissemination of COVID-19 in Wuhan, New York State, and Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Every year, millions of children undergo medical procedures that require anesthesia. Fear and anxiety are common among young children undergoing such procedures and can interfere with the childs recovery and well-being. Relaxation, distraction, and education are methods that can be used to prepare children and help them cope with fear and anxiety, and serious games may be a suitable medium for these purposes. User-centered design emphasizes the involvement of end users during the development and testing of products, but involving young, preschool children may be challenging. OBJECTIVE: One objective of this study was to describe the development and usability of a computer-based educational health game intended for preschool children to prepare them for upcoming anesthesia. A further objective was to describe the lessons learned from using a child-centered approach with the young target group. METHODS: A formative mixed methods child (user)-centered study design was used to develop and test the usability of the game. Preschool children (4-6 years old) informed the game design through playful workshops (n=26), and usability testing was conducted through game-playing and interviews (n=16). Data were collected in Iceland and Finland with video-recorded direct observation and interviews, as well as childrens drawings, and analyzed with content analysis and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The children shared their knowledge and ideas about hospitals, different emotions, and their preferences concerning game elements. Testing revealed the high usability of the game and provided important information that was used to modify the game before publishing and that will be used in its further development. CONCLUSIONS: Preschool children can inform game design through playful workshops about health-related subjects that they are not necessarily familiar with but that are relevant for them. The games usability was improved with the participation of the target group, and the game is now ready for clinical testing.","output":"Developing a Health Game to Prepare Preschool Children for Anesthesia: Formative Study Using a Child-Centered Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Childhood obesity continues to be a serious problem The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to great life-changing challenges amongst schoolchildren, which might subsequently aggravate existing childhood obesity issues We suggest that educators and schools need to provide solutions to the problem ? 2021 The Author(s) This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4 0 International License (CC-BY 4 0), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited See http://creativecommons org/licenses/by/4 0/","output":"Obesity prevention environment: Is it time to empower educators and remobilize schools in the post-COVID-19 period?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tocotrienols (T3) are vitamin E components that inhibit 3-hydroxy 3-methyl glutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR), a primary target for cholesterol management.

Translational challenges include restoring hMSC efficacy following cryopreservation, developing effective xenogeneic-free (XF) hMSCs and establishing true therapeutic potential at a clinically relevant time point of administration. We wished to determine whether cytokine pre-activation of cryopreserved, bone marrow-derived XF-hMSCs would enhance their capacity to facilitate injury resolution following VILI and elucidate mechanisms of action. METHODS: Initially, in vitro studies examined the potential for the secretome from cytokine pre-activated XF-hMSCs to attenuate pulmonary epithelial injury induced by cyclic mechanical stretch. Later, anaesthetised rats underwent VILI and, 6 h following injury, were randomized to receive 1  10(7) XF-hMSC/kg that were (i) naive fresh, (ii) naive cryopreserved, (iii) cytokine pre-activated fresh or (iv) cytokine pre-activated cryopreserved, while control animals received (v) vehicle. The extent of injury resolution was measured at 24 h after injury. Finally, the role of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) in mediating the effect of pre-activated XF-hMSCs was determined in a pulmonary epithelial wound repair model. RESULTS: Pre-activation enhanced the capacity of the XF-hMSC secretome to decrease stretch-induced pulmonary epithelial inflammation and injury. Both pre-activated fresh and cryopreserved XF-hMSCs enhanced resolution of injury following VILI, restoring oxygenation, improving lung compliance, reducing lung leak and improving resolution of lung structural injury. Finally, the secretome of pre-activated XF-hMSCs enhanced epithelial wound repair, in part via a KGF-dependent mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: Cytokine pre-activation enhanced the capacity of cryopreserved, XF-hMSCs to promote injury resolution following VILI, potentially via a KGF-dependent mechanism.","output":"Cytokine pre-activation of cryopreserved xenogeneic-free human mesenchymal stromal cells enhances resolution and repair following ventilator-induced lung injury potentially via a KGF-dependent mechanism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently emerged in China and caused a global pandemic WHO announced that COVID-19 could be charac-terised as a pandemic due to unprecedented swift global spread and severity of the outbreak When infected with the virus, patients usually have a fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, myalgia, headache and sometimes diarrhoea Updates on molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, treatment and epidemiological control are more important to help optimise the disease control measures Thrombotic complication is an essential issue in patients infected with COVID-19 Concomitant venous thromboembolism (VTE) seems to be a potential cause of unexplained deaths in COVID-19 cases Thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer, prolonged prothrombin time, and disseminated intravascular coagulation are the clinical findings related to such condition In China, anticoagu-lant therapy in severe COVID-19 was suggested for improving outcome Studies showed the urgency for VTE diagnostic strategies Aetiology may be mul-tifactorial, and therefore, we review the available literature relevant to acute venous thromboembolism associated with novel coronavirus infection","output":"COVID-19 associated thromboembolism: Causing the respiratory failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental illness that causes significant disability. However, the lack of evidence for functional decline yields difficulty in distinguishing patients with schizophrenia from healthy adults. Since patients with schizophrenia demonstrate severe facial emotion recognition deficit (FERD), FERD measurement appears to be a promising solution for the aforementioned challenge.We aimed to develop a FERD-based screening tool to differentiates patients with schizophrenia from healthy adults. METHODS Patients' responses were extracted from a previous study. The most discriminative index was determined by comparing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of patients' FER scores in 7 domains individually and collectively. The best cut-off score was selected only for the most discriminative index to provide both high sensitivity and specificity ( 0.90). RESULTS The \\"number of domains failed\\" showed the highest discriminative value (AUC = 0.92). Since high sensitivity and specificity could not be achieved simultaneously, two sub-optimal cut-off scores were recommended for prospective users. For users prioritizing sensitivity, the \\" 2 domains failed\\" index yields high sensitivity (0.96) with modest specificity (0.66). For users targeting specificity, the \\" 4 domains failed\\" indexachieves high specificity (0.92) with acceptable sensitivity (0.72). LIMITATIONS Convenience sampling with mild clinical severity and younger healthy adults (< 20 years old) may limit the generalizability. CONCLUSION The FERD screener seems to be a discriminative tool with changeable cut-off scores achieving high sensitivity or specificity.

The limited data that exist regarding the utility of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in these critically ill patients show poor overall outcomes. This report describes our institutional practice regarding the application and management of ECMO support for patients with COVID-19 and reports promising early outcomes. METHODS: All critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 evaluated for ECMO support from March 10, 2020, to April 24, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were evaluated for ECMO support based on a partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of less than 150 mm Hg or pH of less than 7.25 with a partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide exceeding 60 mm Hg with no life-limiting comorbidities. Patients were cannulated at bedside and were managed with protective lung ventilation, early tracheostomy, bronchoscopies, and proning, as clinically indicated. RESULTS: Among 321 patients intubated for COVID-19, 77 patients (24%) were evaluated for ECMO support, and 27 patients (8.4%) were placed on ECMO. All patients were supported with venovenous ECMO. Current survival is 96.3%, with only 1 death to date in more than 350 days of total ECMO support. Thirteen patients (48.1%) remain on ECMO support, and 13 patients (48.1%) have been successfully decannulated. Seven patients (25.9%) have been discharged from the hospital. Six patients (22.2%) remain in the hospital, of which 4 are on room air. No health care workers who participated in ECMO cannulation developed symptoms of or tested positive for COVID-19.

METHODS: We propose a new mathematical model to estimate the impact of vaccination delay against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the number of cases and deaths due to the disease in Brazil. We apply the model to Brazil as a whole and to the State of Sao Paulo, the most affected by COVID-19 in Brazil. We simulated the model for the populations of the State of Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole, varying the scenarios related to vaccine efficacy and compliance from the populations. RESULTS: The model projects that, in the absence of vaccination, almost 170 thousand deaths and more than 350 thousand deaths will occur by the end of 2021 for Sao Paulo and Brazil, respectively. If in contrast, Sao Paulo and Brazil had enough vaccine supply and so started a vaccination campaign in January with the maximum vaccination rate, compliance and efficacy, they could have averted more than 112 thousand deaths and 127 thousand deaths, respectively. In addition, for each month of delay the number of deaths increases monotonically in a logarithmic fashion, for both the State of Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole.

This Editorial highlights a study by Aliu and colleagues in the current issue of the Journal of Neurochemistry, in which the investigators constructed a biodegradable poly-l-lysine backbone with multiple copies of this sulfated HNK-1 trisaccharide. This decoy, poly(phenyl disodium 3-O-sulfo-?-d-glucopyranuronate)-(1a3)-?-d-galactopyranoside, known as PPSGG, removed anti-MAG IgM autoantibodies from the blood, while not activating the immune system. These findings provide a path for the selective removal of a pathogenic set of antibodies that target the myelin sheath resulting in neuropathy. These findings are applicable to a parallel strategy for the generation of polysaccharides similar to those present in the receptor-binding domain of CoViD-19, which might inhibit viral adhesion to its receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein, thereby impairing cellular uptake of the virus itself. The deployment of complex polysaccharides that mimic actual COVID19 polysaccharides on the spike protein may also provide a feasible structural basis for a vaccine. Carbohydrate mimics, if conjugated to a carrier or backbone, might provoke an immune response to the spike protein. A vaccine that targets critical carbohydrates on COVID19, and then neutralizes the virus would recapitulate a successful strategy employed in other microbial vaccines, like the pneumococcal vaccines and the meningococcal vaccines. These vaccines direct an immune response to complex carbohydrates and successfully prevent life-threatening disease.

Many have speculated on the pathogenesis and clinical characteristics of these disturbances; however, no definite answers have been produced on the topic. With this systematic review, we aimed to collect all the available evidence regarding the prevalence of OGD, the timing of their onset and their resolution, their rate of recovery and their role as diagnostic and prognostic tools for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: A systematic review comprising all the observational studies that reported the prevalence and/or the longitudinal trajectories of OGD in COVID-19 patients, as self-reported by patients or measured through objective psychophysical tests. RESULTS: After the selection process, 155 studies were included, with a total of 70920 patients and 105291 not-infected individuals. Prevalence reports were extremely variable across studies, with wide ranges for OD (0% - 98%) and GD (0-89%) prevalence. OGD occurred early during the disease course and only rarely preceded other symptoms; out of 30 studies with a follow-up time of at least 20 days, only in 5 studies OGD fully resolved in more than 90% of patients. OGD had low sensitivity and high specificity for SARS-CoV-2 infection; accuracy of OD and GD for infection identification was higher than 80% in 10 out of 33 studies and in 8 out of 22 studies considered, respectively. 28 out of 30 studies that studied the association between OGD and disease severity found how OGD were associated with lower rates of severe pneumonia, hospitalization and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: OGD seem to be highly prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They occur early, concomitantly with other symptoms and often persist after recovery, in some cases for months; whether a full recovery eventually occurs in all cases is not clear yet.

When assuming a consistent year-on-year positive trend in emissions, results show that during the onset of the global slowdown (MarchCApril 2020) energy sector CH4 emissions from China increased above expected levels;however, during later months (MayCJune 2020) emissions decreased below expected levels. Results for the first 6 months of 2019/20 suggest that the accumulated impact of the COVID-19 slowdown on CH4 emissions from MarchCJune 2020 might be small relative to the long-term positive trend in emissions. Changes in OH concentration, not investigated here, may have contributed to the observed growth in 2020.","output":"Quantification of methane emissions from hotspots and during COVID-19 using a global atmospheric inversion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, smartphone users are interested in large volumes to view live videos and sharing video resources over social media (e.g., Youtube, Netflix). The continuous streaming of video in mobile devices faces many challenges in network parameters namely bandwidth estimation, congestion window, throughput, delay, and transcoding is a challenging and time-consuming task. To perform these resource-intensive tasks via mobile is complicated, and hence, the cloud is integrated with smartphones to provide Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). To resolve the issue, we propose a novel framework called delay aware bandwidth estimation and intelligent video transcoder in mobile cloud. In this paper, we introduced four techniques, namely, Markov Mobile Bandwidth Cloud Estimation (MMBCE), Cloud Dynamic Congestion Window (CDCW), Queue-based Video Processing for Cloud Server (QVPS), and Intelligent Video Transcoding for selecting Server (IVTS). To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we implemented a testbed using the two mobile configurations and the public cloud server Amazon Web Server (AWS). The study and results in a real environment demonstrate that our proposed framework can improve the QoS requirements and outperforms the existing algorithms. Firstly, MMBCE utilizes the well-known Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to estimate the best bandwidth of mobile using reward function. MMBCE improves the performance of 50% PDR compared with other algorithms. CDCW fits the congestion window and reduces packet loss dynamically. CDCW produces 40% more goodput with minimal PLR. Next, in QVPS, the M/M/S queueing model is processed to reduce the video processing delay and calculates the total service time. Finally, IVTS applies the M/G/N model and reduces 6% utilization of transcoding workload, by intelligently selecting the minimum workload of the transcoding server. The IVTS takes less time in slow and fast mode. The performance analysis and experimental evaluation show that the queueing model reduces the delay by 0.2 ms and the servers utilization by 20%. Hence, in this work, the cloud minimizes delay effectively to deliver a good quality of video streaming on mobile.","output":"Delay - aware bandwidth estimation and intelligent video transcoder in mobile cloud"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many countries in the world including Vietnam have taken precautionary measures such as school and university lockdowns and shifted to full E-learning mode due to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases.

Under an assumed constant control reproduction number, we provide simple conditions for the disease to be eliminated, and conversely for it to exhibit the more likely endemic behaviour. With regard to Covid-19, it is shown that if the control reproduction number is set to the basic reproduction number (say 6) of the dominant delta (B1.617.2) variant, vaccination alone, even under the most optimistic of assumptions about vaccine efficacy and high vaccine coverage, is very unlikely to lead to elimination of the disease. The model is not intended to be predictive but more an aid to understanding the relative importance of various biological and control parameters. For example, from a long-term perspective, it may be found that in the UK, through changes in societal behaviour (such as mask use, ventilation, and level of homeworking), without formal government interventions such as on-off lockdowns, the control reproduction number can still be maintained at a level significantly below the basic reproduction number. Even so, our simulations show that endemic behaviour ensues.

The main route of transmission is believed to be through coronavirus-bearing respiratory droplets. The respiratory droplets have a wide spectrum in droplet size, ranging from very small droplets (aerosol droplets) to large droplets of tens and even hundreds of m in size. The large droplets are expected to move like projectiles under the action of gravity force, buoyancy force and air resistance. Droplet motion is complicated by droplet evaporation, which reduces droplet size in its trajectory and affects the force acting on it. The present work attempts to determine the trajectories of the large droplets by using a simplified single-droplet approach. It aims at providing a clear physical picture to elucidate the mechanics involved in single droplet motion and the various factors affecting the range. Assuming an indoor environment with an air temperature of 18 C and relative humidity of 50%, the horizontal range L x of large respiratory droplets (diameter 120 m-200 m) in common respiratory activities are as follows: Speaking, L x &#8776; 0.16 m-0.68 m, coughing, L x &#8776; 0.58 m-1.09 m, and sneezing, L x &#8776; 1.34 m-2.76 m.

To assure proper sample collection, sample adequacy controls (SACs) are needed that detect substances indicative of samples collected within the oral cavity. This study evaluated two candidate SACs for this purpose. One detected representative oral microbiota (Streptococcus species DNA) and the other, human cells (human mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays for the two target cell types were applied to buccal swabs (representing samples collected within the oral cavity) and hand swabs (representing improperly collected samples) obtained from 51 healthy U.S. volunteers. Quantification cycle (Cq) cutoffs that maximized Youdens index were established for each assay. The streptococcal target at a Cq cutoff of 34.9 had 99.0% sensitivity and specificity for oral swab samples, whereas human mtDNA perfectly distinguished between hand and mouth swabs with a Cq cutoff of 31.3. The human mtDNA test was then applied to buccal, tongue, and gum swabs that had previously been collected from TB patients and controls in South Africa, along with air swabs collected as negative controls (total N = 292 swabs from 71 subjects). Of these swabs, 287/292 (98%) exhibited the expected Cq values. In a paired analysis the three oral sites yielded indistinguishable amounts of human mtDNA, however PurFlockTM swabs collected slightly more human mtDNA than did OmniSwabsTM (p = 0.012).

METHODS: on 01 April 2020, we constructed a rapid spatial diagnostics and generated vulnerability map for COVID-19 infection spread at state level using 12 core spatial drivers. The risk factors used include established COVID-19 cases (as at 01 April 2020), population, proximity to the airports, inter-state road traffic, intra-state road traffic, intra city traffic, international road traffic, possible influx of elites from abroad, preponderance of high risk political elite, likelihood of religious gathering, likelihood of other social gatherings, and proximity to existing COVID-19 test centers. These were also tested as predictors of COVID-19 spread using multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: the results show that 6 States - Lagos, Kano, Katsina, Kaduna, Oyo and Rivers - and the Federal Capital Territory have very high vulnerability, 17 states have high vulnerability and 13 states have medium vulnerability to COVID-19 transmission. Several drivers show a strong association with COVID-19 with the coefficient of correlation ranging from 0.983 - 0.995.

Moving from pre-wired to wireless geophones faces major challenges given the enormous amount of data that needs to be transmitted from geophones to the on-site data collection center.

While transmitting the seismic data wirelessly, impairments like interference, multi-path fading, and channel noise need to be considered. Therefore, in this work, a novel amalgamation of blind channel identification and deep neural networks is proposed. As a geophone already is responsible for transmitting a tremendous amount of data under tight timing constraints, the proposed setup eschews sending any additional training signals for the purpose of mitigating the channel effects.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2014 in the four northern regions of Sweden. A total of 24 795 participants (48% response rate) aged 18 to 84 years were involved in the study. A log-binomial regression was used to measure the association between sociodemographic factors and trust in the health system. RESULTS: Two thirds of the participants (68.5%) reported high trust in the health system i.e. had very much or quite a lot confidence in the health system. Women had lower prevalence of trust compared to men (PR = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.94C0.98) while older participants had a higher trust compared to youth (PR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.06C1.16).

In this paper, we have proposed a novel AI-powered data management framework for smart city named IoT-to-Edge-to-Fog-to-cloudlet-to-Cloud (IEF2C) data management framework which will be exploited to identify the COVID-19 suspected patients in smart cities and also be used to inform the surrounding people about the suspected patient. The proposed framework is isolated into five layers which have different tasks such as data collection, processing, authentication and storage. The framework will bring all the citizens under a common platform as well as will ensure the user and device mobility. It will mitigate the information gap by helping concerned authorities and users to take proper steps in such a pandemic era.","output":"IEF2C: A novel AI-powered framework for suspected COVID-19 patient detection and contact tracing in smart cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Events such as Covid-19 have revealed the vulnerabilities that companies face due to low visibility. Consequently, companies experience impact on their supply chains in terms of disruptions of material supply, deliveries, productivity and revenue. Thus, the importance of Supply Chain Visibility (SCV) in global and competitive markets with increasing sustainability demands has received widespread recognition. Yet, the literature provides limited understanding of requirements to consider when developing a SCV system. Addressing the gap, this study presents the findings from a case study during the first months of 2021 at a global manufacturing company developing a SCV system to improve their inbound flow. Using a system engineering perspective, this study presents requirements highlighted during early stage for a SCV system. The results indicate the importance of ensuring SCV system requirements to enable data collection, handling and usage for decision making leading to both supply chain sustainability and resilience. This study contributes to the understanding of SCV by presenting and categorizing requirements considered for real-time case at a manufacturing company when developing a SCV system. ? 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","output":"Requirements on Supply Chain Visibility: A Case on Inbound Logistics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: A comprehensive assessment of visual functioning at an early age is important not only for identifying and defining visual impairment but also for planning personalized rehabilitation programs based on the visual diagnosis. Since existing tools to evaluate visual functioning present some important limitations (e.g., they are based on qualitative reports, they do not take into account environmental adaptations of visual testing or they have not been formally validated as clinical instruments), the present work has the main aim to propose a new clinical tool (Visual Function Score, VFS) to detect and define visual disorders at an early age. Methods: The Visual Function Score was administered to one hundred visually impaired children (age range 4 months to 17.75 years old) in the form of a professional-reported protocol for a total of 51 items, each of which is assigned a score from 1 to 9 (or from 0 to 9 in some specific cases). The VFS produces three sub-scores and a global score (from 0 to 100), resulting in a quantitative evaluation of visual functioning. Results: The VFS can detect the well-known differences between different types of visual impairment (cerebral, oculomotor, and peripheral or grouped as central and peripheral) and takes into account different environments in the definition of a quantitative score of visual functioning. Discussion: Overall, the use of a quantitative tool to evaluate visual functions and functional vision such as the VFS would be fundamental to monitor the progresses of patients over time in response to rehabilitation interventions.","output":"Visual Function Score: A New Clinical Tool to Assess Visual Function and Detect Visual Disorders in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: eConsulta-that is, asynchronous, two-way teleconsultation in primary care-is one of the most important telemedicine developments in the Catalan public health system, a service that has been heavily boosted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is vital to know the characteristics of its users in order to be able to meet their needs and understand the coverage of this service in a context where there is reduced accessibility to the health system. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the profile of the citizens who use the eConsulta tool and the reasons for their use, as well as to gain an understanding of the elements that characterize their decision to use it while distinguishing between those who used it before and those who have used it since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A descriptive, observational study based on administrative data was performed. This study differentiates between the COVID-19 pandemic era and the period preceding it, considering the day the state of emergency was declared in Spain (ie, March 12, 2020) as the cut-off point. It also differentiates between eConsulta users who send messages and those who only receive them. RESULTS: During the pandemic, the number of unique users of this teleconsultation service had almost tripled, with up to 33.10 visits per 1000 inhabitants per month reported in the first three months. For the two user profiles analyzed, most users since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak were predominantly female, systematically younger, more actively employed, and with less complex pathologies. Furthermore, eConsulta users received more messages proactively from the health professionals. There was also a relative decrease in the number of conversations initiated by higher-income urban users and an increase in conversations initiated by users in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has helped to generalize the use of telemedicine as a tool to compensate, to some extent, for the decline in face-to-face visits, especially among younger citizens in Catalonia. Telemedicine has made it possible to maintain contact between citizens and the health care system in the context of maximum complexity.","output":"Characteristics of Citizens and Their Use of Teleconsultations in Primary Care in the Catalan Public Health System Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Descriptive Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Perineal hernia is a rare complication of anterior exenteration.

Due to its pharmacological profile, aripiprazole may be of interest in patients with specific clinical profiles who have not been studied extensively in randomised clinical trials. OBJECTIVES: To capture experience with aripiprazole in everyday psychiatric practice using the Delphi method in order to inform decision-making on the use of aripiprazole for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia in clinical situations where robust evidence from clinical trials is lacking. METHODS: The scope of the survey was defined as the management of schizophrenia in adults. A systematic literature review was performed to identify the different clinical situations in which aripiprazole has been studied, and to describe the level of clinical evidence. Clinical profiles to include in the Delphi survey were selected if there was a clear interest in terms of medical need but uncertainty over the efficacy of aripiprazole. For each clinical profile retained, five to seven specific statements were generated and included in a questionnaire. The final 41-item questionnaire was proposed to a panel of 406 French psychiatrists with experience in the treatment of schizophrenia. Panellists rated their level of agreement using a Likert scale. A second round of voting on eleven items was organised to clarify points for which a consensus was not obtained in the first round. RESULTS: Five clinical profiles were identified in the literature review (persistent negative symptoms, pregnancy, cognitive dysfunction, addictive comorbidity and clozapine resistance). Sixty-two psychiatrists participated in the first round of the Delphi survey and 33 in the second round. A consensus was obtained for 11 out of 41 items in the first round and for 9/11 items in the second round. According to the panellists clinical experience, aripiprazole can be used as maintenance treatment for pregnant women, is relevant to preserve cognitive function and can be considered an option in patients with a comorbid addictive disorder or with persistent negative symptoms. CONCLUSION: These findings may help physicians in choosing relevant ways to use aripiprazole and highlight areas where more research is needed to widen the evidence base.

According to the national policy issued in March 2020 in response to the evolving Covid-19 pandemic, several hospitals were re-configured as Covid-19 centers and elective surgery procedures were rescheduled according to the most recent recommendations. In addition, Covid-19 protected cancer hubs were established, including the Regina Elena National Cancer Institute of Rome, Central Italy. At our Institute, the Breast Surgery Department continued working under the sign of a multidisciplinary approach. The number of professional figures involved in case evaluation was reduced to a minimum and interactions took place in the full respect of the required safety measures. Treatments for benign disease, pure prophylactic surgery and elective reconstructive procedures were all postponed and priority was assigned to the histologically-proven malignant breast tumors and highly suspicious lesions. From March 15th though April 30th 2020, we treated a total of 79 patients. This number is fully consistent with the average quantitative standards reached by our Department under ordinary circumstances. Patients were mostly discharged the day after surgery and none was readmitted due to surgery-related late complications. More generally, post-operative complications rates were unexpectedly low, particularly in light of the relatively high number of reconstructive procedures performed in this emergency situation. A strict follow up was performed based on the close contact with the surgical staff by telephone, messaging apps and telemedicine. Patients ascertainment for their Covid-19 status prior to hospital admission and hospital discharge allowed to maintain the no-Covid-19 status at our Institution. In addition, during the aforementioned time window, none of the care providers developed SARS-CoV-2 infection or disease, as shown by the results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G profiling. In conclusions, elective breast cancer surgery procedures were successfully performed in a lockdown situation due to a novel viral pandemic.

Using French data on cases and tests for the period following the first lock-down - from May 13, 2020, onwards - our acceleration index shows that the ongoing pandemic resurgence can be dated to begin around July 7. It uncovers that the pandemic acceleration has been stronger than national average for the [59-68] and [69-78] age groups since early September, the latter being associated with the strongest acceleration index, as of October 25. In contrast, acceleration among the [19-28] age group is the lowest and is about half that of the [69-78], as of October 25. In addition, we propose an algorithm to allocate tests among French departments, based on both the acceleration index and the feedback effect of testing. Our acceleration-based allocation differs from the actual distribution over French territories, which is population-based. We argue that both our acceleration index and our allocation algorithm are useful tools to guide public health policies as France enters a second lock-down period with indeterminate duration.","output":"Tracking the Dynamics and Allocating Tests for COVID-19 in Real-Time: an Acceleration Index with an Application to French Age Groups and Departments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In conjunction with a beta-lactam, aminoglycosides are the first-choice antibiotic for empirical treatment of sepsis in the neonatal period.

In the tumor microenvironment, macrophages display highly diverse phenotypes and may perform antitumorigenic or protumorigenic functions in a context-dependent manner. Recent studies have shown that macrophages can be engineered to transport drug nanoparticles (NPs) to tumor sites in a targeted manner, thereby exerting significant anticancer effects. In addition, macrophages engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) were shown to actively migrate to tumor sites and eliminate tumor cells through phagocytosis. Importantly, after reaching tumor sites, these engineered macrophages can significantly change the otherwise immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment and thereby enhance T cell-mediated anticancer immune responses. In this review, we first introduce the multifaceted activities of macrophages and the principles of nanotechnology in cancer therapy and then elaborate on macrophage engineering via nanotechnology or genetic approaches and discuss the effects, mechanisms, and limitations of such engineered macrophages, with a focus on using live macrophages as carriers to actively deliver NP drugs to tumor sites. Several new directions in macrophage engineering are reviewed, such as transporting NP drugs through macrophage cell membranes or extracellular vesicles, reprogramming tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) by nanotechnology, and engineering macrophages with CARs.

This article reviews the social and health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on diverse groups within the Canadian Defence Team and across Canada, with a particular focus on visible minorities, Indigenous people, women, older adults, persons with disabilities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and two-spirit communities. The review indicates that the pandemic widened the existing physical and mental health disparities and socio-economic inequities affecting these groups. To address these challenges, and to better understand the needs of diverse groups in the pandemic context, several recommendations for the Defence Team are proposed to incorporate into daily encounters with diverse groups and communities affected by COVID-19. The recommendations are designed to enable the Defence Team to establish positive and sustainable relations with diverse communities and to increase community resilience and defence emergency operational readiness. The range of potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals, families, and communities emphasizes the importance of recognizing the diverse perspectives and needs of the Canadian Defence Team and the urgency of developing inclusive approaches for managing these impacts. Whether the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) and Department of National Defence (DND) are providing support to their own diverse workforce, or responding with humanitarian relief in Canada and abroad, it is essential to understand how the COVID-19 crisis may affect diverse groups across Canada. As a result, this article provides a perspective on COVID-19's potential impacts on diverse groups and communities when examining emergency management and preparedness in the Canadian defence context. The potential challenges that may be experienced by diverse groups across Canada, including members of the Defence Team, are discussed, with a focus on racialized people, women, older adults, persons with disabilities, and members of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and two-spirit communities who reside across the Canadian landscape. The article also includes evidence-based recommendations that are intended to complement existing efforts to mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19, and it further contributes to the well-being of the Defence Team and DND-CAF readiness.","output":"Challenges of diversity and inclusion in defence emergency management and preparedness during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the cancellation of planned surgery and led to significant surgical service reductions. Early intervention in aortovascular disease is often critical and cannot be deferred despite these reductions. There is urgent need to evaluate the provision and outcomes of thoracic aortovascular intervention during the peak of the pandemic. METHODS: Prospective data was collected for patients receiving open and endovascular thoracic aortovascular intervention over two-time points; January-May 2020 and January-May 2019 at three tertiary cardiovascular centres. Baseline demographics, cardiovascular risk and COVID-19 screening results were noted. Primary outcomes were median length of intensive care unit and hospital stay, intra-operative mortality, 30-day mortality, post-operative stroke, and spinal cord injury. RESULTS: Patients operated in 2020 (41) had significantly higher median EuroSCORE II than 2019 (53) (7.44 vs. 5.86, Pa?=a?0.032) and rates of previous cardiac (19.5% vs. 3.8%, Pa?=a?0.019), aortic (14.6% vs. 1.9%, Pa?=a?0.041), and endovascular (22.0% vs. 3.8%, Pa?=a?0.009) intervention. There was an increase in proportion of urgent cases in 2020 (31.7% vs. 18.9%). There were no intra-operative deaths in 2020 and 1 in 2019 (Pa?=a?1.00). There were no significant differences (P &#8805; 0.05) in 30-day mortality (4.9% vs. 13.2%), median intensive care unit length of stay (72 vs. 70 hr), median hospital length of stay (8 vs. 9 days), post-operative stroke (3 vs. 6), or spinal cord injury (2 vs. 1) between 2020 and 2019 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increased mortality risk of patients and urgency of cases during COVID-19, complicated by the introduction of cohorting and screening regimens, thoracic aortovascular intervention remained safe with comparable in outcomes to pre-COVID-19.","output":"Dissecting the Management and Outcomes of Thoracic Aortovascular Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In silico analysis revealed that a lectin, jacalin from jackfruit seeds, recognizes a glycosylated region of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV2 Jacalin binding induces conformational changes in RBD and significantly affects its interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 The result may open up exploration of lectin-based strategies against COVID-19","output":"Targeting the glycan of receptor binding domain with jacalin as a novel approach to develop a treatment against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the onset of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, many state and local governments were forced to implement necessary policies to contain transmission of the deadly virus.

The clinical characteristics vary from asymptomatic to fatal. This study aims to examine the association between body mass index (BMI) levels and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A cohort study included 147 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 were categorized into 4 groups by BMI levels on admission: <18.5 (underweight), 18.5-22.9 (normal weight), 23.0-24.9 (overweight), and &#8805;25.0 kg/m2 (obese). Rates of pneumonia, severe pneumonia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and ICU stay during hospitalization across BMI group was determined. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between BMI and severe pneumonia. RESULTS: Of the totals, patients having a BMI <18.5, 18.5-22.9, 23.0-24.9, and &#8805;25.0 kg/m2 were 12.9%, 38.1%, 17.7%, and 31.3%, respectively. The rates of pneumonia and severe pneumonia tended to be higher in patients with higher BMI, whereas the rates of AKI and ICU stay were higher in patients with BMI <18.5 kg/m2 and &#8805; 25 kg/m2, when compared to patients with normal BMI. After controlling for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia in the logistic regression analysis, having a BMI &#8805;25.0 kg/m2 was associated with higher risk of severe pneumonia (OR 4.73; 95% CI, 1.50-14.94; p = 0.003) compared to having a BMI 18.5-22.9 kg/m2. During admission, elevated hemoglobin and alanine aminotransferase levels on day 7 and 14 of illness were associated with higher BMI levels. In contrast, rising of serum creatinine levels was observed in underweight patients on days 12 and 14 of illness. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity in patients with COVID-19 was associated with severe pneumonia and adverse outcomes such as AKI, transaminitis and ICU stay. Underweight patients should be closely monitored for AKI. Further studies in body composition are warranted to explore the links between adiposity and COVID-19 pathogenesis.","output":"The association between body mass index and severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has posed multiple substantial challenges, affecting not only public health but also economic systems, socio-cultural patterns, and political institutions. Studies have focused on the relationships between complex emergencies and natural disasters with outbreaks of infectious diseases. However, there is a dearth of relevant literature on the impact of a global pandemic on vaccination programs - an important topic because delays or stops in such programs are likely to result in outbreaks and epidemics of other infectious diseases. Thus, this article discusses the negative and positive impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic may exert on vaccination for vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). Negative impacts include the increased risk of VPD outbreaks in low-resource countries where vaccination programs must be temporarily halted to prevent the spread of infection. Positive effects include the strong possibility that the universally-recognized need for a coronavirus vaccine may increase people's appreciation for vaccines in general, resulting in improved vaccination uptake once the pandemic passes. Concerned stakeholders, such as governments and the World Health Organization (WHO), should seize this moment to effectively build on these positive impacts by planning renewed and revitalized post-COVID vaccination programs.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on vaccination programs: adverse or positive?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCCIN: Las alteraciones del perfil heptico durante el embarazo ocurren en 3-5% de las gestantes.

Thus, in concordance with the benefits of this level of education, the state has been designing public policies during the last few years, in order to facilitate access to undergraduate programmes to these populations, focusing mainly on the implementation of the virtual modality. In this context, it is recognised that access itself is not enough, but that continuance and timely graduation are required to materialise the benefits obtained along with a higher education degree;hence, dropout is a subject of interest for study, especially due to the high rates existing in the rural student population. Therefore, the event of dropout becomes an obstacle to social change and transformation in rural areas. Thus, this article aimed to identify which individual, institutional, academic and socio-economic characteristics influence rural student dropout in virtual undergraduate programmes in Colombia. For this purpose, an exploratory, quantitative and cross-sectional study was proposed, with a sample of 291 students to whom a student characterisation instrument and a classroom evaluation instrument were applied. With these data, it was proceeded to establish which of them had deserted, constituting the extraction of the sample of the study, which were 168. With the information, an exploratory factor analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis and descriptive statistics were used to establish which explanatory variables are involved in the dropout of this type of student. The results showed that the academic variables analysed do not have an impact on the event, while marital status (associated with family obligations), age, social stratum, work obligations, parents level of education and type of work, income and type of employment relationship of the student, and, finally, the number of people who depend on the familys income do.","output":"Rurality and Dropout in Virtual Higher Education Programmes in Colombia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Notable discrepancies in vulnerability to COVID-19 infection have been identified between specific population groups and regions in the USA.

A total of 316,599 participants were included in this study, and approximately 7.7% (n = 24,358) tested positive for COVID-19. A gradient boosting model, LightGBM (LGBM), predicted risk of initial infection with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.819. Factors that predicted infection were cough, fever, being a member of the Hispanic or Latino community, being Spanish speaking, having a history of diabetes or dementia, and living in a neighborhood with housing insecurity. A model trained on sociodemographic, environmental, and medical history data performed well in predicting risk of a positive COVID-19 test. This model could be used to tailor education, public health policy, and resources for communities that are at the greatest risk of infection.

Intensifying pathogen emergence can be attributed to climate change, biodiversity loss, habitat degradation, and an increasing rate of wildlife-human contacts. All of these are caused by synergies between persisting intense poverty and a growing human population.

METHODS Bevacizumab was conjugated with paraisothiocyanatobenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (p-SCN-Bn-DTPA) and subsequently radiolabeled with (99m)Tc via the (99m)Tc carbonyl synthon. The radioconjugate after purification was characterized by SE-HPLC and its in vitro stability was determined by histidine challenge experiments. Biodistribution studies to determine the uptake by tumors were carried out in melanoma model. RESULTS The radiochemical purity of (99m)Tc carbonyl labeled antibody was >98 %.

Studies including adults 65 years of age undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty and measuring preoperative frailty and postoperative adverse events or clinical outcomes within 90 days of surgery were included. Two investigators independently screened all abstracts and extracted data; disagreements were adjudicated by a third reviewer. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for cohort studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials. Study quality was assessed using a 5-point scale modified from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine tool. Results Of 1913 abstracts identified, 82 full texts were reviewed, and 13 met inclusion criteria: 5 prospective cohort studies, 6 retrospective cohort studies, and 2 randomized controlled trials covering 382 763 total patients. These studies used 13 frailty instruments and assessed 32 distinct outcomes. Substantial heterogeneity precluded valid meta-analysis; results were qualitatively summarized by study design, frailty instrument, and outcome type. Of the 11 cohort studies, 10 found significant associations between frailty and poor postoperative outcomes. Trials of preoperative frailty-modifying interventions found no association between interventions and improved outcomes. Discussion Standardizing frailty measurement would improve generalizability, permitting the assessment of associations with patient-reported and functional outcome measures, as well as the efficacy of interventions to improve outcomes, in frail patients undergoing arthroplasty.

The inhalation dose and the adhesion dose of the susceptible individual were quantified. The results showed that COVID-19 virus-containing droplets and aerosols might be released into the environment at higher proportions (39.1%-44.2%) than viruses that replicate in lungs only (15.3%-37.1%).

A variety of enzymes use NAD(+) to transfer either single or multiple ADP-ribose (ADPr) moieties onto distinct amino acid substrates, often in response to DNA damage or other stresses. Poly-ADPr-glycohydrolase readily reverses poly-ADP-ribosylation induced by the DNA-damage sensor PARP1 and other enzymes, but it does not remove the most proximal ADPr linked to the target amino acid. Searches for enzymes capable of fully reversing cellular mono-ADP-ribosylation back to the unmodified state have proved elusive, which leaves a gap in the understanding of this modification. Here, we identify a family of macrodomain enzymes present in viruses, yeast and animals that reverse cellular ADP-ribosylation by acting on mono-ADP-ribosylated substrates. Our discoveries establish the complete reversibility of PARP-catalyzed cellular ADP-ribosylation as a regulatory modification.

In contrast, during the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing number of studies and case reports indicate that pre- or asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not only possible but also occurs frequently. We report repeated rRT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a health care worker and demonstrate infective ability up to three days prior to mild COVID-19 symptoms. rRT-PCR indicated high viral levels approximately three days after exposure. Viral samples collected one and three days prior to symptoms exhibited infectivity on Vero E6 cells, confirmed by detection of double-stranded RNA by immunofluorescence, assessment of cytopathic effect (CPE) and rRT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies were detected by day 9 and 15, respectively, after symptom onset.

To cross the outer membrane of the complex Gram-negative cell envelope, antibiotics permeate through porins, trimeric channel proteins that enable the exchange of small polar molecules.

In this work, we show that a single point mutation in the porin PorB from Neisseria meningitidis, the causative agent of bacterial meningitis, can strongly affect the binding and permeation of beta-lactam antibiotics. Using X-ray crystallography, high-resolution electrophysiology, atomistic biomolecular simulation, and liposome swelling experiments, we demonstrate differences in drug binding affinity, ion selectivity and drug permeability of PorB. Our work further reveals distinct interactions between the transversal electric field in the porin eyelet and the zwitterionic drugs, which manifest themselves under applied electric fields in electrophysiology and are altered by the mutation. These observations may apply more broadly to drug-porin interactions in other channels.

As such, health care professionals may be exposed to additional physical and mental stress. The aim of this study was to assess the perspectives of all persons involved in dental care (dentists, dental assistants, students, and patients) regarding the aspects of safety measures, anxiety about self-infection and infecting others, and other prospects in the period March to December 2020 using a questionnaire. Data collection was performed between 14 December 2020 and 23 January 2021. A total of 35 dentists (response rate of 79.5%), 23 dental assistants (65.7%), 84 students (80%), and 51 patients (21.8%) completed the survey. The patients did not notice any changes in the care received. Dentists and dental assistants reported a higher workload due to additional safety measures. The majority of dentists, students, and patients agreed that normal patient care was maintained. One-third of dental assistants would have preferred emergency treatment alone and expressed significantly higher anxiety about COVID-19 infection than all other groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, all groups showed a predominantly positive perspective on dental care, and anxiety about self-infection and infecting others was especially low. However, additional measures are time-consuming and compound daily patient care.

It is unclear whether this is driven by an increased risk of infection or complications. We therefore aimed to investigate the incidence of clinically diagnosed influenza/influenza-like illness (ILI) by ethnicity in England from 2008-2018. Methods: We used linked primary and secondary healthcare data (from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink [CPRD] GOLD and Aurum databases and Hospital Episodes Statistics Admitted Patient Care [HES APC]). We included patients with recorded ethnicity who were aged 40-64 years and did not have a chronic health condition that would render them eligible for influenza vaccination. ILI infection was identified from diagnostic codes in CPRD and HES APC. We calculated crude annual infection incidence rates by ethnic group. Multivariable Poisson regression models with random effects were used to estimate any ethnic disparities in infection risk. Our main analysis adjusted for age, sex, and influenza year. Results: A total of 3,735,308 adults aged 40-64 years were included in the study; 87.6% White, 5.2% South Asian, 4.2% Black, 1.9% Other, and 1.1% Mixed.

Developing rapid and sensitive diagnostic tools is key for successful patient management and curbing disease spread. Currently available diagnostics are very specific and sensitive but time-consuming and require expensive laboratory settings and well-trained personnel; thus, they are not available in resource-limited areas, for the purposes of large-scale screenings and in case of outbreaks and epidemics. Developing new, rapid, and affordable point-of-care diagnostic assays is urgently needed. This review focuses on CRISPR-based technologies and their perspectives to become platforms for point-of-care nucleic acid detection methods and as deployable diagnostic platforms that could help to identify and curb outbreaks and emerging epidemics. We describe the mechanisms and function of different classes and types of CRISPR-Cas systems, including pros and cons for developing molecular diagnostic tests and applications of each type to detect a wide range of infectious agents. Many Cas proteins (Cas3, Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, Cas14 etc.) have been leveraged to create highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic tools combined with technologies of signal amplification and fluorescent, potentiometric, colorimetric, lateral flow assay detection and other. In particular, the most advanced platforms -- SHERLOCK/v2, DETECTR, CARMEN or CRISPR-Chip -- enable detection of attomolar amounts of pathogenic nucleic acids with specificity comparable to that of PCR but with minimal technical settings. Further developing CRISPR-based diagnostic tools promises to dramatically transform molecular diagnostics, making them easily affordable and accessible virtually anywhere in the world. The burden of socially significant diseases, frequent outbreaks, recent epidemics (MERS, SARS and the ongoing COVID-19) and outbreaks of zoonotic viruses (African Swine Fever Virus etc.) urgently need the developing and distribution of express-diagnostic tools.

Each group was also divided into 3 subgroups according to the age of patients (&#8804; 20 years, 21-64 years, and &#8805; 65 years). Data including anatomical region subjected to trauma, place of admission, mechanism of trauma, location of trauma, mode of treatment, type of surgery (if performed), duration of hospitalization (if hospitalized), time elapsed until surgery, and duration of postoperative hospitalization were collected and compared between groups. RESULTS: A total of 361 patients were admitted to the hospital with new trauma during the pandemic, and 708 patients had been admitted during the same period in 2019. The number of admissions decreased significantly by 50.9% (P < 0.001). The mechanism of trauma that occurred with low energy was significantly increased in the pandemic group (73.9%) compared with the control group (47.6%) (P < 0.001). Similarly, the distribution of trauma throughout the skeletal system, especially in the upper extremity, was significantly increased in the pandemic group (49.9% vs. 30.5%, P < 0.001). However, there was no significant decrease in individuals aged above 65 years (P = 0.115). Similar to the general outlook, the 3 groups differed in terms of the mechanism of trauma, location of trauma, and distribution of the anatomical region subjected to trauma (P < 0.001). Majority of the patients received inpatient treatment in all 3 groups (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the pandemic dramatically reduced the number of hospital admissions related to orthopedic trauma.

Objective: To assess the feasibility of patient use of low-cost digital videoscopes and smartphones for examination of the ear and oropharynx. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective quality improvement study was conducted in an academic adult otolaryngology clinic including 23 patients who presented for an in-person appointment and owned a smartphone device. The study was conducted from July 1 to 15, 2020. Interventions: Participants were asked to capture pictures and videos of their ear canals and oropharynx with digital videoscopes and their smartphones under real-time guidance over a telehealth platform. They were then surveyed about their experience. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were ratings by health care clinicians and a blinded otolaryngologist reviewer of image acceptability. Secondary outcomes included participant time to image acquisition and willingness to purchase digital videoscopes for telehealth use. Results: Of the 23 participants included, 14 were women (61%); mean age was 50 years (range, 21 to 80 years). Of the images obtained using the digital otoscope ear examination, 95% were considered acceptable by the health care clinicians and 91% were considered acceptable by the blinded reviewer; 16 participants (70%) reported that the otoscope was easy to use.

The tension MSC group was used as a control group, and miR-144-3p mimics (miR-144-3p mimic group), mimic controls (mimic-NC group), PTEN interferers (si-PTEN group), and interference controls (si-NC group) were transfected into BMSCs. The BMSCs were then continuously stimulated for 24 h using a Flexercell in vitro cellular mechanics loading device, applying a draft force at a frequency of 1 Hz and a deformation rate of 18%. The cell proliferation was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) colorimetric assay; the expression levels of cyclin, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), BCL2-associated X (BAX), B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), and other cell cycle and apoptosis related proteins were detected by western blot (WB); and the osteogenic differentiation ability of MSC cells was detected by ALP staining and alizarin red staining. RESULTS: Compared with the MSC group, the level of miR-144-3p was significantly lower and the level of PTEN was significantly higher in the tension MSC group. ALP staining showed normal activity in the MSC group and decreased ALP activity in the tension MSC group compared to the MSC group. Alizarin red staining in the MSC group showed scattered calcium nodule formation, and alizarin red staining showed red nodules with a more uniform color distribution. Compared to the MSC group, the tension MSC group showed fewer, smaller, and lighter staining mineralized nodules. Compared with the tension group and mimic-NC group (si-NC group), the proliferation rate of cells in the miR-144-3p mimic group (si-PTEN group) was significantly higher; the expression levels of PTEN and BAX were significantly lower; and the expression levels of cyclin, CDK, and BCL-2 protein were significantly higher. ALP staining results revealed that the miR-144-3p mimic group (si-PTEN group) showed significantly higher osteogenic differentiation ability and ALP activity of MSC than the tension group and mimic-NC group (si-NC group). CONCLUSION: miR-144-3p may inhibit apoptosis and promote proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs under tension by targeting and regulating PTEN.","output":"Effect of miR-144-3p-Targeted Regulation of PTEN on Proliferation, Apoptosis, and Osteogenic Differentiation of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells under Stretch"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: International data indicate that arterial, venous and microvascular thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation occur in more than 30% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 This condition is characterized by high levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time METHOD: Blood samples from three COVID-19 patients treated in a Hungarian intensive care unit were collected and analyzed with ClotPro(R) tests EX-tests, IN-test, FIB-tests, RVV-tests, and TPA-tests were performed The results were interpreted with respect to the clinical condition of the patients RESULTS: Procoagulation, hypercoagulation and either fibrinolysis or a \\"shut down\\" phenomenon of the fibrinolytic process were found with ClotPro(R) The ClotPro(R) parameters were consistent with the conventional coagulation tests and corresponded with the criteria of non-overt disseminated intravascular coagulation CONCLUSION: These findings encourage further investigations to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients and may support the introduction of full dose anticoagulation with or without antiplatelet therapy Interventional clinical trials may be helpful in defining the appropriate drug(s), for this purpose, the algorithms of administration, and the optimal duration of therapy At present, the authorization of a clinical trial that attempts to answer these questions is in progress Orv Hetil 2020;161(22): 899-907","output":"Procoagulatio, hypercoagulatio es fibrinolysis \\"shut down\\" kimutatasa ClotPro(R) viszkoelasztikus tesztek segitsegevel COVID-19-betegekben"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe the application of a novel family of trisulfonamide (TSA) calix[6]arenes in general acid catalysis.

As of July 9, 2020, Utah had reported 27,356 confirmed COVID-19 cases. To better understand how area-level deprivation might reinforce ethnic, racial, and workplace-based COVID-19 inequities (3), the Utah Department of Health (UDOH) analyzed confirmed cases of infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), COVID-19 hospitalizations, and SARS-CoV-2 testing rates in relation to deprivation as measured by Utah's Health Improvement Index (HII) (4). Age-weighted odds ratios (weighted ORs) were calculated by weighting rates for four age groups (24, 25-44, 45-64, and 65 years) to a 2000 U.S. Census age-standardized population. Odds of infection increased with level of deprivation and were two times greater in high-deprivation areas (weighted OR = 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.99-2.17) and three times greater (weighted OR = 3.11; 95% CI = 2.98-3.24) in very high-deprivation areas, compared with those in very low-deprivation areas. Odds of hospitalization and testing also increased with deprivation, but to a lesser extent. Local jurisdictions should use measures of deprivation and other social determinants of health to enhance transmission reduction strategies (e.g., increasing availability and accessibility of SARS-CoV-2 testing and distributing prevention guidance) to areas with greatest need. These strategies might include increasing availability and accessibility of SARS-CoV-2 testing, contact tracing, isolation options, preventive care, disease management, and prevention guidance to facilities (e.g., clinics, community centers, and businesses) in areas with high levels of deprivation.","output":"Disparities in COVID-19 Incidence, Hospitalizations, and Testing, by Area-Level Deprivation  Utah, March 3CJuly 9, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It is unclear from epidemiological data for COVID-19 infections, whether people living with HIV (PLWH) have a different outcomes compared to the general population. We conducted a multi-centre, retrospective matched cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive hospital inpatients analysed by HIV-status.Methods: HIV-negative patients were matched to PLWH admitted to hospital before 31 st May 2020, with a 3:1 ratio by: hospital site, SARS-CoV-2 test date +/- 7 days, age +/- 5 years, gender, and index of multiple deprivation decile (IMDD) +/- 1. The primary objective was clinical improvement (2-point improvement on a 7-point ordinal scale) or hospital discharge by day 28, whichever was earlier.Results: 68 PLWH and 181 HIV-negative comparators were included. After adjustment for ethnicity, frailty, baseline hypoxia, duration of symptoms prior to baseline, body mass index categories, and comorbidities (hypertension, chronic cardiac disease, chronic lung disease, active malignancy, diabetes, and chronic renal disease), the effect size of HIV status was not associated with time to clinical improvement or discharge from hospital (aHR 0.70, 95%CI 0.43, 1.17;p=0.18), despite unadjusted hazards of PLWH achieving the primary outcome being 43% lower (p=0.005). Baseline frailty (aHR=0.79;95%CI 0.65, 0.95;p=0.011), malignancy (aHR=0.37;95%CI 0.17, 0.82;p=0.014) remained associated with poorer outcomes. PLWH were more likely of black and minority ethnicities (75.0% vs 48.6%, p=0.0002), higher median clinical frailty score (3 IQR 2-5 vs 2 IQR 1-4, p=0.0069), higher proportion of active malignancy (14.4% vs 9.9%, p=0.29). Median body mass index (BMI) was lower amongst PLWH (27.7 IQR 23.9-32.3 vs 29.4 IQR 24.7-34.3, p=0.19). Median CD4 count of PLWH was 352cells/L (IQR 235-619) and 95.7% had suppressed viral loads <200copies/mL, 63/68 (92.3%) were taking antiretroviral therapy.Conclusions: Differences in clinical outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalisations in PLWH may be due to other important factors including increased frailty and comorbidities such as malignancies, rather than HIV-status alone.Funding Statement: This study has not received any funding sources.Declaration of Interests: MJL has received grants and honoraria from Gilead Sciences and Viiv Healthcare not related to this work.

Methods: Thirty-five consecutive patients with glaucoma (70 eyes) who had undergone unilateral first-time trabeculectomy between April and November 2012 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Patients with intraoperative or postoperative complications were excluded from this study. The eye that underwent trabeculectomy was considered the study eye; the fellow eye was used as the control eye. OPA and IOP were measured by Pascal dynamic contour tonometry (DCT), IOP was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured before and one month after trabeculectomy. The change in the pre- and postoperative values was compared between the two eyes. Results: The study sample included 17 male and 18 female patients with a mean age of 60.8313.46 years. The mean preoperative GAT, DCT and OPA values in the study eyes were 24.978.26, 31.2310.55 and 4.221.77 mmHg, respectively. One month after trabeculectomy, the GAT, DCT and OPA values were 12.834.35, 20.287.34 and 2.961.66 mmHg, respectively. There was a significant decrease in OPA after filtration surgery in the study eyes (p<0.001), but not in the control eyes (p>0.05). Changes in OPA were positively correlated with changes in IOP (p<0.05), and a significant association was found between OPA and IOP, and as measured by DCT (Regression coefficient = 0.093 [0.041-0.145]) and GAT (Regression coefficient = 0.093 [0.013-0.173]). Conclusion: There was a significant decrease in OPA in the eyes that underwent trabeculectomy, and the change in OPA after surgery was significantly different in the study eyes in comparison to the change in OPA in the control eyes.

C. auris was isolated from blood (two isolates), urine (three isolates), respiratory tract (10 isolates) and skin (one isolate). All the patients had received broad spectrum antibiotics prior to isolation of C. auris. Six patients received antifungal treatment, while the remaining eight patients were considered colonized.

The molecular pathways, however, that cause virus-induced ALI/ARDS in aged individuals are ill-defined. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques develop more severe pathology than young adult animals, even though viral replication levels are similar. Comprehensive genomic analyses indicate that aged macaques have a stronger host response to virus infection than young adult macaques, with an increase in differential expression of genes associated with inflammation, with NF-B as central player, whereas expression of type I interferon (IFN)- is reduced. Therapeutic treatment of SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques with type I IFN reduces pathology and diminishes pro-inflammatory gene expression, including interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels, without affecting virus replication in the lungs. Thus, ALI in SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques developed as a result of an exacerbated innate host response.

Background: Nurses are assigned a key role in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Of particular importance is their work engagement, depending on job demands and resources. So far, there have only been scattered and first-wave related indications of nurses' job demands, resources and work engagement in Germany during the pandemic. Aim: To systematically assess key job demands, key job resources and work engagement of nursing staff for the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, also differentiating between various groups of nurses. Method: The study was realized in a cross-sectional design and included nurses in direct health care settings in Germany. Data was collected with an online questionnaire using valid and reliable measures during the second wave of the pandemic. The dataset for analyses comprised 1027 cases in total. Results: Regarding demands, work overload was even higher than before the pandemic, but work-life interferences were less pronounced. Nurses' resource architecture was not fundamentally changed by the pandemic, but interpersonal relationships and autonomy were rated more positively. Domiciliary care workers assessed demands and resources more positively than nurses in nursing homes or hospitals, whereas nurses caring for COVID-19 patients evaluated demands and resources more critically. Nurses' work engagement was higher during the second pandemic wave than in the first wave, but still low overall. Conclusions: Due to the importance of work engagement for nurses' health and performance and thus the quality of care, demands and resources must be further improved.

We studied whether viral RNAemia or viral RNA load in plasma is associated with severe COVID-19 and also to this dysregulated response. METHODS: A total of 250 patients with COVID-19 were recruited (50 outpatients, 100 hospitalized ward patients and 100 critically ill). Viral RNA detection and quantification in plasma was performed using droplet digital PCR, targeting the N1 and N2 regions of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein gene. The association between SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma with severity was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression. Correlations between viral RNA load and biomarkers evidencing dysregulation of host response were evaluated by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficients. RESULTS: The frequency of viral RNAemia was higher in the critically ill patients (78%) compared to ward patients (27%) and outpatients (2%) (p < 0.001). Critical patients had higher viral RNA loads in plasma than non-critically ill patients, with non-survivors showing the highest values. When outpatients and ward patients were compared, viral RNAemia did not show significant associations in the multivariate analysis. In contrast, when ward patients were compared with ICU patients, both viral RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma were associated with critical illness (OR [CI 95%], p): RNAemia (3.92 [1.183-12.968], 0.025), viral RNA load (N1) (1.962 [1.244-3.096], 0.004); viral RNA load (N2) (2.229 [1.382-3.595], 0.001).

It has been suggested that chronic fluoride-induced microglia activation contributes to neuronal damage by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines.

In the current study, in vivo results demonstrate that excessive NaF impaired spatial learning and memory ability, microglia activation, and up-regulation of IL-1? in rats. Moreover, NaF exposure induced JNK pathway activation and associated apoptosis. These results were validated in vitro: NaF could induce BV-2 microglia cell activation and increase the concentration of IL-1? in the culture medium. When PC-12 cells were cultured with BV-2 CM or IL-1? for 24 h, the viability of PC-12 cells decreased, with enhanced apoptosis. In addition, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) or SP600125 (JNK pathway inhibitor) diminished the IL-1?-induced activation of JNK pathway-mediated neuron apoptosis.

Despite the promising findings at a small scale and few contexts, implementing new technologies as part of changes to health care services is inherently challenging. Though there is a potential to introduce mHealth initiatives to health systems of developing countries, existing evidence on the barriers and facilitators of implementation in different contexts is not adequate. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the acceptability, barriers and facilitators of implementing mobile text message reminder system for child vaccination in Ethiopia. METHODS: This study applied a phenomenological study design. The study was conducted in north-west, Ethiopia between July 28 and August 19, 2020. A total of 23 participants were purposively selected for the in-depth and key informant interviews. We used an interview guide to collect data and audio-records of interviews were transcribed verbatim. Coding was done to identify patterns and thematic analysis was conducted using ATLAS ti7 software. RESULTS: The findings indicated that mothers were receptive to mobile text message reminders for their childs vaccination. Low mobile phone ownership, access to mobile network, access to electricity and illiteracy among the target population were identified as barriers that would affect implementation. Confidentiality and security-related issues are not barriers to implementation of text message reminders for child vaccination service. Facilitators for implementation include stakeholder collaboration, providing orientation/training to users, and willingness to pay by clients. CONCLUSION: In this study, using mobile phone text message reminders for child vaccination services are acceptable by clients.

Given the large number of patients affected, healthcare personnel and facility resources are stretched to the limit; however, the need for urgent and emergent neurosurgical care continues. This article describes best practices when performing neurosurgical procedures on patients with COVID-19 based on multi-institutional experiences. METHODS: We assembled neurosurgical practitioners from 13 different health systems from across the USA, including those in hot spots, to describe their practices in managing neurosurgical emergencies within the COVID-19 environment. RESULTS: Patients presenting with neurosurgical emergencies should be considered as persons under investigation (PUI) and thus maximal personal protective equipment (PPE) should be donned during interaction and transfer. Intubations and extubations should be done with only anesthesia staff donning maximal PPE in a negative pressure environment. Operating room (OR) staff should enter the room once the air has been cleared of particulate matter. Certain OR suites should be designated as covid ORs, thus allowing for all neurosurgical cases on covid/PUI patients to be performed in these rooms, which will require a terminal clean post procedure. Each COVID OR suite should be attached to an anteroom which is a negative pressure room with a HEPA filter, thus allowing for donning and doffing of PPE without risking contamination of clean areas. CONCLUSION: Based on a multi-institutional collaborative effort, we describe best practices when providing neurosurgical treatment for patients with COVID-19 in order to optimize clinical care and minimize the exposure of patients and staff.","output":"Minimizing SARS-CoV-2 exposure when performing surgical interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyze the disease control and prevention strategies in a susceptible-infectious-quarantined-diseased (SIQD) model with a quarantine-adjusted incidence function.

METHODS: Twitter data (N=82,893) related to both older adults and COVID-19 and dated from January 23 to May 20, 2020, were analyzed. We used a combination of data science methods (including Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, supervised machine learning, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis), qualitative thematic analysis, and conventional statistics. RESULTS: The most common category in the coded tweets was \\"personal opinions\\" (66.2%), followed by \\"informative\\" (24.7%), \\"jokes/ridicule\\" (4.8%), and \\"personal experiences\\" (4.3%). The daily average of ageist content was 18%, with the highest of 52.8% on March 11, 2020. Specifically, more than one in ten (11.5%) tweets implied that the life of older adults is less valuable or downplayed the pandemic because it mostly harms older adults. A small proportion (4.6%) explicitly supported the idea of just isolating older adults. Almost three-quarters (72.9%) within \\"jokes/ridicule\\" targeted older adults, half of which were \\"death jokes.\\" Also, 14 themes were extracted, such as perceptions of lockdown and risk. A bivariate Granger causality test suggested that informative tweets regarding at-risk populations increased the prevalence of tweets that downplayed the pandemic.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: It is unknown whether patients who recovered from Covid-19 and then underwent a major elective operation have an increased risk of developing postoperative complications. METHODS: The risk of postoperative complications for patients with Covid-19 undergoing 18 major types of elective operations in the Covid-19 Research Database was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Patients were grouped by time of surgery relative to SARS-CoV-2 infection; that is, surgery performed: (1) before January 1, 2020 (pre-Covid-19), (2) 0 to 4 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (peri-Covid-19), (3) 4 to 8 weeks after infection (early post-Covid-19), and (4) 8 weeks after infection (late post-Covid-19). RESULTS: Of the 5479 patients who met study criteria, patients with peri-Covid-19 had an elevated risk of developing postoperative pneumonia [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 6.46; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.06C10.27], respiratory failure (aOR, 3.36; 95% CI: 2.22C5.10), pulmonary embolism (aOR, 2.73; 95% CI: 1.35C5.53), and sepsis (aOR, 3.67; 95% CI: 2.18C6.16) when compared to pre-Covid-19 patients. Early post-Covid-19 patients had an increased risk of developing postoperative pneumonia when compared to pre-Covid-19 patients (aOR, 2.44; 95% CI: 1.20C4.96). Late post-Covid-19 patients did not have an increased risk of postoperative complications when compared to pre-Covid-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Major, elective surgery 0 to 4 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications. Surgery performed 4 to 8 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection is still associated with an increased risk of postoperative pneumonia, whereas surgery 8 weeks after Covid-19 diagnosis is not associated with increased complications.","output":"The Risk of Postoperative Complications After Major Elective Surgery in Active or Resolved COVID-19 in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eleven field cases of a disease characterized by severe dyspnoea or abdominal breathing were examined post mortem.

As convalescent plasma is already used as antibody therapy, this study aimed to compare the binding capacity of antibodies specific to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 between human milk and serum from COVID-19-recovered women. Materials and Methods: The areas under the curve (AUCs) for IgA, IgM, and IgG specific to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in human milk and serum samples were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Milk samples were collected from 12 COVID-19-recovered women, while serum samples were from 10 COVID-19-recovered women. The antibody concentrations were also determined. Results: Our study reveals that SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibody titers differed between human milk and serum samples from COVID-19-recovered women. When the AUCs were not divided by the antibody concentration, SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgA, IgM, and IgG levels were higher in the serum sample group than the human milk group (p < 0.001). However, the titers of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgM (AUC/g of IgM) and IgG (AUC/g of IgG) were higher in human milk samples than serum samples (p < 0.05). The titer of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgA (AUC/mg of IgA) was higher in the serum sample group than the human milk group (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Human milk antibodies specific to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 must be purified to obtain comparable binding capacity observed with SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific serum antibodies.","output":"Comparison of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2-Specific Antibodies' Binding Capacity Between Human Milk and Serum from Coronavirus Disease 2019-Recovered Women."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To determine with safety when and how to open gyms after the COVID-19 epidemic, it's very important since almost all places are locked down and probably will be closed for a while or permanently We need to keep studying options and the ways to do it, therefore the sooner we discuss it, the less damage there will be, especially for owners and professionals This article reviews systematically all numbers available about coronavirus until 01 April 2020 Until this date, COVID-19 is affecting 203 countries and territories around the world and 2 international conveyances: the Diamond Princess Cruise ship harbored in Yokohama, Japan, and Holland America's MS Zaandam cruise ship","output":"Gyms and martial arts school after COVID-19: when to come back to train?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding animal physiological adaptations for tolerating heat, and the causes of inter-individual variation, is key for predicting climate change impacts on biodiversity. Recently, a novel mechanism for transgenerational heat adaptation was identified in a desert-adapted bird, where parents acoustically signal hot conditions to embryos. Prenatal exposure to \\"heat-calls\\" adaptively alters zebra finch development and their thermal preferences in adulthood, suggesting a long-term shift towards a heat-adapted phenotype. However, whether such acoustic experience improves long-term thermoregulatory capacities is unknown. We measured metabolic rate (MR), evaporative water loss (EWL) and body temperature in adults exposed to a stepped profile of progressively higher air temperatures (Ta) between 27 and 44 C. Remarkably, prenatal acoustic experience affected heat tolerance at adulthood, with heat-call exposed individuals more likely to reach the highest Ta in morning trials. This was despite MR and EWL reaching higher levels at the highest Ta in heat-call individuals, partly driven by a stronger metabolic effect of moderate activity. At lower Ta, however, heat-call exposed individuals had greater relative water economy, as expected. They also better recovered mass lost during morning trials.

IGF-1 has been shown to be anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective in CNS injury models. In this study, we determined the impact of IGF-1 on brain injury and inflammation while modeling sleep deprivation. We found that IGF-1 was downregulated in human peripheral blood and in mice subjected to sleep deprivation for 5 days, with reduced activation of the downstream PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 pathway in mice brains. In addition, we found reduced levels of the anti-apoptosis enzyme Bcl-2 and increased levels of pro-apoptosis enzyme Caspase-9 expression, together with increased pro-inflammatory factors. The administration of IGF-1 after sleep deprivation induced activation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 pathway, reversed changes in Bcl-2, Caspase-9, and pro-inflammatory factors, and alleviated cognitive impairment. Notably, IGF-1 also induced activation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 pathway, and displayed anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammatory properties under normal sleep conditions,while IGF-1 did not improve the cognition under normal sleep conditions. These results suggest that the IGF-1/PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 pathway is involved in the regulation of cognitive function after sleep deprivation through modulation of apoptosis and inflammatory response.

Thus, this study aimed to determine the health-seeking behavior, communitys risk perception to COVID-19 pandemics, and factors influencing the community risk perception in Harari regional state, Ethiopia. METHODS: Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 5 to 30 February 2021. A total of 1320 adult (>18 years) participants were selected using systematic random sampling. The data were collected using an online kobo collect toolbox and analyzed using descriptive statistical tests. Chi-square test and multiple binary logistic regression were applied to examine the difference between variables. A p-value < 0.05 was considered to be of statistical significance. RESULTS: The study included 1296 respondents >18 years old. The overall prevalence of willingness to seek healthcare in the study area was 35.6% (95% CI: 33%C38.3.0%). The mean cumulative score of risk perception was 30.5 (SD  7.25) with the minimum and maximum score of 13 and 63, respectively.

Existing inter-individual variations of the immune responses, due to environmental exposures and genetic factors, may be critical to the development or not of symptomatic disease after infection with SARS-CoV-2, and transcriptomic differences marking such responses may be observed even later, after convalescence. Herein, we performed genome-wide transcriptional whole-blood profiling to test the hypothesis that immune response-related gene signatures may differ between healthy individuals with prior entirely asymptomatic versus clinical SARS-CoV-2 infection, all of which developed an equally robust antibody response. Among 12.789 protein-coding genes analyzed, there were only six and nine genes with significantly decreased or increased expression, respectively, in those with prior asymptomatic infection (n=17, mean age 34 years) relatively to those with clinical infection (n=15, mean age 37 years). All six genes with decreased expression (IFIT3, IFI44L, RSAD2, FOLR3, PI3, ALOX15), are involved in innate immune response while the first two are interferon-induced proteins. Among genes with increased expression six are involved in immune response (GZMH, CLEC1B, CLEC12A), viral mRNA translation (GCAT), energy metabolism (CACNA2D2) and oxidative stress response (ENC1). Notably, 8/15 differentially expressed genes are regulated by interferons. Our results suggest that an intrinsically weaker expression of some innate immunity- related genes may be associated with an asymptomatic disease course in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether a certain gene signature predicts, or not, those who will develop a more efficient immune response upon exposure to SARS-CoV-2, with implications for prioritization for vaccination, warrant further study.","output":"Blood transcriptomes of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibody positive healthy individuals with prior asymptomatic versus clinical infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunosuppressive viral diseases threaten the poultry industry by causing heavy mortality and economic loss of production, often as a result of the chickens' increased susceptibility to secondary infections and sub-optimal response to vaccinations. This paper aimed to present an up-to-date review of three specific economically important non-oncogenic immunosuppressive viral diseases of chickens, viz. chicken infectious anaemia (CIA), infectious bursal disease (IBD) and hydropericardium syndrome (HPS), with emphasis on their immunosuppressive effects. CIA and IBD causes immunosuppression in chickens and the socio-economic significance of these diseases is considerable worldwide. CIA occurs following transovarian transmission of chicken anaemia virus and has potential for inducing immunosuppression alone or in combination with other infectious agents, and is characterized by generalized lymphoid atrophy, increased mortality and severe anemia. The virus replicates in erythroid and lymphoid progenitor cells, causing inapparent, sub-clinical infections that lead to depletion of these cells with consequent immunosuppressive effects. The IBD virus replicates extensively in IgM(+) cells of the bursa and chickens may die during the acute phase of the disease, although IBD virus-induced mortality is highly variable and depends, among other factors, upon the virulence of the virus strain. The sub-clinical form is more common than clinical IBD because of regular vaccination on breeding farms. Infection at an early age significantly compromises the humoral and local immune responses of chickens because of the direct effect of B cells or their precursors. HPS is a recently emerged immunosuppressive disease of 3-6-weeked broilers, characterized by sudden onset, high mortality, typical hydropericardium and enlarged mottled and friable livers, with intranuclear inclusion bodies in the hepatocytes. The agent, fowl adenovirus-4, causes immunosuppression by damaging lymphoid tissues; the presence of IBD and CIA viruses may predispose for HPS or HPS may predispose for other viral infections. Synergism with CIA or other virus infections or prior immunosuppression is necessary to produce IBH-HPS in chickens and the susceptibility of chickens infected with fowl adenovirus varies throughout the course of CIA infection. The mechanism of immunosuppression has been studied in detail for certain chicken viruses at molecular levels, which will provides new opportunities to control these diseases by vaccination.","output":"Economically important non-oncogenic immunosuppressive viral diseases of chicken--current status."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the many consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic was the cancelation of the 2020 American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting This conference historically features lectures from world-renowned experts in all areas of dermatology, thus providing an important educational experience for dermatology residents We hypothesized that the cancellation of this meeting produced a substantial educational loss for dermatology residents To mitigate this impact, we developed a virtual faculty exchange program and surveyed dermatology residents' perspectives on its implementation All participating residents found the virtual faculty exchange useful and would recommend it to other residents/programs Moreover, all residents wanted to participate in more faculty exchange sessions as well as incorporate them throughout the academic year Additionally, this educational program eliminated the potential cost of &gt;$15,000 in flights and &gt;24 metric tons of carbon emissions This virtual faculty exchange program is a viable tool to enhance dermatology resident education in the COVID-19 era","output":"A virtual faculty exchange program enhances dermatology resident education in the COVID-19 era: a survey study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE(S) The overall aim of this study was to evaluate personal protective equipment (PPE) that may facilitate the safe recommencement of cochlear implantation in the COVID-19 era with the broader goal of minimising the period of auditory deprivation in prelingually deaf children and reducing the risk of cochlear ossification in individuals following meningitis. METHODS Using a preclinical model, an objective assessment of drill induced droplet spread was undertaken during simulated cochlear implant (CI) surgery and mitigated via the use of a protective drape 'tent'. A subsequent study of various PPE solutions assessed impact on communication, vital physiological parameters, visual acuity and fields, and acceptability to surgeons using a systematic risk-based approach. RESULTS Droplet spread during simulated CI surgery extended over 2 meters, a distance greater than previously reported. A drape 'tent' significantly reduced droplet spread. The ensemble of a half-face mask and safety spoggles (foam lined safety goggles) had consistently superior performance across all aspects of clinical usability. All other PPE options were found to substantially restrict the visual field, making them unsafe for microsurgery. CONCLUSION The results of this preclinical study indicate that the most viable solution to enable the safe conduct of CI and other mastoid surgery is a combination of an FFP3 mask or half-face respirator with safety spoggles as PPE. Prescription spoggles are an option for surgeons who need to wear corrective glasses to operate. A drape 'tent' reduces droplet spread.

We included quantitative peer-reviewed studies reporting health and well-being outcomes in children (0C18 years) related to closure measures' impact due to COVID-19. A pair of authors assessed the risk of bias of included studies. A descriptive and narrative synthesis was carried out. FINDINGS: Twenty-two studies, including high-income, middle-income and low-income countries, fulfilled our search criteria and were judged not to have an increased risk of bias. Studies from Australia, Spain and China showed an increase in depressive symptoms and decrease in life satisfaction. A decrease in physical activity and increase in unhealthy food consumption were shown in studies from two countries. There was a decrease in the number of visits to the emergency department in four countries, an increase in child mortality in Cameroon and a decrease by over 50% of immunisations administered in Pakistan. A significant drop of 39% in child protection medical examination referrals during 2020 compared with the previous years was found in the UK, a decrease in allegations of child abuse and neglect by almost one-third due to school closures in Florida, and an increase in the number of children with physical child abuse trauma was found in one centre in the USA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed systematic searches of the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for full-text articles of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of LMWH vs. aspirin in the early management of acute ischemic stroke. Information on study design, eligibility criteria, baseline information, and outcomes was extracted. Synthesized relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are used to present the differences between the two treatments based on fixed-effects models. RESULTS: Five RCTs were retrieved from the online databases. The results showed no significant difference in efficacy outcomes between the two groups among unselected patients. Subgroup analysis showed that LMWH was significantly related to a lower incidence of END events [relative risk (RR): 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.35C0.56] and reduced occurrence of RIS during treatment (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.16C0.75) in non-cardioembolic stroke. LMWH significantly increased the number of patients with a modified Rankin scale (mRS) score of 0C1 at 6 months in patients with large-artery occlusive disease (LAOD) (RR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.27C0.91). LMWH had a similar effect on symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) and major extracranial hemorrhage during treatment to that of aspirin, except that LMWH was related to an increased likelihood of extracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke, especially that with large-artery stenosis, LMWH treatment significantly reduced the incidence of END and RIS, and improved the likelihood of independence (mRS 0C1) at 6 months compared with those with aspirin treatment. LMWH was related to an increased likelihood of extracranial hemorrhage among all patients; however, the difference in major extracranial hemorrhage and sICH was not significant.

Consistent with prominent neuronal expression, they have a reward learning defect that can be rescued by conditional expression in mushroom body neurons before training. Among CMTr targets are cell adhesion and signaling molecules. Many are relevant for learning, and are also targets of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP).

OxyR, functioning as a negative and/or positive transcriptional regulator, has been included among the major bacterial coordinators of antioxidant response. OxyR was first reported as a repressor of catalase expression in C. diphtheriae. However, the involvement of OxyR in C. diphtheriae pathogenesis remains unclear. Accordingly, this work aimed to investigate the role of OxyR in mechanisms of host-pathogen interaction of C. diphtheriae through the disruption of the OxyR of the diphtheria toxin (DT)-producing C. diphtheriae CDC-E8392 strain. The effects of OxyR gene disruption were analyzed through interaction assays with human epithelial cell lines (HEp-2 and pneumocytes A549) and by the induction of experimental infections in Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes and Swiss Webster mice. The OxyR disruption exerted influence on NO production and mechanism accountable for the expression of the aggregative-adherence pattern (AA) expressed by CDC-E8392 strain on human epithelial HEp-2 cells. Moreover, invasive potential and intracytoplasmic survival within HEp-2 cells, as well as the arthritogenic potential in mice, were found affected by the OxyR disruption.

Based on the theories of post-metaphorical culture, endogenous development, home-school cooperation, and technology adoption and acceptance, this study implements a family intergenerational learning (FIL) project. FIL characterizes learning between grandparents and grandchildren within the household, suggesting a more practical and individualized strategy to help rural older adults gain digital literacy. By conducting a three-month FIL Project in a rural primary school class in China, the study employs a qualitative method to analyze learning records and interviews from 10 sets of participating grandparents and grandchildren. The analysis renders two critical findings on the effectiveness of the FIL Project for rural older adults. First, FIL can help rural older adults adapt into the digital world by (1) gaining knowledge about digital society, (2) improving their digital skills, (3) changing their lifestyles, and (4) understanding the integration between technology and society.

Pearson correlation was used to analyse trends. RESULTS: Online interaction increased 200% between FebruaryCApril 2020, with a significant positive correlation. There was also a significant correlation between online interaction and engagement and the Covid-19 situation in Malta (p ? 0.0001).

Here, we resolved crystal structures of these nanobodies in complex with RBD, and found the epitope of aRBD-2 differs from that of aRBD-5, aRBD-7. aRBD-2 binds to a conserved epitope which renders its binding activity to all variants of concern (VOCs) including Omicron. Interestingly, although monovalent aRBD-5 and aRBD-7 lost binding to some variants, they effectively improved the overall affinity when transformed into the hetero-bivalent form after being fused with aRBD-2. Consistent with the high binding affinities, aRBD-2-5-Fc and aRBD-2-7-Fc exhibited ultra-potent neutralization to all five VOCs; particularly, aRBD-2-5-Fc neutralized authentic virus of Beta, Delta and Omicron with the IC50of 5.989.65 ng/mL or 54.387.6 pM.

Aligned sequences in the respective organisms' proteomes are searched with blastp. 3. Binding predictions of the identified SARS-CoV-2 peptide to HLA supertype representatives are performed. 4. Blastp searches of predicted epitopes that bind strongly to the identified HLA allele are performed by limiting searches to H. sapiens and Plasmodium species, separately. 5. Peptides with minimum 60% identity to the predicted epitopes are found in results. 6. Peptides among those, which bind strongly to the same HLA allele, are predicted. 7. Step-4 is repeated by limiting searches to H. sapiens, followed by the remaining steps until step-7, for peptides sourced by Plasmodium species after step-6. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 peptide with single letter amino acid code CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC has the highest identity to P. vivax. Its YFCTCYFGLF part is predicted to bind strongly to HLA-A*24:02.

Nevertheless, there is a dearth of literature on how nurses develop their personal-professional values. AIM The aim of this study was to understand how nurses develop their foundational values as the base for their value system. RESEARCH DESIGN A constructivist grounded theory methodology was employed to collect multiple data sets, including face-to-face focus group and individual interviews, along with anecdote and reflective stories. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT Fifty-four nurses working across various nursing settings in Indonesia were recruited to participate. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Ethics approval was obtained from the Monash University Human Ethics Committee, project approval number 1553. FINDINGS Foundational values acquisition was achieved through family upbringing, professional nurse education and organisational/institutional values reinforcement. These values are framed through three reference points: religious lens, humanity perspective and professionalism. This framing results in a unique combination of personal-professional values that comprise nurses' values system. Values are transferred to other nurses either in a formal or informal way as part of one's professional responsibility and customary social interaction via telling and sharing in person or through social media. DISCUSSION Values and ethics are inherently interweaved during nursing practice. Ethical and moral values are part of professional training, but other values are often buried in a hidden curriculum, and attained and activated through interactions during nurses' training. CONCLUSION Developing a value system is a complex undertaking that involves basic social processes of attaining, enacting and socialising values.

Other helpful conditions included: (1) a still quite well-equipped and decentralized public health system (which, before the crisis, was even criticized for having overcapacities) with comparatively good C though not world-beating C testing and tracing abilities;(2) an exceptionally well-positioned state budget (schwarze Null) throughout the last decade, allowing for financially powerful stimulus packages;as well as (3) the existence of crisis-proven mechanisms, in particular Kurzarbeit (working short hours, up to 67%, whereby temporarily as much as 87% of the income is paid for by the federal government), which was later adopted in some form or other by many European countries. The source of this tension is the fact that the more jobs are classified as being essential for managing the pandemic (as, e.g., in health care, nursing homes, logistics, retailing, and transportation), the less workers are paid and the poorer are their working conditions, including fewer options for participation which, considering their added exposure to COVID-19, has become a bone of contention. Besides causing problems for global production and supply networks, this also reiterates an old observation: On a more positive note, the federal government was able to offer another huge economic stimulus package, building on already made decisions regarding temporarily subsidizing investments, and guaranteeing purchases in order to stimulate conversion processes and increase the local production of personal protection equipment, disinfectants, vaccines, and medical devices.

It can be treated with sofosbuvir with daclatasvir (SOF/DCV), the least expensive treatment combination globally. In regional guidelines, longer treatment durations of SOF/DCV (24 weeks) are recommended for cirrhotic individuals, compared with other pangenotypic regimens (12 weeks), based on sparse data. Early on-treatment virological response may offer means of reducing length and cost of therapy in patients with liver fibrosis. METHODS: In this prospective trial in Vietnam, genotype 6-infected adults with advanced liver fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis were treated with SOF/DCV. Day 14 viral load was used to guide duration of therapy: participants with viral load <500 IU/mL at day 14 were treated with 12 weeks of SOF/DCV and those 500 IU/mL received 24 weeks. Primary endpoint was sustained virological response (SVR). RESULTS: Of 41 individuals with advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis who commenced treatment, 51% had genotype 6a and 34% had 6e. The remainder had 6h, 6k, 6l, or 6o. One hundred percent had viral load <500 IU/mL by day 14, meaning that all received 12 weeks of SOF/DCV. One hundred percent achieved SVR12 despite a high frequency of putative NS5A inhibitor resistance-associated substitutions at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Prescribing 12 weeks of SOF/DCV results in excellent cure rates in this population. These data support the removal of costly genotyping in countries where genotype 3 prevalence is <5%, in keeping with World Health Organization guidelines. NS5A resistance-associated mutations in isolation do not affect efficacy of SOF/DCV therapy.

But policy making is hindered by limited knowledge about why cycling prevalence and trends vary greatly between different geographic areas (e.g. in London (UK) <1% cycle to work in Harrow compared to>15 % in Hackney) and individuals (e.g. by age or gender). The role of cycle infrastructure investment in explaining part of these patterns and trends is also unknown. We linked individual-level data on 317,117 London commuters (including 11,199 cyclists) in the 2001 and 2011 UK census to relevant geographic data, including on area-level cycling infrastructure investment during the period. Whilst cycle commuting increased over time on average, concentration curves and indices demonstrated that in contrast with England as a whole, cycling in London shifted from being dominated by commuters with lower socioeconomic status to commuters with higher socioeconomic status. In our first set of regression analyses, we showed that observed differences and time trends in cycling prevalence were partially explained by area-level differences in topography, greenspace, footpaths and crime levels and by differences and changes in population structures. In the second, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis which showed that expenditure on cycling infrastructure was associated with increased cycling at a marginal rate of 4915 per additional commuter cyclist, with some variation between groups: ethnic minorities were more responsive, and females, older people and those with lower socioeconomic status appeared less responsive. If planned increases in expenditure in England for the period 2020-25 were as cost-effective, and were sustained for the whole decade, our study suggests that commuter cycling prevalence could increase in England by 0.5 to 1.1 percentage points (this equates to a 16% to 34% increase in commuter cycling prevalence if compared to 2011 levels). More research is necessary to assess the impact on broader measures of cycling, active travel and overall physical activity, and to determine whether such expenditure constitutes good or equitable value for money.","output":"Determinants of bicycle commuting and the effect of bicycle infrastructure investment in London: Evidence from UK census microdata."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Metal mesh devices (MMDs) are novel materials that enable the precise separation of particles by size.

RECENT FINDINGS: Previous to the pandemic, TM was little used in various aspects of asthma care. Since the pandemic, TM has been increasingly used in new ways to care for asthma patients at various locations. In addition to direct-to-consumer visits for asthma care, other forms of telehealth visits have been increasing such as facilitated visits, asynchronous, remote patient monitoring, e-consults, and mHealth. Moreover, patient and provider satisfaction with the use of TM has been increasing and is comparable at times with face-to-face visits. In this review, best practices for starting a telemedicine asthma service with patients at home, distant clinic sites, and various other locations, including school-based asthma programs, are reviewed. SUMMARY: TM is a valuable adjunct to face-to-face visits for asthma care. Following the recommended best practices can strengthen the implementation of a telemedicine asthma program (TMAP) into clinical practice.

The development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs heavily depends on the systematic study of the critical biological processes of key proteins of coronavirus among which the main proteinase (Mpro) dimerization is a key step for virus maturation. Because inhibiting the Mpro dimerization can efficiently suppress virus maturation, the key residues that mediate dimerization can be treated as targets of drug and antibody developments. In this work, the structure and energy features of the Mpro dimer of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The free energy calculations using the Generalized Born (GB) model showed that the dimerization free energy of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro dimer (-107.5  10.89 kcal mol-1) is larger than that of the SARS-CoV Mpro dimer (-92.83  9.81 kcal mol-1), indicating a more stable and possibly a quicker formation of the Mpro dimer of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the energy decomposition of each residue revealed 11 key attractive residues. Furthermore, Thr285Ala weakens the steric hindrance between the two protomers of SARS-CoV-2 that can form more intimate interactions. It is interesting to find 11 repulsive residues which effectively inhibit the dimerization process. At the interface of the Mpro dimer, we detected three regions that are rich in interfacial water which stabilize the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro dimer by forming hydrogen bonds with two protomers. The key residues and rich water regions provide important targets for the future design of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs through inhibiting Mpro dimerization.","output":"Structural and energetic features of the dimerization of the main proteinase of SARS-CoV-2 using molecular dynamic simulations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 patients flood hospitals worldwide, physicians are trying to search for effective antiviral therapies to save lives.

Both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy were significantly more effective than care as usual (relative risk [RR] for response = 1.60; 95% CI, 1.40-1.83 and RR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.35-2.03, respectively) and waitlist (RR = 2.35; 95% CI, 1.57-3.51 and RR = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.57-3.74, respectively) control groups. We found no significant differences between psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy (RR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.88-1.22). The effects were significantly greater for combined treatment compared with psychotherapy alone (RR = 1.35; 95% CI, 1.00-1.81). The difference between combined treatment and pharmacotherapy became significant when limited to studies with low risk of bias and studies limited to cognitive behavior therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Psychotherapy is likely effective for the treatment of depression when compared with care as usual or waitlist, with effects comparable to those of pharmacotherapy. Combined treatment might be better than either psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy alone.","output":"Psychologic Treatment of Depression Compared With Pharmacotherapy and Combined Treatment in Primary Care: A Network Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Optimal application of the recently updated World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for exercise in advanced age necessitates an accurate adjustment for the age-related increasing variability in biological age and fitness levels, alongside detailed recommendations across a range of motor fitness components, including balance, strength, and flexibility. We previously developed and validated a novel tool, designed to both remotely assess these fitness components, and subsequently deliver a personalized exercise program via smartphone. We describe the design of a prospective randomized control trial, comparing the effectiveness of the remotely delivered personalized multicomponent exercise program to either WHO exercise guidelines or no intervention. METHODS: Participants (n = 300) are community dwelling, healthy, functionally independent, cognitively intact volunteers aged 65 at low risk for serious fall injuries, assigned using permuted block randomization (age/gender) to intervention, active-control, or control group. The intervention is an 8-week program including individually tailored exercises for upper/lower body, flexibility, strength, and balance (dynamic, static, vestibular); active-controls receive exercising counselling according to WHO guidelines; controls receive no guidance. Primary outcome is participant fitness level, operationalized as 42 digital markers generated from 10 motor fitness measures (balance, strength, flexibility); measured at baseline, mid-trial (4-weeks), trial-end (8-weeks), and follow-up (12-weeks). Target sample size is 300 participants to provide 99% power for moderate and high effect sizes (Cohens f = 0.25, 0.40 respectively).

METHODS We analyzed Instagram posts from five randomly selected days in February 2020. The hashtag, #ivfcommunity, was selected to identify public posts authored by Instagram's IVF community members from multiple treatment centers. Text, photos, hashtags, and emojis were collected from 452 included posts and entered into a study-specific database. Using thematic coding, a four-member team initially coded the first day in February. Common themes were agreed upon by all team members, and a preliminary codebook was created for further analysis. The remaining posts were coded by two-member teams who reached a consensus on the multiple themes assigned to each individual post. RESULTS Analysis of posts led to the identification of five major themes: documentation of the medical and physical experience of IVF (76.1%), the emotional spectrum (43.1%), social support (49.2%), coping mechanisms (29.9%), and education (receipt, provision) (11.1%). CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that women undergoing IVF often utilize social media to document daily experiences, offer and recognize sources of community support, and provide and receive education regarding their treatments. Given the increased prevalence of mental health conditions, medical providers should explore challenges discussed on online platforms and consider harnessing the supportive nature of online communities to supplement care for IVF patients.","output":"The virtual infertility community: a qualitative analysis of patient experiences shared on Instagram."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 is a major target for diagnosis and vaccine development because of its essential role in viral infection and host immunity. Currently, time-dependent responses of humoral immune system against various S protein epitopes are poorly understood. In this study, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), peptide microarray, and antibody binding epitope mapping (AbMap) techniques were used to systematically analyze the dynamic changes of humoral immune responses against the S protein in a small cohort of moderate COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized for approximately two months after symptom onset. Recombinant truncated S proteins, target S peptides, and random peptides were used as antigens in the analyses. The assays demonstrated the dynamic IgM- and IgG recognition and reactivity against various S protein epitopes with patient-dependent patterns. Comprehensive analysis of epitope distribution along the spike gene sequence and spatial structure of the homotrimer S protein demonstrated that most IgM- and IgG-reactive peptides were clustered into similar genomic regions and were located at accessible domains. Seven S peptides were generally recognized by IgG antibodies derived from serum samples of all COVID-19 patients. The dynamic immune recognition signals from these seven S peptides were comparable to those of the entire S protein or truncated S1 protein. This suggested that the humoral immune system recognized few conserved S protein epitopes in most COVID-19 patients during the entire duration of humoral immune response after symptom onset. Furthermore, in this cohort, individual patients demonstrated stable immune recognition to certain S protein epitopes throughout their hospitalization period. Therefore, the dynamic characteristics of humoral immune responses to S protein have provided valuable information for accurate diagnosis and immunotherapy of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Evaluation of Spike Protein Epitopes by Assessing the Dynamics of Humoral Immune Responses in Moderate COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regional anesthesia is undergoing technological change from electro stimulation to ultrasound era By its creative nature it is resistant to be tighten up by evidence-based recommendations at least at this stage of development Existing guidelines tend to be local in nature and are tailored to individual hospitals rather than countries or regions The COVID-19 pandemic, however, set a precedent ASRA (American Society of Regional Anesthesia) and ESRA (European Society of Regional Anes thesia) have issued joint COVID-19 Guidance for Regional Anesthesia","output":"Year 2020 in review C Regional anesthesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Suicide bereavement support groups are a widely available format of postvention service.

Therefore, treatment and follow-up should be managed dy-namically. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are fast workable, cheap, and easy to calculate he-matological parameters. We need easily accessible parameters as well as routine classifications such as Rockall score in the treatment and follow-up of NVUGIB patients, whose hemodynamics are unstable and progress with high mortality. In this study, we planned to evaluate NLR and PLR levels in patients with NVUGIB in the treatment follow-up with other scoring systems and their relationship with mortality in these patients. METHODS: Two hundred and forty-nine patients who were admitted to our clinic between January 2015 and January 2017 diag-nosed with NVUGIB, and who underwent necessary examinations and follow-ups, were included in the study. The patients' Glasgow Blacthford, Rockall Score, NLR, and PLR levels were calculated at the first admission. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-six of the patients were male (70.6%) and the mean age of all patients was 64.518.0 years. After follow-up and treatment, 28 (11.2%) patients died due to bleeding. High NLR and tachycardia at the time of admission and high patient age were found to be independent risk factors affecting the long of hospital stay. High Rockall score, high NLR at admission, and hy-potension at admission were shown to be independent risk factors affecting mortality. CONCLUSION: Besides the use of various scoring systems in patients with NVUGIB, we think that the use of simple hematological parameters may be appropriate and the use of these hematological parameters may be useful in the management of patients with unstable hemodynamics.","output":"Can neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio predict mortality in acute non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To appraise published studies on the use of supplemental oxygen in chronic heart failure.

Because it is a life-threatening condition, rapid diagnosis is necessary to prevent acute complications. Diagnostic criteria for rhabdomyolysis are elevated serum creatine kinase, liver enzyme levels, and myalgia. Rhabdomyolysis can easily be missed in patients with COVID-19. Herein, we report the case of a female with rhabdomyolysis as a manifestation of acute COVID-19. CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old female was found to have rhabdomyolysis associated with COVID-19. Her creatine kinase and liver enzyme levels were significantly elevated. Ringers lactate infusion was administered at a controlled rate to treat the rhabdomyolysis along with boluses of normal saline, with close monitoring of her oxygen saturation and kidney function. The patients creatine kinase and liver enzyme levels peaked on Day 2 and then decreased. Her medical condition improved, and she was discharged on Day 4. CONCLUSIONS: Our case highlights the need to monitor the creatine kinase level of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Fluid management can be challenging in patients with rhabdomyolysis due to COVID-19 because of the risk of fluid overload and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

In addition, new strains of bacteria and viruses have emerged as the causative agents of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress. Protozoans and saprophytic fungi, which are not normally associated with respiratory infection, have also emerged as respiratory pathogens particularly in individuals with AIDS or in those who are otherwise immunocompromised.

Public health policies are of particular importance, as they often dictate matters in life and death. Accumulating evidence indicates that good-intentioned COVID-19 policies, such as shelter-in-place measures, can often result in unintended consequences among vulnerable populations such as nursing home residents and domestic violence victims. Thus, to shed light on the issue, this study aimed to identify policy-making processes that have the potential of developing policies that could induce optimal desirable outcomes with limited to no unintended consequences amid the pandemic and beyond. Methods: A literature review was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus to answer the research question. To better structure the review and the subsequent analysis, theoretical frameworks such as the social ecological model were adopted to guide the process. Results: The findings suggested that: (1) people-centered; (2) artificial intelligence (AI)-powered; (3) data-driven, and (4) supervision-enhanced policy-making processes could help society develop policies that have the potential to yield desirable outcomes with limited unintended consequences.

Sixty-five ECG Holter recordings from young (mean age 22.6  3.4 years), physically fit male subjects 4C6 weeks after the second negative test (considered to be the start of recovery) and twenty-six control male subjects (mean age 23.2  2.9 years) were considered in the study. Night-time RR time series were extracted from ECG signals. Selected linear as well as nonlinear HRV parameters were calculated. We found significant differences in Portas symbolic analysis parameters V0 and V2 (p < 0.001), (2) (p < 0.001), very low-frequency component (VLF; p = 0.022) and respiratory peak (from the PRSA method; p = 0.012). These differences may be caused by the changes of activity of the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system as well as by the coupling of respiratory rhythm with heart rate due to an increase in pulmonary arterial vascular resistance. The results suggest that the differences with the control group in the HRV parameters, that reflect the functional state of the autonomic nervous system, are measurable after a few weeks from the beginning of the recovery even in the post-COVID groupa young and physically active population. We indicate HRV sensitive markers which may be used in long-term monitoring of patients after recovery.","output":"Heart rate variability comparison between young males after 4C6 weeks from the end of SARS-CoV-2 infection and controls"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I propose novel partial identification bounds on disease prevalence from information on test rate and test yield.

METHODS: Australian HCWs were invited to participate a nationwide, voluntary, anonymous, single time-point, online survey between 27th August and 23rd October 2020. Complete responses on demographics, home and work situation, and measures of health and psychological wellbeing were received from 7846 participants. RESULTS: The most commonly reported adaptive coping strategies were maintaining exercise (44.9%) and social connections (31.7%). Over a quarter of HCWs (26.3%) reported increased alcohol use which was associated with a history of poor mental health and worse personal relationships. Few used psychological wellbeing apps or sought professional help; those who did were more likely to be suffering from moderate to severe symptoms of mental illness. People living in Victoria, in regional areas, and those with children at home were significantly less likely to report adaptive coping strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Personal, social, and workplace predictors of coping strategies and help-seeking behaviour during the pandemic were identified. Use of maladaptive coping strategies and low rates of professional help-seeking indicate an urgent need to understand the effectiveness of, and the barriers and enablers of accessing, different coping strategies.","output":"Coping strategies adopted by Australian frontline health workers to address psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The partial lockdown has brought insignificant effects on the entire economy.

The bacterium resides in aquatic environments worldwide. Continuous testing of V. cholerae contamination in water and aquatic products is imperative for food safety control and human health. In this study, a rapid and visualized method was for the first time developed based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for detection of very important virulence-related genes ace , zot , cri , and nanH for toxins and infection process of V. cholerae . Three pairs of molecular probes targeting each of these genes were designed and synthesized. The one-step LAMP reaction was conducted at 65 o C for 40 min. Positive results were simply inspected by the production of light green color under visible light or green fluorescence under UV light (302 nm). Limit of detection (LOD) of the LAMP method ranged from 1.85-2.06 pg/reaction of genomic DNA or 2.50-4.0010 2 CFU/reaction for target genes of cell culture of V. cholerae , which was more sensitive than standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Inclusivity and exclusivity of the LAMP method were 100% for all target genes. The method showed similar high efficiency to a certain extent in rapid testing of spiked or collected specimens of water and aquatic products. Target genes were detected by the absence from all water samples from various sources. However, high occurrences of nanH gene were observed in intestine samples derived from four species of fish and one species of shellfish, indicating a risk of potentially toxic V. cholerae in commonly consumed aquatic products.

Due to the lack of kinetic investigations on reactions of silicon-based organic precursors, rate constants were usually analogized to those of their hydrocarbon counterparts. Investigations on the similarities and differences between the two types of compounds become necessary. This work reports a comparative theoretical investigation on H-abstraction reactions with H and CH3 attacking for silanes and their alkane counterparts, including silane and methane, disilane, methylsilane and ethane, dimethylsilane and propane, trimethylsilane and iso-butane, and tetramethylsilane and neo-pentane at the domain-based local pair natural orbital coupled cluster with perturbative triple excitations (DLPNO-CCSD(T))/cc-pVTZ//M06-2X/cc-pVTZ level. The rate constants were calculated using the conventional transition-state theory coupled with the asymmetric Eckart tunneling corrections over 600-2000 K. The calculated results show that dramatic discrepancies exist between H-abstraction from silicon sites in silanes and equivalent carbon sites in their alkane counterparts with H and CH3 attacking. The H-abstraction reactions from the primary carbon sites in silanes have generally lower barrier energies than the similar reactions in their alkane counterparts, while those in methylsilane and dimethylsilane with H attacking are the only two with higher barrier energies. Electrostatic potential mapped molecular van der Waals surfaces were adopted to provide insight into the calculated trends in barrier energies. The H-abstraction reactions from silicon sites in silanes have much higher rate constants than those from equivalent carbon sites in their alkane counterparts, especially under low-temperature conditions, while the rate constants of H-abstraction reactions from primary carbon sites in silanes and their alkane counterparts show relatively strong analogy.","output":"Theoretical Investigation on H-Abstraction Reactions of Silanes with H and CH3 Attacking: A Comparative Study with Alkane Counterparts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The development of thoracic central venous obstruction (TCVO) leads to narrowing of the vessel lumen which impacts blood flow and the placement of central venous access.

System is used to obtain central venous access (CVA) in patients with TCVO by facilitating catheter insertion via the novel Inside-Out? approach. This review summarizes the results of clinical studies to date with the Surfacer System, focusing on the how the procedure is performed, clinical efficacy and safety of the device and patient populations where the device offers substantial clinical benefit. EXPERT OPINION The Surfacer System offers a safe and effective approach to reliably preserve and restore critical upper body vascular access sites. For dialysis patients, the device offers an alternative which avoids placement of dialysis catheters in veins which may impact the ability to achieve maturation of hemodialysis vascular access or in locations which have an increased risk of insertion-related complications or are associated with higher morbidity.","output":"Overview of the safety and efficacy of the Surfacer?

Here, we describe CoV infections and clinical characteristics among adults (>18 years) presenting with respiratory illness in Cleveland, Ohio. METHODS: Between February 1, 2016 and April 30, 2017, 2949 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were analyzed by NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel in adults presenting with respiratory illness at MetroHealth Medical Center. Clinical data were collected on adults whose samples screened positive for CoV-HKU1, CoV-OC43, CoV-229E or CoV-NL63. RESULTS: Coronaviruses were detected in 192 (6.5%) adults including 105 (3.5%) OC43, 67 (2.3%) 229E, 13 (0.4%) HKU1 and 7 (0.2%) NL63. The majority of adults with coronavirus infection were females (66.2%) with a median age of 53 years. Common comorbidities included smoking (40.0%), asthma (38.0%), COPD (35.4%), and inhaled corticosteroid use (28.6%). Eighty-five (46.4%) required admission to the hospital. Common presenting symptoms included shortness of breath (42.7%) and cough (31.0%) whereas fever was uncommon (12.5%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were more common in HKU1 and NL63 infected adults. Seventy-three percent of coronavirus disease occurred between the months of January and March. Despite the recognition of coronavirus infection, 70 (36.5%) received antibiotics for their disease. CONCLUSION: This study provides needed insight into clinical characteristics and severity associated with coronavirus infection in adults.

This study describes variation in vaccination uptake by sociodemographic characteristics between December 2020 and August 2021. METHODS Using population-level administrative records linked to the 2011 Census, we estimated monthly first dose vaccination rates by age group and sociodemographic characteristics among adults aged 18 years or over in England. We also present a tool to display the results interactively. RESULTS Our sample included 35 223 466 adults. A lower percentage of males than females were vaccinated in the young and middle age groups (18-59 years) but not in the older age groups. Vaccination rates were highest among individuals of White British and Indian ethnic backgrounds and lowest among Black Africans (aged 80 years) and Black Caribbeans (18-79 years). Differences by ethnic group emerged as soon as vaccination roll-out commenced and widened over time. Vaccination rates were also lower among individuals who identified as Muslim, lived in more deprived areas, reported having a disability, did not speak English as their main language, lived in rented housing, belonged to a lower socioeconomic group, and had fewer qualifications. CONCLUSION We found inequalities in COVID-19 vaccination uptake rates by sex, ethnicity, religion, area deprivation, disability status, English language proficiency, socioeconomic position and educational attainment, but some of these differences varied by age group.

It was performed the comet assay to evaluate DNA damage. The immunophenotyping of TCD4+ lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood was performed by flow cytometry. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PON1, XRCC1, IL6, IL6R, TNF-, and MIR137 genes were evaluated by real-time PCR. The exposed group was composed mostly by males (69.44%), with direct exposure to pesticides (56%) and with an average age range of 46  13.89 years, being that 58.3% of farmworkers directly exposed to pesticides and reported the full use of personal protective equipment (PPE). DNA damage was greater in the exposed group (p < 0.05), reinforced by the use of PPE to denote a lower degree of DNA damage (p = 0.002). In this context, in the exposed group, we demonstrated that the use of PPE, age, gender and intoxication events were the variables that most contributed to increase DNA damage (p < 0.0001). Besides, the exposed group showed a significant increase in the subpopulations of T lymphocytes CD3+ CD4+ (p = 0.04) and CD3+ CD4+ CD25+ (p < 0.0001). SNPs in the TNF- (rs361525) gene presented a difference in the genotype distribution between the groups (p = 0.002). The genotype distribution of TNF- (rs361525) was also positively correlated with the DNA damage of the exposed group (r = 0.19; p = 0.01), demonstrating a higher risk of DNA damage in the farmworkers presenting the A mutated allele. Our findings demonstrate that pesticides can exert various deleterious effects on human health by damaging the DNA as well as by influencing the immune system in the case of both direct or indirect exposure and these issues are associated to age, gender, intoxication and the nonuse of PPE.","output":"Multi-biomarker responses to pesticides in an agricultural population from Central Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, due to the global increase in new cases of infections, the World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 disease a pandemic.

The model is extended to capture the role of immigration, governmental interventions and public perception of risk regarding the number of critical cases and deaths. The model is fitted to the currently available data on cumulative COVID-19 cases in Ghana and trends of outcomes quantitatively estimated. Results suggest that intervention in the form of lockdown lengthens the period of reaching the peak of infection, thereby giving time for policymaking and management of pandemic. Simulation results suggest that detection of exposed individuals has great potential to reduce daily detected cases and flatten the cumulative curve during the early stages of the pandemic. Thus, more effort should be targeted towards increasing contact tracing and detection of those suspected to be exposed to COVID-19 in order to curtail the spread of the disease.

With that, the comparable long-term protection conferred by previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective observational study comparing three groups: (1)SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals who received a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, (2)previously infected individuals who have not been vaccinated, and (3)previously infected and single dose vaccinated individuals. Three multivariate logistic regression models were applied. In all models we evaluated four outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic disease, COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. The follow-up period of June 1 to August 14, 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel. ResultsSARS-CoV-2-naive vaccinees had a 13.06-fold (95% CI, 8.08 to 21.11) increased risk for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant compared to those previously infected, when the first event (infection or vaccination) occurred during January and February of 2021. The increased risk was significant (P<0.001) for symptomatic disease as well. When allowing the infection to occur at any time before vaccination (from March 2020 to February 2021), evidence of waning natural immunity was demonstrated, though SARS-CoV-2 naive vaccinees had a 5.96-fold (95% CI, 4.85 to 7.33) increased risk for breakthrough infection and a 7.13-fold (95% CI, 5.51 to 9.21) increased risk for symptomatic disease. SARS-CoV-2-naive vaccinees were also at a greater risk for COVID-19-related-hospitalizations compared to those that were previously infected. ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity. Individuals who were both previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the vaccine gained additional protection against the Delta variant.","output":"Comparing SARS-CoV-2 natural immunity to vaccine-induced immunity: reinfections versus breakthrough infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The ongoing West African Ebola epidemic began in December 2013 in Guinea, probably from a single zoonotic introduction. As a result of ineffective initial control efforts, an Ebola outbreak of unprecedented scale emerged. As of 4 May 2015, it had resulted in more than 19,000 probable and confirmed Ebola cases, mainly in Guinea (3,529), Liberia (5,343), and Sierra Leone (10,746). Here, we present analyses of data collected during the outbreak identifying drivers of transmission and highlighting areas where control could be improved. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Over 19,000 confirmed and probable Ebola cases were reported in West Africa by 4 May 2015. Individuals with confirmed or probable Ebola (cases) were asked if they had exposure to other potential Ebola cases (potential source contacts) in a funeral or non-funeral context prior to becoming ill. We performed retrospective analyses of a case line-list, collated from national databases of case investigation forms that have been reported to WHO. These analyses were initially performed to assist WHOs response during the epidemic, and have been updated for publication. We analysed data from 3,529 cases in Guinea, 5,343 in Liberia, and 10,746 in Sierra Leone; exposures were reported by 33% of cases. The proportion of cases reporting a funeral exposure decreased over time. We found a positive correlation (r = 0.35, p < 0.001) between this proportion in a given district for a given month and the within-district transmission intensity, quantified by the estimated reproduction number (R). We also found a negative correlation (r = ?0.37, p < 0.001) between R and the district proportion of hospitalised cases admitted within 4 days of symptom onset. These two proportions were not correlated, suggesting that reduced funeral attendance and faster hospitalisation independently influenced local transmission intensity. We were able to identify 14% of potential source contacts as cases in the case line-list. Linking cases to the contacts who potentially infected them provided information on the transmission network. This revealed a high degree of heterogeneity in inferred transmissions, with only 20% of cases accounting for at least 73% of new infections, a phenomenon often called super-spreading. Multivariable regression models allowed us to identify predictors of being named as a potential source contact. These were similar for funeral and non-funeral contacts: severe symptoms, death, non-hospitalisation, older age, and travelling prior to symptom onset. Non-funeral exposures were strongly peaked around the death of the contact. There was evidence that hospitalisation reduced but did not eliminate onward exposures. We found that Ebola treatment units were better than other health care facilities at preventing exposure from hospitalised and deceased individuals. The principal limitation of our analysis is limited data quality, with cases not being entered into the database, cases not reporting exposures, or data being entered incorrectly (especially dates, and possible misclassifications). CONCLUSIONS: Achieving elimination of Ebola is challenging, partly because of super-spreading. Safe funeral practices and fast hospitalisation contributed to the containment of this Ebola epidemic. Continued real-time data capture, reporting, and analysis are vital to track transmission patterns, inform resource deployment, and thus hasten and maintain elimination of the virus from the human population.","output":"Exposure Patterns Driving Ebola Transmission in West Africa: A Retrospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed increased strain on healthcare systems worldwide with enormous reorganisation undertaken to support  COVID-centric' services Non-COVID-19 admissions reduced secondary to public health measures to halt viral transmission We aimed to understand the impact of the response to COVID-19 on the outcomes of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeds Design/methods: A retrospective observational multicentre study comparing outcomes following endoscopy for UGI bleeds from 24 March 2020 to 20 April 2020 to the corresponding dates in 2019 The primary outcome was in-hospital survival at 30 days with secondary outcomes of major rebleeding within 30 days postprocedure and intervention at the time of endoscopy Results: 224 endoscopies for 203 patients with UGI bleeds were included within this study 19 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 There was a 44 4% reduction in the number of procedures performed between 2019 and 2020 Endoscopies performed for UGI bleeds in the COVID-19 era were associated with an adjusted reduced 30-day survival (OR 0 25, 95% CI 0 08-0 67) There was no increased risk of major rebleeding or interventions during this era Patients with COVID-19 did not have reduced survival or increased complication rates Conclusion: Endoscopy for UGI bleeds in the COVID-19 era is associated with reduced survival No clear cause has been identified but we suspect that this is a secondary effect of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic Urgent work is required to encourage the public to seek medical help if required and to optimise patient pathways to ensure that the best possible care is provided","output":"Reduced survival after upper gastrointestinal bleed endoscopy in the COVID-19 era is a secondary effect of the response to the global pandemic: A retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In this work, a COVID19 Application Programming Interface (API) was built using the Representational State Transfer (REST) API architecture and it is designed to fetch data daily from the Nigerian Center for Disease Control (NCDC) website.

Decisions to test or not to test and, if testing, how many tests, how often and for how long, are complex decisions that need to be taken under uncertainty and conflicting pressures from various stakeholders. METHOD: We have developed an agent-based model and simulation tool that can be used to analyze the outcomes and effectiveness of different testing strategies and scenarios in schools with various number of classrooms and class sizes. We have applied a modified version of a standard SEIR disease transmission model that includes symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious populations, and that incorporates feasible public health measures. We also incorporated a pre-symptomatic phase for symptomatic cases. Every day, a random number of students in each class are tested. If they tested positive, they are placed in self-isolation at home when the test results are provided. Last but not least, we have included options to allow for full testing or complete self-isolation of a classroom with a positive case. RESULTS: We present sample simulation results for parameter values based on schools and disease related information, in the Province of Ontario, Canada. The findings show that testing can be an effective method in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools if taken frequently, with expedited test results and self-isolation of infected students at home. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that while testing cannot eliminate the risk and has its own challenges, it can significantly control outbreaks when combined with other measures, such as masks and other protective measures.","output":"Simulating preventative testing of SARS-CoV-2 in schools: policy implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal, seniors saw their social and family activities interrupted. Social isolation and loneliness were a challenge to overcome as they were far from their family and friends and even deprived of their routine and leisure activities. Recognizing that Social Networks Sites (SNS) become a form of socialization and social integration for some seniors in Portugal and given that their use is positively linked to social inclusion (Richter et al., 2013), a study was carried out based on telephone interviews deconstructed during confinement. The non-probabilistic and convenience sample covers 19 seniors with a profile created on Facebook. The data treated in MAXQDA2020 aimed the qualitative and quantitative approaches supported by categorical analysis. The aim of this research is to analyse the behaviors of seniors regarding the use of SNS and how these could contribute to minimize social isolation and help them reduce the feeling of loneliness. The investigation showed the existence of a greater propensity to not use SNS. Specifically, they used Facebook to communicate, relate, maintain, or get in touch with their network and as a form of entertainment to occupy their free time. Another important discovery of this investigation was that the seniors had, in a period of longer isolation, a greater predisposition to the use of new tools and platforms that helped them to maintain relationships, offline activities and social participation.

Firstly, a rumor propagation model with two language spreaders, in which the immunologic mechanism is considered in the ignorant, is proposed on heterogeneous networks. Secondly, the basic reproduction number and the dynamic behaviors are analyzed by using the next-generation matrix method and Lyapunov stability theory, respectively. Moreover, two control strategies are designed to effectively suppress the spread of the rumor. The one is continuous control strategy. By applying real-time control to the spreaders, the rumor spreading time can be greatly reduced and the rumor can die out in a short time. The other is event-triggered impulsive control strategy, which can effectively reduce the consumption of resources and ensure the extinction of the rumor. Finally, the correctness of theoretical analysis and the feasibility of control methods are verified by numerical simulations.","output":"The spread and control of rumors in a multilingual environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent comparative studies on mobility patterns are emerging to describe the changes in mobility patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic Most of the current studies utilize travel volume per day as the critical indicator and identify the impacted period by the dates of governmental lockdown or stay-at-home orders, which however may not accurately present the actual impacted dates The objective of this study is to provide an alternative perspective to identify the normal and pandemic-influenced daily traffic patterns Instead of only using traffic volumes per day or assuming the impacted travel pattern began with the stay-at-home order, the methodology in this study investigates the within-day time-dependent travel speed as time series, and then applies dynamic time warping algorithm and hierarchical clustering unsupervised classification methods to classify days into various groups without assuming a start date for any group Using the state-wide travel speed data in Alabama, these study measures dissimilarities among within-day travel speed time series By incorporating the dissimilarities/distance matrix, various agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) methods (average, complete, Ward's) are tested to conduct proper unsupervised classification The Ward's AHC classification results show that within-day travel speed pattern in Alabama shifted more than two weeks before the issuance of the State stay-at-home order The results further show that a new travel speed pattern appears at the end of stay-at-home order, which is different from either the normal pattern before the pandemic or the initial pandemic-influenced pattern, which leads to a conclusion that a new normal within-day travel pattern emerges ? 2021 The Authors","output":"Within-day travel speed pattern unsupervised classification C A data driven case study of the State of Alabama during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate viral loads at different stages of disease progression in patients infected with the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the first four months of the epidemic in Zhejiang province, China. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A designated hospital for patients with covid-19 in Zhejiang province, China. PARTICIPANTS: 96 consecutively admitted patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection: 22 with mild disease and 74 with severe disease. Data were collected from 19 January 2020 to 20 March 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load measured in respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples. Cycle threshold values, a measure of nucleic acid concentration, were plotted onto the standard curve constructed on the basis of the standard product. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained through data collection forms from electronic medical records, and the relation between clinical data and disease severity was analysed. RESULTS: 3497 respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples were collected from patients after admission and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load. Infection was confirmed in all patients by testing sputum and saliva samples. RNA was detected in the stool of 55 (59%) patients and in the serum of 39 (41%) patients. The urine sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The median duration of virus in stool (22 days, interquartile range 17-31 days) was significantly longer than in respiratory (18 days, 13-29 days; P=0.02) and serum samples (16 days, 11-21 days; P<0.001). The median duration of virus in the respiratory samples of patients with severe disease (21 days, 14-30 days) was significantly longer than in patients with mild disease (14 days, 10-21 days; P=0.04). In the mild group, the viral loads peaked in respiratory samples in the second week from disease onset, whereas viral load continued to be high during the third week in the severe group. Virus duration was longer in patients older than 60 years and in male patients. CONCLUSION: The duration of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly longer in stool samples than in respiratory and serum samples, highlighting the need to strengthen the management of stool samples in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and the virus persists longer with higher load and peaks later in the respiratory tissue of patients with severe disease.","output":"Viral load dynamics and disease severity in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Zhejiang province, China, January-March 2020: retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was recently found to influence worse clinical outcome following SARS-CoV-2 infection (doi: 10.1186/s12979-020-00185-x). Other findings showed that CMV and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) reactivations are observed in patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (HYPERLINK \\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-020-03252-3\\" doi.org/10.1186/s13054-020-03252-3). Addressing occurrence of Herpesviridae reactivation in immunocompetent patients and still unspecified triggers of reactivation, we tested potent xenobiotic 2,3,7,8-tetrachrolodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), which current body burden (DBB) ranges from 20 pg/g (TEQ in fat) in general population to 100 pg/g in older people. Methods & Materials In silico quantitation of active dioxin response enhancers (DRE) in promoters of viral genes. Plaque assay of viral titer. Virus DNA hybridization assay. Clinico-epidemiological analysis. Results In silico analysis revealed in regulatory region of CMV IE genes from 5 to 10 DRE, and from 6 to 8 DRE in regulatory region of HSV-1 IE genes. We established that a picomolar TCDD can trigger up-regulation of CMV and HSV-1 genes via AhR:Arnt transcription factor in macrophage (doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2012.05.265) and glial human cell lines (doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2016.06.1268), respectively. In fact, viral reactivation may be triggered in COVID-19 ARDS patients by higher pulmonary TCDD concentrations, as lipid storm within lungs of severe COVID-19 patients has been recently reported (doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.04.20242115). Due to hydrophobic character (Log PO/W: 7.05), TCDD partitions into inflammatory lipids in lung tissue thus augmenting its local concentration. Population-based epidemiological data on SARS-CoV-2 first wave of pandemic showed that picomolar TCDD can reactivate CMV (measured by high CMV seropositivity), as cumulative mortality rate 4.5 times was revealed in Lombardi region of Italy where after Seveso industrial accident TCDD plasma level in pre-exposed subjects still is 15 times the level in rest of Italy (doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.620416). Also, Arctic Native (AN) peoples have TCDD body burden 7 times that in general population, as they consume dioxin-contaminated fat in seafood, and their COVID-19 mortality is 2.2 times of that among non-AN Alaskans (doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6949a3). Conclusion TCDD in picomolar range may trigger CMV expression in lung cells and commit virus to the lytic cycle, which can be applied to reactivation of Herpesviridae infection in immunocompetent patients with COVID-19 ARDS syndrome.","output":"Reactivation of CMV and HSV-1 Among Severe COVID-19 Patients May be Triggered by Increased Level of Pulmonary Dioxin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Faced with the current large-scale public health emergency, collecting, sorting, and analyzing biomedical information related to the \\"coronavirus\\" should be done as quickly as possible to gain a global perspective, which is a basic requirement for strengthening epidemic control capacity.

In this context, doping prevention measures play a crucial role to protect individuals both within and outside the context of elite sport. Based on the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature search was conducted in the databases ProQuest (ERIC), Scopus, PSYNDEX/PsychInfo, PubMed, and Web of Science Core Collection to provide an overview of the impact of doping prevention measures, with particular attention to the underlying understanding of learning. As a result of the screening process, 30 of the initial 5,591 articles met the previously defined and recorded eligibility criteria. The analysis led to heterogeneous results regarding content, implementation, target group, or outcome variables considered relevant. Two-thirds of the studies related to the competitive sports context. Nevertheless, there has been a growing interest in studying doping prevention and its effects on non-elite athlete target groups in recent years. In terms of effectiveness, many measures did not achieve long-term changes or did not collect any follow-up data. This contrasts with understanding learning as sustained change and reduces the intended long-term protection of prevention measures, especially for adolescent target groups. Even young age groups from 10 years upwards benefited from doping prevention measures, and almost all doping prevention measures enabled their participants to increase their physical and health literacy. No conclusion can be drawn as to whether doping prevention measures based on constructivist ideas are superior to cognitivist approaches or a combination of both. Nevertheless, programs that actively engage their participants appear superior to lecture-based knowledge transfer. Most of the prevention measures offered a benefit-orientation so that participants can achieve added value, besides trying to initiate health-promoting change through rejection. Because of the lack of sustained changes, a further modification in doping prevention seems necessary. The review results support the value of primary prevention. Doping prevention measures should enable tailored learning and development options in the sense of more meaningful differentiation to individual needs. The implementation in a school context or an online setting is promising and sees doping as a problem for society. The review highlights the importance of accompanying evaluation measures to identify efficient prevention components that promote health and protect young people.","output":"Efficient Ways to Combat Doping in a Sports Education Context!?

Determine the incidence of poor outcomes (mechanical ventilation (MV), ICU admission, death, and venous thromboembolism (VTE)), 2. Describe the clinical characteristics of this group, and 3. Evaluate relationships between demographics, diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, and inflammatory markers on outcomes. We hypothesized that older age, male gender, African American ethnicity, DM, obesity, and elevated inflammatory markers would predict poor outcomes. 8751 inpatients were included, of whom 682 (7.79%) required MV, 867 (9.91%) were admitted to the ICU, 753 (8.6%) died, and 430 (4.91%) had VTE. 4447 (50.8%) were African American, 4951 (56.6%) female, 5152 (58.9%) &amp;gt;age 50, and 2068 (23.6%) had DM.

In settings where COVID-19 prevalence is low, there may be a benefit of extending the period that patients are isolated to decrease the risk of transmission. This study explored the duration of viral shedding in such a location, in patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 disease in Ballarat, Australia. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 disease using a real-time reverse-transcriptaseCpolymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay from oropharyngeal and bilateral deep nasopharyngeal sampling and managed through Ballarat Health Services between March 1 and May 1, 2020 were included. Patients were retested if they were afebrile for >72 hours, asymptomatic and >14 days since symptom onset. If positive on retesting, patients were tested every 3 to 7 days thereafter. RESULTS: Patients underwent testing a median of 4 days (range 1-12) after initial symptom onset. Duration of symptoms ranged from 1 to 36 days. Positive tests were recorded up to a median of day 21 (range 6-38). Cycle thresholds were inversely correlated with time since symptom onset (P < .0001). Median time to the first negative test was 25 days (range 12-32). Two patients who had remained asymptomatic for >7 days after initial symptom onset had recrudescence of mild symptoms on day 13 and 14; both tested positive on follow-up tests at this time.

This is because the most powerful contractualist objections to locking down are likely to be based on the VoC.When we apply the value of choice view (VoC), we see that a lockdown policy's justifiability depends on the extent to which particular values of choice are found to be threatened by the policy in question, and what safeguards policy-makers have put in place to increase the value of choice and protect people from the harmful consequences of lockdown. Without the VoC, it is harder to explain why lockdowns, to be non-rejectable, must have certain features. With the VoC, the case for contractualism over cost benefit analysis (CBA) can be made even stronger.","output":"Values for victims and vectors of disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China followed by its spread around the world poses a serious global concern for public health with almost 90000 people infected and thousands of fatalities To conquer viral infections, the inhibition of proteases essential for proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins is a conventional therapeutic strategy To this date, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to treat SARS-CoV-2 despite its close relation to the SARS-CoV-1 virus that caused a similar epidemic in 2003 Thus, there remains an urgent need for the development of specific antiviral therapeutics to conquer SARS-CoV-2 In order to find novel inhibitors, we computationally screened a compound library of over 687 million compounds for binding at the recently solved crystal structure of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 A screening of such a vast chemical space for SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors has not been reported before After shape screening, two docking protocols were applied followed by the determination of pharmacokinetically relevant molecular descriptors to narrow down the initial hits Next, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to validate the stability of docked binding modes and comprehensively quantify ligand binding energies After evaluation of off-target binding, we report a list of 11 drug-like compounds with improved binding free energy to the target protease in contrast to the cocrystallized peptidomimetic lead compound that suffers from poor pharmacokinetic properties Furthermore, we identified one potent binder with comparable properties from the natural compound library","output":"Inhibitors for Novel Coronavirus Protease Identified by Virtual Screening of 687 Million Compounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of Xuebijing injection on the inflammatory markers and prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: Sixty severe COVID-19 patients admitted to Changsha Public Health Treatment Center (North Hospital of the First Hospital of Changsha City) from January to March in 2020 were randomly divided into routine treatment group, Xuebijing 50 mL group and Xuebijing 100 mL group, with 20 cases in each group. The routine treatment group was treated according to the National Health Commission's guide for COVID-19. On the basis of conventional treatment, Xuebijing injection was injected by 50 mL twice a day for 7 days in Xuebijing 50 mL group, while by 100 mL twice a day for 7 days in Xuebijing 100 mL group. The blood routine test, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid test and disease classification of three groups before and 8 days after treatment were observed. RESULTS: (1) After treatment, the white blood cell count (WBC) and lymphocyte count (LYM) of three groups increased, meanwhile CRP and ESR decreased. Compared with routine treatment group, the WBC count of Xuebijing 100 mL group after treatment significantly increased (109/L: 7.120.55 vs. 5.670.51, P < 0.05), and the levels of CRP and ESR in Xuebijing 50 mL and 100 mL groups significantly decreased [CRP (mg/L): 32.34.6, 28.06.2 vs. 37.35.9; ESR (mm/1 h): 45.95.7, 40.57.4 vs. 55.36.6, all P < 0.05]. Compared with Xuebijing 50 mL group, the increase of WBC, and the decrease of CRP and ESR were more significant in Xuebijing 100 mL group [WBC (109/L): 7.120.55 vs. 5.820.49, CRP (mg/L): 28.06.2 vs. 32.34.6, ESR (mm/1 h): 40.57.4 vs. 45.95.7, all P < 0.05]. (2) After treatment, the APACHE II score of three groups decreased. In Xuebijing 100 mL group, the APACHE II score after treatment was significantly lower than those in routine treatment and Xuebijing 50 mL groups (12.31.5 vs. 16.51.6, 15.91.4, both P < 0.05). After treatment, the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test in three groups partly turned negative, with 9 cases in routine treatment group, 8 cases in Xuebijing 50 mL group and 9 cases in Xuebijing 100 mL group, without significant difference (P > 0.05). The conditions of patients in the three groups were improved after treatment, among them, 8 cases in the routine treatment group were transformed into common type, 1 case into critical type; 9 cases and 12 cases of Xuebijing 50 mL group and 100 mL group were transformed into common type respectively. Xuebijing 100 mL group was improved more obviously than Xuebijing 50 mL group and routine treatment group (both P < 0.05).

It results in motor dysfunction and a wide variety of comorbidities like epilepsy, pain, speech, hearing and vision disorders, cognitive dysfunction, and eating and digestive difficulties. Central data collection is essential to study the epidemiology, clinical presentations, care, and quality of life of patients affected by CP. CP specialists founded the Swiss Cerebral Palsy Registry (Swiss-CP-Reg) in 2017. This paper describes the design, structure, aims and achievements of the Swiss-CP-Reg and presents first results. METHODS: Swiss-CP-Reg records patients of any age suffering from CP who are born, treated, or live in Switzerland. It collects data from medical records and reports, from questionnaires answered by patients and their families, and from data linkage with routine statistics and other registries. The registry contains information on diagnosis, clinical presentation, comorbidities, therapies, personal information, family history, and quality of life. RESULTS: From August 2017 to August 2021, 546 participants (55% males, mean age at registration 8 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 5-12) were enrolled in Swiss-CP-Reg. Most had been born at term (56%), were less than 2 years old at diagnosis (73%, median 9 months, IQR: 18-25), and were diagnosed with spastic CP (76%). Most (59%) live with a mild motor impairment (Gross Motor Function Classification System [GMFCS] level I or II), 12% with a moderate motor impairment (GMFCS level III), and 29% with a severe motor impairment (GMFCS level IV or V). In a subset of 170 participants, we measured intelligence quotient (IQ) and saw a reduced IQ by GMFCS scale increase. The Swiss-CP-Reg has a strong interest in research with currently 5 nested projects running, and many more planned. CONCLUSIONS: Swiss-CP-Reg collects and exchanges national data on people living with CP to answer clinically relevant questions. Its structure enables retrospective and prospective data collection and knowledge exchange between experts to optimise and standardise treatment and improve the health and quality of life of those diagnosed with CP in Switzerland.","output":"Cohort profile: the Swiss Cerebral Palsy Registry (Swiss-CP-Reg) cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Both developing and developed countries have felt the impact of COVID-19 on global politics and trade The African continent faces new threats in addition to already existing challenges like poor infrastructure, underdevelopment and weak institutions Through an analysis of official speeches and UN reports on the emerging developments around COVID-19, this paper explores the impact of the pandemic on Africa and answers the critical question of the potential and place for Africas international relations in a post-COVID world While many argue that COVID-19 has further deepened the gap between Africa and the developed world, this paper argues that it has also created opportunities for innovation and a re-emergence of Africa as a more vital continent in global politics and far removed from its colonial legacy This study finds that Africas vast resources and wealth of experts;its innovative local industries and rapid response potential;its active community and grassroots;its committed private sector;the work of the African Union;the continents geopolitical and economic position, and its many lessons position it to be a strong player in a post-COVID world [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Politikon: South African Journal of Political Studies is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"New Opportunities and Threats: Reimagining Africas International Relations in the Midst of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the ionizing radiation exposure in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We therefore aimed to evaluate humoral and cellular immune responses to COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) in patients taking methotrexate and commonly used targeted biological therapies, compared with healthy controls. Given the roll-out of extended interval vaccination programmes to maximise population coverage, we present findings after the first dose. METHODS: In this cohort study, we recruited consecutive patients with a dermatologist-confirmed diagnosis of psoriasis who were receiving methotrexate or targeted biological monotherapy (tumour necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors, interleukin [IL]-17 inhibitors, or IL-23 inhibitors) from a specialist psoriasis centre serving London and South East England. Consecutive volunteers without psoriasis and not receiving systemic immunosuppression who presented for vaccination at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (London, UK) were included as the healthy control cohort. All participants had to be eligible to receive the BNT162b2 vaccine. Immunogenicity was evaluated immediately before and on day 28 (2 days) after vaccination. The primary outcomes were humoral immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, defined as neutralising antibody responses to wild-type SARS-CoV-2, and spike-specific T-cell responses (including interferon-, IL-2, and IL-21) 28 days after vaccination. FINDINGS: Between Jan 14 and April 4, 2021, 84 patients with psoriasis (17 on methotrexate, 27 on TNF inhibitors, 15 on IL-17 inhibitors, and 25 on IL-23 inhibitors) and 17 healthy controls were included. The study population had a median age of 43 years (IQR 31C52), with 56 (55%) males, 45 (45%) females, and 85 (84%) participants of White ethnicity. Seroconversion rates were lower in patients receiving immunosuppressants (60 [78%; 95% CI 67C87] of 77) than in controls (17 [100%; 80C100] of 17), with the lowest rate in those receiving methotrexate (seven [47%; 21C73] of 15). Neutralising activity against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 was significantly lower in patients receiving methotrexate (median 50% inhibitory dilution 129 [IQR 40C236]) than in controls (317 [213C487], p=00032), but was preserved in those receiving targeted biologics (269 [141C418]). Neutralising titres against the B.1.1.7 variant were similarly low in all participants. Cellular immune responses were induced in all groups, and were not attenuated in patients receiving methotrexate or targeted biologics compared with controls. INTERPRETATION: Functional humoral immunity to a single dose of BNT162b2 is impaired by methotrexate but not by targeted biologics, whereas cellular responses are preserved. Seroconversion alone might not adequately reflect vaccine immunogenicity in individuals with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases receiving therapeutic immunosuppression. Real-world pharmacovigilance studies will determine how these findings reflect clinical effectiveness.

This 3rd interim analysis of a living systematic review summarizes evidence on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) and duration of protection against Omicron. Methods: We systematically searched the COVID-19 literature for controlled studies evaluating the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines approved in the European Union up to 14/01/2022, complemented by hand-searches of websites and metasearch engines up to 11/02/2022. We considered the following comparisons: full primary immunization vs. no vaccination; booster immunization vs. no vaccination; booster vs. primary immunization. VE against any confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic, and severe COVID-19 (i.e. COVID-19-related hospitalization, ICU-admission, or death) was indicated providing estimate ranges. Meta-analysis was not performed due to high study heterogeneity. Risk of bias was assessed with ROBINS-I, certainty of evidence evaluated using GRADE. Results: We identified 26 studies, including 430 to 2.2 million participants. VE against any confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to no vaccination ranged between 0-62% after full primary immunization, and between 34-66% after a booster dose. VE-range for booster vs. primary immunization was 34-54.6%. Against symptomatic COVID-19, VE ranged between 6-76% after full primary immunization, and between 19-73.9% after booster immunization, if compared to no vaccination. When comparing booster vs. primary immunization VE ranged between 56-69%. VE against severe COVID-19 compared to no vaccination ranged between 3-84% after full primary immunization, and between 12-100% after a booster dose. One study compared booster vs. primary immunization (VE 100%, 95% CI 71.4-100). VE was characterized by a moderate to strong decline within three to six months for SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic COVID-19. Against severe COVID-19 protection remained robust at least for up to six months. Waning immunity was more profound after primary than booster immunization. Risk of bias was moderate to critical across studies and outcomes. GRADE-certainty was very low for all outcomes. Author's conclusions: Under the Omicron variant, effectiveness of EU-licensed COVID-19 vaccines in preventing any SARS-CoV-2 infection or mild disease is low and only short-lasting after primary immunization, but can be improved by booster vaccination. VE against severe COVID-19 remains high and is long-lasting, especially after receiving the booster vaccination.","output":"Facing the Omicron variant - How well do vaccines protect against mild and severe COVID-19?

Patient satisfaction data were obtained by immediate postvisit survey, across provider care received, logistics of setting up the appointment, and quality of the virtual health system connection. Patient cases highlighting opportunities for transgender telehealth were summarized. Results: Between September 9, 2019 and October 28, 2020, 99 telehealth encounters with video-to-video connection occurred. Twenty-three of the encounters were for gender-affirming hormone therapy, 17 for mental health visits, and 59 for speech therapy. Thirty-five surveys were collected from 20 patients. Overall patients were satisfied or very satisfied with providers' ability to manage their chief complaint through this modality (average 4.9 out of 5 on 1 to 5 scale with 1 being very dissatisfied and 5 being very satisfied) and strongly agree that telehealth is an effective means to accomplish care (average score 4.8 on 1 to 5 scale with 1 being strongly disagree and 5 strongly agree).

METHODS: A total of na?=a?268 surgery residency programs were investigated. Our database of website characteristics included: direct link to residency website from the American Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) program page, resident research requirement, listing of residents' publications, availability of residents' demographic information, program alumni information, board pass rates, attrition rate, detail of educational/academic activities, residents' evaluation methods, diversity, and mentorship. Inter-group analyses between academic and community-based programs were performed using Pearson's Chi-squared test. RESULTS: Academic and community-based general surgery residency program websites were compared based on twelve (12) different parameters.

Superiority of MWA could not be established. The volume reduction was 41.8% (Interquartile range, IQR, 14-63) in the MWA group compared to 62.2% (IQR 34.9-80.1) in the UAE group (p = 0.29). Effects on symptoms, HR-QoL and acceptability did not differ between groups. Days of hospitalization and sick leave were significantly fewer in the MWA group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Although superiority of MWA could not be established, it is a promising technique for treating uterine fibroids. It was well tolerated and associated with lower use of health care resources.

Since oral intake of Lactococcus lactis strain Plasma (LC-Plasma) enhances both the innate and acquired immune systems through activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), we hypothesized that the oral intake of LC-Plasma could aid the relief or prevention of symptoms in patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. Methods and analysis: This is an exploratory, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. This study was initiated in December 2021 and concludes in April 2023. The planned number of enrolled subjects is 100 (50 patients x 2 groups); subject enrolment will be conducted until October 2022. Patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 will be enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to Group A (oral intake of LC-Plasma-containing capsule, 200 mg/day, for 14 days) or Group B (oral intake of placebo capsule, for 14 days). The primary endpoint is the change in subjective symptoms measured by the severity score. Secondary endpoints include SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, biomarkers for pDC activation, serum SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, serum cytokines, interferon and interferon-inducible antiviral effectors, and the proportion of subjects with emergency room visits to medical institutions or who are hospitalized.

This retrospective evaluation of a human endotoxemia model quantified ACE2 and fibrin degradation product (FDP) concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT01714427). Twenty-four healthy volunteers received either 2  40 mg intravenous dexamethasone or placebo. These doses were administered 12 h apart prior to bronchoscopy-guided intrabronchial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation (control: saline into the contralateral lung segment). We quantified ACE2 concentration, the Angiotensin-II-to-Angiotensin-1-7 conversion rate as well as FDP in BALF 6 h after LPS instillation. In placebo-treated subjects, LPS instillation increased ACE2 concentrations compared to unstimulated lung segments [1,481 (IQR: 736C1,965) vs. 546 (413C988) pg/mL;p = 0.016]. Dexamethasone abolished the increase in ACE2 concentrations (p=0.13). Accordingly, LPS instillation increased the Angiotensin-II-to-Angiotensin-1-7 conversion capacity significantly in the placebo cohort, indicating increased enzymatic activity (p = 0.012). FDP increased following LPS-instillation [8.9 (2.7C12.2) vs. 6.6 (0.9C9.6) ng/mL, p = 0.025] in the placebo group, while dexamethasone caused a shut-down of fibrinolysis in both lung segments. LPS instillation increased ACE2 concentration, its enzymatic activity and FDP, which was mitigated by systemic dexamethasone treatment.

However, little is known around the most relevant factors to symptom change;whether certain emotion regulation and coping strategies are linked to better outcomes;and how people with EDs are adjusting to psychological interventions moving online. Method: In a mixed-method design, we collected qualitative and quantitative data from 207 (76 males) UK residents with self-reported ED, who described and ranked impacts of the pandemic on their symptoms. Regression analysis examined whether emotion regulation strategies were associated with self-reported symptom change, ED symptomatology, and negative emotional states. Thematic analysis explored participants experiences of the pandemic, particularly factors affecting their ED, coping strategies used, and experiences of psychological intervention. Results: Most participants (83.1%) reported worsening of ED symptomatology, though factors affecting symptom change differed between specific EDs. Emotion regulation, such as having fewer strategies, poorer emotional clarity, and non-acceptance of emotions, explained nearly half of the variance in emotional distress during the pandemic, and to a lesser extent also predicted ED symptomatology and symptom change. Qualitative findings indicated that difficult emotions (such as fear and uncertainty), changes to routine, confinement and unhelpful social messages were triggering for participants during the pandemic. While some participants described employing positive coping strategies (such as limiting social media exposure), many reported using ED behaviours (among other maladaptive strategies, like alcohol use) to cope with the pandemic. Finally, loss of treatment support, feeling underserving of support and experiencing a detached connection online were further exacerbating factors for these participants. Discussion: Our results show that people with EDs have been strongly affected by the pandemic, and that while beneficial for some, online treatment may need some improvement. Our paper discusses implications for online treatment such as taking into account personal circumstances and, in a time where people have limited control over the antecedents of negative emotion, the need to develop skills to manage emotions when they arise.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Individuals With Eating Disorders: the Role of Emotion Regulation and Exploration of Online Treatment Experiences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Educational data mining (EDM) is a cross-disciplinary technology involving computer science, education, statistics, etc. It analyzes and mines education-related data to discover and solve various types of education problems.

In this study, we prepared a fabricated sandwich structure composed of a Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through a facile and simple one-pot hydrothermal reaction. This framework of nanocomposites, which are modified with a glassy carbon electrode, constructed a bisphenol A (BPA) electrochemical sensor for the first time. Operational parameters such as pH, electrolytes, the amount of modifiers, deposition potentials and deposition time were optimised for the sensitive detection of BPA. The performance of electrodes was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. With differential pulse voltammetry, the detection concentration of BPA ranged from 0.05 mol L-1 to 100 mol L-1. The results revealed that the hierarchical nanocomposites demonstrated better electrocatalytic performance with large electrochemically active surface areas, high sensitivity and a low limit of detection (5.2 nmol L-1), compared with a physical mixture of ZIF-67 and rGO at the same ratio. These impressive features originate from the synergistic effects of ZIF-67 and rGO.

During vascular remodeling, activated endothelial cells can release pro-inflammatory factors that promote phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to the proliferative phenotype. We previously reported that MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, has a protective effect on the development of atherosclerosis and vascular calcification. However, the effect of MEK1/2 inhibitors on neointimal formation and the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. We determined that MEK1/2 inhibitor reduced carotid artery ligation-induced neointimal formation, while increased collagen and elastin levels and vascular integrality. Mechanistically, MEK1/2 inhibitor or ERK1/2 siRNA increased miR-126-3p level in endothelial cells, thereby inhibiting expression of regular of G-protein signaling 16 (RGS16), a miR-126-3p target gene, to activate the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12)/C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) signaling pathway. Accordingly, miR-126-3p was also increased by U0126 in serum and carotid artery. RGS16 was inhibited while CXCR4 and CXCL12 was increased by U0126 in neointimal areas, especially in the endothelium. Moreover, similar results were observed in atherosclerotic plaques of high-fat diet-fed apolipoprotein E deficiency (apoE-/-) mice. In addition, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), another miR-126-3p target gene, was reduced by U0126 in the neointimal areas, resulting reduced monocytes/macrophages accumulation. Taken together, our results indicate that MEK1/2 inhibitor can reduce neointima formation by activating endothelial miR-126-3p production to facilitate endothelium repair while reduce monocyte adhesion/infiltration.","output":"MEK1/2 inhibitor inhibits neointima formation by activating miR-126-3p/ C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12)/C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cortisol concentration of hair (HCC) is an established biomarker in stress research that can provide valuable retrospective information on subjects long-term cortisol levels.

Potential confounding factors that may affect HCC and might obfuscate the outcomes were considered. The results suggest that the two compared sample collection methods did not significantly differ from each other in terms of HCC (p = 0.307). A somewhat larger sample loss in the domestic setting was observed due to hair samples where HCC could not be determined (5.3 % vs. 1.8 % in the lab). Similarly, in a sample of N = 50 using a within-subjects design (Sample 2) no significant HCC differences between collection methods occurred (p = .206). In addition, potential moderating effects of personality traits of the Five-Factor-Model on the relationship between hair collection method and HCC were investigated. In Sample 1 personality data of the hair donor were available, while in Sample 2 personality data (n = 40) were available for the hair donor and the hair sample collector.

DESIGN: A Phase 2b, multicenter, open-label, rollover study. METHODS: LATTE participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml who completed at least 300 weeks on study were eligible. Participants elected to switch to either CAB+RPV long-acting Q2M or daily oral dolutegravir/RPV for maintenance of virologic suppression. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA greater than or equal to 50 copies/ml at Month 12 (M12) per the Food and Drug Administration Snapshot algorithm. The incidence of confirmed virologic failure (CVF, two consecutive HIV-1 RNA measurements greater than or equal to 200 copies/ml), as well as safety, laboratory, and patient-reported outcomes (HIV Treatment Satisfaction and preference questionnaires) were also assessed. RESULTS: Of 97 participants enrolled, 90 chose to receive CAB+RPV long-acting and seven chose dolutegravir/RPV. At M12, no participant had HIV-1 RNA greater than or equal to 50 copies/ml or met the CVF criterion in either treatment group. No new safety signals were identified.

We applied high-throughput genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 to 75% of cases in the State of Victoria (population 6.24 million) in Australia. METHODS: Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected through active case finding and contact tracing. A dedicated SARS-CoV-2 multidisciplinary genomic response team was formed to enable rapid integration of epidemiological and genomic data. Phylodynamic analysis was performed to assess the putative impact of social restrictions. RESULTS: Between 25 January and 14 April 2020, 1,333 COVID-19 cases were reported in Victoria, with a peak in late March. After applying internal quality control parameters, 903 samples were included in genomic analyses. Sequenced samples from Australia were representative of the global diversity of SARS-CoV-2, consistent with epidemiological findings of multiple importations and limited onward transmission. In total, 76 distinct genomic clusters were identified; these included large clusters associated with social venues, healthcare facilities and cruise ships. Sequencing of sequential samples from 98 patients revealed minimal intra-patient SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity. Phylodynamic modelling indicated a significant reduction in the effective viral reproductive number (Re) from 1.63 to 0.48 after the implementation of travel restrictions and population-level physical distancing. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a comprehensive framework for the use of SARS-CoV-2 genomics in public health responses. The application of genomics to rapidly identify SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains will become critically important as social restrictions ease globally. Public health responses to emergent cases must be swift, highly focused and effective.","output":"Tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia using genomics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Since the first reports of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019, the disease has spread worldwide. Different social isolation strategies have been adopted to reduce community transmission, but few studies have evaluated the pattern of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection in a family cluster during periods of isolation. We report an outbreak in 24 members of a family cluster during a period of social distancing. METHODOLOGY We carried out an observational descriptive study of a family cluster infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Pernambuco, Northeast Brazil. Laboratory confirmation included RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal samples or IgM or IgG serology. RESULTS The attack rates were 75% (19/24) based on laboratory-confirmed cases and 87.5% (21/24) including probable cases. The time of spread was 17 days from the first case. All patients had mild symptoms, requiring no hospitalization, and none of them died. The frequency of symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed patients was higher among adults (94%) than among children (50%); the paediatric age group also had a higher frequency of exposed individuals who remained negative for infection. Ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography were present in all patients with reported dyspnoea. CONCLUSION This study highlights a high risk of intrahousehold transmission from an index case, suggesting the need for (I) specific guidelines during periods of social distancing, (II) minimization of external exposures and, above all, (III) adoption of strict quarantine measures for suspected cases and family members to prevent outbreaks from spreading.","output":"Clinical laboratory and dispersion pattern of COVID-19 in a family cluster in the social-distancing period."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Studies have identified health literacy (HL) as an important determinant of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management. There are, however, limited data on patients' and health care professionals (HCPs') insights about the link between HL and management of asthma and COPD. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to elicit patients' and HCPs' perspectives with respect to factors affecting HL in the context of asthma and COPD management. METHODS: A total of 16 semi-structured focus groups (10 in English and 6 in French) with patients with asthma or COPD (n = 93) and 45 interviews with HCPs, researchers, and policymakers were conducted between June 2015 and April 2017. Participants were asked to share their perspectives with respect to five predefined HL domainsaccessing, understanding, evaluating, communicating, and using health-related informationin relation to disease self-management practices. Data were analyzed qualitatively, using a content analysis approach. KEY RESULTS: Most patients and HCPs reflected on factors hampering HL in relation to asthma and COPD management. Thoughts such as not having enough time during medical consultations, not receiving consistent messages from different health care professionals, and language or cultural differences were frequently mentioned by both patients and HCPs. CONCLUSIONS: We identified multiple factors affecting communication between patients and HCPs as it relates to the self-management of their disease. These included inconsistent messages from different providers, limited consultation time, use of technical language, failure to account for cultural differences, and reduced health literacy, especially as it related to written communication. Future interventions that aim to enhance HL skills in the context of asthma and COPD self-management should consider these issues.

Here, we compare neutralization of Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1 and BA.2. BA.2 RBD has slightly higher ACE2 affinity than BA.1 and slightly reduced neutralization by vaccine serum, possibly associated with its increased transmissibility. Neutralization differences between sub-lineages for mAbs (including therapeutics) mostly arise from variation in residues bordering the ACE2 binding site, however, more distant mutations S371F (BA.2) and R346K (BA.1.1) markedly reduce neutralization by therapeutic antibody Vir-S309. In-depth structure-and-function analyses of 27 potent RBD-binding mAbs isolated from vaccinated volunteers following breakthrough Omicron-BA.1 infection reveals that they are focussed in two main clusters within the RBD, with potent right-shoulder antibodies showing increased prevalence. Selection and somatic maturation have optimized antibody potency in less-mutated epitopes and recovered potency in highly mutated epitopes.

This paper tries to answer the important question of whether an established teaching strategy through a multi-course project-based learning (MPL) approach, along with online assessment techniques, helps in the effective achievement of SOs in a senior-level electrical engineering (EE) course. The authors have developed a course project for attaining the objectives of a senior and a capstone course, where students are registered at the same time. In addition, the course conducts assessments online. The paper reports the effect of the two approaches on the attainment of the SOs of the two courses, along with testing the programming and problem-solving abilities of the students. It is known that the MPL approach enhances the critical thinking capacity of students, which is also a major outcome of Sustainable Development Education (ESD). It was ensured that the project that was used to test the fulfillment of a series of SOs were concentrated on soft engineering and project management skills. The difficulty of adopting the MPL method for the senior-level courses is in the scheduling of the course materials to help the student advance to the final project while also aligning the project towards fulfilling the learning outcomes of the individual course. The study also provides the students with feedback on online assessment techniques incorporated within the MPL. Besides this, the effect of the innovative teaching approaches was compared with the same senior course taught using conventional methods in an earlier semester. Based on the feedback from teachers and students from a previously conducted case study, it was concluded that the MPL approach had supported the student learning. The results of the statistical analysis (Chi-square, two-tailed T statistics and hypothesis testing using a z-test) show that an MPL approach and online assessment improved the attainment of the SOs despite the constraints posed by the pandemic.","output":"Case Study of Multi-Course Project-Based Learning and Online Assessment in Electrical Engineering Courses during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artikel ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui kendala- kendala apa saja yang dialami oleh orang tua selama mendampingi anak belajar dirumah pada masa pandemi COVID-19.

There exists some literature demonstrating that the nociceptive stimuli experienced during surgery are responsible for peripheral and central sensitization phenomena, which can in turn lead to persistent postsurgical pain. An individualized approach to the evaluation and treatment of perioperative nociception is beneficial in order to avoid the sensitization phenomena that leads to prolonged postoperative pain and to minimize the consumption of opiates and their adverse effects. In terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values when compared to heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), recent literature has shown that the NOL variation (NOL) is the best index to distinguish noxious from non-noxious stimuli. Chronic treatment with 1-adrenergic antagonists may constitute a limitation to the use of the NOL index. 1-adrenergic antagonists induce a depressive action on the heart rate, which results in a limitation of its variability after a noxious stimulus. Since heart rate and heart rate variability are two parameters integrated into the NOL index, the validity of the NOL index in a population of patients receiving 1-adrenergic antagonists has not yet been determined. Our study sought to explore the NOL index, the BIS, and the heart rate variation in a group of patients under chronic treatment with 1-adrenergic antagonists submitted to standardized noxious stimulus under general anesthesia. We then compared those results to a control group of patients from our previous study (CJA group) that received no 1-adrenergic antagonist chronic treatment. The patients in this study were subjected to a standardized anesthetic protocol from induction up to 3 min after a standardized tetanic stimulus to the ulnar nerve at a frequency of 100 Hz and an amperage of 70 mA, for a duration of 30 s. Data were electronically recorded to obtain NOL, BIS, and heart rate values every 5 s for the duration of the protocol. The NOL maximal mean value reached after noxious stimulation was not different between our two cohorts (CJA: 30(14) versus BETANOL: 36(14) (p = 0.12)). There was no statistically significant difference between our cohorts in regards of the NOL AUC representing the variation of the NOL over a 180 s period (CJA: 595(356) versus BETANOL: 634(301) (p = 0.30)). However, a repeated measurement ANCOVA identified slight statistically significant differences between our cohorts in the peak of variation of the NOL index between 20 and 65 s after noxious stimulation, the NOL index of the cohort of beta-blocked patients being higher than the CJA patients. Moreover, the time to reach the maximum value was not different (CJA: 73(37) versus BETANOL: 63(41) (p = 0.35)). NOL sensitivity and specificity to detect a noxious stimulus under general anesthesia were similar in patients taking beta-blockers or not, and were better than those of heart rate and Bispectral index (AUC NOL 0.97, CI(0.92-1), versus AUC BIS 0.78, CI(0.64-0.89) and AUC HR 0.66, CI(0.5-0.8)). In conclusion, the NOL index is a reliable monitor to assess nociception in a population of patients under chronic beta-blocker therapy. Patients under such therapy achieve similar maximal NOL values over a 180 s period after a standardized noxious stimulus and the NOL variation over time, represented by the AUC is not significantly different from a cohort of non-beta-blocked patients. Whether the patient takes beta-blockers or not, sensitivity of the NOL index is greater than that seen for BIS index or heart rate to detect an experimental noxious stimulus under general anesthesia.","output":"Impact of chronic treatment by 1-adrenergic antagonists on Nociceptive-Level (NOL) index variation after a standardized noxious stimulus under general anesthesia: a cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transport of oxygen between blood and tissue is limited by blood's capillary transit time, understood as the time available for diffusion exchange before blood returns to the heart. If all capillaries contribute equally to tissue oxygenation at all times, this physical limitation would render vasodilation and increased blood flow insufficient means to meet increased metabolic demands in the heart, muscle, and other organs. In 1920, Danish physiologist August Krogh was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his mathematical and quantitative, experimental demonstration of a solution to this conceptual problem: capillary recruitment, the active opening of previously closed capillaries to meet metabolic demands. Today, capillary recruitment is still mentioned in textbooks. When we suspect symptoms might represent hypoxia of a vascular origin, however, we search for relevant, flow-limiting conditions in our patients and rarely ascribe hypoxia or hypoxemia to short capillary transit times. This review describes how natural changes in capillary transit-time heterogeneity (CTH) and capillary hematocrit (HCT) across open capillaries during blood flow increases can account for a match of oxygen availability to metabolic demands in normal tissue. CTH and HCT depend on a number of factors: on blood properties, including plasma viscosity, the number, size, and deformability of blood cells, and blood cell interactions with capillary endothelium; on anatomical factors including glycocalyx, endothelial cells, basement membrane, and pericytes that affect the capillary diameter; and on any external compression. The review describes how risk factor- and disease-related changes in CTH and HCT interfere with flow-metabolism coupling and tissue oxygenation and discusses whether such capillary dysfunction contributes to vascular disease pathology.","output":"Blood flow, capillary transit times, and tissue oxygenation: the centennial of capillary recruitment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Jumlah kasus COVID-19 di Indonesia meningkat secara signifikan.

Fitness trackers have become increasingly popular in the past decade. One in five Americans use a device or an app to track their fitness-related activities. These devices generate massive and important data that could help physicians make better assessments of their patients health if shared with health providers. This ultimately could lead to better health outcomes and perhaps even lower costs for patients. However, sharing personal fitness information with health care providers has drawbacks, mainly related to the risk of privacy loss and information misuse. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the influence of granting users granular privacy control on their willingness to share fitness information. METHODS: The study used 270 valid responses collected from Mtrurkers through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The conceptual model was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). The dependent variable was the intention to share fitness information. The independent variables were perceived risk, perceived benefits, and trust in the system. RESULTS: SEM explained about 60% of the variance in the dependent variable. Three of the four hypotheses were supported. Perceived risk and trust in the system had a significant relationship with the dependent variable, while trust in the system was not significant.

DESIGN: This is a phenomenological qualitative study. SETTING: The study was carried out in a leading teaching hospital in Southwest China. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited 15 informal caregivers for healthy pregnant women on routine antenatal visits about six months after China launched the city-wide lockdown and other control measures for COVID-19, including 10 males and 5 females with diverse demographic backgrounds. MEASURES AND FINDINGS: The research team developed a demographic form and an interview outline with key questions, conducted semi-structured interviews with the informal caregivers, and analyzed the data using the Colazzie's method. Five themes of lived experiences were revealed, i.e., increased caregiving burdens, disruption of routines in family life, lack of accurate information and knowledge, active role adjustment, and positive attitudes and coping in a difficult time. Some caregivers reacted positively to the lockdown experience and saw it as an opportunity to rethink their lives and improve family relations. KEY CONCLUSIONS: The informal caregivers experienced increased physical and psychological burdens. Strategies such as adoption of a less frequent prenatal visit schedule, use of tele-medicine technologies, and provision of accurate information and knowledge may help to ease the increased informal caregiving burdens. Psychological counseling, community services and disaster response policies specially targeting pregnant women and their informal caregivers may also be valuable resources. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Attention should be drawn to the group of informal caregivers for pregnant women during a COVID-19 lockdown, including professional assistance delivered by nursing and other related professionals. Measures are called for to minimize exposure opportunities such as adoption of a new prenatal care schedule and tele-medicine technologies.

RESULTS: Among 81,579 participants involved [50.37%, men; mean age, 59.38 years (standard deviation, 7.23 years)], 15,990 CMM events and 6456 all-cause deaths were reported (median follow-up, 12.23 years). In multivariable-adjusted models, baseline use of fish oil was associated with 8% lower risk of CMM [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.89C0.96, P < 0.001] and 10% lower risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI 0.85C0.95, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In individuals with hypertension, baseline use of fish oil was associated with a reduced risk of CMM and all-cause mortality, and further clinical trials are needed to prove this hypothesis.

A major problem following hernia repair is recurrence, and the technique used for hernia repair influences the rate of hernia recurrence. Data from individual studies show that the area of mesh overlap used during hernia repair correlates with hernia recurrence, but no meta-analyses have previously been published. The aim of this review was to perform a meta-analysis to determine if the area of mesh overlap correlates with the rate of hernia recurrence after ventral and incisional hernia repair. METHODS Studies from 1990 to 2013 that used a mesh in open or laparoscopic procedures, and that reported both the area of mesh overlap beyond the fascial defect and the recurrence rate, were assessed for inclusion in the final analysis. A pooled estimation of combined overall risk was calculated according to a random effect model. RESULTS A total of 95 articles, with 111 study populations, met all criteria and were included in the final analysis. For open procedures, results showed no correlation between the pooled estimation of risk for recurrence of ventral hernia and area of mesh overlap used for hernia repair (<3 cm, incidence rate 0.065; 3-5 cm, incidence rate 0.070; >5 cm, incidence rate 0.060). In laparoscopic procedures, the pooled estimation of risk for recurrence of hernia decreased with increasing area of mesh overlap (<3 cm, incidence rate 0.086; 3-5 cm, incidence rate 0.046; >5 cm, incidence rate 0.014). CONCLUSION Risk of hernia recurrence decreases with increasing area of mesh overlap in laparoscopic, but not open, procedures for ventral hernia repair.","output":"Proper mesh overlap is a key determinant in hernia recurrence following laparoscopic ventral and incisional hernia repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A group of SPF cats were moderately susceptible to the causal organism of contagious equine metritis (CEM) following intra-uterine or intrapreputial challenge with an Irish streptomycin resistant strain isolated from a clinically infected mare.

We investigated changes in UK workers mental health by industry, social class, and occupation and differential effects by UK country of residence, gender and age. Methods We used representative Understanding Society data from 6,474 adults (41,207 observations) in paid employment who participated in pre-pandemic (2017-2020) and at least one COVID-19 survey. The outcome was psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire-12; score[]4). Exposures were industry, social class and occupation and are examined separately. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to estimate relative (OR) and absolute (%) increases in distress before and during pandemic. Differential effects were investigated for UK countries of residence (Non-England/England), gender (Male/female), and age (Younger/Older) using 3-way interaction effects. Results Psychological distress increased in relative terms most for professional, scientific and technical (OR:3.15, 95% CI 2.17-4.59) industry in the pandemic versus pre-pandemic period. Absolute risk increased most in hospitality (+11.4%). For social class, small employers/self-employed were most affected in relative and absolute terms (OR:3.24, 95% CI 2.28- 4.63; +10.3%). Across occupations Sales and customer service (OR:3.01, 95% CI 1.61- 5.62; +10.7%) had the greatest increase. Analysis with 3-way interactions showed considerable gender differences, while for UK country of residence and age results are mixed. Conclusions Psychological distress increases during the COVID-19 pandemic were concentrated among professional and technical and hospitality industries, small employers/self-employed and sales and customers service workers. Female workers often exhibited greater differences in risk by industry and occupation.

With the global epidemic dynamics becoming more and more serious, the prediction and analysis of the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 has become an important task. We develop an artificial neural network (ANN) for modeling of the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19. The confirmed cases and deaths data are collected from January 20 to November 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). By introducing root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R), and mean absolute error (MAE), statistical indicators of the prediction model are verified and evaluated. The size of training and test confirmed cases and death base employed in the model is optimized. The best simulating performance with RMSE, R, and MAE is realized using the 7 past days' cases as input variables in the training and test dataset. And the estimated R are 0.9948 and 0.9683, respectively. Compared with different algorithms, experimental simulation shows that trainbr algorithm has better performance than other algorithms in reproducing the amount of the confirmed cases and deaths. This study shows that the ANN model is suitable for predicting the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 in the future. Using the ANN model, we also predict the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 from June 5, 2020 to November 11, 2020. During the predicting period, the R, RMSE, and MAE for new infected confirmed cases of COVID-19 are 0.9848, 17,554, and 12,229, respectively; the R, RMSE, and MAE for new confirmed deaths of COVID-19 are 0.8593, 631.8, and 463.7, respectively.

Our main method used instrumental variables to account for potential endogeneity. Findings show that 63% of Malawians thought that they are likely to catch COVID-19. Notwithstanding the COVID19 risk, 86% were willing to vote. The regression analysis suggests that an individuals perceived risk of catching COVID-19 is associated with lower likelihood of voting (  =-0.096;p <0.05). The results suggest that voter turnout in Malawis fresh presidential election may have been highly affected by the perceived risk of catching COVID-19.

However, most studies investigating the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy or effectiveness of influenza vaccines are conducted in healthy adults. In this evidence-based clinical review, we provide an update on the safety profile, immunogenicity, and efficacy/effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) in healthy pregnant women and children <5 years old. Six electronic databases were searched until May 27, 2021. We identified 3,731 articles, of which 93 met the eligibility criteria and were included. The IIVs were generally well tolerated in pregnant women and young children, with low frequencies of adverse events following IIV administration; however, continuous vaccine safety monitoring systems are necessary to detect rare adverse events. IIVs generated good antibody responses, and the seroprotection rates after IIVs were moderate to high in pregnant women (range = 65%C96%) and young children (range = 50%C100%), varying between the different influenza types/subtypes and seasons. Studies show vaccine efficacy/effectiveness values of 50%C70% in pregnant women and 20%C90% in young children against lab-confirmed influenza, although the efficacy/effectiveness depended on the study design, host factors, vaccine type, manufacturing practices, and the antigenic match/mismatch between the influenza vaccine strains and the circulating strains.

Setting: Staff commuter patterns between the main campuses of UNISA and the policy environment that has an impact on such travel. Methods: The aim is achieved by means of a case study methodology that considers the relevant policies of the university and applicable results of a 2018 UNISA staff travel demand survey to determine whether the policies are incongruous with the institutions attempts to reduce its carbon footprint in general, and its Scope 3 carbon emissions in particular. The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on defining a new normal for the universitys operations, and the impact thereof on staff commuting, have been discussed. Results: The study revealed that despite being an Open Distance E-Learning (ODeL) institution, the university has not put a coherent policy framework in place that undeniably supports its efforts to limit or reduce its Scope 3 carbon emissions. This was brought into stark focus by the measures the university was forced to put in place as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown regulations in South Africa, to ensure the continuation of its business.

Emerging adulthood is a developmental phase with significant changes in the patterns of daily living; it is a risky phase for the onset of major mental illness. College students during the pandemic face significant risk, potentially losing several protective factors (eg, housing, routine, social support, job, and financial security) that are stabilizing for mental health and physical well-being. Individualized multiple assessments of mental health, referred to as multimodal personal chronicles, present an opportunity to examine indicators of health in an ongoing and personalized way using mobile sensing devices and wearable internet of things. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and provide an in-depth examination of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college students through multimodal personal chronicles, we present a case study of an individual monitored using a longitudinal subjective and objective assessment approach over a 9-month period throughout 2020, spanning the prepandemic period of January through September. METHODS: The individual, referred to as Lee, completed psychological assessments measuring depression, anxiety, and loneliness across 4 time points in January, April, June, and September. We used the data emerging from the multimodal personal chronicles (ie, heart rate, sleep, physical activity, affect, behaviors) in relation to psychological assessments to understand patterns that help to explicate changes in the individual's psychological well-being across the pandemic. RESULTS: Over the course of the pandemic, Lee's depression severity was highest in April, shortly after shelter-in-place orders were mandated. His depression severity remained mildly severe throughout the rest of the months. Associations in positive and negative affect, physiology, sleep, and physical activity patterns varied across time periods. Lee's positive affect and negative affect were positively correlated in April (r=0.53, P=.04) whereas they were negatively correlated in September (r=-0.57, P=.03). Only in the month of January was sleep negatively associated with negative affect (r=-0.58, P=.03) and diurnal beats per minute (r=-0.54, P=.04), and then positively associated with heart rate variability (resting root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats) (r=0.54, P=.04). When looking at his available contextual data, Lee noted certain situations as supportive coping factors and other situations as potential stressors. CONCLUSIONS: We observed more pandemic concerns in April and noticed other contextual events relating to this individual's well-being, reflecting how college students continue to experience life events during the pandemic. The rich monitoring data alongside contextual data may be beneficial for clinicians to understand client experiences and offer personalized treatment plans. We discuss benefits as well as future directions of this system, and the conclusions we can draw regarding the links between the COVID-19 pandemic and college student mental health.","output":"Using Multimodal Assessments to Capture Personalized Contexts of College Student Well-being in 2020: Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to concerns regarding the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), major sporting events and activities have been temporarily suspended or postponed, and a new radical sports protocol has emerged.

Because cloud-data and grid infrastructure are both growing exponentially, there is an urgent need to explore computational sources and cloud large-data protection. Numerous cloud service categories are assimilated into numerous fields, such as defense systems and pharmaceutical databases, to compute information space and allocation of resources. Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) is a sophisticated approach which can permit employees to specify a higher level of security for data stored in cloud storage facilities. Numerous obsolete ABE techniques are practical when applied to small data sets to generate cryptograms with restricted computational properties; their properties are used to generate the key, encrypt it, and decrypt it. To address the current concerns, a dynamic non-linear polynomial chaotic quantum hash technique on top of secure block chain model can be used for enhancing cloud data security while maintaining user privacy. In the proposed method, customer attributes are guaranteed by using a dynamic non- polynomial chaotic map function for the key initialization, encryption, and decryption. In the proposed model, both organized and unorganized massive clinical data are considered to be inputs for reliable corroboration and encoding.

RESULTS: Weight gain was perceived in 38% of the participants and 22.8% perceived weight loss. 39.2% did not perceive changes in their weight. Risk factors for body weight gain were increased alcohol consumption (OR=4.510, 95% CI 1.764 to 11.531) and decreased fruit consumption (OR=2.129, 95% CI 1.290 to 3.515), while decreasing cereal intake (OR=0.498, 95% CI 0.269 to 0.922) and choosing nutritious food as a driver for purchase (OR=0.512, 95% CI 0.320 to 0.821) were found to be protective against gaining weight. Decreasing food intake during the pandemic (OR=2.188, 95% CI 1.348 to 3.550) and having to miss important foods (OR=2.354, 95% CI 1.393 to 3.978), were associated with weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: During confinement, weight gain was mostly associated with food consumption and personal food system factors. Meanwhile, weight loss was associated with external food system factors.","output":"COVID-19, body weight and the neighbourhood: food system dimensions and consumption associated with changes in body weight of Peruvian adults during first wave lockdowns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Racial/ethnic minorities have disproportionately increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and experiencing severe illness;they also have worse breast cancer (BC) outcomes. COVID-19 outcomes among racial/ethnic minorities with BC are currently unknown. We sought to compare clinicopathologic characteristics and COVID-19 outcomes stratified by race/ethnicity. Methods: The COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium registry (NCT04354701) was used to identify patients with invasive BC and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed in the U.S. between 2020-03-06 and 2021-02-04. The primary analysis was restricted to women who selfidentified as non-Hispanic White (NHW), nonHispanic Black (NHB), or Hispanic (H). Demographic, cancer characteristics, and COVID-19 outcomes were evaluated. COVID-19 outcomes included: hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, death within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and death from any cause during follow-up. Descriptive statistics were used to compare clinicopathologic characteristics and Fisher exact tests were used to compare COVID19 outcomes across the 3 racial/ethnic groups. Results: A total of 1133 patients were identified of which 1111 (98%) were women;of which 575 (52%) NHW, 243 (22%) NHB, 183 (16%) H, and 110 (10%) other/unknown. Baseline characteristics differed among racial/ethnic groups. H were younger (median age: NHW 63y;NHB 62y;H 54y) and more likely to be never smokers (NHW 62%;NHB 62%;H 78%). NHB had higher rates of obesity (NHW 40%;NHB 54%;H 46%), diabetes (NHW 16 %;NHB 32%;H 20%) and combined moderate and severe baseline COVID-19 at presentation (NHW 28%;NHB 42%;H 28%). Cancer characteristics are as shown (Table). Significant differences were observed in outcomes across racial/ethnic groups including higher rates of hospital admission (NHW 34%;NHB 49%;H 34%;P <0.001), mechanical ventilation (NHW 3%;NHB 9%;H 5%;P=0.002), 30-day mortality (NHW 6%;NHB 9%;H 4%;P=0.043) and total mortality (NHW 8%;NHB 12%;H 5%;P=0.05) among NHB compared to NHW and H. Conclusions: This is the largest study to show significant differences in COVID-19 outcomes by racial/ethnic groups of women with BC. The adverse outcomes in NHB could be due to higher moderate to severe COVID-19 at presentation and preexisting comorbidities. H did not have worse outcomes despite having more active disease and recent anti-cancer therapy, including with cytotoxic chemotherapy - potentially due to younger age and nonsmoking status.

Testing an entire population, however, requires significant resources. Group testing can enable large-scale screening, but dilution degrades its sensitivity, reducing its effectiveness as an infection control measure. Analysis of this tradeoff typically assumes pooled samples are independent. Building on recent empirical results in the literature, we argue that this assumption significantly underestimates group testing's true benefits. Indeed, placing samples from a social group into the same pool correlates a pool's samples. Hence, a positive pool likely contains multiple positive samples, increasing a pooled test's sensitivity and also tending to reduce the number of pools requiring follow-up testing. We prove that under a general correlation structure, pooling correlated samples together (called correlated pooling) achieves higher sensitivity and requires fewer tests per positive identified compared to independently pooling the samples (called naive pooling) using the same pool size within the classic two-stage Dorfman procedure. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to theoretically characterize correlation's effect on sensitivity and test usage under models of general correlation structure and realistic test errors. Under a 1% starting prevalence, simulation results estimate that correlated pooling requires 12.9% fewer tests than naive pooling to achieve infection control. Thus, we argue that correlation is an important consideration for policy-makers designing infection control interventions: it makes screening more attractive for infection control and it suggests that sample collection should maximize correlation.","output":"Correlation Improves Group Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a novel viral illness that has rapidly spread worldwide. While the disease primarily presents as a respiratory illness, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea have been reported in up to one-third of confirmed cases, and patients may have mild symptoms that do not prompt them to seek medical attention. Internet-based infodemiology offers an approach to studying symptoms at a population level, even in individuals who do not seek medical care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine if a correlation exists between internet searches for gastrointestinal symptoms and the confirmed case count of COVID-19 in the United States. METHODS: The search terms chosen for analysis in this study included common gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Furthermore, the search terms fever and cough were used as positive controls, and constipation was used as a negative control. Daily query shares for the selected symptoms were obtained from Google Trends between October 1, 2019 and June 15, 2020 for all US states. These shares were divided into two time periods: pre-COVID-19 (prior to March 1) and post-COVID-19 (March 1-June 15). Confirmed COVID-19 case numbers were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering data repository. Moving averages of the daily query shares (normalized to baseline pre-COVID-19) were then analyzed against the confirmed disease case count and daily new cases to establish a temporal relationship. RESULTS: The relative search query shares of many symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and constipation, remained near or below baseline throughout the time period studied; however, there were notable increases in searches for the positive control symptoms of fever and cough as well as for diarrhea. These increases in daily search queries for fever, cough, and diarrhea preceded the rapid rise in number of cases by approximately 10 to 14 days. The search volumes for these terms began declining after mid-March despite the continued rises in cumulative cases and daily new case counts. CONCLUSIONS: Google searches for symptoms may precede the actual rises in cases and hospitalizations during pandemics. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, this study demonstrates that internet search queries for fever, cough, and diarrhea increased prior to the increased confirmed case count by available testing during the early weeks of the pandemic in the United States. While the search volumes eventually decreased significantly as the number of cases continued to rise, internet query search data may still be a useful tool at a population level to identify areas of active disease transmission at the cusp of new outbreaks.","output":"Association of Search Query Interest in Gastrointestinal Symptoms With COVID-19 Diagnosis in the United States: Infodemiology Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background Since its first description, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), formerly known as 2019-nCoV, has attracted tremendous attention in a short period of time as the death toll and number of confirmed cases grows unceasingly.

OBJECTIVE: To gain insight by a mixed method study on what has happened during the lockdown within families who were already known to social services. METHODS: A quantitative study was performed among 159 families recruited before the coronavirus crisis, and 87 families recruited during the lockdown in the Netherlands through child protection services. Family members (parents, children) completed questionnaires about interparental violence, (historical) child abuse and neglect, and emotional security. In a qualitative study 39 of these respondents and 13 professionals were interviewed. RESULTS: No difference was found in violence between families who participated before and after the lockdown. The level of violence is still high in most families. The absence of assistance promoted the self-reliance of children and parents to deal with this difficult period. Professionals found new ways of connecting to families at risk. Every form of support is important to these families because it made children feel seen and heard.

We aimed to analyze how these effects can bias key epidemiological metrics used to track and monitor SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Methods: An age-structured mathematical model was constructed to simulate progression of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in populations. PCR testing to diagnose infection and cross-sectional surveys to measure seroprevalence were also simulated. Analyses were conducted on simulated outcomes assuming a natural epidemic time course and an epidemic in presence of interventions. Results: The prolonged PCR positivity biased the epidemiological measures. There was a lag of 10 days between the true epidemic peak and the actually-observed peak. Prior to epidemic peak, PCR positivity rate was 2-fold higher than that based only on current active infection, and half of those tested positive by PCR were in the prolonged PCR positivity stage after infection clearance. Post epidemic peak, PCR positivity rate poorly predicted true trend in active infection. Meanwhile, the prolonged PCR positivity did not appreciably bias estimation of the basic reproduction number R0. The time delay in development of detectable antibodies biased measured seroprevalence. The actually-observed seroprevalence substantially underestimated true prevalence of ever infection, with the underestimation being most pronounced around epidemic peak.

Methods: We assessed the baseline epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB, enrolled in a multicenter prospective cohort in Brazil (RePORT-Brazil) during 2015-2019. Dysglycemia was defined by elevated glycated hemoglobin and stratified as PDM or DM. Additionally, we used data from TB cases obtained through the Brazilian National Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN), during 2015-2019. In SINAN, diagnosis of diabetes was based on self-report. Logistic regression models were performed to test independent associations between HIV, dysglycemia status, and other baseline characteristics in both cohorts. Results: In the RePORT-Brazil cohort, the prevalence of DM and of PDM was 23.7 and 37.8%, respectively. Furthermore, the prevalence of HIV was 21.4% in the group of persons with TB-dysglycemia and 20.5% in that of patients with TBDM. In the SINAN cohort, the prevalence of DM was 9.2%, and among the TBDM group the prevalence of HIV was 4.1%. Logistic regressions demonstrated that aging was independently associated with PDM or DM in both the RePORT-Brazil and SINAN cohorts. In RePORT-Brazil, illicit drug use was associated with PDM, whereas a higher body mass index (BMI) was associated with DM occurrence. Of note, HIV was not associated with an increased risk of PDM or DM in patients with pulmonary TB in both cohorts. Moreover, in both cohorts, the TBDM-HIV group presented with a lower proportion of positive sputum smear and a higher frequency of tobacco and alcohol users.

METHODS: Prospective study that included all abdominal surgery patients operated since the COVID-19 outbreak. On discharge, patients were given the option to perform their postoperative follow-up appointment by telemedicine or by in-person clinics. Demographic, perioperative, and follow-up variables were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 219 patients who underwent abdominal surgery, 106 (48%) had their postoperative follow-up using telemedicine.

pandemic health problem worldwide. In this study, we attempted to explain the clinical and laboratories characteristics of non-surviving patients, to identify the probable factors affecting disease progression. METHODS In a retrospective study, we assessed the data from dead adult patients who were hospitalized and laboratory diagnosed with COVID-19 during March 2020. The data were obtained from electronic medical records. Moreover, a checklist including demographic, clinical, laboratorial, imaging, and treatment data was completed for each one of the patients. In case of lack of information, a member of the research team contacted the first-degree relatives via phone. RESULTS Totally, 50 patients were enrolled in this study. The mean age was 68.0  14.1 years. Of them, 29 (58%) patients were male. Notably, the median (IQR) hospitalization time was 4.0 (2.7-6.2) days and the duration between the first symptoms to death was 10.0 (5.0-14.5) days. Also, pre-existing morbidity was reported in 42 (84%) patients, and hypertension was the most common one with 28 (54%) patients. Interestingly, body temperature more than 37.5C was reported in only 20 (40%) patients. Nevertheless, neutrophilia (7109/L) and lymphopenia (<1.0 109/L) were observed in 27 (54%) and 29 (58%) patients, respectively. Also, elevated levels of creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were common, which may be indicators of aggravation of the patients' status. CONCLUSION Besides age and underlying diseases, elevated creatinine level, neutrophil count, and the inflammatory indices along with the reduced lymphocyte count can be considered as indicators of disease progression. Hence, they should be considered for admission and surveillance of patients.","output":"Clinical Manifestation of Patients Who Died Due to COVID-19; A Retrospective Study from Qom-Iran."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mode of binding of oligosaccharides to griffithsin, an antiviral lectin from the red alga Griffithsia sp., was investigated by a combination of X\\\\ray crystallography, isothermal titration calorimetry, and molecular modeling.

The aim of this study is to determine the current knowledge, attitude and behaviour of hand and food hygiene, and the potential risk factors of diarrhoea in a residential community of Singapore. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted within a residential area in the west of Singapore from June to August 2013. A total of 1,156 household units were randomly sampled and invited to participate in an interviewer-assisted survey using standardised questionnaires. Descriptive, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using descriptive statistics, Fishers Exact test and multivariate logistic regression modelling, respectively. R program was used for all statistical analysis. All tests were conducted at 5 % level of significance with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) reported where applicable. RESULTS: A total of 240 units (20.8 %) consented and responded to the survey invitation. About 77 % of the expected knowledge and attitude were observed in at least 80 % of the participants, compared to only about 31 % of the expected behaviours and practises. Being single [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.29; 95 % CI = 1.16-4.48], having flu in the past six month (AOR = 3.24; 95 % CI = 1.74-6.06), preferred self-medication (AOR = 2.07; 95 % CI = 1.06C4.12) were risk factors of diarrhoea. Washing hands with water before attending to children or sick persons (AOR = 0.30; 95 % CI = 0.11C0.82), washing hands with water (AOR = 0.16; 95 % CI = 0.05C0.45) and water with soap (AOR = 0.29; 95 % CI = 0.12C0.72) after attending to children or sick persons, and hand washing between 30 s to a minute (AOR = 0.44; 95 % CI = 0.20-0.90) were protective factors against diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS: Good knowledge and attitude of the participants did not positively translate into high compliance and motivation to perform good hygiene practices. This observation may have resulted in a significant extent on the increasing diarrhoea incidences. Current interventions may be improved with more active community partnership among the residents, schools and the relevant social organizations, to raise awareness on the importance of compliance to good hygiene practices, and the risk factors of diarrhoea.

The UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish community has been severely affected by the pandemic. This group shares characteristics with other ethnic minorities including larger family sizes, higher rates of household crowding and relative socioeconomic deprivation. We studied a UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish population to understand transmission of COVID-19 within this community. Methods We performed a household-focused cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey between late-October and early December 2020 prior to the third national lockdown. Randomly-selected households completed a standardised questionnaire and underwent serological testing with a multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We report clinical illness and testing before the serosurvey, seroprevalence stratified by age and sex. We used random-effects models to identify factors associated with infection and antibody titres. Findings A total of 343 households, consisting of 1,759 individuals, were recruited. Serum was available for 1,242 participants. The overall seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 64.3% (95% CI 61.6-67.0%). The lowest seroprevalence was 27.6% in children under 5 years and rose to 73.8% in secondary school children and 74% in adults. Antibody titres were higher in symptomatic individuals and declined over time since reported COVID-19 symptoms, with the decline more marked for nucleocapsid titres. Interpretation In this tight-knit religious minority population in the UK, we report one of the highest SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence levels in the world to date, which was markedly higher than the reported 10% seroprevalence in London at the time of the study. In the context of this high force of infection, all age groups experienced a high burden of infection.

In Spain, no description exists, as yet, as to the degree of burden rhinovirus infections represent among hospitalized infants. Our aim was to describe rhinovirus infections in hospitalized children, under 2 years of age, and to compare these with patients infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). PATIENTS AND METHODS The prospective study was performed between September 2003 and July 2005, in children <2 years of age, admitted at the Severo Ochoa Hospital (Legans, Madrid) with fever or respiratory tract infection and with positive rhinovirus detection in the nasopharyngeal aspirate samples. Virologic diagnosis was made by multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and for some virus by direct immunofluorescent assay in nasopharyngeal samples. Demographic and clinical data of those patients with rhinovirus infection were described and compared with a group of 86 patients, infected only with RSV, randomly selected from the same population. RESULTS We detected 85 children admitted to hospital with rhinovirus infection. Rhinovirus was the cause of 25% of all admissions, among the total of 340 under 2-year olds diagnosed with fever or respiratory tract infection. Rhinovirus was the second viral agent identified, after RSV. Clinical diagnosis was recurrent wheezing in 48.2%; bronchiolitis in 36.5%; and pneumonia in 3.5%. Fever was present in 60% of the patients. Radiologic infiltrates were found in 22.4% of the children. In 50.6% of the infants, oxygen saturation under 95% was detected, at the time of admission. Hypoxia was present in RSV-infected children more frequently (P = 0.005). Also, in this group, final diagnosis was, most frequently, bronchiolitis (P = 0.0001), and rhinovirus-infected patients were most frequently males (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS Rhinovirus was detected in hospitalized infants with respiratory tract disease and was the second most common virus after RSV.

Among those, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are extremely versatile and, therefore, widely prescribed. Moreover, they are commonly considered as having a better safety profile compared to other antidepressants. For these reasons, when it comes to off-label prescribing, SSRIs rank among the top positions. In this review, we present the state of the art of off-label applications of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, ranging from migraine prophylaxis to SARS-CoV-2 antiviral properties. Research on SSRIs provided significant evidence in the treatment of premature ejaculation, both with the on-label dapoxetine 30 mg and the off-label paroxetine 20 mg. However, other than serotoninergic syndrome, serious conditions like increased bleeding rates, hyponatremia, hepatoxicity, and post-SSRIs sexual dysfunctions, are consistently more prominent when using such compounds. These insidious side effects might be frequently underestimated during common clinical practice, especially by non-psychiatrists. For this reason, some points must be addressed when using SSRIs. Among these, a psychiatric evaluation before every administration that falls outside the regulatory agencies-approved guidelines has to be considered mandatory. For these reasons, we aim with the present article to identify the risks of inappropriate uses and to advocate the need to actively boost research encouraging future clinical trials on this topic.","output":"Off-label uses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The episode of Covid19 (CORONA VIRUS) has become one of the greatest worldwide dangers around the world, which has now tainted over 1 7 million individuals with deaths of over 100,000 lives far & wide Under these extraordinary conditions, there are no entrenched rules for cancer patients The danger for genuine infection & passing in CORONA VIRUS cases increments with propelling age & existing co-morbid medical issue After the rise of primary suspects in China during last month of 2019, enormous exploration endeavors have been in progress to comprehend the instruments of infectivity & contagiousness of coronavirus, a lethal infection liable for wretched endurance results To limit the death rate, it gets judicious to distinguish indications quickly & utilize medicines suitably Despite the fact that no fix has been set up, different clinical preliminaries are in progress to decide the most ideal system Overseeing patients with cancer in these conditions is a fair task, considering their weak immune status & their ill health Through this thorough audit, we talk about the effect of CORONA VIRUS on wellbeing & the immune system of who are infected, assessing the most recent care plan draws near & progressing clinical preliminaries Also, we talk about difficulties confronted while treating cancer patients & propose possible ways to deal with these weak populace during pandemic","output":"COVID-19 in patients suffering from cancer: Review article"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent molecular diagnostic methods have significantly improved the diagnosis of viral pneumonia in intensive care units (ICUs).

The present study investigates if unemployment increases the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization for men and women of working age in Germany. METHODS: The study uses the health insurance data from AOK Rhineland/Hamburg (from 1 January 2020 until 18 June 2020) of 1,288,745 persons aged between 18 and 65. Four employment situations are distinguished: (1) regular employment, (2) low-wage employment with social support, (3) unemployment with receipt of unemployment benefit 1, and (4) long-term unemployment with receipt of unemployment benefit 2. COVID-19 hospitalizations are measured on the basis of the ICD codes U07.1 and U07.2 reported by the hospitals. Multiple logistic regression models are calculated (adjusted for age and sex). RESULTS: During the observation period, 1521 persons had hospitalization with COVID-19 as primary or secondary diagnosis. Overall, this corresponds to a rate of 118 cases per 100,000 insured persons. Rates varied by employment situation. Compared with regularly employed persons, the odds ratio for a hospitalization was 1.94 (CI 95%: 1.74C2.15) for long-term unemployment, 1.29 (0.86C1.94) for unemployed, and 1.33 (0.98C1.82) for low-wage employment.

The efficacy of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 critically depends on the availability of its receptor, ACE2, in the placenta. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that placental ACE2 expression is oxygenation-dependent by studying the expression of ACE2 and associated cell entry regulators in the monochorionic twin anemia-polycythemia (TAPS) placenta, a model of discordant placental oxygenation. METHODS: We performed a retrospective comparative immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Cathepsin B expression in anemic and polycythemic territories of TAPS placentas (N = 14). RESULTS: ACE2 protein levels were significantly higher in the anemic twin territories than in the corresponding polycythemic territories, associated with upregulation of the key ACE2-related cell entry regulators, TMPRSS2 and Cathepsin B, immunolocalized to villous trophoblastic and stromal cells. Cellular colocalization of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, suggestive of functionality of this cell entry axis, was demonstrated by double immunofluorescence studies. DISCUSSION: Placental hypoxia is associated with upregulation of ACE2 expression, concomitant with increased expression of its key cell entry proteases. ACE2-regulated placental functions, both infection- and non-infection related, may be highly oxygenation-dependent.","output":"Increased placental expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, associated with hypoxia in twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Die Corona-Pandemie trifft Deutschland und Europa mitten in einem umfassenden Strukturwandel, dessen Treiber insbesondere die Digitalisierung sowie die Transformation zu einer klimaneutralen Wirtschaft sind Schon vor der Corona-Krise zeichnete sich das Bekenntnis zur Klimaneutralit?t im Jahr 2050 und damit ein gro?er und auch dringlicher Investitionsbedarf ab Die Europ?ische Kommission beziffert diesen auf 2,6 Billionen Euro in diesem Jahrzehnt allein fr den Umbau hin zu einer nachhaltigen Wirtschaft in der EU (Europ?ische Kommission, 2019a, 2020a) Privatwirtschaftliche Investitionen in gro?em Umfang werden n?tig sein, damit die Transformation gelingt ?ffentliche Investitionen spielen eine wichtige Rolle, wenn es darum geht, ein optimales Umfeld fr private Investoren zu schaffen, z B durch den Infrastrukturausbau oder die Forschungsf?rderung Vor diesem Hintergrund war es zielfhrend, einen signifikanten Anteil des Corona-Konjunkturpakets fr Investitionen in die Zukunftsf?higkeit der deutschen Volkswirtschaft vorzusehen und auf europ?ischer Ebene ebenso mit dem Aufbaufonds zu verfahren","output":"Investitionen fr nachhaltiges Wachstum in Deutschland: Status quo und Perspektiven"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is a substantial burden on global mental health as a result of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has become putting pressure on healthcare systems. There is increasing concern about rising suicidality consequential to the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken. Existing research about the impact of earlier epidemics and economic crises as well as current studies about the effects of the pandemic on public mental health and populations at risk indicate rising suicidality, especially in the middle and longer term. AIMS: This study investigated the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicidality by comparing weekly in-patient admissions for individuals who were suicidal or who attempted suicide just before admission, for the first 6 months after the pandemic's onset in Switzerland with corresponding 2019 control data. METHOD: Data was collected at the Psychiatric University Hospital of Zurich. An interrupted time-series design was used to analyse the number of patients who were suicidal. RESULTS: Instead of a suggested higher rate of suicidality, fewer admissions of patients with suicidal thoughts were found during the first 6-months after the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the proportion of involuntary admissions was found to be higher and more patients have been admitted after a first suicide attempt than in the corresponding control period from 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Although admissions relating to suicidality decreased during the pandemic, the rising number of patients admitted with a first suicide attempt may be an early indicator for an upcoming extra burden on public mental health (and care). Being a multifactorial process, suicidality is influenced in several ways; low in-patient admissions of patients who are suicidal could also reflect fear of contagion and related uncertainty about seeking mental healthcare.","output":"Suicidal ideations and suicide attempts prior to admission to a psychiatric hospital in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic: interrupted time-series analysis to estimate the impact of the lockdown and comparison of 2020 with 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, the early Covid-19 lockdown and social distancing induced the abrupt migration of traditionally presential learning activities to online domains.

We measured parents perceptions of their children's digital privacy on school-issued digital devices. METHODS We surveyed 571 parents of K-12th grade children, recruited nationally, regarding their child's use of school-issued devices. Parents reported their awareness of, and ratings of importance for, seven types of privacy policies for school-issued devices. RESULTS About half (45.9%) of children were in K-5th grade and 84.9% attended public school. Most (80.7%) children used a school-issued device and 66.6% took one home during the coronavirus pandemic. Parents most often rated policies for preventing the collection of geolocation (76%) and sharing of data with third parties (75%) as \\"very important.\\" However, 35.4% of parents did not know with certainty if their school had any digital policies. Many (55.7%) parents \\"strongly agreed\\" their child's school protected student digital privacy and most (68.1%) felt schools were the most responsible party to do so, yet those ratings differed by parent awareness of privacy policies (p < .05).

DESIGN A systematic review and meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS DED patients were individuals with dry eye symptoms or primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS). Controls were healthy, non-pSS, or non-DED patients. METHODS A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and grey literature was conducted. Studies were screened using Covidence software. Outcomes included sleep quality, duration, daytime sleepiness, prevalence/incidence/severity of sleep disorders, and sleep disturbances. Meta-analysis was conducted using STATA 13.0. The weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated as the effect size for continuous scale outcomes. Random-effects models were developed based on the presence of heterogeneity. RESULTS Seventeen full-text articles (16 370 subjects) and 2 conference abstracts (571 763 subjects) were included. Compared to controls, DED patients score higher on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (WMD = 1.69, 95% CI: 0.82, 2.56; I2 = 88.8%, p < 0.001) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (WMD = 2.26, 95% CI: 0.96, 3.56; I2 = 82.4%, p < 0.001). Additionally, DED patients spend less time asleep (WMD = -0.59 hours, 95% CI: -0.94, -0.24; I2 = 85.1%, p < 0.001), experience more sleep disturbances, and may have increased prevalence, incidence, severity of sleep disorders. CONCLUSION DED patients may have poorer sleep quality, greater daytime sleepiness, less sleep, more sleep disturbances, increased prevalence, incidence, and severity of sleep disorders compared to non-DED patients. Further research is needed to identify potential causes of these outcomes given the paucity and heterogeneity of included studies. It may be worthwhile to consider sleep in the clinical management of DED.","output":"Sleep outcomes associated with dry eye disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Free and bounded amino acids are one of the valuable biologically active substances (BAS) containing in medicinal plants with other BAS groups. The research aims to determine the profile and content of free and bounded amino acids in coltsfoot leaves infusion by HPLC-UV, as well as suggest alternative ways to use it in medicine. Materials and methods: Coltsfoot leaves (crushed herbal drug) were used as plant material for preparing infusion and analysis. Amino acids profile and content were analyzed by RP-HPLC-UV after pre-column derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (OPA) (derivatization of primary amines) and with fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (FMOC) (secondary amines).

However, the impact of treating acute insomnia symptoms on future depression outcomes remains unknown. Moreover, whether sleep improvements as a result of an insomnia treatment mediate subsequent reduction of depression symptoms similarly remains unknown. METHODS: At this writing, 44 individuals experiencing insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index; ISI  10) that began during the COVID-19 pandemic have been randomized to receive a brief, telehealth Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI) waitlist control. Treatment was delivered in 4 sessions over a 5-week period. CBTI is the gold-standard behavioral intervention for chronic insomnia and has been applied successfully via telemedicine. Outcome measures were depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9) minus the sleep item and insomnia symptom severity as measured by the ISI. Both outcome measures were collected at baseline (week 0), throughout treatment phase (weeks 2C6), and at the post-treatment (week 7). Linear mixed models determined the impact of treatment on depression and insomnia symptom severity. Mediation was tested using the MacArthur framework. RESULTS: There was a significant Group x Time interaction, with CBTI leading to a greater rate of improvement in ISI (b = -1.14, p < 0.001) and PHQ-9 (b = -0.61, p = 0.002) than the control. Critically, the rate of improvement in insomnia symptoms to the last session of treatment, was associated with the subsequent improvement in depressive symptoms post-treatment (b = 2.06, p = 0.017). In contrast, depressive symptom improvement was not associated with insomnia symptom improvement (b = 4.28, p = 0.102). CONCLUSION: This preliminary data suggests that brief CBTI can reduce pandemic onset insomnia and other depressive symptoms. The preliminary mediation results further suggest that sleep may be an important treatment target for reducing situational depressive symptoms and supports the need to examine the physiological mechanisms of sleep using high-density EEG in a larger sample.

Given the modifiable nature and high risk of electronic cigarettes, with potential to deliver toxic concentrations of nicotine, we investigated if electronic cigarettes are also a danger in relation to COVID-19. We investigated the cytotoxicity of electronic cigarette exposure and whether flavored vaping has the potential to increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in large and small airway epithelial cells through the upregulation of ACE2. METHODS We exposed bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) and primary human small airway epithelial (SAEC) cells to e-cigarette aerosol condensates produced from propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin (PG/VG) or locally bought [Juicius Maximus, watermelon flavor (WM)] e-liquid ( added nicotine), and cigarette smoke extract (CSE). Aerosols were produced from a Drag2 e-cigarette device (Vapoo) operated at 60W, with a 0.4 U2 dual coil (Vapoo), and condensates were collected in flasks over dry ice with the aid of a peristaltic pump, then stored at -80C. We investigated if e-cigarette exposure, alike cigarette smoke, increases the expression of ACE2 in lung epithelial cells. Cytotoxicity (CCK-8), membrane integrity by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and ACE2 protein expression (immunofluorescence) were measured for both 4- and 24-hour treatments;ACE2 gene expression was measured using qPCR for 4- hour treatment only. RESULTSFor both BEAS-2B cells and SAECs, nicotine-free condensates and higher concentrations of nicotine-containing condensates were highly cytotoxic (PG/VG, JM  nicotine(60mg);p&lt;0.0001, p&lt;0.001). Higher LDH release was seen in BEAS-2B cells treated for 24 hours with higher concentrations of nicotine-containing condensates (PG/VG, JM + nicotine(18 or 60mg): ?p&lt;0.0001, p&lt;0.01) indicating that the membrane integrity was disturbed. Cells appear to be under significant distress. Small increases in LDH were also seen with 4 hours treatment (?p&lt;0.0001, p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.01?p&lt;0.05). ACE2 protein expression was observably increased in all treatments compared to media controls, particularly for 24 hours exposures. ACE2 gene expression was significantly increased in cells exposed to WM + 60mg/mL nicotine (p&lt;0.1) and cigarette smoke extract (?p&lt;0.0001) compared with media controls. CONCLUSIONS Our study confirms that electronic cigarettes condensates are highly cytotoxic. Data also suggests that vaping can result in an increase in lung ACE2 expression as we have shown for tobacco smoking. The health care community needs to stay alert;vaping and smoking are avoidable risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and should be avoided during and post- the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Electronic Cigarette Aerosol Condensate Increases ACE2 Expression on Human Airway Epithelial Cells: Implications for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors investigate how teaching art and astronomy together has the potential to inspire new art forms, enhance scientific public outreach, and promote art and science education.

The inequities between those who need care and those who receive adequate care are larger for racial and ethnic minority groups and people living in underserved communities. The pandemic is associated with an exacerbation of these inequities, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality for the most vulnerable populations. Aims: This Perspective summarizes longstanding and evolving challenges to the provision of high quality care for people with mental illness, describes the National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) commitment to addressing those challenges. and embeds salient research priorities most germane to the health policy readership of this journal. Methods: Example funding announcements and extant funding priorities are highlighted to demonstrate NIMH's commitment to health services research during the pandemic. The collaborative care model is presented as an evidence-supported service delivery model that could be delivered via telehealth. Recent studies that compare the utilization of routine telehealth services during the pandemic. when compared to in-person services pre-pandemic, are summarized. Results: In FY2020, NIMII invested $171,194,275 in health services research. Over the past two years. NIMH led or participated on dozens of funding announcements that call for mental health services research to help improve the provision of care for people with mental illness. Service delivery models like collaborative care can offer effective intervention via telehealth. The practice community can deliver routine services via telehealth at volumes similar to pre-pandemic in-person levels. However, wide variation in telehealth utilization exists, with inequities associated with racial and ethnic groups and underserved rural locations. A limitation is that clinical outcomes are not routinely available from administrative datasets. Discussion: There continues to be an urgent need for health policy research and collaboration with the health policy community as part of the research enterprise. Implications for Health Care Provision and Use: NIMH encourages and often requires strong research practice partnerships to help ensure findings will be of value to end users and make their way into the practice setting. There is a need to study pandemic related changes in financing, delivery, receipt, and outcomes of mental health care. Implications for Health Policies: Despite robust evidence, clinical practice guideline recommendations, and established financing mechanisms, uptake of service delivery models that can be delivered in part or in full via telehealth (e.g., the collaborative care model) is poor. Implications for Further Research: In the era of COVID-19, the charge to the mental health services research community is urgent: (i) develop strategies to better implement, scale, and sustain existing evidence-supported treatments and services and (ii) develop, test, and evaluate new solutions to improve access, continuity, quality, equity, and value of care.","output":"A Mental Health Services Research Agenda in the Era of COVID-19: Steadfast Commitment to Addressing Evolving Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: The newly emerged coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), is threatening the world. Olfactory or gustatory dysfunction is reported as one of the symptoms worldwide. As reported so far, different clinical features have been reported according to outbreak sites and gender; most of the patients, who complained of anosmia or hyposmia, were Europeans. We had a fast review for novel articles about COVID-19 infection and olfactory function. OBSERVATIONS: Rapid reviews for COVID-19 or other viral infection and olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunctions were done in this review. Up to date, a lot of reports have shown that olfactory dysfunction is related to viral infections but no exact mechanism, clinical course, and definite treatment have been discovered, which is also same in COVID-19. In general, intranasal steroid (INS) and oral steroid for short time help improve the recovery of the olfactory function in case of olfactory dysfunction after virus infection. Considering severe respiratory complications and immunocompromised state of COVID-19, the use of steroid should be limited and cautious because we do not have enough data to support the usage of steroid to treat olfactory dysfunction in the clinical course of COVID-19.

This study aimed to clarify the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19. Methods In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical features, treatments, and maternal and fetal outcomes were assessed. Findings Seven patients, admitted to Tongji Hospital from Jan 1, to Feb 8, 2020, were included in our study. The mean age of the patients was 32 years (range 29C34 years) and the mean gestational age was 39 weeks plus 1 day (range 37 weeks to 41 weeks plus 2 days). Clinical manifestations were fever (six [86%] patients), cough (one [14%] patient), shortness of breath (one [14%] patient), and diarrhoea (one [14%] patient). All the patients had caesarean section within 3 days of clinical presentation with an average gestational age of 39 weeks plus 2 days. The final date of follow-up was Feb 12, 2020. The outcomes of the pregnant women and neonates were good. Three neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and one neonate was infected with SARS-CoV-2 36 h after birth. Interpretation The maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of patients who were infected in late pregnancy appeared very good, and these outcomes were achieved with intensive, active management that might be the best practice in the absence of more robust data.

Overexpression of a constitutively active phosphomimetic mutant of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), chemical inhibition of its dephosphorylation, or overexpression of its upstream double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) significantly enhanced IL-8 mRNA expression in IBV-infected cells. Overexpression of the AP-1 protein cJUN or its upstream kinase also increased the IBV-induced IL-8 mRNA expression, which was synergistically enhanced by overexpression of cFOS.

They were diagnosed with FASS by a combination of history, physical examination and exclusion of other pruritic diseases. They underwent rush immunotherapy (RIT) after determination of offending environmental allergens by either serum IgE or intradermal testing. Cats were premedicated with an antihistamine and hospitalized for the day to undergo the procedure and to ensure adequate observation. Allergen extracts were administered subcutaneously at increasing concentrations every 30 mins until the maintenance dose of 20,000 protein nitrogen units/ml was reached. Both cats successfully completed RIT without any adverse reactions and their clinical signs improved afterwards. RIT appears to be an alternative treatment option for cats with FASS. Larger studies are needed to more accurately assess the safety and long-term efficacy of RIT in the feline patient, as well as the incidence of adverse reactions and optimal premedication protocol.

In silico research and selected experimental data have shown that compounds of natural origin such as phenolic acids and flavonoids have promising antiviral potential. Phenolic compounds inhibit multiplication of viruses at various stages of the viral life cycle, e.g., attachment (disturbance of the interaction between cellular and viral receptors), penetration (inhibition of viral pseudo-particle fusion to the host membrane), replication (inhibition of integrase and 3C-like protease), assembly and maturation (inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) activity hydrolysis) and release (inhibition of secretion of apolipoprotein B (apoB) from infected cells). Phenolic compounds also indirectly influence on the viral life cycle by affecting the host cells biochemical processes that viruses use for their own benefit. Phenolic compounds may inhibit the proteasomes and cellular deubiquitinating activity that causes an increase in the ubiquitinated proteins level in host cells. This, in turn, contributes to the lowering the available ubiquitin molecules that viruses could use for their own replication. One of the drug design strategy for the treatment of viral diseases may be an enhancement of the antiviral properties of phenolic compounds by metal complexation. Many studies have shown that the presence of a metal ion in the structure can significantly affect the affinity of the compound to key structural elements of the SARS CoV-2, such as M(pro) protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and spike protein. We believe that in the era of coronavirus pandemic, it is necessary to reconsider the search for therapeutics among well-known compounds of plant origin and their metal complexes.","output":"Drug Design Strategies for the Treatment of Viral Disease.

We divided 80 subjects into two groups, comparing MMR titers to recent COVID-19 severity levels. The MMR II group consisted of 50 subjects who would primarily have MMR antibodies from the MMR II vaccine, and a comparison group of 30 subjects consisted of those who would primarily have MMR antibodies from sources other than MMR II, including prior measles, mumps, and/or rubella illnesses.

However, the validity of these designs depends on the use of controls that closely resemble the treated unit on before-intervention characteristics and trends on the outcome, and suitable controls may be difficult to find because the number of potential control regions is typically limited. The synthetic control method provides a potential solution to these problems by using a data-driven algorithm to identify an optimal weighted control unita synthetic controlbased on data from before the intervention from available control units.

Despite the urgency with which the app was developed, a clear commitment was made to designing the technology in a way that enshrined key ethical principles, and an ethics advisory board (EAB) was established to provide timely advice, guidance and recommendations on associated ethical issues. Alongside this, there were extensive criticisms of how NHSX adhered to ethical principles in the handling of the app development-criticisms that require empirical exploration. This paper explores how ethics was incorporated into decision-making during governance processes associated with the development of app. Design/methodology/approach: Interviews were conducted with those involved in the app's development/governance, those with a consulting role associated with the app, or those who sat on the EAB. Findings: The EAB fulfilled an important role by introducing ethical considerations to app developers. Though at times, it was difficult to accommodate key ethics principles into governance processes, which sometimes suffered from little accountability.

METHODS: Cancer patient who required treatment, were evaluated for potential COVID-19 infection in a 90-day period, starting from beginning of this epidemic in Iran, January, to April 19, 2020. For treatment of solid tumor patients, if they did not have symptoms related to COVID-19, just chest X-ray was requested. If they showed COVID-19 related symptoms, high resolution CT scan of lungs was requested. For hematology cancer patients, PCR test for COVID-19 infection was requested as well. Protection measures were considered for personnel of oncology wards. RESULTS: 279 Patients were followed up in this 90-day period. No COVID-19 infection was observed in 92 cases of breast cancer, 14 cases of gastric cancer and 12 cases of pancreaticobiliary cancer. However, in 72 cases of colon cancer, 11 cases of lung cancer, 5 cases brain tumors and 12 cases ovarian cancer; 4 cases of COVID-19 were observed.

Two different genogroups of PEDV, S INDEL [PEDV variant containing multiple deletions and insertions in the S1 subunit of the spike (S) protein, G1b] and non-S INDEL (G2b) strains were detected during the diarrheal disease outbreak in US swine in 2013-2014. Similar viruses are also circulating globally. Continuous improvement and update of biosecurity and vaccine strains and protocols are still needed to control and prevent PEDV infections worldwide. Although the non-S INDEL PEDV was highly virulent and the S INDEL PEDV caused milder disease, the latter has the capacity to cause illness in a high number of piglets on farms with low biosecurity and herd immunity. The main PEDV transmission route is fecal-oral, but airborne transmission via the fecal-nasal route may play a role in pig-to-pig and farm-to-farm spread. PEDV infection of neonatal pigs causes fecal virus shedding (alongside frequent detection of PEDV RNA in the nasal cavity), acute viremia, severe atrophic enteritis (mainly jejunum and ileum), and increased pro-inflammatory and innate immune responses.

This method is deduced theoretically from existing formulae and equations. The main advantage of this method is that data measured not only under near neutral conditions, but also under unstable and slightly stable conditions can be used to calculate the scaling parameters. Based on the data measured above an Acacia Saligna agroforestry system, the displacement height (d0) calculated by the TCLI method and by a conventional method are compared. Under strict neutral conditions, the two methods give almost the same results. Under unstable conditions, d0 values calculated by the conventional method are systematically lower than those calculated by the TCLI method, with the latter exhibiting only slightly lower values than those seen under strictly neutral conditions. Computation of the average values of the scaling parameters for the agroforestry system showed that the displacement height and roughness length for momentum are 68% and 9.4% of the average height of the tree canopy, respectively, which are similar to percentages found in the literature. The calculated roughness length for sensible heat is 6.4% of the average height of the tree canopy, a little higher than the percentages documented in the literature. When wind direction was aligned within 5 degrees of the row direction of the trees, the average displacement height calculated was about 0.6 m lower than when the wind blew across the row direction. This difference was statistically significant at the 0.0005 probability level. This implies that when the wind blows parallel to the row direction, the logarithmic profile of wind speed is shifted lower to the ground, so that, at a given height, the wind speeds are faster than when the wind blows perpendicular to the row direction.","output":"A two-concentric-loop iterative method in estimation of displacement height and roughness length for momentum and sensible heat."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer patients are a vulnerable population postulated to be at higher risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.

Few studies have examined the emotional attitudes of citizens as expressed on social media toward the imposed social distancing measures and the factors that affected their emotions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was twofold. First, we aimed to detect the emotional attitudes of different groups of users on Sina Weibo toward the social distancing measures imposed by the People's Government of Hubei Province. Second, the influencing factors of their emotions, as well as the impact of the imposed measures on users' emotions, was studied. METHODS: Sina Weibo, one of China's largest social media platforms, was chosen as the primary data source. The time span of selected data was from January 21, 2020, to March 24, 2020, while analysis was completed in late June 2020. Bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) was used to analyze users' emotions, while logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the influence of explanatory variables on users' emotions, such as age and spatial location. Further, the moderating effects of social distancing measures on the relationship between user characteristics and users' emotions were assessed by observing the interaction effects between the measures and explanatory variables. RESULTS: Based on the 63,169 comments obtained, we identified six topics of discussion-(1) delaying the resumption of work and school, (2) travel restrictions, (3) traffic restrictions, (4) extending the Lunar New Year holiday, (5) closing public spaces, and (6) community containment. There was no multicollinearity in the data during statistical analysis; the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit was 0.24 (&#967;28=10.34, P>.24).

However, water restriction requires rigorous monitoring of animals health and hydration status and can be challenging for some mice. We present an alternative that allows mice more control over their water intake: free home-cage access to water, made slightly sour by a small amount of citric acid (CA). In a previous study, rats with free access to CA water readily performed a behavioral task for water rewards, although completing fewer trials than under water restriction (Reinagel, 2018). We here extend this approach to mice and confirm its robustness across multiple laboratories. Mice reduced their intake of CA water while maintaining healthy weights. Continuous home-cage access to CA water only subtly impacted their willingness to perform a decision-making task, in which they were rewarded with sweetened water. When free CA water was used instead of water restriction only on weekends, learning and decision-making behavior were unaffected.

The aim of this study was to evaluate an established (Onyx) and a novel (precipitating hydrophobic injectable liquid [PHIL]) liquid embolic agent in an in vitro AVM model. MATERIALS AND METHODS An AVM model was integrated into a circuit system. The artificial nidus (subdivided into 28 honeycomb-like sections) was embolized with Onyx 18 (group Onyx; n = 8) or PHIL 25 (group PHIL; n = 8) with different pause times between the injections (30 and 60 seconds, n = 4 per study group) by using a 1.3F microcatheter. Procedure times, number of injections, embolization success (defined as the number of filled sections of the artificial nidus), volume of embolic agent, and frequency and extent of reflux and draining vein embolization were assessed. RESULTS Embolization success was comparable between Onyx and PHIL. Shorter pause times resulted in a significantly higher embolization success for PHIL (median embolization score, 28 versus 18; P = .011). Compared with Onyx, lower volumes of PHIL were required for the same extent of embolization (median volume per section of the artificial nidus, 15.5 versus 3.6 L; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS While the embolization success was comparable for Onyx and PHIL, pause time had a considerable effect on the embolization success in an in vitro AVM model. Compared with Onyx, lower volumes of PHIL were required for the same extent of embolization.","output":"Liquid Embolic Agents for Endovascular Embolization: Evaluation of an Established (Onyx) and a Novel (PHIL) Embolic Agent in an In Vitro AVM Model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Arachnoid cysts are benign cerebrospinal fluid collection within a duplication of arachnoid membrane and, when found in the retrocerebellar site, they may be associated with tonsils herniation. This rare situation of coexisting retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst (AC) and Chiari malformation type 1 (CM-1) have been previously reported in few cases (10 patients) with syringomyelia and hydrocephalus described to be the most relevant issues. The aim of this paper is to describe 3 pediatric cases of this condition with a systematic review of the literature, underlining the importance of surgical management tailored to the pathogenic mechanism. RESULTS A case of a 10 months-old baby with coexisting AC and CM-1 with tri-ventricular hydrocephalus treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy, a case of 1 a year-old baby with a huge retrocerebellar AC and CM-1 treated with a cysto-peritoneal shunt and a case of a 15 years old with retrocerebellar AC causing symptomatic CM-1 treated with C0-C2 decompression, AC fenestration and duraplasty have been described. A long-term follow-up have been reported. CONCLUSION Surgical management of coexisting ACs and CM-1 should not aim at the complete resolution of the cyst or of tonsils herniation, especially when pediatric patients are treated. Rather, the purpose of neurosurgeon should be to understand the underlying pathogenic mechanism and, then, restoring both the CSF flow in the posterior fossa and the dynamic equilibrium between ventricles, cyst and subarachnoid space.","output":"Coexisting Retrocerebellar Arachnoid Cyst and Chiari Type 1 Malformation: 3 Pediatric Cases of Surgical Management Tailored To The Pathogenic Mechanism and Systematic Review Of The Literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Before the widespread availability of an effective COVID-19 vaccine, it is crucial to control the rate of transmission by ensuring adherence to behavioral modifications, such as wearing masks, physical distancing, and washing hands, all of which can be implemented as public health measures. Focusing on the conditions in Bali, this study explored the level of compliance to public health measures targeted at COVID-19 and identified the determinants of compliance via the values, rules, and knowledge approach. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study conducted an online survey using the Google Form application from June 29 to July 5, 2020. The minimum required sample size was 664. Inclusion criteria were set as follows: 18 years of age or older and residing in Bali during the data collection period. Adherence was measured based on nine protocol indicators that were rated using a four-point Likert scale. A multiple linear regression analysis was then conducted to determine the associated factors of adherence to public health measures. Results: Of the 954 survey respondents, data from 743 were included for analysis. The average level of adherence to public health measures was 32.59 (range of 20-36). The linear regression analysis showed that perceived health benefits from public health measures, being female, and having COVID-19 test histories were significantly associated with adherence to public health measures. Conclusions: For public health measures targeted at COVID-19, adherence was strongly associated with perceived social norms, in which individuals played social community roles by adapting to standardized public health measures. It is thus imperative for governments to support and monitor public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Perceived Social Norms as Determinants of Adherence to Public Health Measures Related to COVID-19 in Bali, Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The development of COVID-19 vaccines has progressed with encouraging safety and efficacy data. Concerns have been raised about SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses in the large population of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The study aimed to explore the safety and immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination in NAFLD. METHODS: This multicenter study included patients with NAFLD without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All patients were vaccinated with 2 doses of inactivated vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The primary safety outcome was the incidence of adverse reactions within 7 days after each injection and overall incidence of adverse reactions within 28 days, and the primary immunogenicity outcome was neutralizing antibody response at least 14 days after the whole-course vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 381 patients with pre-existing NAFLD were included from 11 designated centers in China. The median age was 39.0 years (IQR 33.0C48.0 years) and 179 (47.0%) were male. The median BMI was 26.1 kg/m(2) (IQR 23.8C28.1 kg/m(2)). The number of adverse reactions within 7 days after each injection and adverse reactions within 28 days totaled 95 (24.9%) and 112 (29.4%), respectively. The most common adverse reactions were injection site pain in 70 (18.4%), followed by muscle pain in 21 (5.5%), and headache in 20 (5.2%). All adverse reactions were mild and self-limiting, and no grade 3 adverse reactions were recorded. Notably, neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 364 (95.5%) patients with NAFLD. The median neutralizing antibody titer was 32 (IQR 8-64), and the neutralizing antibody titers were maintained. CONCLUSIONS: The inactivated COVID-19 vaccine appears to be safe with good immunogenicity in patients with NAFLD. LAY SUMMARY: The development of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has progressed rapidly, with encouraging safety and efficacy data.

While ensemble docking has been used widely as a solution to this problem, the optimum choice of receptor conformations is still an open question considering the issues related to the computational cost and false positive pose predictions. Here, a combination of ensemble learning and ensemble docking is suggested to rank different conformations of the target protein in light of their importance for the final accuracy of the model. Available X-ray structures of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) in complex with different ligands are used as an initial receptor ensemble, and its redundancy is removed through a graph-based redundancy removal, which is shown to be more efficient and less subjective than clustering-based representative selection methods. A set of ligands with available experimental affinity are docked to this nonredundant receptor ensemble, and the energetic features of the best scored poses are used in an ensemble learning procedure based on the random forest method. The importance of receptors is obtained through feature selection measures, and it is shown that a few of the most important conformations are sufficient to reach 1 kcal/mol accuracy in affinity prediction with considerable improvement of the early enrichment power of the models compared to the different ensemble docking without learning strategies. A clear strategy has been provided in which machine learning selects the most important experimental conformers of the receptor among a large set of proteinCligand complexes while simultaneously maintaining the final accuracy of affinity predictions at the highest level possible for available data. Our results could be informative for future attempts to design receptor-specific docking-rescoring strategies.","output":"Ensemble learning from ensemble docking: revisiting the optimum ensemble size problem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unknown","output":"Part III-1.

Factors involved in establishment and persistence of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms (KPCO) in hospital wastewater plumbing are unclear.Methods: This study was conducted at a hospital with endemic KPCO linked to wastewater reservoirs and robust patient perirectal screening for silent KPCO carriage. Over five months, both rooms occupied and not occupied by KPCO-positive patients were sampled at three wastewater sites within each room (sink drain, sink P-trap, and toilet or hopper). Risk factors for KPCO positivity were assessed using logistic regression. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) identified environmental seeding by KPCO-positive patients.Findings: 219/475(46%) room sampling events were KPCO-positive in at least one wastewater site. KPCO-positive patient exposure was associated with increased risk of environmental positivity for the room and toilet/hopper. Previous positivity and intensive care unit room type were consistently associated with increased risk. Tube feeds were associated with increased risk for the drain, while exposure to patients with Clostridioides difficile was associated with decreased risk. Urinary catheter exposure was associated with increased risk of P-trap positivity. P-trap heaters reduced risk of P-trap and sink drain positivity. WGS identified genomically linked environmental seeding in six of 99 room occupations by 40 KPCO-positive patients.Interpretation: KPCO-positive patients seed the environment in at least 6% of opportunities; once positive for KPCO, wastewater sites are at greater risk of being positive subsequently. Increased nutrient exposure, e.g. due to tube food disposal down sinks, may increase risk; frequent flushing may be protective.IMPORTANCE: Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms (KPCOs) are bacteria that are resistant to most antibiotics and thus are challenging to treat when they cause infections in patients. These organisms can be acquired by patients who are hospitalized for other reasons, complicating their hospital stay and even leading to death. Hospital wastewater sites, such as sink drains and toilets, have played a role in many reported outbreaks over the past decade. The significance of our research is in identifying risk factors for environmental positivity for KPCOs, which will facilitate further work to prevent transmission of these organisms to patients from the hospital environment.","output":"Risk factors associated with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) positivity in the hospital wastewater environment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to analyse the trends manifested in research literature from the field of healthcare management, with emphasis on bibliometric features and different influencing factors.

Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) emerges as a compensatory mechanism used by neurons to adjust their excitability in response to changes in synaptic activity. Recently, glial cells emerged as modulators for neurotransmission by releasing gliotransmitters into the synaptic cleft through pathways that include P2X7 receptors (P2X7R), connexons, and pannexons. However, the role of gliotransmission in the activity-dependent adjustment of presynaptic strength is still an open question. Here, we investigated whether glial cells participate in HSP upon chronic inactivity and the role of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), connexin43 hemichannels (Cx43HCs), and pannexin1 (Panx1) channels in this process. We used immunocytochemistry against vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) to estimate changes in synaptic strength in hippocampal dissociated cultures. Pharmacological manipulations indicate that glial-derived ATP and P2X7R are required for HSP. In addition, inhibition of Cx43 and Panx1 channels reveals a pivotal role for these channels in the compensatory adjustment of synaptic strength, emerging as new pathways for ATP release upon inactivity. The involvement of Panx1 channels was confirmed by using Panx1-deficient animals. Lacking Panx1 in neurons is sufficient to prevent the P2X7R-dependent upregulation of presynaptic strength; however, the P2X7R-dependent compensatory adjustment of synapse density requires both neuronal and glial Panx1. Together, our data supports an essential role for glial ATP signaling and Cx43HCs and Panx1 channels in the homeostatic adjustment of synaptic strength in hippocampal cultures upon chronic inactivity.","output":"Glial ATP and Large Pore Channels Modulate Synaptic Strength in Response to Chronic Inactivity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A high-intensity thrombosis prophylaxis protocol based on D-dimer and weight was implemented across the healthcare system on 04/2020.

Hospital staff was encouraged to get tested for COVID-19 when presenting with SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms. In a period of approximately 5 months, a steady decline in the performance of the Ag test was noted, epidemiologically coinciding with the rise of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant of concern (VOC) in the Netherlands. This led to the hypothesis that the diagnostic performance of the PanBio COVID-19 Ag test was influenced by the infecting viral variant. The results show a significantly lower sensitivity of the PanBio COVID-19 Ag test in persons infected with the B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with that in persons infected with non-B.1.1.7 variants, also after adjustment for viral load.

There are several FDA- and CE-cleared tests on the market. Their performance has been evaluated mainly on the basis of infections by the classical variant of the causing virus, SARS-CoV-2. This paper provides evidence that the performance of one of the most widely used antigen tests detects significantly fewer cases of COVID-19 by the alpha variant than by the classical variants of SARS-CoV-2.

METHOD: In our clinic 11 patients presented with PIMS between 06/2020 and 06/2021, whose data were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 11 patients 6 were male, the age distribution ranged from 4C18 years and 7 were overweight or obese. Almost all patients showed gastrointestinal and cardiovascular involvement, 4 had respiratory symptoms, 6 showed signs of nephritis. All showed blood count changes with anemia or leukocytosis and coagulopathy. CRP, ferritin, and soluble IL2 receptor were highly elevated in all patients. Only 2 patients had neither troponin?T nor NT-pro-BNP elevation and 7 patients had impaired left ventricular function. Positive SARS-CoV?2 serology was found in 10, and positive SARS-CoV?2 PCR via nasopharyngeal swabs in 2. All were initially treated with antibiotics, 3 patients required O(2) supplementation, 6 required intensive care and 5 required vasoactive agents. All but one patient received immunoglobulins and ASS, 5 received prednisolone. Length of stay ranged from 4C51 days. CONCLUSION: PIMS is a severe acute hyperinflammatory disease, which was secured in 11 patients in our clinic. In some cases, there was a need for intensive care.

DESIGN: Outbreak investigation. SETTING: Medical floor of a tertiary care center in Minnesota. METHODS: Serial testing for SARS-CoV-2 and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of positive specimens from HCP and patients was used. An outbreak-associated case was defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test in HCP who worked on the floor prior to testing positive or in a patient who was hospitalized on the medical floor during October 27-December 1, 2020. WGS was used to understand potential routes of transmission. RESULTS: The outbreak was detected after a patient hospitalized for 12 days tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Serial testing of patients and HCP was conducted in response. Overall, 247 HCP and 41 patients participated in serial SARS-CoV-2 testing. Fifty-two (21%) HCP and 19 (46%) hospitalized patients tested positive. One additional HCP tested positive outside of serial testing. WGS of specimens from 27 (51%) HCP and 15 (79%) patients identified three distinct transmission clusters. WGS and epidemiologic evidence suggested intrafacility transmission. The proportion of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients who tested positive (63%) and HCP who worked during their infectious period (75%) highlight the need for serial testing of asymptomatic patients and HCP during outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: Coupled with preventive measures such as personal protective equipment use and physical distancing, serial testing of HCP and patients could help detect and prevent transmission within healthcare facilities during outbreaks and when nosocomial transmission is suspected.","output":"Use of Serial Testing to Interrupt a SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak on a Hospital Medical Floor - Minnesota, October-December 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The deleterious mental health effects associated with the COVID\\\\19 pandemic are increasingly apparent, however, questions remain about the extent to which pandemic\\\\related stressor exposure has contributed to increased psychological distress among an already disadvantaged group, individuals with disabilities.

METHODS Patients completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)'s Quality of Life Questionnaires (QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BN20), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) twice. All patients completed the first measurement on the day of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan (t = 0), but the second measurement (t = 1) depended on randomization; Group 1 (n = 49) completed the questionnaires before and Group 2 (n = 51) after the consultation with the physician. RESULTS median HRQoL scale scores on t0/t1 and change scores were comparable between the two groups. Between 8-58% of patients changed to a clinically relevant extent (i.e., 10 points) on the evaluated HRQoL scales in about one-week time, in both directions, with only 3% of patients remaining stable in all scales. Patients with a stable role functioning had a lower HADS anxiety change score. The HADS depression score was not associated with a change in HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS Measuring HRQoL before or after the consultation did not impact HRQoL scores on a group level. However, most patients reported a clinically relevant difference in at least one HRQoL scale between the two time points.

This audit evaluates the safety of this pathway with a particular focus on anaphylaxis. Objectives This study aimed to retrospectively audit the records of 39 patients undertaking expedited home self-administration at NIRIS for complications, particularly emergency department attendance for anaphylaxis. The target was for 100% of patients to complete a six-month course without experiencing anaphylaxis related to omalizumab administration. Materials and methods A total of 39 records of patients who underwent expedited omalizumab self-administration were audited by a single reviewer. They were prospectively collected between March 2020 and August 2021. Clinical data were collected from the Northern Ireland Electronic Care Record (NIECR). Results Hundred percent of patients were in the process of completing or had completed a six-dose course without anaphylaxis. During the course of omalizumab, 7.6% of patients attended the emergency department. Zero percent of patients have experienced anaphylaxis triggered by omalizumab. The target of 100% patients completing the expedited pathway without omalizumab-related anaphylaxis was met. Conclusion Home self-administration of omalizumab is preferred by patients and clinicians for reducing expense, travel, and unnecessary clinical contact during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Due to globalization and the proliferation of international travel, many countries are now facing local epidemics. The existence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmissions makes it more difficult to control disease transmission by isolating infectious individuals. To accurately describe and represent the spread of COVID-19, we suggest a susceptible-exposed-infected-hospitalized-removed (SEIHR) model with human migrations, where the exposed (asymptomatic) individuals are contagious. From this model, we derive the basic reproduction number of the disease and its relationship with the model parameters. We find that, for highly contagious diseases like COVID-19, when the adjacent regions epidemic is not severe, a large migration rate can reduce the speed of local epidemic spreading at the price of infecting the neighboring regions. In addition, since infected (symptomatic) patients are isolated almost immediately, the transmission rate of the epidemic is more sensitive to that of the exposed (asymptomatic) individuals. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of various interventions, e.g. isolation and border control, on the speed of disease propagation and the resultant demand on medical facilities, and find that a strict intervention measure can be more effective than closing the borders. Finally, we use some real historical data of COVID-19 caseloads from different regions, including Hong Kong, to validate the modified SEIHR model, and make an accurate prediction for the third wave of the outbreak in Hong Kong.","output":"Modeling the COVID-19 Pandemic Using an SEIHR Model With Human Migration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) in select individuals results in viral sepsis, pneumonia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, collectively known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the early months of the pandemic the combination of novel disease presentation, enormous surges of critically ill patients and severity of illness lent to early observations and pronouncements regarding COVID-19 that could not be scientifically validated owing to crisis circumstances. One of these was a phenomenon referred to as \\"happy hypoxia\\". Widely discussed in the lay press, it was thought to represent a novel and perplexing phenomenon: severe hypoxemia coupled with the absence of respiratory distress and dyspnea. Silent hypoxemia is the preferred term describing an apparent lack of distress in the presence of hypoxemia. However, the phenomenon is well-known among respiratory physiologists as \\"hypoxic ventilatory decline\\". Silent hypoxemia can be explained by physiologic mechanisms governing the control of breathing, breathing perception and cardiovascular compensation. This narrative review examines silent hypoxemia during COVID-19, as well as hypotheses that viral infection of the central and peripheral nervous system may be implicated. Moreover, the credulous embrace of \\"happy hypoxia\\" and the novel hypotheses proposed to explain it, has exposed significant misunderstandings among clinicians regarding the physiologic mechanisms governing both the control of breathing and the modulation of breathing sensations.

However, translating the nanocompounds to the field requires considerable investment and time as well as actual trials;thus, they may not be a viable option for timely deployment during the COVID-19 pandemic. With these considerations in mind, we have used sodium chloride, which is generally recognized as safe (GRAS), to functionalize nonwoven sheets as frequently touched surfaces.

Secondary attack rates among household contacts are estimated to be five to ten times higher than among non-household contacts, but it is unclear which individuals are more prone to transmit infection within their households. METHODS: Using address matching, a cohort was assembled of all laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 residing in private households in Ontario, Canada. Descriptive analyses were performed to compare characteristics of cases in households that experienced secondary transmission versus those that did not. Logistic regression models were fit to determine index case characteristics and neighbourhood characteristics associated with transmission. FINDINGS: Between January and July, 2020, there were 26,152 cases of COVID-19 residing in 21,226 households. Longer testing delays ([]5 days versus 0 days OR=3.02, 95% CI: 2.53 - 3.60) and male sex (OR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.18 - 1.38) were associated with greater odds of household secondary transmission, while being a healthcare worker (OR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.50 - 0.62) was associated with lower odds of transmission. Neighbourhoods with larger average economic family size and a higher proportion of households with multiple persons per room were also associated with greater odds of transmission.

The model has a trigonometric baseline and considers any upwards deviation from that to come from flu or extreme temperatures. To measure it, the model considers two variables: influenza activity and extreme temperatures. With the former, the model gives the number of deaths because of flu and with the latter the number of deaths because of extreme temperatures. In this article, we show that FluMOMO lacks important variables to be an accurate measure of all-cause mortality and flu mortality. Indeed, we found, as expected, that population ageing and exposure to the risk of death cannot be excluded from the linear predictor. We model weekly deaths as an autoregressive process (lag of one together with a lead of one week). This step allowed us to avoid FluMOMO trigonometric baseline and have a fit to weekly deaths through demographic variables. Our model uses data from Portugal between 2009 and 2020, on ISO-week basis. We use negative binomial-generalized linear models to estimate the weekly number of deaths as an alternative to traditional overdispersion Poisson. As explanatory variables were found to be statistically significant, we registered the number of deaths from the previous week, the influenza activity index, the population average age, the heat waves, the flu season, the number of deaths with COVID-19, and the population exposed to the risk of dying. Considering as excess mortality the number of deaths above the best estimate of deaths from our model, we conclude that excess mortality in 2020 (net of COVID-19 deaths, heat wave of July, and ageing) is low or inexistent. The model also allows us to have the number of deaths arising from flu and we conclude that FluMOMO is overestimating deaths from flu by 78%. Averages from the probability of dying are obtained as well as the probability of dying from flu. The latter is shown to be decreasing over time, probably due to the increase of flu vaccination. Higher mortality detected with the start of COVID-19, in March-April 2020, was probably due to COVID-19 deaths not recognized as COVID-19 deaths.","output":"Mortality and Excess Mortality: Improving FluMOMO"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corporate sustainability and ESG investing are increasingly front and center for U.S. companies as issues such as climate change, health care and inequity have more and more impact on the bottomline.

The main outcome measures were: feasibility, safety of the technique, operative time, recurrence rate, hydrocele and cosmetic results. RESULTS A total of 314 patients with CIH were corrected by NAIRS. They were 232 males and 82 females. The mean age was 28.12  1.3 months (range 6-120 months). The mean operative time was 12.6  1.7 min (range 8-15 min) for unilateral cases and 18.6  1.7 min (range 14-20 min) for the bilateral repairs.

METHODS: 173 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia receiving tocilizumab in Reggio Emilia province Hospitals between 11 March and 3 June 2020 were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Clinical improvement was defined as status improvement on a six-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. A composite outcome of intubation/death was also evaluated. CRP and IL-6 levels were determined before TCZ administration (T0) and after 3 (T3), and 7 (T7) days. RESULTS: At multivariate analysis T0 and T3 CRP levels were negatively associated with clinical improvement (OR 0.13, CI 0.03-0.55 and OR 0.11, CI 0.0-0.46) (p=0.006 and p=0.003) and positively associated with intubation/death (OR 17.66, CI 2.47-126.14 and OR 5.34, CI: 1.49-19.12) (p=0.01 and p=0.004). No significant associations with IL-6 values were observed. General linear model analyses for repeated measures showed significantly different trends for CRP from day 3 to day 7 between patients who improved and those who did not, and between patients who were intubated or died and those who were not (p<0.0001 for both). ROC analysis identified a baseline CRP level of 15.8 mg/dl as the best cut-off to predict intubation/death (AUC = 0.711, sensitivity = 0.67, specificity = 0.71). CONCLUSIONS: CRP serial measurements in the first week of TCZ therapy are useful in identifying patients developing poor outcomes.","output":"Acute-phase reactants during tocilizumab therapy for severe COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Comprehensive data on transmission mitigation behaviors and SARS-CoV-2 infection and serostatus are needed from large, community-based cohorts to identify SARS-CoV-2 risk factors and impact of public health measures.

Genome-wide association studies have shown association of a common single nucleotide polymorphism in LNK (R262W, T allele) with neutrophilia, thrombocytosis, and coronary artery disease. We have shown that LNK(TT) reduces LNK function and that LNK-deficient mice display prominent plateletCneutrophil aggregates, accelerated atherosclerosis, and thrombosis. PlateletCneutrophil interactions can promote neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. The goals of this study were to assess the role of NETs in atherosclerosis and thrombosis in mice with hematopoietic Lnk deficiency. METHODS: We bred mice with combined deficiency of Lnk and the NETosis-essential enzyme PAD4 (peptidyl arginine deiminase 4) and transplanted their bone marrow into Ldlr(C/C) mice. We evaluated the role of LNK in atherothrombosis in humans and mice bearing a gain of function variant in JAK2 (JAK2(V617F)). RESULTS: Lnk-deficient mice displayed accelerated carotid artery thrombosis with prominent NETosis that was completely reversed by PAD4 deficiency. Thrombin-activated Lnk(C/C) platelets promoted increased NETosis when incubated with Lnk(C/C) neutrophils compared with wild-type platelets or wild-type neutrophils. This involved increased surface exposure and release of oxidized phospholipids (OxPL) from Lnk(C/C) platelets, as well as increased priming and response of Lnk(C/C) neutrophils to OxPL. To counteract the effects of OxPL, we introduced a transgene expressing the single-chain variable fragment of E06 (E06-scFv). E06-scFv reversed accelerated NETosis, atherosclerosis, and thrombosis in Lnk(C/C) mice. We also showed increased NETosis when human induced pluripotent stem cellCderived LNK(TT) neutrophils were incubated with LNK(TT) platelet/megakaryocytes, but not in isogenic LNK(CC) controls, confirming human relevance. Using data from the UK Biobank, we found that individuals with the JAK2(VF) mutation only showed increased risk of coronary artery disease when also carrying the LNK R262W allele. Mice with hematopoietic Lnk(+/C) and Jak2(VF) clonal hematopoiesis showed accelerated arterial thrombosis but not atherosclerosis compared with Jak2(VF)Lnk(+/+) controls. CONCLUSIONS: Hematopoietic Lnk deficiency promotes NETosis and arterial thrombosis in an OxPL-dependent fashion. LNK(R262W) reduces LNK function in human platelets and neutrophils, promoting NETosis, and increases coronary artery disease risk in humans carrying Jak2(VF) mutations. Therapies targeting OxPL may be beneficial for coronary artery disease in genetically defined human populations.","output":"Oxidized Phospholipids Promote NETosis and Arterial Thrombosis in LNK(SH2B3) Deficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has not led to a uniform increase of mental health concerns among older adults, there is evidence to suggest that some older veterans did experience an exacerbation of preexisting mental health conditions, and that mental health difficulties were associated with a lack of social support and increasing numbers of pandemic-related stressors. Mobile mental health apps are scalable, may be a helpful resource for managing stress during the pandemic and beyond, and could potentially provide services that are not accessible due to the pandemic. However, overall comfort with mobile devices and factors influencing the uptake and usage of mobile apps during the pandemic among older veterans are not well known. COVID Coach is a free, evidence-informed mobile app designed for pandemic-related stress. Public usage data have been evaluated; however, the uptake and usage of the app among older veterans have not been explored. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize smartphone ownership rates among US veterans, identify veteran characteristics associated with downloading and use of COVID Coach, and characterize key content usage within the app. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the 2019-2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study (NHRVS), which surveyed a nationally representative, prospective cohort of 3078 US military veterans before and 1 year into the pandemic. The NHRVS sample was drawn from KnowledgePanel, a research panel of more than 50,000 households maintained by Ipsos, Inc. The median time to complete the survey was nearly 32 minutes. The research version of COVID Coach was offered to all veterans who completed the peripandemic follow-up assessment on a mobile device (n=814; weighted 34.2% of total sample). App usage data from all respondents who downloaded the app (n=34; weighted 3.3% of the mobile completers sample) were collected between November 14, 2020, and November 7, 2021. RESULTS: We found that most US veterans (81.5%) own smartphones, and that veterans with higher education, greater number of adverse childhood experiences, higher extraversion, and greater severity of pandemic-related posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were more likely to download COVID Coach. Although uptake and usage of COVID Coach were relatively low (3.3% of eligible participants, n=34), 50% of the participants returned to the app for more than 1 day of use. The interactive tools for managing stress were used most frequently. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for and creation of digital mental health tools. However, these resources may require tailoring for older veteran populations. Future research is needed to better understand how to optimize digital mental health tools such as apps to ensure uptake and usage among older adults, particularly those who have experienced traumas across the lifespan.","output":"Predicting Uptake of the COVID Coach App Among US Military Veterans: Funnel Analysis Using a Probability-Based Panel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury represents a major cause of myocardial dysfunction after infarction and thrombolytic therapy, and it is closely related to the free radical explosion and overwhelming inflammatory responses. Herein, macrophage-targeting nanocomplexes (NCs) are developed to mediate efficient co-delivery of siRNA against MOF (siMOF) and microRNA-21 (miR21) into myocardial macrophages, cooperatively orchestrating the myocardial microenvironment against IR injury. Bioreducible, branched poly(-amino ester) (BPAE-SS) is designed to co-condense siMOF and miR21 into NCs in a multivalency-reinforced approach, and they are surface-decorated with carboxylated mannan (Man-COOH) to shield the positive surface charges and enhance the serum stability. The final MBSsm NCs are efficiently internalized by myocardial macrophages after systemic administration, wherein BPAE-SS is degraded into small segments by intracellular glutathione to promote the siMOF/miR21 release, finally provoking efficient gene silencing. Thus, cardiomyocyte protection and macrophage modulation are realized via the combined effects of ROS scavenging, inflammation inhibition, and autophagy attenuation, which ameliorates the myocardial microenvironment and restores the cardiac function via positive cellular crosstalk. This study renders promising solutions to address the multiple systemic barriers against in vivo nucleic acid delivery, and it also offers new options for IR injury by manipulating multiple reciprocal bio-reactions.","output":"Macrophage-targeting gene silencing orchestrates myocardial microenvironment remodeling toward the anti-inflammatory treatment of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective prevention and treatment of hypertrophic scars (HTSs), a dermal form of fibrosis that frequently occurs following thermal injury to deep dermis, are unsolved significant clinical problems. Previously, we have found that stromal cell-derived factor 1/CXCR4 signaling is up-regulated during wound healing in burn patients and HTS tissue after thermal injury. We hypothesize that blood-borne mononuclear cells are recruited into wound sites after burn injury through the chemokine pathway of stromal cell-derived factor 1 and its receptor CXCR4. Deep dermal injuries to the skin are often accompanied by prolonged inflammation, which leads to chemotaxis of mononuclear cells into the wounds by chemokine signaling where fibroblast activation occurs and ultimately HTS are formed. Blocking mononuclear cell recruitment and fibroblast activation, CXCR4 antagonism is expected to reduce or minimize scar formation. In this study, the inhibitory effect of CXCR4 antagonist CTCE-9908 on dermal fibrosis was determined in vivo using a human HTS-like nude mouse model, in which split-thickness human skin is transplanted into full-thickness dorsal excisional wounds in athymic mice, where these wounds subsequently develop fibrotic scars that resemble human HTS as previously described. CTCE-9908 significantly attenuated scar formation and contraction, reduced the accumulation of macrophages and myofibroblasts, enhanced the remodeling of collagen fibers, and down-regulated the gene and protein expression of fibrotic growth factors in the human skin tissues. These findings support the potential therapeutic value of CXCR4 antagonist in dermal fibrosis and possibly other fibroproliferative disorders.","output":"The therapeutic potential of a C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR-4) antagonist on hypertrophic scarring in vivo."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of the Study: The purpose of this paper is to systematically review the literature on consumption and consumer behavior in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The pivotal role of immunoglobulins in the host immune response to infection suggests that additional therapy with polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulins may be a promising option in patients with septic shock. Immunoglobulin preparations enriched with the IgM component have largely been used in sepsis, mostly at standard dosages (250 mg/kg per day), regardless of clinical severity and without any dose adjustment based on immunoglobulin serum titres or other biomarkers. We hypothesised that a personalised dose of IgM enriched preparation based on patient IgM titres and aimed to achieve a specific threshold of IgM titre is more effective in decreasing mortality than a standard dose. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is designed as a multicentre, interventional, randomised, single-blinded, prospective, investigator sponsored, two-armed study. Patients with septic shock and IgM titres <60 mg/dL will be randomly assigned to an IgM titre-based treatment or a standard treatment group in a ratio of 1:1. The study will involve 12 Italian intensive care units and 356 patients will be enrolled. Patients assigned to the IgM titre-based treatment will receive a personalised daily dose based on an IgM serum titre aimed at achieving serum titres above 100 mg/dL up to discontinuation of vasoactive drugs or day 7 after enrolment. Patients assigned to the IgM standard treatment group will receive IgM enriched preparation daily for three consecutive days at the standard dose of 250 mg/kg.

This spans from biofilm being a mere reservoir of pathogenic bacteria, to playing a more active role, e.g., by contributing to inflammation. Observations also indicate that biofilm does not exclusively occur extracellularly, but may also be formed inside living cells.

Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 19.58.7, two patients (14%) received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, and mean time from last known normal to intra-arterial therapy was 17.020.1 h. Five patients had anterior circulation occlusive disease and 10 had vertebrobasilar occlusions. TRA was effective in allowing clot engagement in 13 of 15 cases: one patient had a hypoplastic radial artery that precluded sheath advancement and one had chronic innominate artery occlusion that could not be crossed. Mean time to switch from TFA to TRA was 1.91.3 h and the mean time from radial puncture to reperfusion was 2.21.0 h. Modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction 2b-3 reperfusion via TRA was achieved in 9 of 15 patients (60%). No radial puncture site complications were noted.

Subsequent 11 questions were to assess physician's awareness and plan of the medical management of the COVID-19 patients. Results: The majority of the clinicians were aware of the various treatment modalities available for the treatment of COVID-19. Regarding the plan for use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), 55% of the total respondents intended to use the drug in combination with azithromycin, even as 62% agreed that there was no clear evidence yet. About 90% of all clinicians, from junior residents to consultants, were monitoring electrocardiogram (ECG) during HCQ therapy; however, there were 10% of physicians who were not practicing ECG monitoring. About 68% of clinicians were aware of the various therapeutic options being tested, like convalescent plasma, lopinavir-ritonavir, and 64% knew about remdesivir. There was divergence regarding the use of steroids in a cytokine storm among the physicians, with only 39% of consultants planning to use steroids whereas about 50% of junior residents and 79% of junior consultants were planning to use the drug. Conclusion: The majority of the clinicians involved in the management of COVID-19 were aware of the various drug modalities available for treatment. However, more emphasis on the adverse effects and possible drug interactions is required. There is disaccord regarding the use of steroids in cytokine storm in COVID-19 and further guidelines and educational programs should address these issues. Clinical significance: Clinicians have to be made more aware of the possible adverse effects and drug interactions of the medications used for the treatment of COVID-19. The treatment of the serious, cytokine storm syndrome and the role of steroids must be elucidated as soon as it is feasible. How to cite this article: Maddani SS, Chaudhuri S, Deepa HC, Amara V.

Also, polymorphisms in the IL-10, TNF and INF genes were associated with immune responsiveness and the frequency of complications. Here, the effect of these polymorphisms on illness and seroconversion during infection with rhinovirus type 39 (RV39) was evaluated. METHODS: Seventy-two adults were genotyped for the selected polymorphisms, experimentally exposed to RV39 and followed for infection, seroconversion and symptoms/signs of illness. Regression analysis was used to determine if these polymorphisms predicted seroconversion and illness magnitude in 57 infected subjects. RESULTS: The low production IL-6 (?174, C/C) phenotype was associated with greater symptom magnitudes and the INF (+874) phenotype predicted the frequency of seroconversion. No relationship between the IL-10 or TNF polymorphisms and any measured outcome was documented. IL-6 protein measured in nasal wash fluids of 51 subjects was positively correlated with symptom magnitude but was independent of the IL-6 (?174) genotypes representing high and low production phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: These results document significant associations between the IL-6 (?174) and INF (+874) gene polymorphisms and specific responses to experimental RV39 infection.

The SARS-CoV-2 genome is about a 29,800-nucleotide-long plus-strand RNA that can form functionally important secondary and higher-order structures called cis-acting RNA elements. These elements can interact with viral proteins, host proteins, or other RNAs and be involved in regulating translation and replication processes of the viral genome and encapsidation of the virus. However, the cis-acting RNA elements and their biological roles in SARS-CoV-2 as well as their comparative analysis in the closely related viral genome have not been well explored, which is very important to understand the molecular mechanism of viral infection and pathogenies. In this study, we used a bioinformatics approach to identify the cis-acting RNA elements in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Initially, we aligned the full genomic sequence of six different CoVs, and a phylogenetic analysis was performed to understand their evolutionary relationship. Next, we predicted the cis-acting RNA elements in the SARS-CoV-2 genome using the structRNAfinder tool. Then, we annotated the location of these cis-acting RNA elements in different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2. After that, we analyzed the sequence conservation patterns of each cis-acting RNA element among the six CoVs. Finally, the presence of cis-acting RNA elements across different CoV genomes and their comparative analysis was performed. Our study identified 12 important cis-acting RNA elements in the SARS-CoV-2 genome; among them, Corona_FSE, Corona_pk3, and s2m are highly conserved across most of the studied CoVs, and Thr_leader, MAT2A_D, and MS2 are uniquely present in SARS-CoV-2. These RNA structure elements can be involved in viral translation, replication, and encapsidation and, therefore, can be potential targets for better treatment of COVID-19. It is imperative to further characterize these cis-acting RNA elements experimentally for a better mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and therapeutic intervention.","output":"A Comprehensive Analysis of cis-Acting RNA Elements in the SARS-CoV-2 Genome by a Bioinformatics Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research aims to examine: (a) how Physics teachers who participated in a STEM project, adopted and implemented a STEM activity in the context of a pandemic;(b) from the perspective of Physics teachers, what were the effects on students' learning of a STEM activity implemented in the context of the pandemic;(c) what challenges had Physics teachers faced in implementing the STEM activity during the pandemic A qualitative and interpretive methodology was used The participants are four Physics teachers who implemented a STEM activity on sound, during the pandemic Data were collected through interviews and written reflections The study has shown how, in a crisis context such as COVID-19, which affected schools all around the world, teachers were able to deal with it and kept developing a STEM activity, revealing the main challenges and effects on student learning, from the teachers' points of view Moreover, it was clear that carrying out with success a STEM activity, in such an adverse scenario, was strongly related with teachers who found new strategies and keep students motivated, by guiding them proficiently, and that requires to merge scientific and technological knowledge","output":"Stem Education during the Covid-19: Teachers' Perspectives about Strategies, Challenges and Effects on Students' Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While focused on the United States, Rosenberg's work on epidemics offers a nuanced framing that defines the stages and unfolding trajectories of epidemics.

Results: the system of compulsory health insurance is an ancestor of the program of the state guarantees of free medical care of in Russian citizens. ThelengthofthetextofthisProgramsofarwasincreasedin130timesincomparison with initial edition of 1998. At the same time, there is still no clear delineation for the bases, volumes and conditions differentiation of free and paid medical care rendering. As a result, the major human right to free medical care remains not completely realized. The numbers of the non-state medical organizations to provide free of charge medical care to the population according to the policy of obligatory medical insurance (i.e. financed from the state sources) in the period of 2011 to 2019 C from 648 to 2423 organizations respectively were increased in Russia four times. This demonstrates the creation of the new, ?integrated? model of health care in Russia in the mode of public and private partnership for deciding of social tasks. Although, free medical care for citizens in the private medical organizations is not mentioned in the Constitution of Russian Federation (Main Law). In emergency situations such integration allows private medical structures to involve capacities and also be coordinated with one of the tasks of the Ministry of health target program ?Development of the Fundamental, Transmitting and Personalized Medicine?. Conclusions. There is a formation of the integrated, public and private (hybrid) model of health care in modern Russia that needs developing of a new partnership and principles of management in the sphere of medical care organization. State policy in the health care financing sphere should be directed not only to the state guarantees of medical care specification, but also to a gap in social and economic inequality reduction. The social protection systems should be focused, first of all, on people who are mostin greatneedofmedicalcare. For the protecting population from catastrophic payments for medical care, it is necessary to bring the concept of the social standards - a number of the general rules, norms and standards which must guarantee the state ensuring constitutional rights of citizens to free medical care in the health care legislation. ? 2021 Scientific Centre for Family Health and Human Reproduction Problems.","output":"Formation of public -private model in Russia health care organization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) from SARS-CoV-2 is an important drug target as it is responsible for viral RNA genome replication.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, consecutive COVID-19 patients over 60 years old in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 1 to Feb 6 were included. Data of demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory tests, medications and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Sequential alterations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were monitored. RESULTS: 330 patients were included and classified into two groups with normal (n=234) or elevated ALT (n=96). There were fewer females (40.6% vs 54.7%, P=0.020) and more critical cases (30.2% vs. 19.2%, P=0.026) in patients with elevated ALT compared to the normal group. Higher levels of bacterial infection indices (e.g. white blood cell count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin) were observed in the elevated group. Spearman correlation showed that both ALT and AST levels were positively correlated with those indices of bacterial infection. No obvious effects of medications on ALT abnormalities were found. In patients with elevated ALT, most ALT elevations were mild and transient. 59.4% of the patients had ALT concentrations of 41-100 U/L, while only a few patients (5.2%) had high serum ALT concentrations above 300 U/L. ALT elevations occurred at 13 (10-17) days and recovered at 28 (18-35) days from disease onset. For most patients, the elevation of serum ALT levels occurred at 6-20 days after disease onset and reached their peak values within a similar time frame. The recovery of serum ALT levels to normal frequently occurred at 16-20 days or 31-35 days after disease onset.

Currently, little is known of how the pandemic has impacted patients with cardiovascular disease. The primary focus of this study was to determine whether emergency cardiovascular surgeries can be carried out safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Between 17 January 2020 and 11 February 2020, 13 patients were admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital for emergency cardiovascular surgery. During this time, Wuhan was a COVID-19 epicenter, and Wuhan Union Hospital is a sentinel hospital located in this area. These patients' epidemiological histories, clinical records, laboratory assessments, imaging findings, and surgical outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. Throat swabs were collected from some patients preoperatively and all patients postoperatively for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to determine whether these patients had COVID-19. Results This cohort included 5 cases of acute aortic dissection, 3 cases of congenital heart disease, 2 cases of dilated cardiomyopathy with end-stage heart failure, 1 case of aortocoronary fistula that had undergone previous surgery, 1 case of subacute infective endocarditis with cerebral infarction, and 1 case of multivessel coronary disease. Six patients were suspected COVID-19 cases (46.2%). There were no confirmed COVID-19 cases in this cohort. None of the patients in this cohort died and none developed severe acute respiratory syndrome, renal failure, or septic shock after surgery. No cross-infection occurred with other patients or medical staff who came into close contact with this cohort. Conclusions Emergency surgery is crucial and unavoidable for many patients with acute and severe cardiovascular disease, regardless of the pandemic.

DISCUSSION Mesothelial cells play a crucial physiological role in friction less gliding of the serosa and the maintenance of anantiadhesive surface. The formation of postoperative adhesions results from a cascade of events and is regulated by various cellular and humoral factors. Therefore, optimization or functionalization of barrier materials by developments interacting with this cascade on a structural or pharmacological level could give an innovative input for future strategies in peritoneal adhesion prevention.

The magnitude of the associations has been estimated using the Spearman correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Incidence and mortality rates at the time of decree of alarm status are associated with current incidence, mortality and hospital demand rates. Higher mean temperatures are significantly associated with a lower current incidence of COVID-19 in the autonomous communities. Likewise, a higher proportion of older people in nursing homes is significantly associated with a higher current mortality in the autonomous communities. CONCLUSION: It is possible to predict the evolution of the epidemic through the analysis of incidence and mortality. Lower temperatures and the proportion of older people in residences are factors associated with a worse prognosis. These parameters must be considered in decisions about the timing and intensity of the implementation of containment measures.

In this study, we found that deficiency of BMAL1, the only non-redundant circadian clock component, results in an accelerated aging phenotype in both human and cynomolgus monkey mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs). Unexpectedly, this phenotype was mainly attributed to a transcription-independent role of BMAL1 in stabilizing heterochromatin and thus preventing activation of the LINE1-cGAS-STING pathway. In senescent primate MPCs, we observed decreased capacity of BMAL1 to bind to LINE1 and synergistic activation of LINE1 expression. Likewise, in the skin and muscle tissues from the BMAL1-deficient cynomolgus monkey, we observed destabilized heterochromatin and aberrant LINE1 transcription.

In the COVID-19 pandemic, questions arose about how infection events occur in daycare centers, what role daycare children play in the pandemic, and what protective and hygienic measures are implemented in daycare centers. From 06/2020 to 12/2021, we conducted the Corona Day Care Study, in which we address pedagogical and infection epidemiological topics in a joint approach. METHODS: In the study, data are collected from different sources. Official reporting data as well as weekly data from daycare centers in the so-called KiTa Register are continuously evaluated. In addition, SARS-CoV?2 outbreaks in daycare centers are investigated on site by repeated sample collection and interviews. RESULTS: SARS-CoV?2 infection incidence in daycare centers or in daycare-aged children was very dynamic from 03/2020 to 05/2021. In the second and third pandemic waves, the number of SARS-CoV?2 outbreaks in daycare centers rose sharply, accompanied by a substantial increase in daycare and group closures. Most recently, the proportion of affected children in outbreaks increased steadily. However, preliminary examinations of SARS-CoV?2 outbreaks (n = 28) revealed that, on average, only a fraction of daycare contact persons (6.8%) were infected by child index cases. Transmission frequencies differed markedly between the individual daycare centers.

The key findings of this systematic review are as follows: 77% of the models are non-interpretable in nature, and organisations can argue for the explainability and trust in the system. DL models in other domains perform well in terms of accuracy but lack explainability, which can be achieved with XAI implementation. Future research should focus on implementing DL models for sentiment analysis in the FDS domain and incorporating XAI techniques to bring out the explainability of the models.","output":"Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews of Food Delivery Services Using Deep Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is associated with an increased risk for lifestyle-related diseases. In Japan, VDD is quite prevalent in all age groups, with its high risk in young women. Furthermore, its association during pregnancy with gestational hypertension and low birth weight has also been reported. VDD can be diagnosed by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels, which, however, is not suited for screening. Therefore, we will create a predictive model for serum 25(OH)D concentration and prevalence of VDD based on such data as region, sun exposure habit, and vitamin D intake in young women. METHODS: From 2020 to 2022, we conduct a cross-sectional study of 600 young women in four regions of Japan, identify the indices associated with serum 25(OH)D concentrations such as sun exposure habits, habitual vitamin D intake, ultraviolet-B irradiation, seasons (summer and winter) and latitude, and construct prediction models for serum 25(OH)D concentrations and VDD risk. This study has been registered with UMIN-CTR (ID: UMIN000041527). RESULTS: One hundred and fifteen subjects have been collected from 6 institutions in winter as of May 2021. When data from more than 200 subjects have become available, we will conduct the interim analysis, summarize the data by region and facility, review the inclusion criteria for analysis, and check for missing values and outliers. Prediction models for serum 25(OH)D concentration and VDD will be determined in the final analysis when all cases have been collected. CONCLUSIONS: A screening tool for VDD risk to be developed in our study based on the predictive model would help the public and medical professionals prevent lifestyle-related diseases through improving VDD. Additionally, the results may serve as the scientific basis for determining the appropriate vitamin D intake and sun exposure standards.","output":"Development of a predictive model for vitamin D deficiency based on the vitamin D status in young Japanese women: A study protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper reports the policy-responses of different Philippine higher education institutions (HEIs) to the novel coronavirus, COVD-19 pandemic.

Womens discomfort in asking for more time on adjustable deadlines uniquely predicts time stress and burnout, controlling for marital status, industry, tenure, and delegation preferences (study 1). Women are less likely to ask for more time to complete their tasks because they hold stronger beliefs that they will be penalized for these requests and worry more about burdening others (studies 1 to 2d).

In Ethiopia, due to different reasons, including healthcare providers associated reasons, most unmarried adolescents are not accessing the services. However, little is known about healthcare providers perception towards the provision of SRH services for unmarried adolescents. This study aimed to explore healthcare provider perception towards the provision of SRH services to unmarried adolescents in Gamo zone, Southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A qualitative phenomenological research design was used in May 2021. Fifteen healthcare providers (HCPs) working in adolescent and youth sexual and reproductive health centers were involved in this study. A purposive sampling technique was used to select healthcare providers assuming they are information-rich regarding the phenomenon of interest. Inclusion of the study participants was continued until data saturation is reached. To analyze the data, we used inductive thematic analysis, method, and main themes, which captured the diverse views and feelings of the participants. To maintain the trustworthiness of the data, we used dependability, transferability, conformability, and credibility. RESULTS: In this study, individual-level attributes such as healthcare providers personal belief, attitude, and motivation; community-level influences like socio-cultural norms, religious reasons, and lack of parental support; and health system setbacks like shortage of essential medical supplies and lack of training are identified as major obstacles in the provision of sexual and reproductive health services for unmarried adolescents. CONCLUSION: Provision of sexual and reproductive health services for unmarried adolescents is constrained by the interplay of factors acting at an individual level, community level, and health system level. The Ministry of Health (MOH), program planners and policymakers are recommended to give due attention to fulfill the necessary inputs, improving healthcare providers attitude and skill and engagement of religious and community leaders to create a safe and supportive environment for providing sexual and reproductive health services to unmarried adolescents.","output":"Exploring Providers Perception Towards Provision of Sexual and Reproductive Health Services for Unmarried Adolescents in Gamo Zone, Southern Ethiopia: A Phenomenological Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent outbreaks of zoonotic coronaviruses, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have caused tremendous casualties and great economic shock. Although some repurposed drugs have shown potential therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials, specific therapeutic agents targeting coronaviruses have not yet been developed. During coronavirus replication, a replicase gene cluster, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), is alternatively translated via a process called -1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (?1 PRF) by an RNA pseudoknot structure encoded in viral RNAs. The coronavirus frameshifting has been identified previously as a target for antiviral therapy. In this study, the frameshifting efficiencies of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were determined using an in vitro ?1 PRF assay system. Our group has searched approximately 9689 small molecules to identify potential ?1 PRF inhibitors. Herein, we found that a novel compound, 2-(5-acetylthiophen-2yl)furo[2,3-b]quinoline (KCB261770), inhibits the frameshifting of MERS-CoV and effectively suppresses viral propagation in MERS-CoV-infected cells. The inhibitory effects of 87 derivatives of furo[2,3-b]quinolines were also examined showing less prominent inhibitory effect when compared to compound KCB261770. We demonstrated that KCB261770 inhibits the frameshifting without suppressing cap-dependent translation. Furthermore, this compound was able to inhibit the frameshifting, to some extent, of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the novel compound 2-(5-acetylthiophen-2yl)furo[2,3-b]quinoline may serve as a promising drug candidate to interfere with pan-coronavirus frameshifting.","output":"A Novel Frameshifting Inhibitor Having Antiviral Activity against Zoonotic Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic include strict public health measures, such as national lockdowns During these measures, paediatric emergency department attendances have declined and the prevalence of presenting complaints has changed This study sought to identify whether dog bite attendance and victim demographics changed during COVID-19 public health measures Methods An audit was conducted of emergency department attendance data from a UK tertiary paediatric hospital between January 2016 and September 2020 Dog bite attendance and victim demographics were explored using  2 tests and multivariable Poisson regression The mean monthly percentage of attendance due to dog bites in 2020 was compared against predicted percentages based on previous years' data Results Dog bite attendance rose in conjunction with the introduction of COVID-19 public health measures and reached a peak in July 2020 (44 dog bites, 1 3% of all attendances were due to dog bites) This was a threefold increase in dog bite attendance By September 2020, attendance had returned to normal The demographic profile of child dog bite victims remained the same Boys had the highest attendance rates in 7-12 year-olds, girls in 4-6 year-olds Girls showed higher attendance rates in the summer, while boys' attendance rates were constant throughout the year COVID-19 public health measures were associated with a 78% increase in attendance for boys and a 66% increase in girls Conclusions COVID-19 national public health measures were associated with an increase in paediatric emergency department dog bite attendance, and may be due to increased child exposure to dogs via 'stay at home' orders and school closures National lockdowns are likely to continue globally throughout the COVID-19 pandemic;this is likely to result in more dog bites Urgent public health communication and injury prevention strategies are needed to help prevent these avoidable injuries ?

The outcomes of these policies on the care of injured patients and the maintenance of emergency services have not been adequately reported. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with delays in urgent fracture surgery beyond national time-to-surgery benchmarks. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used data collected in the Program of Randomized Trials to Evaluate Preoperative Antiseptic Skin Solutions in Orthopaedic Trauma among at 20 sites throughout the US and Canada and included patients who sustained open fractures or closed femur or hip fractures. EXPOSURE: COVID-19Cera operating room restrictions were compared with preCCOVID-19 data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Surgery within 24 hours after injury. RESULTS: A total of 3589 patients (mean [SD] age, 55 [25.4] years; 1913 [53.3%] male) were included in this study, 2175 preCCOVID-19 and 1414 during COVID-19. A total of 54 patients (3.1%) in the open fracture cohort and 407 patients (21.8%) in the closed hip/femur fracture cohort did not meet 24-hour time-to-surgery benchmarks. We were unable to detect any association between time to operating room and COVID-19 era in either open fracture (odds ratio [OR], 1.40; 95% CI, 0.77-2.55; P = .28) or closed femur/hip fracture (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.74-1.37; P = .97) cohorts.

Yet the TPJ is also recruited in processes with no affective or social component, such as visuo-spatial processing and mathematical cognition. We present serendipitous findings from a perceptual decision-making task on a bistable stimulus, the Necker Cube, performed in an MRI scanner. The Necker cube is a transparent, wire-frame cube that evokes spontaneous switches in perception. Individuals can view the cube from below or from above, though a consistent bias is shown towards seeing the cube from above. We replicate this behavioral bias, finding participants spend more time in the from-above percept. However, in testing for BOLD differences between percept orientations, we find robust responses in bilateral TPJ for the from-above > from-below perceptual state. We speculate that this neural response comes from the sensory incongruence of viewing an object from above while lying supine in the scanner. We further speculate that the TPJ resolves this incongruence by facilitating an egocentric projection. Such a function would explain the TPJ's ubiquitous response to other-regarding, visuo-spatial and mathematical cognition, as all these phenomena demand an ability to ambulate through the coordinate space. Our findings suggest the TPJ may not play a specific role in social or moral components of other-regarding behavior such as altruism and further indirectly suggest that \\"pure\\", allocentric altruism may not correlate with the TPJ.

We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on general surgical services in a district general hospital. METHOD: Electronic health care record data was retrospectively collected from 6th of April to 6th of May for both 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: Despite fewer referrals and admissions in 2020 (133 vs 177 admissions in 2019), there were more failed discharges (29 vs 17 in 2019) and higher associated costs. Higher numbers of biliary related pathologies and pancreatitis (50 in 2020 vs 25 in 2019), and fewer complaints of non-specific abdominal pain (10 in 2020 vs 22 in 2019) were observed. The use of outpatient investigations decreased by approximately 40% in 2020; however, utilisation of inpatient investigations was comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Better utilisation of outpatient investigations and virtual clinic services may surmount pressures from further peaks of COVID-19.

In the absence of an efficacious vaccine, further research would be essential to streamline general surgical services based on clinical risk stratification.","output":"822 Lessons Learnt During the COVID-19 Pandemic on Emergency Surgical Admissions in A District General Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Varying definitions of procedural myocardial infarction (PMI) are in widespread use. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the rates and clinical relevance of PMI using different definitions in patients with left main coronary artery disease randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery in the EXCEL (Evaluation of XIENCE versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization) trial. METHODS: The pre-specified protocol definition of PMI (PMIProt) required a large elevation of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), with identical threshold for both procedures. The Third Universal Definition of MI (types 4a and 5) (PMIUD) required lesser biomarker elevations but with supporting evidence of myocardial ischemia, different after PCI and CABG. For the PMIUD, troponins were used preferentially (available in 49.5% of patients), CK-MB otherwise. The multivariable relationship between each PMI type and 5-year mortality was determined. RESULTS: PMIProt occurred in 34 of 935 (3.6%) patients after PCI and 56 of 923 (6.1%) patients after CABG (difference -2.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.4% to -0.5%; p = 0.015). The corresponding rates of PMIUD were 37 (4.0%) and 20 (2.2%), respectively (difference 1.8%; 95% CI: 0.2% to 3.4%; p = 0.025). Both PMIProt and PMIUD were associated with 5-year cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 2.18 [95% CI: 1.13 to 4.23] and 2.87 [95% CI: 1.44 to 5.73], respectively). PMIProt was associated with a consistent hazard of cardiovascular mortality after both PCI and CABG (pinteraction = 0.86). Conversely, PMIUD was strongly associated with cardiovascular mortality after CABG (adjusted HR: 11.94; 95% CI: 4.84 to 29.47) but not after PCI (adjusted HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.35 to 3.67) (pinteraction = 0.004). Results were similar for all-cause mortality and with varying PMIUD biomarker definitions. Only large biomarker elevations (CK-MB &#8805;10 upper reference limit and troponin &#8805;70 upper reference limit) were associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The rates of PMI after PCI and CABG vary greatly with different definitions. In the EXCEL trial, the pre-specified PMIProt was associated with similar hazard after PCI and CABG, whereas PMIUD was strongly associated with mortality after CABG but not after PCI.

This disease, with a peak incidence in childhood, causes the lifelong need for insulin injections and necessitates careful monitoring of blood glucose levels. However, despite the current insulin therapies, it still shortens life expectancy due to complications affecting multiple organs. Recently, the incidence of T1D in childhood has increased by 3C5% per year in most developed Western countries. The heterogeneity of the disease process is supported by the findings of follow-up studies started early in infancy. The development of T1D is usually preceded by the appearance of autoantibodies targeted against antigens expressed in the pancreatic islets. The risk of T1D increases significantly with an increasing number of positive autoantibodies. The order of autoantibody appearance affects the disease risk. Genetic susceptibility, mainly defined by the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II gene region and environmental factors, is important in the development of islet autoimmunity and T1D. Environmental factors, mainly those linked to the changes in the gut microbiome as well as several pathogens, especially viruses, and diet are key modulators of T1D. The aim of this paper is to expand the understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of T1D in childhood by detailed description and comparison of factors affecting the progression from the islet autoimmunity to T1D in children.","output":"The Multifactorial Progression from the Islet Autoimmunity to Type 1 Diabetes in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was declared as pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Understanding the airborne route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is essential for infection prevention and control. In this study, a total of 107 indoor air samples (45 SARS-CoV-2, 62 bacteria, and fungi) were collected from different wards of the Hajar Hospital in Shahrekord, Iran. Simultaneously, bacterial and fungal samples were also collected from the ambient air of hospital yard. Overall, 6 positive air samples were detected in the infectious 1 and infectious 2 wards, intensive care unit (ICU), computed tomography (CT) scan, respiratory patients' clinic, and personal protective equipment (PPE) room. Also, airborne bacteria and fungi were simultaneously detected in the various wards of the hospital with concentrations ranging from 14 to 106 CFU m-3 and 18 to 141 CFU m-3, respectively. The highest mean concentrations of bacteria and fungi were observed in respiratory patients' clinics and ICU wards, respectively. Significant correlation (p < 0.05) was found between airborne bacterial concentration and the presence of SARS-CoV-2, while no significant correlation was found between fungi concentration and the virus presence. This study provided an additional evidence about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the indoor air of a hospital that admitted COVID-19 patients. Moreover, it was revealed that the monitoring of microbial quality of indoor air in such hospitals is very important, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, for controlling the nosocomial infections.","output":"Simultaneous monitoring of SARS-CoV-2, bacteria, and fungi in indoor air of hospital: a study on Hajar Hospital in Shahrekord, Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper performs a systematic investigation into the temporal evolution of daily death cases of COVID-19 worldwide lethality considering 90 countries. We apply the information theory quantifiers, more specifically the Permutation entropy (Hs) and Fisher information measure (Fs) to construct the Shannon-Fisher causality plane (SFCP), which allows us to quantify the disorder and evaluate randomness present in the time series of daily death cases related to COVID-19 in each country. Moreover, we employ Hs and Fs to rank the COVID-19 lethality in these countries based on the complexity hierarchy. Our findings reveal that the countries that are located farther from the random ideal position (Hs = 1, Fs = 0) in the SFCP such as Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand, Singapore, Monaco, Iceland, Thailand, Bahamas, Cyprus, Australia, and Norway are characterized by a less entropy and low disorder, which leads to high predictability of the COVID-19 lethality. Otherwise, the countries that are located near to the random ideal position (Hs = 1, Fs = 0) in the SFCP such as Ecuador, Czechia, Iraq, Colombia, Belgium, Italy, Philippines, Iran, Peru, and Japan are characterized by high entropy and high disorder, which implies low predictability of the COVID-19 lethality. We also employ two cluster techniques to analyze the similarity considering the temporal evolution of COVID-19 worldwide lethality for the countries investigated. Based on the values of Hs, Fs and our cluster analysis, we suggest that this health crisis will only be adequately combated through global adherence to scientific exchange and technology sharing to homogenize the actions to combat the COVID-19.

These measures are known as nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and their implementation clearly produces social unrest as well as greatly affects the economy. Frequently, NPIs are implemented with an intensity quantified in an ad hoc manner. Control theory offers a worthwhile tool for determining the optimal intensity of the NPIs in order to avoid the collapse of the healthcare system while keeping them as low as possible, yielding in a policymakers concrete guidance.

The COVID-19 pandemic originated from a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that was formerly identified in 2003. The contagiousness, dynamics of the pathogen, and mobility of the general population incurred the occurrence of underestimation of infection (i.e., the unidentified cases and the gap with the identified cases) that was potentially substantial in magnitude, which was supposed to connect with subsequent cyclical outbreaks in practice. We employed a Susceptible-Infected-Removed-Contained (SIR-C) mathematical model to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with COVID-19, then asymptotically simulated the peak sizes and peak dates of the identified and unidentified cases, the underestimation, and the dynamics of the gap. The simulation outcomes indicated that unidentified peak dates in practice could predate the reported peak dates for a variable period of weeks or months. In comparison, the saturation sizes of infection remained at commensurate levels. The curve of the initial exponential-like outbreak for the undocumented cases would flatten when the gap between concurrent identified cases and unidentified cases decreased. The rate of non-pharmaceutical containment could impact the trend of disease transmission ceteris paribus, and the greater the rate the larger reduction of infections. When the rate reached a certain level of threshold, the undocumented curve would shift from flattening effect to decaying effect. A similar trend was observed when it applied to the rate of pharmaceutical containment measures ceteris paribus. The results were sensitive to the duration of infection (DOI), it manifested that greater values of DOI were associated with greater peak sizes and greater peak dates for both documented and undocumented cases. Conditional on assumptions, calibration of DOI from 8 days to 18 days would increase the unidentified peak size by nearly 56% and the peak date by almost 18 days.","output":"Modeling the underestimation of COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 rely on trust in public health organizations and practices. These practices include contact tracing, which requires people to share personal information with public health organizations. The central role of trust in these practices has gained more attention during the pandemic, resurfacing endemic questions about public trust and potential racial trust disparities, especially as they relate to participation in public health efforts. Using an explanatory mixed methods design, we conducted quantitative analysis of state-level survey data in the United States from a representative sample of Michigan residents (n = 1000) in May 2020. We used unadjusted and adjusted linear regressions to examine differences in trust in public health information and willingness to participate in public health efforts by race. From July to September 2020, we conducted qualitative interviews (n = 26) to further explain quantitative results. Using unadjusted linear regression, we observed higher willingness to participate in COVID-19 public health efforts among Black survey respondents compared to White respondents. In adjusted analysis, that difference disappeared, yielding no statistically significant difference between Black and White respondents in either trust in public health information sources or willingness to participate. Qualitative interviews were conducted to explain these findings, considering their contrast with assumptions that Black people would exhibit lower trust in public health organizations during COVID-19. Altruism, risk acknowledgement, trust in public health organizations during COVID-19, and belief in efficacy of public health efforts contributed to willingness to participate in public health efforts among interviewees. Our findings underscore the contextual nature of trust, and the importance of this context when analyzing protective health behaviors among communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Assumptions about mistrust among Black individuals and communities may be inaccurate because they overlook the specific context of the public health crisis. These findings are important because they indicate that Black respondents are exhibiting strategic trust during COVID-19 despite systemic, contemporary, and historic barriers to trust. Conceptual specificity rather than blanket generalizations is warranted, especially given the harms of stereotyping and discrimination.","output":"Understanding racial differences in attitudes about public health efforts during COVID-19 using an explanatory mixed methods design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), also called nsp12, is considered a promising but challenging drug target for inhibiting replication and hence, the growth of various RNA-viruses. In this report, a computational study is performed to offer insights on the binding of Remdesivir and Galidesivir with SARS-CoV2 RdRp with natural substrate, ATP, as the control. It was observed that Remdesivir and Galidesivir exhibited similar binding energies for their best docked poses, -6.6 kcal/mole and -6.2 kcal/mole, respectively. ATP also displayed comparative and strong binding free energy of -6.3 kcal/mole in the catalytic site of RdRp. However, their binding locations within the active site are distinct. Further, the interaction of catalytic site residues (Asp760, Asp761, and Asp618) with Remdesivir and Galidesivir is comprehensively examined. Conformational changes of RdRp and bound molecules are demonstrated using 100 ns explicit solvent simulation of the protein-ligand complex. Simulation suggests that Galidesivir binds at the non-catalytic location and its binding strength is relatively weaker than ATP and Remdesivir. Remdesivir also binds at the catalytic site and showed high potency to inhibit the function of RdRp. Binding of co-factor units nsp7 and nsp8 with RdRp (nsp12) complexed with Remdesivir and Galidesivir was also examined. MMPBSA binding energy for all three complexes has been computed across the 100 ns simulation trajectory. Overall, this study suggests, Remdesivir has anti-RdRp activity via binding at a catalytic site. In contrast, Galidesivir may not have direct anti-RdRp activity but it can induce a conformational change in the RNA polymerase.","output":"RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as a drug target for SARS-CoV2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The adverse effects of coronavirus infection on pregnant women and their infants are not apparent. The best strategies to deal with this disease is avoiding the infection and preventing its transmission. PURPOSE: the present study aimed to investigate the relationship between demographic factors and levels of self-care against coronavirus in pregnant women referred to maternity wards of Kerman, southeast Iran. METHOD: The present descriptive study was conducted on 200 pregnant women who referred to maternity wards in Kerman in 2020 and met the inclusion criteria. The required information was collected using demographic and obstetric questionnaires and a self-care checklist. FINDINGS: The mean age of the participants was 28.89  7.07. Iranian and Afghan citizens comprised 82 and 18% of the participants, respectively. The highest level of self-care measures against coronavirus in pregnant women was attributed to the use of face masks (74%), and the lowest was warning the personnel to wear masks (28%). There was a statistically significant relationship between the nationality of the participants and warning the personnel to wear facemasks (r = 0.183; p = 0.02), having a sick spouse (r=0.149;P = 0.039), and having a sick child (r = 0.191; p = 0.043), and between the husbands job and the patients demand for a private room (r = 0.173; p = 0.013). There was an inverse relationship between mothers age and warning the personnel about paying attention to their hygiene (r = -0.145; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that most pregnant women in the present study were active in self-care against coronavirus.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients admitted to our institution with confirmed COVID-19 status by PCR between March 1, 2020 and May 13, 2020 and selected those who underwent both D-dimer and venous duplex US. This cohort was divided into two groups, those with and without DVT based on duplex US. These groups were then compared to determine the value of D-dimer in establishing this diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 1170 patients were admitted with COVID-19, of which 158 were selected as our study. Of the 158, there were 52 patients with DVT and 106 without DVT. There were no differences in gender, age, race, or ethnicity between groups. Diabetes and routine hemodialysis were less commonly seen in the group with DVT. Over 90% of patients in both groups received prophylactic anticoagulation, but the use of LMWH or subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis was not predictive of DVT. All patients had elevated acute-phase D-dimer levels using conventional criteria, and 154/158 (97.5%) had elevated levels with age-adjusted criteria (mean D-dimer 16,163  5,395 ng/mL). Those with DVT had higher acute-phase D-dimer levels than those without DVT (median 13,602 [6,616-36,543 ng/mL] vs. 2,880 [1,030-9,126 ng/mL], p < 0.001). An optimal D-dimer cutoff of 6,494 ng/mL was determined to differentiate those with and without DVT (sensitivity 80.8%, specificity 68.9%, negative predictive value 88.0%). Wells DVT criteria was not found to be a significant predictor of DVT. Elevated D-dimer as defined by our optimal metric was a statistically significant predictor of DVT in both univariate and multivariable analyses when adjusting for other factors (OR 6.12, 95%CI [2.79-13.39], p <0.001).

After SARS-CoV-2 infection, cardio-pulmonary complications can occur and, before the resumption of sports competitions, a screening has been recommended. However, few data are available and discrepancies exist in the screening modalities. We conducted this prospective study to investigate the incidence of cardiovascular consequences following SARS-CoV-2 infection in young adult competitive athletes and the appropriate screening strategies for a safe return-to-play. METHODS: Ninety competitive athletes (24  10 years) after asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened by physical examination, blood testing, spirometry, 12-lead resting ECG, 24-h ambulatory ECG monitoring, echocardiogram, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). RESULTS: Sixty-four athletes (71.1%) were male, and most (76.7%) were mildly symptomatic. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, spirometry and resting ECG were normal in all athletes. Ambulatory ECG monitoring demonstrated <50/24 h supraventricular and ventricular premature beats in 53.3% and 52.2% of athletes, respectively, in the absence of malignant arrhythmias. CPET did not demonstrate cardiopulmonary limitations. Echocardiography showed pericardial effusion in 3 athletes (all females) with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (3.3%; 4.4% in the symptomatic group) with a definitive diagnosis of myopericarditis in 1 athlete (1.1%) and pericarditis in 2 athletes (2.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection were found in 3.3% of competitive athletes.

These organisms are proved to be important, both biotechnologically and economically considering their global presence. The marine ecosystem in India is less explored for the isolation of actinomycetes and several ecological niches are left unattended. Compared to the global scenario, the contribution from Indian researchers towards the isolation and exploitation of marine actinomycetes from the Indian sub-continent is noteworthy.

There are currently no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics for hantavirus-related diseases; however, it is evident that a robust neutralizing antibody response is critical for protection from severe disease. Although virologists first described this family of viruses in the 1950s, there is limited information on the neutralizing epitopes that exist on the hantavirus antigenic glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, and sites important for the design of effective therapeutics and vaccines. We provide a thorough summary of the hantavirus field from an immunological perspective. In particular, we discuss our current structural knowledge of antigenic proteins Gn and Gc, identification of B cell neutralizing epitopes, previously isolated monoclonal antibodies and their cross-reactivity between different hantavirus strains, and current developments toward vaccines and therapeutics. We conclude with some outstanding questions in the field and emphasize the need for additional studies of the human antibody response to hantavirus infection. IMPORTANCE Hantaviruses are pathogens that sometimes pass from animals to humans, and they are found in parts of Europe, Asia, and North and South America. When human infection occurs, these viruses can cause kidney or lung failure, and as many as 40% of infected people die. Currently, there are no vaccines or therapeutics for hantavirus-related diseases available. A first step in developing prevention measures is determining what type of immune response is protective. Increasingly it has become clear that the induction of a type of response called a neutralizing antibody response is critical for protection from severe disease.

The current analyses indicate a small but significant decrease in worry about climate change among the general public during this time interval, in particular among respondents born before 1980. However, the change in climate change worry did not correlate with worrying about becoming infected with COVID-19 yourself, or with family members being infected. Thus, the results do not indicate a mechanism of worrying about COVID-19 infections leading to a decrease in people's worry about climate change. The findings are discussed in relation to empirical evidence from other countries, where climate change risk perceptions have been monitored during the recent pandemic.

Forty papers were relevant following screening, which highlighted facilitators of WTR to include: availability of personal protective equipment (PPE)/vaccine, level of training, professional ethics, family and personal safety, and worker support systems. A number of barriers were reported to prevent WTR for HCWs, such as: concern and perceived risk, interpersonal factors, job-level factors, and outbreak characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: By comprehensively identifying the facilitators and barriers to HCWs WTR during infectious disease outbreaks and/or bioterrorist events, strategies can be identified and implemented to improve WTR and thus improve HCW and public safety.","output":"Factors Influencing Health Care Workers Willingness to Respond to Duty during Infectious Disease Outbreaks and Bioterrorist Events: An Integrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper evaluates Indias first officially approved self-administered rapid antigen test kit against COVID-19, a device called CoviSelf. The context is rural India. Rapid antigen tests (RATs) are currently popular in situations where vaccination rates are low, where sections of the community remain unvaccinated, where the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow and where easy or timely access to RTPCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) testing is not an option. Given that rural residents make up 66% of the Indian population, our evaluation focuses on the question of whether this self-administered RAT could help protect villagers and contain the Indian pandemic. CoviSelf has two components: the test and IT (information technology) parts. Using discourse analysis, a qualitative methodology, we evaluate the practicality of the kit on the basis of data in its instructional leaflet, reports about Indias digital divide and our published research on the constraints of daily life in Indian villages. This paper does not provide a scientific assessment of the effectiveness of CoviSelf in detecting infection. As social scientists, our contribution sits within the field of qualitative studies of medical and health problems. Self-administered RATs are cheap, quick and reasonably reliable. Hence, point-of-care testing at the doorsteps of villagers has much potential, but realising the benefits of innovative, diagnostic medical technologies requires a realistic understanding of the conditions in Indian villages and designing devices that work in rural situations. This paper forms part of a larger project regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in rural India.

Here we investigated whether Omicron escapes antibody neutralization in South Africans, either previously SARS-CoV-2 infected or uninfected, who were vaccinated with Pfizer BNT162b2. We also investigated if Omicron requires the ACE2 receptor to infect cells. We isolated and sequence confirmed live Omicron virus from an infected person in South Africa and compared plasma neutralization of this virus relative to an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain with the D614G mutation, observing that Omicron still required ACE2 to infect. For neutralization, blood samples were taken soon after vaccination, so that vaccine elicited neutralization was close to peak. Neutralization capacity of the D614G virus was much higher in infected and vaccinated versus vaccinated only participants but both groups had 22-fold Omicron escape from vaccine elicited neutralization. Previously infected and vaccinated individuals had residual neutralization predicted to confer 73% protection from symptomatic Omicron infection, while those without previous infection were predicted to retain only about 35%. Both groups were predicted to have substantial protection from severe disease. These data support the notion that high neutralization capacity elicited by a combination of infection and vaccination, and possibly boosting, could maintain reasonable effectiveness against Omicron. A waning neutralization response is likely to decrease vaccine effectiveness below these estimates. However, since protection from severe disease requires lower neutralization levels and involves T cell immunity, such protection may be maintained.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Omicron has extensive but incomplete escape of Pfizer BNT162b2 elicited neutralization and requires ACE2 for infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Emotion regulation deficits are an outcome and risk factor for both insomnia and depression, suggesting that maladaptive emotion regulation might in part explain the bi-directional links between sleep and depression. The current study tests this hypothesis during the COVID-19 pandemic in emerging adult undergraduate students, a high-risk population for both depression and sleep disturbance.Methods: A sample of 154 undergraduate students completed a series of online questionnaires bi-weekly on sleep, depression, and emotion regulation strategies across eight weeks during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2nd to June 27th, 2020).Results: Sleep disturbance and depression prospectively predicted one another across eight weeks, and both directions were mediated by maladaptive emotion regulation. However, sleep and depression failed to predict change in one another controlling for baseline measures, directly or via emotion regulation.Conclusions: The results suggest that maladaptive emotion regulation is a potential mechanism through which sleep disturbance and depression help maintain high levels of one another in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Safe and effective vaccines are thus urgently needed to reduce the significant morbidity and mortality of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease and ease the major economic impact. There has been an unprecedented rapid response by vaccine developers with now over one hundred vaccine candidates in development and at least six having reached clinical trials. However, a major challenge during rapid development is to avoid safety issues both by thoughtful vaccine design and by thorough evaluation in a timely manner. A syndrome of disease enhancement has been reported in the past for a few viral vaccines where those immunized suffered increased severity or death when they later encountered the virus or were found to have an increased frequency of infection. Animal models allowed scientists to determine the underlying mechanism for the former in the case of Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine and have been utilized to design and screen new RSV vaccine candidates. Because some Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS-CoV-1 vaccines have shown evidence of disease enhancement in some animal models, this is a particular concern for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. To address this challenge, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the Brighton Collaboration (BC) Safety Platform for Emergency vACcines (SPEAC) convened a scientific working meeting on March 12 and 13, 2020 of experts in the field of vaccine immunology and coronaviruses to consider what vaccine designs could reduce safety concerns and how animal models and immunological assessments in early clinical trials can help to assess the risk.

Using a novel technique based on the trade-off between annual horn growth and reproduction, we estimated the age of primiparity for 2274 female mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus (Blainville, 1816)) harvested across British Columbia, Canada, from 1976 to 2019. We then investigated spatio-temporal variation in the probability that harvested females were primiparous when aged 3, 4, or 5 years and older using Bayesian ordinal regressions. We found that the probability of primiparity at 3 years decreased over time in nearly all mountain ranges. In the Coastal Mountain range, however, the probability of primiparity at age 3 significantly increased. These results suggest that the large coastal populations of mountain goats could be more resilient to harvest than other populations in British Columbia, which may be experiencing environmental effects promoting later primiparity. Models predicting age of primiparity from annual growth measures are a valuable tool for wildlife management and could help conservation of many species.

METHODOLOGY We searched PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The studies were divided in two groups: randomized and observational studies, from 1990 to 2018 that included patients with severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation with pregnancy prolongation 48 h but that did not include fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome at the beginning. The main variables recorded were maternal and perinatal complications. MAIN RESULTS Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, and 5 of these were randomized. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no difference between groups. Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, RR = 0.71, 95% CI (0.54-0.93), p = .009. Perinatal complications were also significantly more common in observational studies (RR = 0.89, 95% CI (0.80-0.98), p = .01) at the expense of stillbirth and neonatal deaths. The percentages of cesarean sections were significantly higher in randomized studies, RR = 1.54, 95% CI (1.46-1.64). There were 2 maternal deaths, both in observational studies.

One type of those commonly emerging and re-emerging pathogens are coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2). Wild animals are hosts of different coronaviruses with the potential risk of cross-species transmission. However, little is known about the reservoir and host of coronaviruses in wild animals in Qinghai Province, where has the greatest biodiversity among the worlds high-altitude regions. Here, from the next-generation sequencing data, we obtained a known beta-coronavirus (beta-CoV) genome and a novel delta-coronavirus (delta-CoV) genome from faecal samples of 29 marmots, 50 rats and 25 birds in Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China in July 2019. According to the phylogenetic analysis, the beta-CoV shared high nucleotide identity with Coronavirus HKU24. Although the novel delta-CoV (MtCoV) was closely related to Sparrow deltacoronavirus ISU42824, the protein spike of the novel delta-CoV showed highest amino acid identity to Sparrow coronavirus HKU17 (73.1%). Interestingly, our results identified a novel host (Montifringilla taczanowskii) for the novel delta-CoV and the potential cross-species transmission. The most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of MtCoVs along with other closest members of the species of Coronavirus HKU15 was estimated to be 289 years ago.

Although previous studies have suggested that type I interferon (IFN-I) could inhibit the virus replication, the expression characteristics of IFN-I signaling-related miRNAs (ISR-miRNAs) during acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its relationship with receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG antibody response at the recovery phase remain unclear. METHODS: Expression profiles of 12 plasma ISR-miRNAs in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls were analyzed using RT-qPCR. The level of RBD-IgG antibody was determined using the competitive ELISA. Spearman correlation was done to measure the associations of plasma ISR-miRNAs with clinical characteristics during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and RBD-IgG antibody response at the recovery phase. RESULTS: Compared with the healthy controls, COVID-19 patients exhibited higher levels of miR-29b-3p (Z = 3.15, P = 0.002) and miR-1246 (Z = 4.98, P < 0.001). However, the expression of miR-186-5p and miR-15a-5p were significantly decreased. As the results shown, miR-30b-5p was negatively correlated with CD4 + T cell counts (r = ? 0.41, P = 0.027) and marginally positively correlated with fasting plasma glucose in COVID-19 patients (r = 0.37, P = 0.052). The competitive ELISA analysis showed the plasma level of miR-497-5p at the acute phase was positively correlated with RBD-IgG antibody response (r = 0.48, P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Our present results suggested that the expression level of ISR-miRNAs was not only associated with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection but also with RBD-IgG antibody response at the recovery phase of COVID-19. Future studies should be performed to explore the biological significance of ISR-miRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, cumulating data showed that gestational state is a risk factor for severe pneumonia, particularly due to the hyperinflammatory state. Recent reports suggested the efficacy of pulse corticosteroids in stopping the cytokine storm in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, but limited data exists regarding its use in pregnant women. Moreover, pregnancy termination is a treatment option in this population, but it has been reported mainly in the third trimester and rarely in the second trimester. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old woman infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 23 weeks of gestation presented with fatigue and dyspnea but soon deteriorated to severely acute respiratory failure and cytokine storm requiring mechanical ventilation combined with hemodialysis just one day after hospitalization. Low-dose corticosteroids and antibiotics were initiated, followed by antiviral therapy, anticoagulant and high-dose corticosteroid therapy. On hospital day 3, a decision to terminate her pregnancy was made; termination led to significant improvement in her clinical condition and a gradual decrease in demand for oxygen supplementation as well as the corticosteroid dose. She was discharged two weeks after admission. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the specific immune response, pregnant women with COVID-19 may differ from others in their clinical presentation, especially the probability of classic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

We chose to compare Denmark and Sweden because reliable data were available and because the two countries are similar but chose different responses to COVID-19: Denmark imposed a rather severe lockdown; Sweden did not. We make forecasts by age and sex to predict expected deaths if COVID-19 had not struck. Subtracting these forecasts from observed deaths gives the excess death count. Excess deaths were lower in Denmark than Sweden during the first wave of the pandemic. The later/earlier ratio we propose for shortcasting is easy to understand, requires less data than more elaborate approaches, and may be useful in many countries in making both predictions about the future and the past to study the impact on mortality of coronavirus and other epidemics. In the application to Denmark and Sweden, prediction intervals are narrower and bias is less than when forecasts are based on averages of the last 5 y, as is often done.

This study aimed to estimate prevalence, risk factors and outcome of hypokalemia in a cohort of non-critically ill patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 290 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection at the tertiary teaching hospital of Modena, Italy. Hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L) was detected in 119 patients (41%). The decrease of serum potassium level was of mild entity (3-3.4 mEq/L) and occurred in association with hypocalcemia (P=0.001) and lower level of serum magnesium (P=0.028) compared to normokaliemic patients. Urine K: creatinine ratio, measured in a small subset of patients (n=45; 36.1%), showed an increase of urinary potassium excretion in the majority of the cases (95.5%). Causes of kaliuria were diuretic therapy (53.4%) and corticosteroids (23.3%). In the remaining patients, urinary potassium loss was associated with normal serum magnesium, low sodium excretion (FENa< 1%) and metabolic alkalosis. Risk factors for hypokalemia were female gender (P=0.002; HR 0.41, 95%CI 0.23-0.73) and diuretic therapy (P=0.027; HR 1.94, 95%CI 1.08-3.48).

Hypokalemia is a frequent disorder in COVID-19 patients and urinary potassium loss may be the main cause of hypokalemia.

However since the COVID-19 pandemic, the same radiological appearance have become synonymous with COVID-19 pneumonia. We present a case of a patient who was mistakenly presumed to have COVID-19 and was later found to be a case of EVALI. Case Presentation: 33 year old obese Caucasian male with 15 pack year smoking history and no past medical history presented with one month of worsening exertional dyspnea associated with cough, sore throat, subjective chills, and diaphoresis. He was admitted to the COVID-19 unit due to hypoxemia requiring 3 L/min of oxygen and chest CT scan with contrast showing bilateral ground glass opacities with mosaic attenuation. COVID-19 reverse transcriptase RNA PCR test was negative twice. Labs showed leukocytosis of 12,700 with 74.4% neutrophils and 15.7% lymphocytes, normal procalcitonin of 0.09 ng/mL, and normal BNP of 83 pg/mL. Pulmonary was consulted and after detailed history was obtained, the patient reported vaping nicotine three weeks prior to admission. Respiratory viral panel, including influenza A and B, urine legionella and pneumococcal antigens were all negative. He underwent inpatient flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy with right upper lobe bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and right upper lobe transbronchial biopsy. BAL cell count showed 89% alveolar macrophages including numerous lipid laden macrophages and 6% eosinophils with transbronchial biopsy showing benign respiratory epithelium with unremarkable alveolated lung parenchyma. Diagnosis of EVALI was made, and patient clinically improved after starting on prednisone. He was discharged on steroid taper and will be followed in the pulmonary clinic with repeat CT imaging to check for resolution. Discussion: With the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic there is a bias in diagnosing all ground glass opacities on CT chest in the setting of hypoxemia as COVID-19 pneumonia. However, as per CDC guidelines, our patient met the criteria for EVALI with recent history of vaping within 90 days, typical radiological findings, and infectious causes ruled out. This diagnosis was made more robust by the findings of lipid laden macrophages on BAL. Our case emphasizes the importance of preventing anchoring bias during this COVID-19 pandemic by taking time to obtain a more thorough history and including other causes of lung injury, such as, EVALI in our differential diagnoses.","output":"Evali masquerading as COVID-19: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The goal of blood transfusion is to provide a safe, sufficient, and timely supply of blood components to the recipients by ensuring that donation is safe and no harm to the recipient.

A significant improvement was seen in the hematological profile (hemoglobin, red blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, and white blood cells) findings of the transfused individuals after blood unit transfusion (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The overall utilization rate and improvement status after transfusion were high even if the utilization rate has some limitations. The overall ratios of cross-match to transfusion ratio, transfusion probability, and transfusion index were 1.03, 99.8%, and 0.97, respectively.","output":"Assessment of Blood Transfusion Utilization and Patient Outcomes at Yekatit-12 Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a social context, customer participation in the innovation process is often accompanied by social exclusion situations, which are generally believed to have a negative impact on individuals.

systems worldwide, with the rapidly growing number of deaths and critical patients with pneumonia requiring ventilatory support Alternative methods to control the spread of the disease such as social isolation, extreme quarantine measures, and contact tracing have been used around the world However, these measures may not be totally effective to fight COVID-19, in step with the necessary national preparations to meet the new patient care demands A wide range of digital technologies can be used to enhance these public health strategies, and the pandemic has sparked increasing use of telehealth This field has grown considerably in Brazil in recent years Still, despite the intense proliferation of recommendations and rules, until the current pandemic the country still lacked a fully consolidated regulatory framework The emergence of COVID-19 marks a key moment in the expansion of applications and use of telehealth for improving the health system&#039;s response to the current

of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, it is unclear whether actual body weight (ABW) or ideal body weight (IBW) should be used. This study aims to explore whether UO calculation based on ABW might lead to overestimation of AKI. METHOD: AKI patients identified in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database by different components of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines and different definitions of body weight were retrospectively studied. Hospital and 90-day mortality were compared to decide whether different patient groups had the same outcome. RESULTS: In the cohort of 14,725 patients, AKI was identified in 4,298 (29.19%) and 3,060 (20.78%) patients respectively when ABW or IBW was used (P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that AKI patients identified by UO calculated from ABW had similar hospital and 90-day mortality to that of patients with no evidence of AKI. Whereas AKI patients identified by serum creatinine changes, or those identified by both ABW and IBW, had twice higher the risks of hospital death and about 1.5 times higher the risks of 90-day death compared with thoese with no evidence of AKI. Results were confirmed in two separate sensitivity analyses where patients whose admission creatinine levels were within the normal reference ranges and patients identified as sepsis were studied.

The compound 2-hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin (HPCD) has high cholesterol complexation capacity and is currently under clinical investigation for the NPC treatment. However, due to its short blood half-life, high doses are required to produce a therapeutic effect. In this work, stable polymerized HPCD is generated to investigate their in vitro mechanisms of action and in vivo effects. Crosslinked CDs (8-312 kDa) display a ninefold greater cholesterol complexation capacity than monomeric HPCD but are taken up to a lower extent, resulting in an overall comparable in vitro effect. In vivo, the 19.3 kDa HPCD exhibits a longer half-life than the monomeric HPCD but it does not increase the life span of Npc1 mice, possibly due to reduced brain penetration. This is circumvented by the application of magnetic resonance imaging-guided low intensity-pulsed focused ultrasound (MRIg-FUS), which increases the brain penetration of the CD. In conclusion, stable polymerized HPCDs can elucidate CDs' mechanism of action while the use of MRIg-FUS warrants further investigation, as it may be key to harnessing CDs full therapeutic potential in the NPC treatment.","output":"Investigating the Mechanism of Cyclodextrins in the Treatment of Niemann-Pick Disease Type C Using Crosslinked 2-Hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The unfolded protein response (UPR) is one of the pathways triggered to ensure quality control of the proteins assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when cell homeostasis is compromised. This mechanism is primarily composed of three transmembrane proteins serving as stress sensors: PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). These three proteins synergic action elicits translation and transcriptional downstream pathways, leading to less protein production and activating genes that encode important proteins in folding processes, including chaperones. Previous reports showed that viruses have evolved mechanisms to curtail or customize this UPR signaling for their own benefit. However, HIV infections effect on the UPR has scarcely been investigated. METHODS: This work investigated UPR modulation by HIV infection by assessing UPR-related protein expression under in vitro and in vivo conditions via Western blotting. Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs influence on this stress response was also considered. RESULTS: In in vitro and in vivo analyses, our results confirm that HIV infection activates stress-response components and that ARV therapy contributes to changes in the UPRs activation profile. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report showing UPR-related protein expression in HIV target cells derived directly from HIV-infected patients receiving different ARV therapies. Thus, two mechanisms may occur simultaneously: interference by HIV itself and the ARV drugs pharmacological effects as UPR activators. New evidence of how HIV modulates the UPR to enhance its own replication and secure infection success is also presented.

The evaluation is based on a survey designed and carried out in 2020. The issues concerning the scope of telematics systems utilization as well as the internal and external factors affecting their use are analysed. The methodology is based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The results are checked for robustness. Based on the results, it can be reasoned that as a result of the COVID19 pandemic, the companies started to use telematics systems more widely than they did before. Furthermore, the companies employing more people recognize the higher usefulness of telematics systems and are motivated to have the systems more than smaller enterprises;however, TAMs estimated separately for small and medium-sized enterprises did not reveal any significant differences in the parameter estimates.","output":"Technology Acceptance Model in Evaluation of Telematics Technologies Utilization in Road Transportation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data privacy is a trending topic in the internet era. Given such importance, many challenges emerged in order to collect, manage, process, and publish data. In this sense, personal data have got attention, and many regulations emerged, such as GDPR in the European Union and LGPD in Brazil. This regulation model aims to protect users' data from misusage and leakage and allow users to request an explanation from companies when needed. In pandemic situations, such as the COVID-19 and Ebola outbreak, the action related to sharing health data between different organizations is/ was crucial to develop a significant movement to avoid the massive infection and decrease the number of deaths. However, the data subject, i.e., the users, should have the right to request the purpose of data use, anonymization, and data deletion. In this sense, permissioned blockchain technology emerges to empower users to get their rights providing data ownership, transparency, and security through an immutable, unified, and distributed database ruled by smart contracts. The governance model discussed in blockchain applications is usually regarding the first layer governance, i.e., public and permissioned models. However, this discussion is too superficial, and they do not cover compliance with the data regulations. Therefore, in order to organize the relationship between data owners and the stakeholders, i.e., companies and governmental entities, we developed a second layer data governance model for permissioned blockchains based on the Governance Analytical Framework principles applied in pandemic situations preserving the users' privacy and their duties.

We analysed odontogenic cervicofacial infections (CFI) presenting to oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) departments during the first wave of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom. From 1 April 2020 until 31 July 2020 a database was used to prospectively collect records for all patients with CFI who presented to oral and maxillofacial teams. Information gathered included clinical presentation, location/origin of infection, and how this was managed. The OMFS units were asked to compare the patient's care with the treatment that would usually have been given prior to the crisis. A total of 32 OMFS units recorded 1381 cases of CFI in the UK. Most of the infections were referred via the emergency department (74%). Lower first or second molars were the most common origin, contributing 40% of CFI. Collaborators reported that patients' treatments were modified as a response to COVID in 20% of cases, the most frequently cited reason being the application of COVID-19 hospital policy (85%). The impact of the first wave of COVID modified the management of a significant number of patients presenting with CFI, and there was a proactive move to avoid general anaesthetics where possible. Some patients who presented to secondary care were given no treatment, suggesting they could have been managed in primary dental care if this had been available. We recommend that OMFS units and urgent dental care centres (UDCCs) build strong communication links not only to provide the best possible patient care, but to minimise COVID exposure and the strain on emergency departments during the pandemic.","output":"Management of odontogenic cervicofacial infections presenting to oral and maxillofacial units during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inferring the impact of climate upon the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been confounded by variability in testing, unknown disease introduction rates, and changing weather.

The objective of this review is to describe the current state of research for pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Study Design We conducted a search of international trial registries for trials relating to the novel coronavirus. The eligibility criteria for each trial were reviewed for inclusion/exclusion of pregnant women. Relevant data were extracted and descriptive statistics were calculated for individual and combined data. The total number of trials from each registry were compared, as well as the proportions of pregnancy-related trials within each. Results Among 621,370 trials in the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry, 927 (0.15%) were COVID-19 related. Of those, the majority (52%) explicitly excluded pregnancy or failed to address pregnancy at all (46%) and only 16 (1.7%) were pregnancy specific. When categorized by region, 688 (74.2%) of COVID-19 trials were in Asia, followed by 128 (13.8%) in Europe, and 66 (7.2%) in North America. Of the COVID-19 trials which included pregnant women, only three were randomized-controlled drug trials. Conclusion Approximately 1.7% of current COVID-19 research is pregnancy related and the majority of trials either explicitly exclude or fail to address pregnancy. Only three interventional trials worldwide involved pregnant women. The knowledge gap concerning the safety and efficacy of interventions for COVID-19 created by the exclusion of pregnant women may ultimately harm them. While ethical concerns about fetal exposure are often cited, it is in fact unethical to habitually exclude pregnant women from research.

This study aimed to examine the trends in the prevalence of non-medical methamphetamine use and to explore the flow pattern of internal migrant methamphetamine users in the mainland of China. METHODS: Data were extracted from the National Dynamic Management and Control Database for Drug Users (NDMCD). Joinpoint regressions were used to examine trends in the prevalence and population size of methamphetamine use. RESULTS: A total of 1,821,468 methamphetamine use cases registered in NDMCD from 2006 to 2015 were identified. The number of methamphetamine use cases presented an increasing trend in all age subgroups, and among them, the elderly increased the fastest [annual percent change (APC(2006?2015)), 122.9; 95% CI, 113.0C133.3; p < 0.001].

The regions of the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta, and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration absorbed over 96% of all internal migrant methamphetamine use cases, and the number of migrant methamphetamine use cases presented increased trends in these three regions. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing trends in methamphetamine use have become a threat to all age groups in China. Substance use prevention programs should focus on internal migrant drug users, especially in economically developed regions.","output":"Trends in Methamphetamine Use in the Mainland of China, 2006C2015"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corticosteroid is commonly used to reduce damage from inflammatory reactions in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aim to determine the outcomes of corticosteroid use in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Ninety six critically ill patients, hospitalized in 14 hospitals outside Wuhan from January 16 to March 30, 2020 were enrolled in this study. Among 96 critical patients, 68 were treated with corticosteroid (CS group), while 28 were not treated with corticosteroids (non-CS group). Multivariable logistic regression were performed to determine the possible correlation between corticosteroid use and the treatment outcomes. Forty-six (68%) patients in the CS group died compared to six (21%) of the non-CS group. Corticosteroid use was also associated with the development of ARDS, exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis, longer hospital stay and virus clearance time. On admission, no difference in laboratory findings between the CS and the non-CS group was observed. After corticosteroid treatment, patients treated with corticosteroids were associated with higher counts of white blood cells, neutrophils, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, alanine aminotransferase level and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. In conclusion, corticosteroid use in critically ill COVID-19 patients was associated with a much higher case fatality rate. Frequent incidence of liver injury and multi-organ failure in corticosteroid treated patients may have contributed to the adverse outcomes. The multi-organ failure is likely caused by more persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection and higher viral load, due to the inhibition of immune surveillance by corticosteroid.","output":"Adverse Outcomes Associated With Corticosteroid Use in Critical COVID-19: A Retrospective Multicenter Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed various spheres of health care. General practitioners (GPs) have widely replaced face-to-face consultations with telephone or video consultations (VCs) to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Using VCs for health service delivery is an entirely new way of practicing for many GPs. However, this transition process has largely been conducted with no formal guidelines, which may have caused implementation barriers. This study presents a rapid cycle coproduction approach for developing a guide to assist VC implementation in general practice. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to describe the developmental phases of the VC guide to assist general practices in implementing VCs and summarize the evaluation made by general practice users. METHODS: The development of a guide for VC in general practice was structured as a stepped process based on the coproduction and prototyping processes. We used an iterative framework based on rapid qualitative analyses and interdisciplinary collaborations. Thus, the guide was developed in small, repeated cycles of development, implementation, evaluation, and adaptation, with a continuous exchange between research and practice. The data collection process was structured in 3 main phases. First, we conducted a literature review, recorded observations, and held informal and semistructured interviews. Second, we facilitated coproduction with stakeholders through 4 workshops with GPs, a group interview with patient representatives, and individual revisions by GPs. Third, nationwide testing was conducted in 5 general practice clinics and was followed by an evaluation of the guide through interviews with GPs. RESULTS: A rapid cycle coproduction approach was used to explore the needs of general practice in connection with the implementation of VC and to develop useful, relevant, and easily understandable guiding materials. Our findings suggest that a guide for VCs should include advice and recommendations regarding the organization of VCs, the technical setup, the appropriate target groups, patients use of VCs, the performance of VCs, and the arrangements for booking a VC. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of coproduction, prototyping, small iterations, and rapid data analysis is a suitable approach when contextually rich, hands-on guide materials are urgently needed. Moreover, this method could provide an efficient way of developing relevant guide materials for general practice to aid the implementation of new technology beyond the pandemic period.","output":"Guidance for Implementing Video Consultations in Danish General Practice: Rapid Cycle Coproduction Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in December 2019 about 500,000 people died within the first 6 months The virus itself, as well as the related political decisions, intensified an increasing feeling of fear in billions of people worldwide However, while some people remained unperturbed, others experienced panic over the current situation In order to investigate individual differences in the perceptions, emotions and behaviors in response to the Coronavirus pandemic, an online survey was conducted between 6th and 27th of March 2020 Participants included 7309 individuals from 96 countries, who provided information on socio-demographics, personality, political orientation and general life satisfaction To determine the specificity of fear of Coronavirus, we also investigated fear related to two other current political issues: the refugee and the climate crises Overall, in parallel with the escalation of the pandemic, fear of Coronavirus increased significantly over the 22-day period, with the strongest predictors being the personality variable neuroticism, as well as education, sex and being an at-risk person A detailed longitudinal analysis of the largest sample, Germany, revealed that political orientation was also an important predictor of fear of Coronavirus Specifically, conservatives were more afraid of Coronavirus than liberals However, as the perceived threat of the virus increased, the influence of political orientation disappeared, whereas personality remained a stable predictor The pattern of results regarding the perceived threat of the refugee and climate crises painted a different picture: political orientation was by far the best predictor, more important even than personality Conservatives were more worried about the refugees, and liberals about climate change Cross-cultural analyses showed pronounced differences between countries, dependent on the crisis Nonetheless, the importance of personality for the prediction of fear of Coronavirus remained stable over time and across the world within the investigated 22-day period ?

CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS: Six patients with the diagnosis of ocular hypertension, glaucoma suspect, or glaucoma underwent standard automated perimetry (24-2 or 10-2 SITA, Humphrey Field Analyzer) while wearing ear-loop surgical face masks. Due to patient complaints of fogging during the testing, low test reliability, and unexpected results, the tests were repeated after taping securely the mask to the bridge of the nose. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Fogging may reduce visual field (VF) test reliability and induce artifacts that mimic glaucomatous defects. VF test reliability can be improved and artifacts minimized following mask taping. In 1 case there was worsening of VF defects after mask taping. This suggests that fogging may also disguise true VF defects. CONCLUSIONS: Fogging can result in unreliable VF testing with glaucoma-like artifacts.

Research methods: correlation analysis, valid and reliable psycho-diagnostic instruments. The research was conducted during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and made it possible to find out a number of regularities. Results. The development of mental exhaustion in athletes is determined by a different level of manifestation of personality traits and their correlation in the structure of personality: anxiety, self-esteem, the level of aspirations, locus of control and motivation for achieving success and avoiding failures. The study shows that significant differences between the level of aspirations and self-esteem in the men (r = .38**), high anxiety in the men and women correlating with the integral index of mental exhaustion (r = .28**;r = 36**) mostly contribute to mental strain in many athletes. It finds out that the events of their personal lives become a factor of mental exhaustion provided that external locus of control prevails. This trait is pronounced in the athletes C Masters of team sports (r = .34**). The research determines that a low level of mental exhaustion in the athletes engaged in team sports is a consequence of the significance of social support (r =-.38**). High requirements for demonstrating success cause mental strain for the male athletes that increases probability of their mental exhaustion. Conclusions.

Responses by governments in charge of public health, and all other involved organizations, have proved largely wanting. Data infrastructure and the information and communication systems needed to deal with the pandemic have likewise not been up to the task. Nevertheless, after a year of the worldwide outbreak, hope arises from this being the first major pandemic event in history where genomic and related biosciences - relying on biomedical informatics - have been essential in decoding the viral sequence data and producing the mRNA and other biotechnologies that unexpectedly rapidly have led to investigation, design, development, and testing of useful vaccines. Medical informatics may also help support public health actions and clinical interventions - but scalability and impact will depend on overcoming ingrained human shortcomings to deal with complex socio-economic, political, and technological disruptions together with the many ethical challenges presented by pandemics. OBJECTIVES: The principal goal is to review the history of biomedical information and healthcare practices related to past pandemics in order to illustrate just how exceptional and dependent on biomedical informatics are the recent scientific insights into human immune responses to viral infection, which are enabling rapid antiviral vaccine development and clinical management of severe cases - despite the many societal challenges ahead. METHODS: This paper briefly reviews some of the key historical antecedents leading up to modern insights into epidemic and pandemic processes with their biomedical and healthcare information intended to guide practitioners, agencies, and the lay public in today's ongoing pandemic events. CONCLUSIONS: Poor scientific understanding and excessively slow learning about infectious disease processes and mitigating behaviors have stymied effective treatment until the present time. Advances in insights about immune systems, genomes, proteomes, and all the other -omes, became a reality thanks to the key sequencing technologies and biomedical informatics that enabled the Human Genome Project, and only now, 20 years later, are having an impact in ameliorating devastating zoonotic infectious pandemics, including the present SARS-CoV-2 event through unprecedently rapid vaccine development. In the future these advances will hopefully also enable more targeted prevention and treatment of disease. However, past and present shortcomings of most of the COVID-19 pandemic responses illustrate just how difficult it is to persuade enough people - and especially political leaders - to adopt societally beneficial risk-avoidance behaviors and policies, even as these become better understood.","output":"Pandemics: Historically Slow \\"Learning Curve\\" Leading to Biomedical Informatics and Vaccine Breakthroughs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Visitor restriction policies have been implemented on many hospital units as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.

At the University of South Floridas Center for Advanced Medical Learning and Simulation (CAMLS) two different models of ATLS were delivered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic with both models utilizing the ACSs online mobile ATLS (mATLS). In this study three different models of ATLS delivered by USF CAMLS between 2019 and 2020 were compared to determine if there were any impacts on the education and functionality of the ATLS course between the three different models of ATLS: a baseline ATLS course, an augmented ATLS course that used mATLS, and an ATLS course that used mATLS as a replacement for in-person lectures. Material and methods To compare the three models of ATLS delivery, a total of six ATLS courses were studied: a baseline face-to-face ATLS course from June 2019, two Mobile ATLS (mATLS) courses from September 2020, and three augmented ATLS courses that contained both face-to-face and mATLS delivery from October, November and December 2020. The only differences between the traditional ATLS courses from 2020 and the pre-COVID ATLS course from 2019 were that the courses from 2020 utilized mATLS and that the course days were longer due to cleaning time. These courses were selected to have a non-significant difference in the number of learners in each model of ATLS course. The data that were collected from these courses included: post-test results from learners, learner feedback surveys, and interviews with the ATLS Course Director, ATLS Course Coordinator, and the Educational Coordinator. Results The only courses with significant differences in the post-test mean scores were for the baseline ATLS course compared to the mATLS courses. The augmented courses showed similar post-test performance to the mATLS courses. Students viewed the courses favorably with the only major complaint between the 2019 and the 2020 courses being a high amount of downtime for the 2020 courses due to time required to disinfect skill stations and equipment. The main difficulties for the ATLS Course Director, ATLS Course Coordinator, and the Educational Coordinator with the ATLS courses in 2020 were concerned with challenges from COVID-19, like social distancing, and not with mATLS or the shortened instruction time with the hybrid model.

The core problem being addressed by these policies can be succinctly stated as the problem of identifying high-quality learnt clauses. These clauses, when shared between the worker nodes of parallel solvers, should lead to better performance. The term high-quality clauses is often defined in terms of metrics that solver designers have identified over years of empirical study. Some of the more well-known metrics to identify high-quality clauses for sharing include clause length, literal block distance (LBD), and clause usage in propagation. In this paper, we propose a new metric aimed at identifying high-quality learnt clauses and a concomitant clause-sharing policy based on a combination of LBD and community structure of Boolean formulas. The concept of community structure has been proposed as a possible explanation for the extraordinary performance of SAT solvers in industrial instances. Hence, it is a natural candidate as a basis for a metric to identify high-quality clauses. To be more precise, our metric identifies clauses that have low LBD and low community number as ones that are high-quality for applications such as verification and testing. The community number of a clause C measures the number of different communities of a formula that the variables in C span. We perform extensive empirical analysis of our metric and clause-sharing policy, and show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on the benchmark from the parallel track of the last four SAT competitions.","output":"Community and LBD-Based Clause Sharing Policy for Parallel SAT Solving"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a theory of Keynesian supply shocks: supply shocks that trigger changes in aggregate demand larger than the shocks themselves.

We show that this is a general result that extend to economies with incomplete markets and liquidity constrained consumers. In economies with multiple sectors Keynesian supply shocks are possible, under some conditions. A 50% shock that hits all sectors is not the same as a 100% shock that hits half the economy. Incomplete markets make the conditions for Keynesian supply shocks more likely to be met. Firm exit and job destruction can amplify the initial effect, aggravating the recession. We discuss the effects of various policies. Standard fiscal stimulus can be less effective than usual because the fact that some sectors are shut down mutes the Keynesian multiplier feedback. Monetary policy, as long as it is unimpeded by the zero lower bound, can have magnified effects, by preventing firm exits.

Patients with intracranial procedures, malignancy, or vascular malformation were excluded. We used regression models to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (OR, 95% CI) of the association between ICH and covariates. We also used regression models to determine association between ICH and mortality. Among 3824 patients admitted with COVID-19, 755 patients had neuroimaging and 416 patients were identified after exclusion criteria were applied. The mean (standard deviation) age was 69.3 (16.2), 35.8% were women, and 34.9% were on therapeutic anticoagulation. ICH occurred in 33 (7.9%) patients. Older age, non-Caucasian race, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and therapeutic anticoagulation were associated with ICH on univariate analysis (p < 0.01 for each variable).

We formulate a multi-objective multi-period non-linear resource allocation model for this problem with the objectives of minimizing the number of infected health workers, the number of infected patients and minimizing a deprivation cost function defined over shortages. We solve the resulting problem using the -constraint algorithm so as to obtain the exact Pareto set. We also develop a customized genetic algorithm to obtain an approximate Pareto frontier in reasonable time for larger instances. We provide a comparative analysis of the exact and heuristic methods under various scenarios and give insights on how the suggested allocations outperform the ones obtained through a set of rule-of-thumb policies, policies that are implemented owing to their simplicity and ease-of-implementation. Our comparative analysis shows that as the circumstances get worse, the trade-off between the deprivation cost and the ratio of infections deepens and that the proposed heuristic algorithm gives very close solutions to the exact Pareto frontier, especially under pessimistic scenarios. We also observed that while some rule-of-thumb policies such as a last-in-first-receives type policy work well in terms of deprivation costs in optimistic scenarios, others like split policies perform well in terms of number of infections under neutral or pessimistic settings. While favoring one of the objectives, these policies typically fail to provide good solutions in terms of the other objective;hence if such policies are to be implemented the choice would depend on the problem characteristics and the priorities of the policy makers. Overall, the solutions obtained by the proposed methods imply that more complicated distribution schemes that are not induced by these policies would be needed for best results.","output":"Fair allocation of personal protective equipment to health centers during early phases of a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, a global pandemic has been observed, caused by the emergence of a new coronavirus, SARS CoV-2.

To date, there is no measure to treat or prevent SARS CoV-2 infection. Additionally, as gut microbiota composition is altered in patients with COVID-19, alternative therapies using probiotics can be considered to fight SARS CoV-2 infection.

In addition, these bacteria generate metabolites such as butyrate, desaminotyrosine, and secondary bile acid, suggested to prevent viral respiratory infections. Gut microbial metabolites transported via the circulation to the lungs could inhibit viral replication or improve the immune response against viruses. The use of probiotics and/or their metabolites may target either the virus itself and/or the immunologic process.

We assessed the response to the COVID-19 pandemic by pharmacies in Kenya, aiming to identify strategies for maximising their contribution to the national response. Methods: We conducted a prospective mixed-methods study, consisting of a questionnaire survey (n=195), a simulated client survey (n=103), and in-depth interviews (n=18). Data collection started approximately seven months after the pandemic reached Kenya. Quantitative data were summarized using measures of central tendency and multivariable modelling done using logistic regression. Qualitative analysis followed a thematic approach. Results: The initial weeks of the pandemic were characterized by fear and panic among service providers and a surge in client flow. Subsequently, 61% of pharmacies experienced a dip in demand to below pre-pandemic levels and 31% reported challenges with unavailability, high price, and poor-quality of products. Almost all pharmacies were actively providing preventive materials and therapies; educating clients on prevention measures; counselling anxious clients; and handling and referring suspect cases. Fifty-nine pharmacies (55% [95% CI 45-65%]) reported ever receiving a client asking for COVID-19 testing and a similar proportion supported pharmacy-based testing. For treatment, most pharmacies (71%) recommended alternative therapies and nutritional supplements such as vitamin C; only 27% recommended conventional therapies such as antibiotics. While 48% had at least one staff member trained on COVID-19, a general feeling of disconnection from the national program prevailed. Conclusions: Private pharmacies in Kenya were actively contributing to the COVID-19 response, but more deliberate engagement, support and linkages are required. Notably, there is an urgent need to develop guidelines for pharmacy-based COVID-19 testing, a service that is clearly needed and which could greatly increase test coverage.

Some VACV strains have been extensively used to develop vaccine candidates against various diseases. Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is a VACV vaccine strain that offers several advantages for the development of recombinant vaccine candidates. In addition to various host-restriction genes, MVA lacks several immunomodulatory genes of which some have proven to be quite efficient in skewing the immune response in an unfavorable way to control infection in the host. Studies to manipulate these genes aim to optimize the immunogenicity and safety of MVA-based viral vector vaccine candidates.

The use of convalescent-phase human plasma is an effective treatment in humans infected with arenaviruses, particularly species found in South America. Despite this, little work has focused on developing potent and defined immunotherapeutics against arenaviruses. In the present study, we produced arenavirus neutralizing antibodies by DNA vaccination of rabbits with plasmids encoding the full-length glycoprotein precursors of Junn virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MACV), and Guanarito virus (GTOV). Geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers, as measured by the 50% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT(50)), exceeded 5,000 against homologous viruses. Antisera against each targeted virus exhibited limited cross-species binding and, to a lesser extent, cross-neutralization. Anti-JUNV glycoprotein rabbit antiserum protected Hartley guinea pigs from lethal intraperitoneal infection with JUNV strain Romero when the antiserum was administered 2 days after challenge and provided some protection (30%) when administered 4 days after challenge. Treatment starting on day 6 did not protect animals. We further formulated an IgG antibody cocktail by combining anti-JUNV, -MACV, and -GTOV antibodies produced in DNA-vaccinated rabbits. This cocktail protected 100% of guinea pigs against JUNV and GTOV lethal disease. We then expanded on this cocktail approach by simultaneously vaccinating rabbits with a combination of plasmids encoding glycoproteins from JUNV, MACV, GTOV, and Sabia virus (SABV). Sera collected from rabbits vaccinated with the combination vaccine neutralized all four targets. These findings support the concept of using a DNA vaccine approach to generate a potent pan-arenavirus immunotherapeutic. IMPORTANCE Arenaviruses are an important family of emerging viruses. In infected humans, convalescent-phase plasma containing neutralizing antibodies can mitigate the severity of disease caused by arenaviruses, particularly species found in South America. Because of variations in potency of the human-derived product, limited availability, and safety concerns, this treatment option has essentially been abandoned. Accordingly, despite this approach being an effective postinfection treatment option, research on novel approaches to produce potent polyclonal antibody-based therapies have been deficient. Here we show that DNA-based vaccine technology can be used to make potently neutralizing antibodies in rabbits that exclusively target the glycoproteins of several human-pathogenic arenaviruses found in South America, including JUNV, MACV, GTOV, and SABV. These antibodies protected guinea pigs from lethal disease when given post-virus challenge. We also generated a purified antibody cocktail with antibodies targeting three arenaviruses and demonstrated protective efficacy against all three targets. Our findings demonstrate that use of the DNA vaccine technology could be used to produce candidate antiarenavirus neutralizing antibody-based products.","output":"Glycoprotein-Specific Antibodies Produced by DNA Vaccination Protect Guinea Pigs from Lethal Argentine and Venezuelan Hemorrhagic Fever."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emotion, as an essential element in communication, is becoming increasingly important and influential in the era of social media.

In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic required a sudden change in healthcare delivery from in-person to telehealth visits. We aimed to evaluate use of telehealth by YAs with T1D during this time and assess characteristics associated with telehealth usage. Method: Frequency of telehealth visits from 3/16/2020 to 9/30/2020 was compared with in-person visits during the same calendar period before COVID-19 (3/16/2019 to 9/30/2020) in a sample of YAs with T1D seen by pediatric and adult diabetes clinicians. The Electronic Health Record provided demographic and clinical data for YAs aged 18-30 with a pre-pandemic A1c. Descriptive statistics and t-tests compared data before and during COVID-19. Results: Pre-COVID-19, there were 1177 YAs (50% male) with meanSD age 24.43.4 years, T1D duration 12.85.9 years, and A1c 8.11.6%;46% were pump-treated, 55% used CGM, and 91% had private insurance. In 2019, there were 2961 visits;in 2020, there were 2701 visits. For the two 6-month periods, the mean number of visits per YA declined significantly, from 2.52.5 in 2019 to 2.33.1 in 2020 (p=.02). Further, 20% (n=240) of YAs had no visits during the pandemic period. YAs with an A1c <7% pre-pandemic (21%, n=247) had fewer visits during the pandemic than before the pandemic (1.62.7 vs. 2.22.7, p=.001).

Wavelet-MRP maps yield a clear depiction of hypervascular tumor regions, as recently shown. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to elucidate a possible connection of the wavelet-MRP power spectrum in glioblastoma (GBM) with local vascularity and cell proliferation. METHODS For this IRB-approved study 12 patients (63.0+/-14.9y; 7m) with histologically confirmed IDH-wildtype GBM were included. Target regions for biopsies were prospectively marked on tumor regions as seen on preoperative 3T MRI. During subsequent neurosurgical tumor resection 43 targeted biopsies were taken from these target regions, of which all 27 matching samples were analyzed. All specimens were immunohistochemically analyzed for endothelial cell marker CD31 and proliferation marker Ki67 and correlated to the wavelet-MRP power spectrum as derived from DSC perfusion weighted imaging. RESULTS There was a strong correlation between wavelet-MRP power spectrum (median = 4.41) and conventional relative cerebral blood volume (median = 5.97 ml/100g) in Spearman's rank-order correlation ( = .83, p < .05). In a logistic regression model, the wavelet-MRP power spectrum showed a significant correlation to CD31 dichotomized to no or present staining (p = .04), while rCBV did not show a significant correlation to CD31 (p = .30).

METHODS: We distributed an electronic survey to members of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, Regional Anaesthesia-UK, and the European Society of Regional Anaesthesia & Pain Therapy. A questionnaire consisting of 19 questions was developed by a panel of experienced regional anesthesiologists and distributed by email to the participants. The survey covered the following domains: participant information, practice settings, preference for the type of anesthetic technique, the use of personal protective equipment, and oxygen therapy. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 729 participants from 73 different countries, with a response rate of 20.1% (729/3,630) for the number of emails opened and 8.5% (729/8,572) for the number of emails sent. Most respondents (87.7%) identified as anesthesia staff (faculty or consultant) and practiced obstetric and non-obstetric anesthesia (55.3%). The practice of regional anesthesia either expanded or remained the same, with only 2% of respondents decreasing their use compared with the pre-pandemic period. The top reasons for an increase in the use of regional anesthesia was to reduce the need for an aerosol-generating medical procedure and to reduce the risk of possible complications to patients. The most common reason for decreased use of regional anesthesia was the risk of urgent conversion to general anesthesia. Approximately 70% of the responders used airborne precautions when providing care to a patient under regional anesthesia. The most common oxygen delivery method was nasal prongs (cannula) with a surgical mask layered over it (61%). CONCLUSIONS: Given the perceived benefits of regional over general anesthesia, approximately half of the members of three regional anesthesia societies seem to have expanded their use of regional anesthesia techniques during the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, its early detection is critical in prevention, diagnostic, and management efforts of COVID-19 patients. Loss of taste and smell is one of the early symptoms reported in these patients and the virus is abundantly found in the salivary secretion of the infected symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Infection and inflammation of salivary glands are common among viral infections, particularly in the early stages, which lead to salivary composition changes. Chemosensory sensation of taste is critically dependent on the salivary flow rate and its inorganic constituents, protein levels, specific 3,5-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and 3,5-cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels, ghrelins, pH levels, and enzymes.

Methods: The correspondence between COVID-19 and XCHD was analyzed by literature consulting. Based on network pharmacology, Cytoscape 3.6.0 and other software were then used to construct XCHD efficacy network of Chinese medicine prescription-active ingredient-key target for pneumonia and immune regulation, in order to confirm anti-SARS-CoV-2 active ingredients in the prescription. Some softwares were used to analyze XCHD for COVID-19 treatment in multiple aspects. Results: A total of 48 active ingredients with potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect in herbs were collected; 140 active ingredients in XCHD for pneumonia treatment and immune regulation were analyzed, of which 12 ingredients had direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity including baicalein, formononetin, quercetin, etc. The active ingredients in XCHD exerted efficacy for pneumonia treatment and immunoregulation through 95 key targets such as IL-6, NOS2, and ESR1, involving multiple pathways such as the TNF signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, and influenza A. Analysis of gene co-expression and PPI interaction analysis found that ACE2 only co-expressed with NOS2 in the above targets, and also interacted with only five targets in the PPI interaction network. It is speculated that the ACE2 target only plays an important role when SARS-CoV-2 invaded the human body, and had little effect in the treatment of pneumonia after viral infection. Conclusion: The active ingredients in XCHD play a role in treating COVID-19 by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 activity, blocking the SARS-CoV-2 invasion pathway, inhibiting cytokine storm, and regulating immunity. It is worth noting that drugs designed for the ACE2 target can block virus invasion, but may not be effective for diseases such as alveolar inflammation, Therefore, this study also provides a multi-target and multi-directional space for XCHD for early COVID-19 treatment. In addition, when XCHD is used in the early treatment of COVID-19, we should pay attention to the precise use of drugs based on syndrome accurate identification, one is to avoid adverse reactions, the other is to avoid cytokine damage caused by re-crown disease.","output":"Network pharmacological analysis and mechanism prediction of Xiaochaihu Decoction in treatment of COVID-19 with syndrome of pathogenic heat lingering in lung and obstructive cardinalate/ С͹״ףCOVID-19аΡ֤ЧԤ"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of biomedical image analysis challenges organized per year is steadily increasing.

With 1.6 million Americans suffering from IBD and global prevalence on the rise, there is a critical unmet need in the use of anti-TNF therapies: a test for the likelihood of therapy response. Here, as a proof-of-concept, we present a multi-mRNA signature for predicting response to anti-TNF treatment to improve the efficacy and cost-to-benefit ratio of these biologics. Methods: We surveyed public data repositories and curated four transcriptomic datasets (n = 136) from colonic and ileal mucosal biopsies of IBD patients (pretreatment) who were subjected to anti-TNF therapy and subsequently adjudicated for response. We applied a multicohort analysis with a leave-one-study-out (LOSO) approach, MetaIntegrator, to identify significant differentially expressed (DE) genes between responders and non-responders and then used a greedy forward search to identify a parsimonious gene signature. We then calculated an anti-TNF response (ATR) score based on this parsimonious gene signature to predict responder status and assessed discriminatory performance via an area-under-receiver operating-characteristic curve (AUROC). Results: We identified 324 significant DE genes between responders and non-responders. The greedy forward search yielded seven genes that robustly distinguish anti-TNF responders from non-responders, with an AUROC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.70C1).

The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the lockdown secondary to the pandemic on patient numbers and pattern of injuries at the department of traumatology of the Medical University of Vienna. METHODS: This retrospective, descriptive study identified all patients admitted and enrolled onto the trauma registry at a level I trauma center, between 15 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 (lockdown) and compared them to those between 15 March 2019 and 30 April 2019 (baseline). Variables collected included patient age, sex, reason for hospital admission, place of injury, death, injury severity score (ISS), as well as American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score. RESULTS: A total of 10,938 patient visits to the trauma emergency department were analyzed, 8353 presentations during the baseline period and 2585 during lockdown. Only 1869 acutely injured and 716 follow-up patients presented during lockdown, compared to 6178 and 2175, respectively, during baseline. Throughout the COVID-19 lockdown there were significant reductions in both workplace and traffic accidents, sports injuries, number of hospitalized patients, and overall visits to the trauma emergency department; however, the number of major traumas and hip fractures remained similar. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the frequency of injuries at home as well as hospital admissions due to attempted suicide. CONCLUSION: Despite the reduction in total number of patients, trauma departments should continue to provide adequate service during lockdown considering that severe injuries showed no change. Conditions such as breakdown of social networks and limited access to mental health care and support might account for the significant rise in hospital admissions due to suicides.

Despite many efforts, very little progress has been made regarding finding low-cost oral medicines that can be made widely available worldwide to address the global pandemic. Methods We sought to examine if a triple combination of nitazoxanide (using its active metabolite tizoxanide), ribavirin, and hydroxychloroquine would lead to a multiplicative effects on viral replication of SARS-COV-2 resulting in a significant reduction of virus yield using VERO E6 cells as a model of viral replication. Results Virus yield measured in PFU/ml was ~ 2 logs lower with triple combination versus either drug alone, resulting in the prolongation of time to peak cytopathic effects (CPE). The time to produce 50% CPE increased from 2.8 days for viral controls versus 5.3 days for triple combination therapy. Finally, for each 1-log reduction in virus yield 24 hours post-infection, there was an additional 0.7-day delay in onset of CPE.

Thus, this article's objective was to describe the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in indigenous communities in Brazil. METHODS: This descriptive observational study was carried out in indigenous communities in the municipality of Amatur (Amazonas, Brazil). Individuals from the Alto Rio Solim?es Special Indigenous Sanitary District (DSEI) who met the Sars-Cov-2 infection case definitions during the period between January and August 2020 were included. For case notification, the definitions adopted by the Ministry of Health of Brazil and by the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health were considered. RESULTS: Out of the entire population served by the Alto Rio Solim?es DSEI (n = 2890), 109 indigenous people were suspected of having been infected with Sars-Cov-R during the study period; a total of 89 cases were actually confirmed (rate: 3.08 cases/100,000 inhabitants). Most patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were female (56.2%), with a mean age of 32.4 ( 23.6) years. Predominant symptoms were fever (76.4%), dry cough (64%), and headache (60.7%). Complications occurred in 7.9% of the patients; no deaths were reported.

Objectives: This study was designed to test the hypothesis of persistent endothelial dysfunction and that RBCs act as mediators of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19. Methods and results: COVID-19 patients displayed profound endothelial dysfunction in vivo assessed with pulse amplitude tonometry, both in the acute phase and at follow-up four months later. RBCs but not plasma from COVID-19 patients in the acute phase incubated with healthy rat aorta induced severe endothelial dysfunction ex vivo compared to RBCs from healthy subjects. Further, these RBCs induced vascular arginase 1 and oxidative stress. Consequently, inhibition of vascular arginase or superoxide attenuated endothelial dysfunction induced by RBCs from COVID-19 patients. These RBCs were characterized by increased production of reactive oxygen species and reduced export of the nitric oxide metabolite nitrate. RBCs from COVID-19 patients at follow-up did not affect vascular function.

The Copenhagen EMS operates two telephone line the 1-1-2 emergency number and the 1813 medical helpline. A separate coronavirus support track was implemented on the 1813 medical helpline and a web-based self-triage (web triage) system was created to reduce non-emergency call volume. The aim of this paper is to present call volume and the two measures implemented to handle the increased call volume to the Copenhagen EMS.MethodsThis is a cross sectional observational study. Call volume and queue time is presented in the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic (27th of February 2020 to 27th of march) and compared to the equivalent month from the year before (2019). Descriptive statistics are conducted on call volumes and queue times and spearman's rank correlation test are performed to test correlation between web triage and call volume.ResultsTotal EMS call volume increase by 23.3% between 2019 and 2020 (92.670 vs. 114,250). The 1-1-2 emergency line total call volume increase by 4.4% (8,4942 vs. 8,870) and the 1813 medical helpline increased by 25.1% (84.176 vs. 105.380). The coronavirus support track handled 21,063 calls. The 1813 medical helpline queue time was a mean of 02 minutes and 23 seconds (CI: 2.22-2.25) in 2019 and 12 minutes and 2 seconds (CI 11:55-12:09) in 2020 (P < 0.001). The web triage was used 10,894 times. No correlation between call volume and web triage usage was seen.ConclusionsIn the first month of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic a significant increase in call volume was observed in the 1813 medical helpline compared to 2019. A large number of calls were handled by the additional coronavirus track and diverted away from the regular tracks of the 1813 medical helpline. This likely contributed to mitigating increased call volumes and queue times. The web triage was widely used but no significant correlation was seen with 1813 medical helpline call volume.

All the patients underwent chest X-ray and echocardiography. The findings obtained from 25 abdominal radiographs, 24 abdominal US, 7 abdominal CT, 16 thorax CT, 21 cranial MRI and one spinal MRI, MR cholangiography (MRCP) and cardiac MRI examinations were categorized and evaluated according to the affected systems. RESULTS: While the most common findings in chest X-ray were perihilar opacity and peribronchial thickening, pleural effusion was the most finding in thorax CT. Echocardiography findings of myocarditis were observed in 31% of the cases. The most common findings in abdominal radiological evaluation were hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, edema in the gallbladder wall and periportal area, mesenteric lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant, thickening of the intestinal walls, and free fluid. Reversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES) was the most common neurological finding. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like lesions, acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalomyelitis, and radiological findings consistent with Guillain-Barr syndrome were found in one case each.

Clinical, laboratory and radiographic parameters were compared between groups. RESULTS CD was the most common aetiology (35.3%), followed by neoplasia (30.7%), pyothorax (8.8%), FIP (8.5%), chylothorax (4.6%) and miscellaneous diseases (3.7%). In 26 (8.5%) cats, more than one underlying disease was diagnosed as a possible aetiology for pleural effusion. Cats with FIP were significantly younger than those with CD ( P <0.001) and neoplasia ( P <0.001). Cats with CD were presented with a significantly lower body temperature compared with cats with FIP ( P = 0.022). Cats with CD had significantly higher serum alanine aminotransferase activity compared with all other cats (FIP and pyothorax, P <0.001; neoplasia and chylothorax, P = 0.02) and serum alkaline phosphatase activity compared with the pyothorax ( P <0.001) and FIP groups ( P = 0.04), and significantly lower protein concentrations (FIP, pyothorax and neoplasia, P <0.001; chylothorax, P = 0.04 ) and nucleated cell counts in the effusion than all other groups (pyothorax and neoplasia, P <0.001; chylothorax, P = 0.02; FIP, P = 0.04).The glucose level in the effusion of cats with pyothorax was significantly lower than glucose levels in patients with CD, neoplasia and chylothorax ( P <0.001).

METHODS: Data for the retrospective cohort study were collected from a large UK tertiary maternity unit over a 4-week period using computerised hospital records. Literature searches were performed across multiple repositories. COVID-19 prevalence was extracted from online repositories. RESULTS: Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from 457/465 (98%) women during the study period. The median turnaround time for results was 5.3 h (interquartile range (IQR) 2.6-8.9 h), with 92% of the results returned within 24 h. In our cohort, only one woman tested positive, giving a screen positive rate of 0.22% (1/457; 95% CI: 0.04-1.23%). One woman who tested negative developed a fever postnatally following discharge but was lost to follow-up. From our literature review, we did not find any correlation between asymptomatic carriage in pregnant women and the reported regional prevalence of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Testing using the SAMBA-II machine was acceptable to the vast majority of pregnant women requiring admission and had a low turnaround time. Asymptomatic carriage is low, but not correlated to community prevalence rates. Screening pregnant women on admission will remain an important component in order to minimise nosocomial infection.","output":"Samba II PCR testing for COVID-19 in pregnant women: a retrospective cohort study and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in large-scale healthcare restrictions to control viral spread, reducing operating room censuses to include only medically necessary surgeries. The impact of restrictions on which patients undergo surgical procedures and their perioperative outcomes is less understood. METHODS: Adult patients who underwent medically necessary surgical procedures at our institution during a restricted operative period due to the COVID-19 pandemic (March 23-April 24, 2020) were compared to patients undergoing procedures during a similar time period in the pre-COVID-19 era (March 25-April 26, 2019). Cardinal matching and differences in means were utilized to analyze perioperative outcomes. RESULTS: 857 patients had surgery in 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and 212 patients had surgery in 2020 (COVID-19). The COVID-19 era cohort had a higher proportion of patients who were male (61.3% vs. 44.5%, P < 0.0001), were White (83.5% vs. 68.7%, P < 0.001), had private insurance (62.7% vs. 54.3%, p 0.05), were ASA classification 4 (10.9% vs. 3%, P < 0.0001), and underwent oncologic procedures (69.3% vs. 42.7%, P < 0.0001). Following 1:1 cardinal matching, COVID-19 era patients (N = 157) had a decreased likelihood of discharge to a nursing facility (risk difference-8.3, P < 0.0001) and shorter median length of stay (risk difference-0.6, p 0.04) compared to pre-COVID-19 era patients. There was no difference between the two patient cohorts in overall morbidity and 30-day readmission. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 restrictions on surgical operations were associated with a change in the racial and insurance demographics in patients undergoing medically necessary surgical procedures but were not associated with worse postoperative morbidity.

The aim of this study is to assess the Health-related Quality of Life of COVID-19 survivors and to ascertain which factors are related to worse results. Methods: An observational, cross-sectional study has been performed, using, a telephone survey that was administered to all patients with COVID-19 from the first pandemic wave in our healthcare area ten months after the acute infection. Patients with dementia and nursing home residents were excluded. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the EQ-5D instrument and its indices EQ-VAS and EQ-Health Index. Results: 443 answers were collected. Mean age was 5416 and 38.4% of patients were male. The most affected domain was anxiety/depression (23.9% of patients) and mobility (16.5%). Mean global EQ-VAS score was 75.818.7, and mean EQ-Health Index was 0.8840.174. Both VAS and Health Index scores were lower in females, patients older than 65 years, patients with comorbidities, and those who needed hospital admission during the acute infection. VAS scores in our sample were lower than in the general Spanish population, but similar to the scores in our region prior to the pandemic. Female sex, hospital admission, and a lower educational status were independently associated to lower EQ-Health Index scoring. Conclusion: while health self-perception is affected after COVID-19, this might not be directly related to the infection.

HCV-371 displayed broad inhibitory activities against the NS5B RdRp enzyme, with 50% inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 1.8 microM for 90% of the isolates derived from HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, and 3a. HCV-371 showed no inhibitory activity against a panel of human polymerases, including mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, and other unrelated viral polymerases, demonstrating its specificity for the HCV polymerase. A single administration of HCV-371 to cells containing the HCV subgenomic replicon for 3 days resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the steady-state levels of viral RNA and protein. Multiple treatments with HCV-371 for 16 days led to a >3-log10 reduction in the HCV RNA level. In comparison, multiple treatments with a similar inhibitory dose of alpha interferon resulted in a 2-log10 reduction of the viral RNA level. In addition, treatment of cells with a combination of HCV-371 and pegylated alpha interferon resulted in an additive antiviral activity. Within the effective antiviral concentrations of HCV-371, there was no effect on cell viability and metabolism. The intracellular antiviral specificity of HCV-371 was demonstrated by its lack of activity in cells infected with several DNA or RNA viruses.

The potency and stability of the national candidate standard (CS) were determined by collaborative calibration, and accelerated and freeze-thaw degradation studies. Moreover, a suitability study of the CS was performed. Eight laboratories in mainland China were asked to detect antigen content of CS using a common validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit established by NIFDC and in-house kits in the collaborative study. Six laboratories returned valid results, which established that the antigen content of the CS was 876,938 YU/mL, with good agreement across laboratories. In the suitability study, the CS exhibited excellent parallelism and a linear relationship with four samples produced by different expression systems and target proteins. In addition, good stability in the accelerated and freeze-thaw degradation study was observed.

We included studies presenting measurements (regardless of primary/secondary/tertiary/safety outcomes) for any fracture in both NOAC and warfarin users. Two or more reviewers independently screened relevant articles, extracted data, and performed quality assessments. Data were retrieved to synthesize the pooled relative risk (RR) of fractures associated with NOACs versus warfarin. Random-effects models were used for data synthesis. We included 29 studies (5 cohort studies and 24 randomized controlled trials) with 388 209 patients. Patients treated with NOACs had lower risks of fracture than those treated with warfarin (pooled RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77-0.91; P<0.001) with low heterogeneity (I2=38.9%). NOACs were also associated with significantly lower risks of hip fracture than warfarin (pooled RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.98; P=0.023). A nonsignificant trend of lower vertebral fracture risk in NOAC users was also observed (pooled RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.54-1.01; P=0.061).

Although multicellular organisms have developed sophisticated immune systems to defend against pathogens, pathogens are often able to successfully infect their hosts.

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is the nutrient sensor and central regulator of metabolism in innate and adaptive immune cells. Rapamycin, a drug targeting the mTOR pathway, has been widely used in clinical practice for decades and is relatively safe. However, some unexpected infections occur after long-term administration of rapamycin, indicating the presence of a close relationship between mTOR signaling and the infection process. In this manuscript, we briefly review the mTOR pathway and the current clinical use of rapamycin;we also summarize the role of the mTOR pathway in immune cell death, including apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis, and its impact on anti-infection immunity.

Methods: A series of NOTA-conjugated peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor DX600 were synthesized, with variable linker identity. Since DX600 bears two cystine residues, both linear and cyclic peptides were studied. An ACE2 inhibition assay was used to identify lead compounds, which were labeled with 68Ga to generate peptide radiotracers ([68Ga]NOTA-PEP). The aminocaproate-derived radiotracer [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 was subsequently studied in a humanized ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic model. Results: Cyclic DX-600 derived peptides had markedly lower IC50's than their linear counterparts. The three cyclic peptides with triglycine, aminocaproate, and polyethylene glycol linkers had calculated IC50's similar to, or lower than the parent DX600 molecule.

To determine the role of M2 protein apical targeting in IAV replication, a panel of M2 proteins with basolateral plasma membrane (M2-Baso) or endoplasmic reticulum (M2-ER) targeting sequences was generated. MDCK II cells stably expressing M2-Baso, but not M2-ER, complemented the replication of M2-stop viruses. However, in primary human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures, viruses encoding M2-Baso and M2-ER replicated to negligible titers compared to those of wild-type virus. M2-Baso replication was negatively correlated with cell polarization. These results demonstrate that M2 apical targeting is essential for IAV replication: targeting M2 to the ER results in a strong, cell type-independent inhibition of virus replication, and targeting M2 to the basolateral membrane has greater effects in hNECs than in MDCK cells.IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus assembly and particle release occur at the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells. The integral membrane proteins encoded by the virus, HA, NA, and M2, are all targeted to the apical membrane and believed to recruit the other structural proteins to sites of virus assembly. By targeting M2 to the basolateral or endoplasmic reticulum membranes, influenza A virus replication was significantly reduced. Basolateral targeting of M2 reduced the infectious virus titers with minimal effects on virus particle release, while targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum resulted in reduced infectious and total virus particle release.

In the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the maximum duration of antibody response is still unknown. In this work, the generation of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and IgG antibodies against the S1 subunit (S1 IgG ) of SARS-CoV-2 and their possible duration were determined through decay models. METHODS: 132 participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection were classified according to the severity of the disease. Seroconversion and persistence of S1 IgG antibodies and NAbs were determined by ELISA, samples were taken at two different times post-infection and duration of those antibodies was estimated using Linear Mixed Models (LMMs). RESULTS: The highest amount of S1 IgGs antibodies was associated with age (41 years or older), greater severity of COVID-19 and male gender. NAbs production was associated with the same variables, except for age. The percentage of NAbs decay is higher in the asymptomatic group (P = 0.033), while in S1 IgG antibodies decay, no statistical difference was found between the 4 severity groups. An exponential decay model was built by using a LMM and similarly, two dispersion regions where constructed. The duration of S1 IgG antibodies was 744 days (668C781) for first region and 744 days (453C1231) for the second. Regarding NAbs, an adaptative LMM was used to model a logistic function, determining a duration of 267 days (215C347). CONCLUSION: Humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on the severity of the disease, gender and age. This immune response could be long-lasting as for other coronaviruses.

In this study we investigate whether pandemic-related occupational and financial changes (e.g., reduced working hours, working from home, financial losses) were associated with increased symptoms of depression and anxiety compared with the situation before the pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed data from the German National Cohort (NAKO) Study. Between May and November 2020, 161 849 study participants answered questions on their mental state and social circumstances. Their responses were compared with data from the baseline survey before the pandemic (2014-2019). Linear fixed-effects models were used to determine whether individual changes in the severity of symptoms of depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) were associated with occupational/financial changes (controlling for various covariates). RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate or severe symptoms of depression and anxiety increased by 2.4% and 1.5%, respectively, during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the preceding years. The mean severity of the symptoms rose slightly. A pronounced increase in symptoms was observed among those who became unemployed during the pandemic (+ 1.16 points on the depression scale, 95% confidence interval [0.91; 1.41], range 0-27). Increases were also seen for reduced working hours with no short-time allowance, increased working hours, working from home, insecurity regarding employment, and financial strain. The deterioration in mental health was largely statistically explained by the occupational and financial changes investigated in the model. CONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms and anxiety disorders increased slightly in the study population during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Occupational and financial difficulties were an essential contributory factor. These strains should be taken into account both in the care of individual patients and in the planning of targeted prevention measures.","output":"Increase in Mental Disorders During the COVID-19 Pandemic-the Role of Occupational and Financial Strains.

These features amplify its psychological toxicity, and increase the number of psychological casualties it inflicts. Uncertainty was fueled by lack of knowledge about the lethality of a disaster, its duration, and ambiguity in messaging from leaders and healthcare authorities. Human resilience can have a buffering effect on the psychological impact. Experts have advocated \\"flattening the curve\\" to slow the spread of the infection. Our strategy for crisis leadership is focused on flattening the rise in psychological casualties by increasing resilience among healthcare workers. This paper describes an approach employed at Johns Hopkins to promote and enhance crisis leadership. The approach is based on four factors: vision for the future, decisiveness, effective communication, and following a moral compass. We recommend specific actionable recommendations for implementing these factors that are being disseminated to frontline leaders and managers. The COVID-19 pandemic is destined to have a strong psychological impact that extends far beyond the end of quarantine.

Since then PHM has been an active part of a global counter-hegemonic social movement. This study aimed to gain insights on social movement building, drawing on the successes and failures reported by activists over their experiences of working in the Health for All social movement to improve health, justice and equity. METHODS: Qualitative research methods were employed in this study to capture complex and historical narratives of individual activists, through semi-structured interviews and subsequent thematic analysis of transcripts. The research design and analysis were informed by social movement theory and literature on health activism as a pathway for social change. In this study we examine the semi-structured interviews of 15 health activists who are part of the PHM, with the aim of deriving lessons for strengthening movements for Health for All. RESULTS: This study locates the activists' narratives within a socio-political analysis of the global trends of late modern individualism and capitalist neoliberalism. This highlights the challenges faced by civil society groups mobilising collective action and building social movements for Health for All. The study found that within the constraints of the neoliberal socio-political and economic conditions which have caused the rise in social and health inequities, this group of long-term health activists have been nurturing alternative approaches to structuring society and building collective agency to improve health.

We estimate the impact of infant and maternal vaccination on the incidence of these diseases in Colombia. Design and methods: an interrupted time series study analyzing the incidence before and after of vaccination with DwPT (1975-2018) and with Tdap in pregnant women (2008-2018). A segmented regression model with negative binomial distribution estimated the change in level and trend of the predicted incidence ratio after vaccination in relation to the incidence if vaccination had not been started (IRR), using a Prais Winsten regression. Results: The pertussis IRR decreased immediately after the start of childhood vaccination (0.91, p=0.51), but this was only significant (1.01, p<0.001) along with the trend per year, after the start of maternal vaccination (0.98, p<0.001). In the absence of vaccination, the incidence would not have been reduced. Neonatal tetanus had the highest rate of change with significant reduction - 1.69 - CI 95%: -2.91, -0.48). The trend after vaccination was the highest with an annual reduction of 19% (0.81, p=0.001). The change in incidence of diphtheria was significant, although slow (- 0.02 - CI 95%: -0.04, -0.004). The sustained effect in the post-vaccination period was smaller (0.95, p=0.79). Conclusion: Childhood and maternal vaccination markedly reduced the incidence of pertussis and neonatal tetanus.

Nurses involved in the care of infected (COVID-19) patients, may feel more discomfort physically and experience greater psychological morbidities. Aims and Objectives: The main aim of the study is to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety and stress among nurses in a designated COVID-19 hospital and variables that influence these psychological problems. Methodology: Nurses working in the designated tertiary care hospital were invited to participate in an online cross-sectional survey (dated, September 5-15, 2020). A self-administered questionnaire regarding sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19-related experiences, perceived threat regarding COVID-19, and two scales (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Perceived Stress Scale-10) for the assessment of anxiety and stress was applied to nurses. Chi-square test and multiple regression analysis were used to investigate the predictors (risk and protective) of psychological morbidities in nurses. Results: On analysis of 209 participants, it was revealed that 65 (31.1%) participants have anxiety symptoms and 35.40% have moderate to the high level of stress. Being proud of working in this profession was the only protective factor from such psychological morbidities. The identified risk factors for greater anxiety symptoms and moderate-to-high-level stress were, working experience of &gt;10 years (odds ratio [OR] = 3.36), direct involvement in the care of suspected/diagnosed patients (OR = 3.4), feeling worried about being quarantined/isolated (OR = 1.69,) and high risk of being infected at the job (OR = 2.3 for anxiety and OR = 2.1 for moderate-to-high stress).

DesignSystematic review of spontaneously reported data from the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA), the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). Data SourcesEudraVigilance (EU/EEA), Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS; US) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MRHA, UK) spontaneous reporting databases were searched from date of vaccine launch to 01 December 2021. Eligibility criteriaPublicly available spontaneous reporting data for \\"Myocarditis\\" and \\"Pericarditis\\" from EU/EEA and US following COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Reports with comorbidities or concurrent medication indicative of transplantation, HIV infection, or cancer (\\"immunocompromised\\" population) were compared with each overall database population. Data extraction and synthesisTwo researchers extracted data. Spontaneously reported events of myocarditis and pericarditis were presented for immunocompromised populations for each data source, stratified by age, sex, dose, and time-to-onset (where available). Seriousness of each event was determined according to the ICH E2A definition. Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) was calculated. ResultsThere were 178 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis amongst immunocompromised individuals overall. Seriousness was comparable between the immunocompromised and overall populations in both databases. No trends in age or sex were observed amongst immunocompromised individuals. Most reports followed a second vaccine dose and occurred within 14 days. The frequency of reporting was similar to the wider population (PRR=1.36 [95% CI= 0.89-1.82] for VAERS population). ConclusionsMyocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination are very rare, and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination continue to outweigh any perceived risks. Reporting rates of myocarditis and pericarditis were similar in immunocompromised individuals, however defining characteristics differed compared to the whole population; therefore, continued monitoring of adverse events following vaccination remains vital to understand differences between population subgroups. Strengths and Limitations of the StudyO_LIThis is the first study to investigate the frequency and characteristics of reported events of myocarditis and pericarditis in immunocompromised individuals compared with the population as a whole, bringing together data from three regions (Europe, the United States, and the United Kingdom). C_LIO_LIResults from this study demonstrate that myocarditis and pericarditis are not more frequently reported following COVID-19 mRNA vaccines for immunocompromised individuals, however age and sex distributions are less clear, and clinical course may differ compared with the overall population. C_LIO_LIAs with all analyses using spontaneously reported data, results may have been subject to underreporting and missing information, including information on comorbidities and concomitant medications. It is possible that some immunocompromised were incorrectly classified as immunocompetent. Further biases may have influenced results, including differences in vaccination strategies between the two regions examined, differences in data collected via spontaneous reporting systems, and serious events more likely to be reported. C_LIO_LIIt is not possible to estimate incidence rates using spontaneous reports due to a lack of data on the exposed population, and there is no unexposed comparison group. C_LIO_LIFurther monitoring of myocarditis and pericarditis events in immunocompromised populations is needed as booster vaccination programmes progress.

However, single-incision laparoscopic surgery is also widening its applicable fields as a new technique. This study aimed to find whether single-incision laparoscopic total extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (SILTEP) is applicable compared to conventional laparoscopic total extraperitoneal hernia repair (CLTEP). METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 120 cases of SILTEP and 60 cases of CLTEP in Yonsei University Severance Hospital from January 2012 to December 2013. Each group was compared with patients' characteristics, operative details, and postoperative complications. RESULTS There were no statistical difference in patient age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, hernia type, or location between SILTEP and CLTEP. In operative details, operation time (61.77  16.48 minutes versus 77.83  35.15 minutes, P = .001) was shorter in SILTEP. Postoperative complication rate has shown no statistical difference in SILTEP compared to CLTEP (n = 20, 16.7% versus n = 16, 26.7%, P = .114). CONCLUSIONS SILTEP is feasible and provides comparable postoperative outcomes compared to CLTEP. Although SILTEP has its own challenges for mastering the procedure, with some experiences, it is possible to operate as well as CLTEP.","output":"Safety and Efficacy of Single-Incision Laparoscopic Totally Extraperitoneal Inguinal Hernia Repair: Comparative Study with Conventional Laparoscopic Totally Extraperitoneal Inguinal Hernia Repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background There is some evidence that alcohol use may have changed during the coronavirus pandemic. However, as yet, there has been comparatively little focus on heavy/excessive drinking. This study examined binge drinking (BD) in Japan during the coronavirus pandemic and its association with COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Method Data were analyzed from an online sample of 1452 individuals aged 18 and above that were collected one year after the beginning of the pandemic. Self-reported information was obtained on current and pre-pandemic BD and a range of sociodemographic and health-related variables. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine associations. Results Just under one-third of the sample (29.3%) reported past-month BD. More individuals reduced rather than increased BD during the pandemic (11.5 > 6.5%). Worsening household finances and depressive symptoms were associated with both current and increased BD, while young age (18-29) was linked to both increased and decreased BD. Individuals who binged reported significantly lower odds for engaging in several COVID-19 preventive behaviors including wearing a mask (odds ratio [OR]: 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30-0.76), hand washing (OR: 0.58, 95%CI: 0.44-0.76) and avoiding crowds/staying at home (OR:0.72, 95%CI: 0.55-0.93). Conclusion BD is prevalent in Japan during the coronavirus pandemic and associated with poorer adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviors.

Introduction Given the importance of evidence-based decision-making, this study aimed to evaluate epidemiological and clinical characteristics as well as associate factors of mortality among admitted COVID-19 cases. Methods This multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted on confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases who were hospitalized in 19 public hospitals affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (SBMU), Tehran, Iran, between February 19 and May 12, 2020. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the infected cases were compared between the deceased and survivors after discharge. Case fatality rates (CFRs) were calculated across all study variables. Single and multiple logistic regressions were used to explore the risk factors associated with COIVD-19 mortality. Results Out of the 16035 cases that referred to the hospitals affiliated to SBMU, 16016 patients (99.93% of Confirmed and 99.83% of suspected cases) were hospitalized. 1612 patients died with median hospitalization days of 5 (interquartile range (IQR): 2-9) and 3 (1-7) for confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases, respectively. The highest death rate was observed among ages>65 (63.4% of confirmed cases, 62.3% of suspected cases) and intensive care unit (ICU)/critical care unit (CCU) patients (62.7% of confirmed cases, 52.2% of suspected cases). Total case fatality rate (CFR) was 10.05% (13.52% and 6.37% among confirmed and suspected cases, respectively). The highest total CFR was observed in patients with age>65 years (25.32%), underlying comorbidities (25.55%), and ICU/CCU patients (41.7%). The highest CFR was reported for patients who had diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (38.46%) as underlying non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and patients with cancer (35.79%). Conclusion This study showed a high CFR among suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases, and highlighted the main associated risk factors including age, sex, underlying NCDs, and ICU/CCU admission affecting survival of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Baseline Characteristics and Associated Factors of Mortality in COVID-19 Patients; an Analysis of 16000 Cases in Tehran, Iran."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report an inspiring case of a 55-year-old Korean female diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in Mexico.

PHE materials were shown before cycle 2 and respondents then subjected to the general campaign. RESULTS: 253 responses were collected. Symptom recognition was 84%, increasing to 88% post-intervention, longer-term recognition remained high at 81% - including the new symptom of anosmia. Identification of COVIDs means of transmission increased from 76% to 95% post intervention, risk factor recognition increased from 85% to 93% post-intervention. This fell to 74% later in the pandemic when recognised risk factors increased. Recognition of the new risk factors BAME status and BMI was 73% and 79% respectively in the final cycle.

Over the last few years, numerous mobile apps have been developed to challenge the brain with cognitive exercises; however, little is currently known about how age influences capacity for performance improvement when playing cognitive mobile games. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the score data of cognitive mobile games over a period of 100 gaming sessions to determine age-related learning ability for new cognitive tasks by measuring the level of score improvement achieved by participants of different ages. METHODS: Scores from 9000 individuals of different ages for 7 cognitive mobile games over 100 gaming sessions were analyzed. Scores from the first session were compared between age groups using one-way analysis of variance. Mixed models were subsequently used to investigate the progression of scores over 100 sessions. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found between age groups for the initial scores of 6 of the 7 games (linear trend, P<.001). Cognitive mobile game scores increased for all participants (P<.001) suggesting that all participants were able to improve their performance. The rate of improvement was, however, strongly influenced by the age of the participant with slower progression for older participants (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence to support two interesting insights-cognitive mobile game scores appear to be sensitive to the changes in cognitive ability that occur with advancing age; therefore, these games could be a convenient way to monitor cognitive function over long-term follow-up, and users who train with the cognitive mobile games improve regardless of age.","output":"Age-Associated Capacity to Progress When Playing Cognitive Mobile Games: Ecological Retrospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Significant advances have been observed in the field of cell biology, with numerous studies exploring the molecular genetic pathways that have contributed to species evolution and disease development.

In the present study, the earliest steps in the virus replication cycle, i.e. the appearance and intracellular translocation of viral protein and negative-strand RNA prior to positive-strand RNA synthesis, were followed. During translation, positive-strand RNA and newly synthesized viral protein presented as a dispersed endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-like pattern. Concomitant with translation, individual PV vesicle clusters emerged at the ER and formed nascent replication complexes, which contained newly synthesized negative-strand RNA. The complexes rapidly moved centripetally, in a microtubule-dependent way, to the perinuclear area to engage in positive-strand viral RNA synthesis. Replication complexes made transcriptionally silent with guanidine/HCl followed the anterograde membrane pathway to the Golgi complex within the microtubule-organizing centre (MTOC), whereas replication complexes active in positive-strand RNA synthesis were retained at the nuclear periphery. If the silent replication complexes that had accumulated at the MTOC were released from the guanidine block, transcription was not readily resumed. Rather, positive-strand RNA was redistributed back to the ER to start, after a lag phase, translation, followed by negative- and positive-strand RNA synthesis in replication complexes migrating to the nuclear periphery. As some of the findings appear to be in contrast to events reported in cell-free guanidine-synchronized translation/transcription systems, implications for the comparison of in vitro systems with the living cell are discussed.","output":"Intracellular location and translocation of silent and active poliovirus replication complexes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate the value of anal swabs positive for 2019-nCoV in patients with COVID-19 and the clinical features of the patients. Methods: Throat swabs, sputum and blood samples, and anal swabs were collected from 104 patients with COVID-19 at admission to test for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. Clinical characteristics and hematological indexes were compared between viral nucleic acid-positive and -negative groups of different sample types. Fifteen patients whose anal swabs were positive for viral nucleic acid were selected to analyze the length of time before the nucleic acid turned negative in different specimens. Results: Compared with the patients having negative anal swab test results, those having positive test results showed decreased lymphocytes, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HsCRP), and higher incidence of severe COVID-19. The levels of HsCRP and IL-6 and the incidence of severe COVID-19 were significantly higher in patients with positive throat swab test results than in those with negative results. No significant difference in hematological indexes or the proportion of severe cases was detected between the patients with positive and negative sputum test results. Only 1.92% of the patients had positive blood test results, but all of them were severe patients. The positive rate of sputum test was the highest, which was 46.15%. Patients with positive results of both throat and anal swab test had significantly decreased lymphocytes, increased HsCRP and IL-6 levels, and higher incidence of critical COVID-19. It took longer time for patients to have negative anal swab and sputum test results. Moreover, it should be noticed that the viral nucleic acid in sputum might become positive again after it turned negative. Conclusions: Patients with positive anal swab test results had reduced lymphocytes, enhanced inflammatory response and higher incidence of severe COVID-19, suggesting that a positive anal swab test might be an indicator of severe COVID-19. Moreover, the time of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid turning negative in anal swabs was longer than that in throat swabs.

The miniSTONE-2 study included pediatric patients with influenza (1 to < 12 years) and demonstrated similar median times to alleviation of signs and symptoms of influenza with a single dose of baloxavir granules (weight < 20 kg: 2 mg/kg,  20 kg: 40 mg) and oseltamivir. Although the baloxavir dose in miniSTONE-2 was higher than the Japanese-approved dose, baloxavir exposure in miniSTONE-2 was similar to Japanese pediatric patients who receive the Japanese-approved dose. This study will be the first randomized active-controlled study in pediatric patients with influenza using the Japanese-approved dose of baloxavir. METHODS: This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, active-controlled trial in which 200 Japanese subjects aged 6 to < 12 years with influenza virus infection are randomly allocated (2:1) to a single dose of baloxavir at the approved dose in Japan (weight  10 to < 20 kg: 10 mg,  20 to < 40 kg: 20 mg,  40 kg: 40 mg) or oseltamivir twice daily for 5 days. The primary clinical endpoint is the time to illness alleviation of influenza, from administration of baloxavir or oseltamivir until the following criteria were met and sustained for at least 21.5 h (24 h10%): cough and nasal discharge/nasal congestion rated as absent or mild axillary body temperature < 37.5 C. The primary analysis population is the intention-to-treat infected population, which includes all pediatric subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug and have confirmed influenza virus infection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The safety population includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug. DISCUSSION: No comparative studies have been conducted to confirm the efficacy and safety of baloxavir versus a comparator in pediatric patients with influenza infection in Japan.

Child burns in the previous five years constituted the before COVID-19 group as the reference group. Child burns during the first lockdown formed the COVID-19 group. Demographics characteristics, the delay before first attendance at the surgery department, burns characteristics, the place of the incident, need of skin graft, and child reactions to trauma or isolation were recorded for these two groups.

METHODS: Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with COVID\\\\19 were enrolled in this prospective, observational study. ADAMTS13 activity and VWF:Ag were measured at index ED visit. The primary endpoint was severe AKI defined by KDIGO stage 2 + 3 criteria, while the secondary endpoint was peak 30\\\\day COVID\\\\19 severity. RESULTS: A total of 52 adult COVID\\\\19 patients were enrolled. Overall, we observed that 23.1% of the cohort had a relative deficiency in ADAMTS13 activity, while 80.8% had elevated VWF:Ag. The ADAMTS13 activity/VWF:Ag ratio was significantly lower in patients with severe AKI (P = .002) and those who developed the severe form of COVID\\\\19 (P = .020).

Depressive and anxiety symptoms were estimated using the Children's Depression Inventory C Short Form (CDI-S) and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), respectively. CDI-S and SCARED scores between Wave 2 and Wave 1 were calculated and further categorized into tertiles. Multivariable linear regression and multinomial logistic regression models were then applied. RESULTS: A total of 1,224 children completed both surveys. The prevalence of mental health outcomes at Wave 2 increased significantly compared to Wave 1, specifically depressive symptoms (age-standardized prevalence rates: 37.5 vs. 21.8%) and anxiety symptoms (age-standardized prevalence rates: 24.0 vs. 19.6%).

Virucidal activity of agents correlated with anti-JEV activity, while virucidal IC(50) values were 7.58 g/ml for methanol extract, 17.36 g/ml for water extract, 0.75 g/ml for chrysophanol and 0.46 g/ml for aloe-emodin, respectively. In addition, 10 g/ml of extract, chrysophanol or aloe emodin caused 90 % inhibition of JEV yields in cells and significantly activated gamma activated sequence-driven promoters. Hence, methanol extract of R. palmatum and chrysophanol with high therapeutic index might be useful for development of antiviral agents against JEV.","output":"Antiviral activity of Rheum palmatum methanol extract and chrysophanol against Japanese encephalitis virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human milk (HM) is the gold standard for the nutrition of infants. An important component of HM is human milk oligosaccharides (hMOs), which play an important role in gut microbiota colonization and gut immune barrier establishment, and thereby contribute to the maturation of the immune system in early life. Guiding these processes is important as disturbances have life-long health effects and can lead to the development of allergic diseases. Unfortunately, not all infants can be exclusively fed with HM. These infants are routinely fed with infant formulas that contain hMO analogs and other non-digestible carbohydrates (NDCs) to mimic the effects of hMOs. Currently, the hMO analogs 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), and pectins are added to infant formulas; however, these NDCs cannot mimic all hMO functions and therefore new NDCs and NDC mixtures need to become available for specific groups of neonates like preterm and disease-prone neonates. In this review, we discuss human data on the beneficial effects of infant formula supplements such as the specific hMO analog 2'-FL and NDCs as well as their mechanism of effects like stimulation of microbiota development, maturation of different parts of the gut immune barrier and anti-pathogenic effects. Insights into the structure-specific mechanisms by which hMOs and NDCs exert their beneficial functions might contribute to the development of new tailored NDCs and NDC mixtures. We also describe the needs for new in vitro systems that can be used for research on hMOs and NDCs.

Due to some characteristics of COVID-19, like high infectivity, people prefer to use their private cars more than before. On the one hand, this circumstance caused public transportation to face an unprecedented decrease in demand and, consequently, revenue. On the other hand, it could intensify traffic congestion during rush hours. This study provides a computational framework to assess public transportation's customer satisfaction in Tehran during the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, a combined multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach based on the best-worst method (BWM) and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (fuzzy TOPSIS) is introduced, which benefits from all the advantages of BWM and fuzzy TOPSIS procedure and consequently provides consistent and reliable outcomes. Outcomes of the implemented model provide precious insight for improving service quality during and after the pandemic; for example, it reveals the performance of each transport mode about each criterion which can help policymakers and transit agencies to allocate resources more intelligently.

To enable routine surveillance and comprehensive diagnostic applications, there is a need for detection technologies that can scale to test many samples(1C3) while simultaneously testing for many pathogens(4C6). Here, we develop Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (CARMEN), a platform for scalable, multiplexed pathogen detection. In the CARMEN platform, nanolitre droplets containing CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection reagents(7) self-organize in a microwell array(8) to pair with droplets of amplified samples, testing each sample against each CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in replicate. The combination of CARMEN and Cas13 detection (CARMENCCas13) enables robust testing of more than 4,500 crRNACtarget pairs on a single array. Using CARMENCCas13, we developed a multiplexed assay that simultaneously differentiates all 169 human-associated viruses with at least 10 published genome sequences and rapidly incorporated an additional crRNA to detect the causative agent of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. CARMENCCas13 further enables comprehensive subtyping of influenza A strains and multiplexed identification of dozens of HIV drug-resistance mutations. The intrinsic multiplexing and throughput capabilities of CARMEN make it practical to scale, as miniaturization decreases reagent cost per test by more than 300-fold.

Debunking false information about a health crisis is critical as misinformation can trigger protests or panic, which necessitates a better understanding of it. This exploratory study examined the effects of debunking messages on a COVID-19-related public chat on WhatsApp in Singapore. Design/methodology/approach: To understand the effects of debunking messages about COVID-19 on WhatsApp conversations, the following was studied. The relationship between source credibility (i.e. characteristics of a communicator that affect the receiver's acceptance of the message) of different debunking message types and their effects on the length of the conversation, sentiments towards various aspects of a crisis, and the information distortions in a message thread were studied. Deep learning techniques, knowledge graphs (KG), and content analyses were used to perform aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) of the messages and measure information distortion. Findings: Debunking messages with higher source credibility (e.g. providing evidence from authoritative sources like health authorities) help close a discussion thread earlier. Shifts in sentiments towards some aspects of the crisis highlight the value of ABSA in monitoring the effectiveness of debunking messages. Finally, debunking messages with lower source credibility (e.g. stating that the information is false without any substantiation) are likely to increase information distortion in conversation threads. Originality/value: The study supports the importance of source credibility in debunking and an ABSA approach in analysing the effect of debunking messages during a health crisis, which have practical value for public agencies during a health crisis. Studying differences in the source credibility of debunking messages on WhatsApp is a novel shift from the existing approaches. Additionally, a novel approach to measuring information distortion using KGs was used to shed insights on how debunking can reduce information distortions. ? 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Exploring how online responses change in response to debunking messages about COVID-19 on WhatsApp"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Gulf of Mexico (GoM) region is prone to disasters, including recurrent oil spills, hurricanes, floods, industrial accidents, harmful algal blooms, and the current COVID-19 pandemic The GoM and other regions of the U S lack sufficient baseline health information to identify, attribute, mitigate, and facilitate prevention of major health effects of disasters Developing capacity to assess adverse human health consequences of future disasters requires establishment of a comprehensive, sustained community health observing system, similar to the extensive and well-established environmental observing systems We propose a system that combines six levels of health data domains, beginning with three existing, national surveys and studies plus three new nested, longitudinal cohort studies The latter are the unique and most important parts of the system and are focused on the coastal regions of the five GoM States A statistically representative sample of participants is proposed for the new cohort studies, stratified to ensure proportional inclusion of urban and rural populations and with additional recruitment as necessary to enroll participants from particularly vulnerable or under-represented groups Secondary data sources such as syndromic surveillance systems, electronic health records, national community surveys, environmental exposure databases, social media, and remote sensing will inform and augment the collection of primary data Primary data sources will include participant-provided information via questionnaires, clinical measures of mental and physical health, acquisition of biological specimens, and wearable health monitoring devices A suite of biomarkers may be derived from biological specimens for use in health assessments, including calculation of allostatic load, a measure of cumulative stress The framework also addresses data management and sharing, participant retention, and system governance The observing system is designed to continue indefinitely to ensure that essential pre-, during-, and post-disaster health data are collected and maintained It could also provide a model/vehicle for effective health observation related to infectious disease pandemics such as COVID-19 To our knowledge, there is no comprehensive, disaster-focused health observing system such as the one proposed here currently in existence or planned elsewhere Significant strengths of the GoM Community Health Observing System (CHOS) are its longitudinal cohorts and ability to adapt rapidly as needs arise and new technologies develop ?

While many of our patients with rheumatic diseases (RD) wonder whether it is safe to get the vaccine, vaccine hesitancy is rising among the general population. We assessed the willingness to get vaccination and its probable predictors among patients with RD compared to healthcare workers and a sample from the general population. METHODS: We conducted a web-based questionnaire survey in a cross-sectional design in 3 groups of participants just before the mass vaccination program in Istanbul, Turkey. The questionnaire sought socio-demographic variables, COVID-19 related risk factors, willingness to get vaccination, and concerns and thoughts about vaccine. COVID-19 anxiety scale (CAS) was also evaluated. RESULTS: We studied in total 732 patients with RD (Group 1), 763 individuals representing general population (Group 2) and 320 hospital workers (Group 3). Dysfunctional anxiety related to COVID-19 was found in 4.9%, 3.8% and 4.1%, in Group 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Of the patients with RD, 29.2% were willing to be vaccinated, 19.0% were unwilling and 51.8% were undecided. These were somewhat similar among the general population (yes: 34.6%, no: 23.3% and unsure: 42.1%), with significantly less undecided individuals (p < 0.001). On the other hand, hospital workers were significantly more willing (yes: 52.5%, no: 20.9% and unsure: 26.6%) (p < 0.001). Main concerns were probable side effects, unknown scientific results and having no trust. Being male, older age, working in a hospital, not having contracted COVID-19 and high scores on CAS were found to be independently associated with willingness. CONCLUSIONS: The low rate of vaccine acceptance among patients with RD, as well as general population sampling is worrying. Healthcare policies should aim to implement communication, promote confidence and increase demand for COVID-19 vaccine.","output":"Willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine among patients with rheumatic diseases, healthcare workers and general population in Turkey: a web-based survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate if genetic polymorphisms in the oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and oestrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) genes encoded for oestrogen receptors alpha (ER) and beta (ER) are involved in permanent tooth size.

METHODS The technical feasibility of SDI was evaluated by a series of anthropomorphic phantom studies on a standard SPECT camera. The attenuation map was created by a moving transmission line source. Iterative reconstruction including attenuation correction, resolution recovery and Monte Carlo simulation of scatter was used for simultaneous reconstruction of dual tracer distribution. For clinical evaluation, patient studies were compared to stress (99m)Tc and rest (99m)Tc reference images acquired in a 2-day protocol. Clinical follow-up examinations like coronary angiography (CAG) and fractional flow reserve (FFR) were included in the assessment if available. RESULTS Phantom studies demonstrated the technical feasibility of SDI. Artificial lesions inserted in the phantom mimicking ischaemia could be clearly identified. In 51/53 patients, the image quality was adequate for clinical evaluation. For the remaining two obese patients with body mass index > 32 the injected (201)Tl dose of 74 MBq was insufficient for clinical assessment. In answer to this the (201)Tl dose was adapted for obese patients in the rest of the study. In 31 patients, SDI and (99m)Tc reference images resulted in equivalent clinical assessment. Significant differences were found in 20 patients. In 18 of these 20 patients additional examinations were available. In 15 patients the diagnosis based on the SDI images was confirmed by the results of CAG or FFR. In these patients the SDI images were more accurate than the (99m)Tc reference study. In three patients minor ischaemic lesions were detected by SDI but were not confirmed by CAG. In one of these cases this was probably caused by pronounced apical thinning. For two patients no relevant clinical follow-up information was available for evaluation.

The full impact of this onslaught of grief will not be known for some time. Ensuring high quality bereavement care in the context of COVID-19 presents unprecedented challenges to end-of-life care. OBJECTIVES We aimed to determine how psychological symptoms explain functional impairment. METHODS A sample of people bereaved through COVID-19 (N = 307) in the United States completed demographic questions and self-report measures of neuroticism; symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, posttraumatic stress, separation distress, and dysfunctional grief; and functional impairment due to a COVID-19 loss. RESULTS Most participants' scores were in the clinical ranges for generalized anxiety, depression, dysfunctional grief, and functional impairment. Functional impairment scores were not associated with age, gender, and time since loss but were associated with being diagnosed with COVID-19, having received professional help with the loss, and a close relationship to the deceased. A logistic regression model showed that, after controlling for covariates, the odds of functional impairment significantly increased by 27% for higher scores in separation distress, 25% for higher scores in dysfunctional grief, and 13% for higher scores in posttraumatic stress. CONCLUSION People bereaved due to COVID-19 are at risk of functional impairment, especially if they have symptoms of separation distress, dysfunctional grief, and/or posttraumatic stress.

Available evidence suggests that liver injury may result from direct pathogenic effect by the virus, systemic inflammation or toxicity from commonly used drugs in this subset of patients. SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection in children is associated with minimal or no increase in liver enzymes, thus the presence of abnormal liver function tests should trigger evaluation for underlying liver diseases. Although it seems that patients with CLD are not at greater risk for acquiring the infection, those with cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, non\\\\alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune liver diseases or liver transplant may have a greater risk for severe COVID\\\\19.

The purpose of this study was to assess the validity, reliability and feasibility of the Fever Assessment Tool (FAST) in an acute care research setting. METHODS Qualitative: To assess content validity and finalize the FAST instrument, 12 adults from an inpatient medical-surgical unit at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center participated in cognitive interviews within approximately 12 h of a febrile state (tympanic temperature  38 Celsius). Quantitative: To test reliability, validity and feasibility, 56 new adult inpatients completed the 21-item FAST. RESULTS The cognitive interviews clarified and validated the content of the final 21-item FAST. Fifty-six patients completed the FAST from two to 133 times during routine vital sign assessment, yielding 1,699 temperature time points. Thirty-four percent of the patients (N = 19) experienced fever at one or more time points, with a total of 125 febrile time points. Kuder-Richardson 20 (KR-20) reliability of the FAST was 0.70. Four nonspecific symptom categories, Tired or Run-Down (12), Sleepy (13), Weak or Lacking Energy (11), and Thirsty (9) were among the most frequently reported symptoms in all participants. Using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), the odds of reporting eight symptoms, Warm (4), Sweating (5), Thirsty (9), General Body Aches (10), Weak or Lacking Energy (11), Tired or Run Down (12) and Difficulty Breathing (17), were increased when patients had a fever (Fever Now), compared to the two other subgroups-patients who had a fever, but not at that particular time point, (Fever Not Now) and patients who never had a fever (Fever Never). Many, but not all, of the comparisons were significant in both groups. CONCLUSION Results suggest the FAST is reliable, valid and easy to administer.

This is an analysis of first week data from a 12-week, double-blind trial. ClinicalTrials.gov unique ID: NCT00444925. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Baseline to week 1 changes in 3-day bladder diary variables, Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC), and Urgency Perception Scale (UPS) scores reported by subjects receiving fesoterodine 4 mg or placebo. RESULTS By week 1, fesoterodine 4 mg (n = 679) was associated with significantly greater improvements compared with placebo (n = 334) in micturitions, urgency, severe urgency and UUI episodes, frequency-urgency sum, and MVV per 24 hours and 3-day diary-dry rate (all p < 0.05), but not nocturnal micturitions per 24 hours (p = 0.273). These differences were significant as early as day 5 of treatment (i.e., day 1 of the 3-day diary) for all diary endpoints except nocturnal micturitions and MVV.

CONCLUSION The results provide evidence that patients receiving fesoterodine 4 mg for their OAB symptoms may expect to experience a response as early as 1 week after initiating treatment. One limitation is that, although 65% of subjects had received treatment with antimuscarinics before the study, whether subjects were dissatisfied with previous treatment and reasons for dissatisfaction were not collected. This might affect the magnitude of outcome improvements.

METHODS: We followed up 1174 patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)who were recovered and discharged for 6 months. RESULTS: There were 175 cases with clear IgG results 6 months after discharge, of which 82 (46.9%) were IgG (+) and 16 (9.1%) were IgG (dim+). Four hundred and forty-one participants (55.4%) had some kind of sequelae. The most common symptoms were fatigue (25.3%), sleep disorder (23.2%) and shortness of breath (20.4%). In those who had sequelae, 262 (59.4%) had more than one symptom. Critical cases were more likely to have cough (20.5% vs 11.6%, p = 0.023) and hypomnesis (15.1% vs 8.0%, p = 0.041) than severe cases. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that women are more likely to have multiple symptoms (p = 0.002), fatigue (p = 0.009) and sleep disorder (p = 0.008), whereas critical illness was found as independent risk factor for hypomnesis (p = 0.045).

Considering their critical role in reducing disease burden, the increasing demand outpacing production, and that most currently approved vaccines follow a two-dose regimen, the cost-effectiveness of delaying the second dose to increment the coverage of the population receiving the first dose is often debated. Finding the best solution is complex due to the trade-off between vaccinating more people with lower level of protection and guaranteeing higher protection to a fewer number of individuals. Here we present a novel extended age-structured SEIR mathematical model that includes a two-dose vaccination schedule with a between-doses delay modelled through delay differential equations and linear optimization of vaccination rates. Simulations for each time window and for different types of vaccines and production rates were run to find the optimal time window between doses, that is, the one that minimizes the number of deaths. We found that the best strategy depends on an interplay between the vaccine production rate and the relative efficacy of the first dose. In the scenario of low first-dose efficacy, it is always better to apply the second dose as soon as possible, while for high first-dose efficacy, the optimal window depends on the production rate and also on second-dose efficacy provided by each type of vaccine. We also found that the rate of spread of the infection does not affect significantly the thresholds of the optimal window, but is an important factor in the absolute number of total deaths. These conclusions point to the need to carefully take into account both vaccine characteristics and roll-out speed to optimize the outcome of vaccination strategies.","output":"Assessing optimal time between doses in two-dose vaccination regimen in an ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Applying momentum measures and probability distributions, a visual scheme is proposed in this paper to transfer SARS-CoV-2 genomes to two distinct maps to be the A6 module of the MAS.

Early sports specialization and extremely high activity levels have been linked to elevated risk of injury. PURPOSE To investigate for any relationships among quality of physical movement, quantity of physical activity, and degree of sports specialization in a healthy cohort of active children and adolescents. STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional study with prospectively collected data. METHODS Healthy children between the ages of 10 and 18 years were recruited and completed the Hospital for Special Surgery Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale to assess quantity of physical activity and the Jayanthi scale to assess degree of sports specialization (high, score of 2 or 3; low, score of 0 or 1). Movement quality was assessed using motion analysis sensors during 5 repetitions of 4 different jumping and squatting motions, with a maximum score of 100 per participant. Independent-samples t tests were used to compare participants with high versus low specialization on physical activity and movement quality. A Spearman correlation was used to determine the relationship between quantity of physical activity and movement quality, and linear regression was used to assess for the effect of participant age on relevant covariables. RESULTS Final analyses included 147 participants (72% male) with a mean  SD age of 13.4  2.2 years. Participants who were highly specialized displayed better movement quality than did participants with low sports specialization (27.6  14.0 vs 19.8  10.1; P < .01). Participants who were highly specialized had significantly higher activity levels (24.6  5.9 vs 18.1  6.9; P < .001). Movement quality was moderately correlated with physical activity level (r = 0.335; P < .001). Physical activity; hours of organized sports activity; hours of free, unorganized physical activity; and specialization level were not significant predictors of movement quality when controlling for age. Age alone predicted 24.2% of the variance in the overall movement quality score (R2 = 0.242; B = 3.0; P < .001). CONCLUSION This study found that sports specialization and physical activity levels were not associated with movement quality when controlling for age, which was the most important variable predicting athletic movement quality. Although all participants displayed movement patterns that were associated with high risk for injury, overall movement quality improved with advancing chronological age.

One of the unsolved scientific questions of SARS-CoV-2 is the animal origin of this virus. Bats and pangolins are recognized as the most probable reservoir hosts that harbour highly similar SARS-CoV-2 related viruses (SARSr-CoV-2). This study identified a novel lineage of SARSr-CoVs, including RaTG15 and seven other viruses, from bats at the same location where we found RaTG13 in 2015. Although RaTG15 and the related viruses share 97.2% amino acid sequence identities with SARS-CoV-2 in the conserved ORF1b region, it only shows less than 77.6% nucleotide identity to all known SARSr-CoVs at the genome level, thus forming a distinct lineage in the Sarbecovirus phylogenetic tree. We found that the RaTG15 receptor-binding domain (RBD) can bind to ACE2 from Rhinolophus affinis, Malayan pangolin, and use it as an entry receptor, except for ACE2 from humans. However, it contains a short deletion and has different key residues responsible for ACE2 binding. In addition, we showed that none of the known viruses in bat SARSr-CoV-2 lineage discovered uses human ACE2 as efficiently as the pangolin-derived SARSr-CoV-2 or some viruses in the SARSr-CoV-1 lineage. Therefore, further systematic and longitudinal studies in bats are needed to prevent future spillover events caused by SARSr-CoVs or to understand the origin of SARS-CoV-2 better.","output":"Identification of a novel lineage bat SARS-related coronaviruses that use bat ACE2 receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The inaccuracy of the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been a major incentive for studies aimed at the identification of biomarkers.

Objective: To evaluate the initial short-term additional benefit of a 3-dose vs a 2-dose regimen against infection of SARS-CoV-2. Design, Setting, and Participants: This preliminary retrospective case-control study used 2 complementary approaches: a test-negative design and a matched case-control design. Participants were included from the national centralized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services, an Israeli healthcare maintenance organization covering 2.5 million members. Data were collected between March 1, 2020, and October 4, 2021, and analyses focused on the period from August 1, 2021, to October 4, 2021, because the booster dose was widely administered from August 1 onward. Exposures: Either 2 doses or 3 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Main Outcomes and Measures: The reduction in the odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at different time intervals following receipt of the booster dose (0-6, 7-13, 14-20, 21-27, and 28-65 days) compared with receiving only 2 doses. Results: The study population included 306a?710 members of Maccabi Healthcare Services who were 40 years and older (55% female) and received either 2 or 3 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine and did not have a positive PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2 prior to the start of the follow-up period. During this period, there were 500a?232 PCR tests performed, 227a?380 among those who received 2 doses and 272a?852 among those who received 3 doses, with 14a?989 (6.6%) and 4941 (1.8%) positive test results in each group, respectively. Comparing those who received a booster and those who received 2 doses, there was an estimated odds ratio of 0.14 (95% CI, 0.13-0.15) 28 to 65 days following receipt of the booster (86% reduction in the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2). Conclusion and Relevance: Previous studies have demonstrated that vaccine-derived protection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time. In this case-control analysis, we showed an association between receipt of the booster dose and a reduction in the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, potentially counteracting waning immunity in the short term.

Living and working conditions are highly conducive for transmission, as people live in crowded inter-generational households that often lack running water and other basic sanitary facilities. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of Ethiopians toward COVID-19 following the introduction of state of emergency by the Ethiopian government to curb the spread of the disease. A cross-sectional study design was conducted in nine reginal states and two chartered cities. Data for demographic, Knowledge, attitude and practice toward COVID-19 were collected through telephone interview from 1570 participants. Descriptive and bivariate analyses using chi-square test, t-test or analysis of variance were performed as appropriate. Binary and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to measure the relationship between the categorical dependent variables and one or more socio-demographic independent variables with two-tailed at =0.05 significance level and 95% of confidence interval. The level of good knowledge, favourable attitude and good practice among the respondents were 42%, 53.8% and 24.3% respectively. Being rural resident, older than 50 years, having at least primary education, being resident of Amhara and Oromia regions were independent predictors of knowledge level. While being rural resident, married, employed, having at least basic education, being residents of Afar, Amhara, Gambela, Oromia and Somali regions were found to be the best predictors of the attitude, being rural resident, government employee, having at least basic education, and living outside of the capital were the independent predictors of practice level of the respondents. The finding revealed that Ethiopians have inadequate level of knowledge and are generally have a mixed outlook on overcoming the pandemic with poor adherence to COVID-19 prevention practice. reinforcing preventive measures and intensifying sensitization campaigns to fill the knowledge gap and persuading people to follow the preventive measures set by the government with concurrent evaluation of the impacts of these measures on knowledge and practice is highly recommended to mitigate the disease.","output":"Inadequate level of knowledge, mixed outlook and poor adherence to COVID-19 prevention guideline among Ethiopians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multimedia IoT (M-IoT) is an emerging type of Internet of things (IoT) relaying multimedia data (images, videos, audio and speech, etc.). The rapid growth of M-IoT devices enables the creation of a massive volume of multimedia data with different characteristics and requirements. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), AI-based multimedia IoT systems have been recently designed and deployed for various video-based services for contemporary daily life, like video surveillance with high definition (HD) and ultra-high definition (UHD) and mobile multimedia streaming. These new services need higher video quality in order to meet the quality of experience (QoE) required by the users. Versatile video coding (VVC) is the new video coding standard that achieves significant coding efficiency over its predecessor high-efficiency video coding (HEVC). Moreover, VVC can achieve up to 30% BD rate savings compared to HEVC. Inspired by the rapid advancements in deep learning, we propose in this paper a wide-activated squeeze-and-excitation deep convolutional neural network (WSE-DCNN) technique-based video quality enhancement for VVC. Therefore, we replace the conventional in-loop filtering in VVC by the proposed WSE-DCNN model that eliminates the compression artifacts in order to improve visual quality and hence increase the end user QoE. The obtained results prove that the proposed in-loop filtering technique achieves [Formula: see text]%, [Formula: see text]%, and [Formula: see text]% BD rate reduction for luma and both chroma components under random access configuration.

Understanding the virome in Ae. albopictus is critical for assessing the risk of disease transmission, implementation of vector control measures, and health system strengthening. METHODS: In this study, viral metagenomic and PCR methods were used to reveal the virome in adult Ae. albopictus captured in different areas and during different seasons in Guangzhou, China. RESULTS: The viral composition of adult Ae. albopictus varied mainly between seasons. Over 50 viral families were found, which were specific to vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, fungi, bacteria, and protozoa. In rural areas, Siphoviridae (6.5%) was the most common viral family harbored by mosquitoes captured during winter and spring, while Luteoviridae (1.1%) was the most common viral family harbored by mosquitoes captured during summer and autumn. Myoviridae (7.0% and 1.3%) was the most common viral family in mosquitoes captured in urban areas during all seasons. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) was detected by PCR in a female mosquito pool. The first near full-length HBV genome from Ae. albopictus was amplified, which showed a high level of similarity with human HBV genotype B sequences. Human parechovirus (HPeV) was detected in male and female mosquito pools, and the sequences were clustered with HPeV 1 and 3 sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Large numbers of viral species were found in adult Ae. albopictus, including viruses from vertebrates, insects, and plants. The viral composition in Ae. albopictus mainly varied between seasons. Herein, we are the first to report the detection of HPeV and HBV in mosquitoes.

The objective was to examine whether subarachnoid hemorrhage(SAH) hospitalizations and ruptured aneurysm coiling interventions demonstrated similar declines. Methods: We conducted a global, retrospective, observational study across 6 continents, 37 countries, and 140 comprehensive stroke centers. Patients with diagnosis of SAH, ruptured aneurysm coiling interventions, COVID-19 were identified using ICD-10 codes or by prospectively maintained stroke databases. The 3-month cumulative volume, monthly volumes for SAH hospitalizations and ruptured aneurysm coiling procedures were compared for the period before (1- year and immediately before) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1 to May 31, 2020). Results: There was a significant decline in SAH hospitalizations with 2,044 admissions in the 3 months immediately before and 1,585 admissions during the pandemic, representing a decline of 22.5% (95%CI, -24.3 to -20.7, p&lt;0.0001). Embolization of ruptured aneurysms declined with 1,170 to 1,035 procedures, respectively, representing an 11.5%(95%CI, -13.5 to -9.8, p=0.002) drop. Hospitals with higher COVID-19 hospitalization burden demonstrated greater declines in SAH and ruptured aneurysm coiling compared to lower COVID-19 burden. A relative increase in coiling of ruptured aneurysms was noted in low coiling volume hospitals of 41.1% (95%CI, 32.3-50.6, p=0.008) despite a decrease in SAH admissions in this tertile. Conclusions: There was a global decrease in subarachnoid hemorrhage admissions and ruptured aneurysm embolizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among low-volume coiling SAH hospitals, there was an increase in the ruptured aneurysm coiling intervention. These findings in SAH are consistent with a global decrease in other emergencies such as stroke and myocardial infarction.","output":"Global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on subarachnoid hemorrhage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a respiratory infection similar to viral pneumonia and is caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Despite appreciable research, identification of targeted populations for testing and tracking the spread of COVID-19 at a larger scale is an intimidating challenge. There is a need to quickly identify the infected individual or community to check the spread. The diagnostic testing done at large-scale for individuals has limitations as it cannot provide information at a swift pace in large populations, which is pivotal to contain the spread at the early stage of its breakouts. Recently, scientists are exploring the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the faeces discharged in municipal wastewater. Wastewater sampling could be a potential tool to expedite the early identification of infected communities by detecting the biomarkers from the virus. However, it needs a targeted approach to choose optimized locations for wastewater sampling. The present study proposes a novel fuzzy based Bayesian model to identify targeted populations and optimized locations with a maximum probability of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater networks. Consequently, real time monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater using autosamplers or biosensors could be deployed efficiently. Fourteen criteria such as population density, patients with comorbidity, quarantine and hospital facilities, etc. are analysed using the data of 14 lac individuals infected by COVID-19 in the USA. The uniqueness of the proposed model is its ability to deal with the uncertainty associated with the data and decision maker's opinions using fuzzy logic, which is fused with Bayesian approach. The evidence-based virus detection in wastewater not only facilitates focused testing, but also provides potential communities for vaccine distribution. Consequently, governments can reduce lockdown periods, thereby relieving human stress and boosting economic growth.","output":"Detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA prone clusters in a municipal wastewater network using fuzzy-Bayesian optimization model to facilitate wastewater-based epidemiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Treatment guidelines do not recommend antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections (ARI), except for streptococcal pharyngitis/tonsillitis and pneumonia. However, antibiotics are prescribed frequently for children with ARI, often in absence of evidence for bacterial infection. The objectives of this study were 1) to assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for mild ARI in paediatric outpatients in relation to available guidelines and detected pathogens, 2) to assess antibiotic use on presentation using questionnaires and detection in urine 3) to assess the carriage rates and proportions of resistant intestinal Enterobacteriaceae before, during and after consultation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were prospectively enrolled in Childrens Hospital 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and diagnoses, prescribed therapy and outcome were recorded on first visit and on follow-up after 7 days. Respiratory bacterial and viral pathogens were detected using molecular assays. Antibiotic use before presentation was assessed using questionnaires and urine HPLC. The impact of antibiotic usage on intestinal Enterobacteriaceae was assessed with semi-quantitative culture on agar with and without antibiotics on presentation and after 7 and 28 days. RESULTS: A total of 563 patients were enrolled between February 2009 and February 2010. Antibiotics were prescribed for all except 2 of 563 patients. The majority were 2(nd) and 3(rd) generation oral cephalosporins and amoxicillin with or without clavulanic acid. Respiratory viruses were detected in respiratory specimens of 72.5% of patients. Antibiotic use was considered inappropriate in 90.1% and 67.5%, based on guidelines and detected pathogens, respectively. On presentation parents reported antibiotic use for 22% of patients, 41% of parents did not know and 37% denied antibiotic use. Among these three groups, six commonly used antibiotics were detected with HPLC in patients urine in 49%, 40% and 14%, respectively. Temporary selection of 3(rd) generation cephalosporin resistant intestinal Enterobacteriaceae during antibiotic use was observed, with co-selection of resistance to aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSIONS: We report overuse and overprescription of antibiotics for uncomplicated ARI with selection of resistant intestinal Enterobacteriaceae, posing a risk for community transmission and persistence in a setting of a highly granular healthcare system and unrestricted access to antibiotics through private pharmacies.

METHODS: We evaluated 159 patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), 38 of whom with NIV as the ceiling of treatment, admitted to an ordinary ward and treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and respiratory physiotherapy. Treatment failure and death were correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters in the whole cohort and in patients with NIV as the ceiling of treatment. RESULTS: Patients who had NIV as the ceiling of treatment were elderly, with a low BMI and a high burden of comorbidities, showed clinical and laboratory signs of multi-organ insufficiency on admission and of rapidly deteriorating vital signs during the first week of treatment. NIV failure occurred overall in 77 (48%) patients, and 27/38 patients with NIV as the ceiling of treatment died. Congestive heart failure, chronic benign haematological diseases and inability/refusal to receive respiratory physiotherapy were independently associated to NIV failure and mortality. Need for increased positive end-expiratory pressures and low platelets were associated with NIV failure. Death was associated to cerebrovascular disease, need for CPAP cycles longer than 12h and, in the subgroup of patients with NIV as the ceiling of treatment, was heralded by vital sign deterioration within 48 h.

The present investigation carried out during OctCDec 2019 attempts to assess the parameters, such as quality of groundwater and soil along three depths (0C5, 5C15 and 15C30 cm), in proximity to a dumping site in Silchar, a rapidly evolving city of North-East India. Standard protocols of soil and water quality assessments were carried out. The pH values of the surface soils were found to be slightly acidic. Decrease in acidity with increasing depth was observed in the study site. The relative abundance of the analyzed elements at all soil depths was Zn > Fe > Ni > Cu > Cr. Weak correlation between the concentration of Cu, Fe and Zn, and the bulk density of the soil highlighted the micronutrient status of the soil. The impact of the nearby dumpsite on trace element contamination is indicated by the extremely contaminated status of the soils with respect to geo-accumulation index. Majority of the groundwater samples exhibited pH levels below the desired limits, making it unfit for consumption by local communities. While Fe, Cu and Ni levels in groundwater samples exceeded the guideline values, Cr and Zn concentrations were found to be within limits except one sample.

Poorly constructed guidelines that are not comprehensive and are ambiguous may compromise HCWs safety. We aimed to develop and validate a tool to appraise guidelines on infection prevention strategies in HCWs. Methods: A 3-stage, web-based, Delphi consensus-building process among a panel of diverse HCWs and healthcare managers was utilised. We validated the tool by appraising 40 international, specialty-specific and procedure-specific guidelines along with national guidelines from countries with a wide range of gross national income. Results: Overall consensus (>75%) was reached at the end of three rounds for all six domains included in the tool. The chosen domains allowed appraisal of guidelines in relation to general characteristics (domain-1), recommendations on engineering (domain-2) and administrative aspects (domain 4-6) of infection prevention, as well as personal protection equipment (PPE) use (domain-3). The appraisal tool performed well across all domains and inter-rater agreement was excellent. All included guidelines performed relatively better in domains 1-3 compared with domains 4-6 and this was more evident in guidelines originating from lower income countries. Conclusion: The guideline appraisal tool was robust and easy to use.

Among patients with cancer, those undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) or adjuvant chemotherapy (Adj chemo) for early breast cancer (EBC) are at particularly high risk for inferior outcomes, in part, because optimal timing of chemotherapy is essential for promoting distant disease-free survival. COVID-19 data from the ongoing multicenter I-SPY 2 trial of NAC for EBC provides a window into the magnitude of the problem of treatment interruption, not only for the trial itself but also for routine Adj chemo. In the I-SPY 2 trial, 4.5% of patients had disruption of therapy by COVID-19, prior to wide vaccine availability, suggesting that nationally up to 5,700 patients with EBC were at risk for adverse outcomes from COVID-19 infection in 2020. To address this problem, vaccine education and public engagement are essential to overcome hesitancy, while equity of distribution is needed to address access. To accomplish these goals, healthcare organizations (HCO) need to not only call out disinformation but also engage the public with vaccine education and find common ground for vaccine acceptance, while partnering with state/local governments to improve efficiency of vaccine distribution. These approaches are important to improve trial access and to reduce susceptibility to COVID-19, as the pandemic could continue to impact access to clinical trials and routine cancer treatment.","output":"A Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Trial for Early Breast Cancer is Impacted by COVID-19: Addressing Vaccination and Cancer Trials Through Education, Equity, and Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the pandemic began in 2020, Remdesivir has been widely used for the treatment of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).

CASE SUMMARY: A 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and lung cancer was hospitalized for COVID-19. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission demonstrated atrial fibrillation and right bundle branch block. He was started on a course of Dexamethasone and Remdesivir. Within 24 h of starting Remdesivir, he was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with ventricular rates between 30 and 40 b.p.m. On Day 5 of Remdesivir therapy, ECG demonstrated complete AV block. Having completed the Remdesivir regimen, during the next 48 h, he was closely monitored, and the AV block resolved spontaneously. As he remained asymptomatic and had an adequate chronotropic response with activity, pacemaker implantation was not recommended. DISCUSSION: Despite the widespread use of Remdesivir, there is little known information about its cardiac toxicity. Daily ECGs and close cardiac surveillance of patients who develop severe bradycardia or AV block are essential.

Regular use of COVID-Guide could help collect epidemiological data on the spread of (suspected) covid-19 cases, easily and quickly available in all countries where the tool will be used. Using the SSDC could help reduce the load on operators. Furthermore, the use of anonymous and geolocatable clinical data together with the generation of alerts and indicators produced by COVID-Guide could become a useful tool for epidemiological surveillance in the future phases of the pandemic (Telemedical Syndromic Surveillance).","output":"[COVID-Guide: an app for covid-19 triage and self-assessment.]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: This study evaluated the impact of previous glycemic control and in-hospital use of antidiabetic/antihypertensive drugs on the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with diabetes. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, consecutive inpatients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled from Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China). Patients without diabetes were matched to those with diabetes based on age, sex, and comorbidities. All patients were followed up to a clinical endpoint (discharge, worsening including transferring to ICU or immediate death). Data and outcomes were extracted from medical records and analyzed. RESULTS: 64 patients with pre-existing diabetes were included in this study, with 128 matched patients without diabetes included as a control group. Patients with diabetes had a higher rate of worsening (18.8% versus 7.8%, p = 0.025). Multivariable regression showed increased odds of worsening associated with previous glycemic control reflected by HbA1c (odds ratio 3.29, 95% CI 1.19-9.13, p = 0.022) and receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve identified HbA1c of 8.6% (70 mmol/mol) as the optimal cut-off value. Univariate analysis demonstrated the in-hospital use of antidiabetic/antihypertensive drugs were not associated with a higher risk of worsening. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with diabetes had a higher risk of worsening, especially those with poorly-controlled HbA1c, with an optimal cut-off value of 8.6%.

Among various scaffold decoration techniques, coating surfaces with cell-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) is a rapidly growing field of research. In this study, for the first time, this technology was applied using primary dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and tested for use in artificial bone tissue construction. METHODS: Rat DPSCs were grown on three-dimensional-printed porous polylactic acid scaffolds for 7 days. After the predetermined time, samples were decellularized, and the remaining ECM detailed proteomic analysis was performed. Further, DPSC-secreated ECM impact to mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) behaviour as well as its role in osteoregeneration induction were analysed. RESULTS: It was identified that DPSC-specific ECM protein network ornamenting surface-enhanced MSC attachment, migration and proliferation and even promoted spontaneous stem cell osteogenesis. This protein network also demonstrated angiogenic properties and did not stimulate MSCs to secrete molecules associated with scaffold rejection. With regard to bone defects, DPSC-derived ECM recruited endogenous stem cells, initiating the bone self-healing process. Thus, the DPSC-secreted ECM network was able to significantly enhance artificial bone construct integration and induce successful tissue regeneration.

Those patients are often treated with commonly used antiviral and antihypertensive agents concomitantly, such as ritonavir-containing regimens and nifedipine. Since ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, when nifedipine is combined with ritonavir-containing antiviral drugs, there is a potential risk of drug-drug interaction. This study aimed to provide guidance on nifedipine treatment during and after co-administration with ritonavir-containing regimens using a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) analysis. Methods A PBPK/PD model was developed for nifedipine by the software of Simcyp, and the model was verified using published data. The effects of ritonavir on nifedipine exposures and systolic blood pressure were assessed for instant-release, sustained-release and controlled-release formulations. Moreover, various nifedipine regimens were investigated when co-administrated with and withdrawing ritonavir. Results PBPK/PD models for three formulations of nifedipine were successfully established. The model predicted pharmacokinetic profiles of nifedipine were comparable to the published data. Ratios of predicted versus observed AUCDDI/AUCNifedipine of nifedipine were within 0.70- to 1.83-fold. Model simulations showed that the inhibitory effect of ritonavir on CYP3A4 increased the Cmax of nifedipine by 9.82-34.35 times and the AUC by 44.94-50.77 times at steady state. Moreover, nifedipine dose reduced to 1/16 of the regular dose during ritonavir co-administration could lead to severe hypotension. Conclusions Ritonavir had a pronounced influence on the pharmacokinetics and antihypertensive effect of nifedipine.

However, many PWH live too far from their Haemophilia Comprehensive Care Centre (HCCC) to receive regular treatment at their HCCC. Physiotherapists in primary care may have limited experience with a rare disease like haemophilia. AIM To explore experiences of stakeholders with primary care physiotherapy for PWH and develop recommendations to optimize physiotherapy care coordination. METHODS A RAND approach was used, consisting of a Delphi procedure with e-mailed questionnaires and a consensus meeting. Included stakeholders were PWH, physiotherapists from HCCC's and primary care physiotherapists. HCCC physiotherapists approached patients from their centre and primary care physiotherapists from their network to fill in the questionnaires. Purposive sampling was used to select participants from the survey sample for the consensus meeting. RESULTS Ninety-six primary care physiotherapists, 54 PWH and eight HCCC physiotherapists completed the questionnaire. Subsequently, four PWH, three primary care physiotherapists and four HCCC physiotherapists participated in the consensus meeting. The questionnaires yielded 33 recommendations, merged into a final list of 20 recommendations based on the consensus meeting. The final rank-order consists of 13 recommendations prioritized by at least one stakeholder. CONCLUSION Commitment to a formal network is considered not feasible for a rare disease like haemophilia.

In this study, we sought to elucidate the pandemic's effects on mental health and access to care for perinatal individuals. METHODS: This cross-sectional study of individuals in Massachusetts who were pregnant or up to three months postpartum with a history of depressive symptoms examined associations between demographics and psychiatric symptoms (via validated mental health screening instruments) and the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on mental health and access to care. Chi-square associations and multivariate regression models were used. RESULTS: Of 163 participants, 80.8% perceived increased symptoms of depression and 88.8% of anxiety due to the pandemic. Positive screens for depression, anxiety, and/or PTSD at time of interview, higher education, and income were associated with increased symptoms of depression and anxiety due to the pandemic. Positive screens for depression, anxiety, and/or PTSD were also associated with perceived changes in access to mental healthcare. Compared to non-Hispanic White participants, participants of color (Black, Asian, Multiracial, and/or Hispanic/Latinx) were more likely to report that the pandemic changed their mental healthcare access (aOR:3.25, 95%CI:1.23, 8.59). LIMITATIONS: Limitations included study generalizability, given that participants have a history of depressive symptoms, and cross-sectional design. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has increased symptoms of perinatal depression and anxiety and impacted perceived access to care.

We use SAP to assess whether draft data are sufficient or finished sequencing is required using Marburg and variola virus sequences. Simulations indicate that intermediate to high-quality draft with error rates of 10(?3)C10(?5) (8 coverage) of target organisms is suitable for DNA signature prediction. Low-quality draft with error rates of 1% (3 to 6 coverage) of target isolates is inadequate for DNA signature prediction, although low-quality draft of NNs is sufficient, as long as the target genomes are of high quality. For protein signature prediction, sequencing errors in target genomes substantially reduce the detection of amino acid sequence conservation, even if the draft is of high quality. In summary, high-quality draft of target and low-quality draft of NNs appears to be a cost-effective investment for DNA signature prediction, but may lead to underestimation of predicted protein signatures.","output":"Draft versus finished sequence data for DNA and protein diagnostic signature development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus-like particles were observed in the giant cells of a mammary adenoma of a snow leopard kept in captivity.

OBJECTIVES: Based on our experience conducting a school-based randomized intervention trial in Baltimore, Maryland, we present strategies for conducting research with low-income, urban youth of color. We discuss strategies in three domains: university-community partnership development, participant recruitment, and participant retention. METHODS: We reviewed partnership building and recruitment strategies employed by our team across four years of trial implementation and evaluated success of participant retention at our final survey timepoint. RESULTS: Partnership building was facilitated by selecting a study design that maximized benefits for all participants, facilitation of capacity building at partner institutions, and attention to research staff hiring and training practices. Effective study recruitment strategies included personal contact with parents and close cooperation between school personnel and study staff. Providing incentives and collecting multiple types of participant contact information contributed to increased retention rates. On average, those who participated in the final survey timepoint were less likely to be male and Latinx and exhibited more favorable baseline mental health than those who did not, suggesting differential attrition based on youth characteristics.

Postmortem analysis of serum IgE can provide helpful information for determining anaphylaxis. However, postmortem serum always suffers from hemolysis. To investigate the interference of hemolysis on postmortem analysis of total IgE by electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) and verify the suitability of the commercially available ECLIA kit for postmortem hemolyzed blood with the dilution-correction method, different levels of hemolyzed serum were prepared to evaluate the interference of hemolysis. A linear regression analysis was then performed on the concentration of total IgE in the completely hemolyzed blood and the corresponding serum. Our results indicated that hemolysis negatively interfered with the total IgE analysis by ECLIA and the interference (|Bias%|) increased with increasing levels of hemolysis. After controlling for |Bias%| by dilution, the test concentration of total IgE in the completely hemolyzed blood was still significantly lower than that in the serum (P < 0.05) and resulted in eight false-negative cases. A strong correlation was observed between the test concentration of total IgE in the completely hemolyzed blood and that in the serum (r = 0.983). After correction by the regression formula, the corrected concentration revealed no significant differences and exhibited the same diagnostic ability, compared with the serum total IgE concentration.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort trial conducted at the University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston, Texas. All pregnant women presented to our medical center, who were screened and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus, were included. We stratified our study population in three groups: asymptomatic, symptomatic not requiring oxygen therapy, and patients requiring oxygen support to maintain oxygen saturation >94%. Relevant population characteristics, laboratory data, and maternal and neonatal outcomes were abstracted. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Between March and July 2020, 91 women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 upon admission to our labor and delivery unit. Among these, 61.5% were asymptomatic, 34.1% were symptomatic, and 4.4% required oxygen support. Our population was mainly Hispanic (80.2%), multiparous (76.9%), obese (70.3%), and with a median age of 27 years. Median gestational age at symptom onset or diagnosis was 36 weeks. Significant differences were found between gestational age and disease severity. Maternal characteristics including age, body mass index (BMI), and presence of comorbid conditions did not appear to influence severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Significant laboratory findings associated with increasing disease severity included decreasing hemoglobin and white blood cell count, lymphopenia, and increasing levels of inflammatory markers including CRP, ferritin, and procalcitonin. Maternal and neonatal outcomes did not differ among groups. No SARS-CoV-2 was detected by polymerase chain reaction testing in neonates of mothers with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Pregnant patients with COVID-19 infection are predominantly asymptomatic. Patients appear to be at increased risk for more severe infection requiring oxygen support later in pregnancy.

METHOD: Twenty\\\\four people living with dementia (PLWD), 95 caregivers (on behalf of PLWD) and 38 healthy older controls anonymously reported their experiences of wearing face coverings and the associated impacts on communication via an online survey that ran between December 2020 and April 2021 (age ranges: PLWD 38\\\\90 years; controls 32\\\\100 years). The majority of questions were self\\\\reflective experiences compared to when not wearing face coverings. Mann\\\\Whitney U tests were used to compare Likert ratings for impact of wearing face coverings on aspects of speaking, listening and holding conversations between PLWD or diagnosis subgroups (27 PPA; 26 Frontotemporal Dementia, FTD; 29 Alzheimers disease, AD; 24 Posterior Cortical Atrophy, PCA) and the controls. RESULT: Wearing a face covering made both speaking (80%) and listening (90%) more effortful for the majority of survey respondents and had a greater impact on people living with PPA. Overall PLWD were more likely to require help communicating and those with PPA relied more on non\\\\verbal strategies (e.g. body language or gestures) than when not wearing a face covering, compared to controls (p=0.001) and other diagnosis subgroups. People with PPA also experienced greater difficulty understanding across diverse everyday listening conditions and most aspects of conversation than controls (p<0.05). People with PCA (p=0.039) also had more difficulty knowing when it was their turn to speak and those with FTD had more difficulty speaking over others (p=0.032), compared to controls.

However, results can be badly affected by non-response. One way to potentially reduce non-response is by sending potential study participants advance communication. The last systematic review to examine the effect of questionnaire pre-notification on response is 10 years old, and lacked a risk of bias assessment. OBJECTIVES Update the section of the Cochrane systematic review, Edwards et al. (2009), on pre-notification to include 1) recently published studies, 2) an assessment of risk of bias, 3) Explore if heterogeneity is reduced by: delay between pre-contact and questionnaire delivery, the method of pre-contact, if pre-contact and questionnaire delivery differ, if the pre-contact includes a foot-in-the-door manipulation, and study's the risk of bias. METHODS Inclusion criteria: population: any population, intervention: comparison of some type of pre-notification, comparison group: no pre-notification, outcome: response rates. STUDY DESIGN randomised controlled trails. EXCLUSION CRITERIA NA. DATA SOURCES Studies which cited or were included in Edwards et al. (2009); We additionally searched: CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycInfo, MEDLINE, EconLit, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, Cochrane CMR, ERIC, and Sociological Abstracts. The searches were implemented in June 2018 and May 2021. Study screening: a single reviewer screened studies, with a random 10% sample independently screened to ascertain accuracy. DATA EXTRACTION data was extracted by a single reviewer twice, with a week between each extraction. Risk of Bias: within studies bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (ROB1) by a single unblinded reviewer, across studies bias was assessed using funnel plots. Synthesis Method: study results were meta-analysed with a random effects model using the final response rate as the outcome. Evaluation of Uncertainty: Uncertainty was evaluated using the GRADE approach. RESULTS One hundred seven trials were included with 211,802 participants. Over-all pre-notification increased response, OR = 1.33 (95% CI: 1.20-1.47). However, there was a large amount of heterogeneity (I2 = 97.1%), which was not explained by the subgroup analyses. In addition, when studies at high or unclear risk of bias were excluded the effect was to reduced OR = 1.09 (95% CI: 0.99-1.20). Because of the large amount of heterogeneity, even after restricting to low risk of bias studies, there is still moderate uncertainty in these results. CONCLUSIONS Using the GRADE evaluation, this review finds moderate evidence that pre-notification may not have an effect on response rates. FUNDING Economic and Social Research Council.

The radiologist compared the tumor regression before and after chemotherapy by computed tomography (CT). The survival of all patients was obtained by telephone follow-up. Multivariate Cox regression was used to assess the relationship between overall risk of death and Mandard score, imaging evaluation, and ypN stage. Results. In the Mandard score (4-5) group, the median survival time for PR and ypN0 patients was 68.5 and 76.7 months.

DESIGN Prospective crossover randomized controlled trial. SETTING University hospital ICU. PATIENTS Fourteen intubated patients mechanically ventilated for acute respiratory failure. INTERVENTIONS Six 25-minute trials randomly performed applying both pressure support ventilation and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist during wakefulness and with two doses of propofol, administered by Target Control Infusion, determining light (1.26  0.35 g/mL) and deep (2.52  0.71 g/mL) sedation, as defined by the bispectral index and Ramsay Sedation Scale. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We measured electrical activity of the diaphragm to assess neural drive and calculated its integral over time during 1 minute (electrical activity of the diaphragm/min) to estimate diaphragm energy expenditure (effort), arterial blood gases, airway pressure, tidal volume and its coefficient of variation, respiratory rate, neural timing components, and calculated the ineffective triggering index. Increasing the depth of sedation did not cause significant modifications of respiratory timing, while determined a progressive significant decrease in neural drive (with both modes) and effort (in pressure support ventilation only). In pressure support ventilation, the difference in ineffective triggering index between wakefulness and light sedation was negligible (from 5.9% to 7.6%, p = 0.97); with deep sedation, however, ineffective triggering index increased up to 21.8% (p < 0.0001, compared to both wakefulness and light sedation). With neurally adjusted ventilatory assist, ineffective triggering index fell to 0%, regardless of the depth of sedation. With both modes, deep sedation caused a significant increase in PaCO2, which resulted, however, from different breathing patterns and patient-ventilator interactions. CONCLUSIONS In pressure support ventilation, deep propofol sedation increased asynchronies, while light sedation did not. Propofol reduced the respiratory drive, while breathing timing was not significantly affected.

In this article, we look at the anxiety problems that some parents and their children might experience when school reopens after the COVID-19 lockdown. Using a behavioral theory of development, we provide suggestions for how to handle the departure and separation problems that may emerge as parents drop their children off at school. Many parents are unsure about how to handle anxiety or fear as their children return to school or have to visit other environments outside their homes. Social distancing has caused families to develop stronger dependencies at home and to create new routines that vary, in many instances greatly, from their prepandemic routines. Families are adjusting to the new normal. They are keeping their children busy with schoolwork as best they can. In particular, families have likely developed close attachment relationships. Families have been struggling with an unprecedented lockdown, and for many parents and their children, this extended period of family confinement and severe restrictions has been especially stressful, and the timing for returning to school is uncertain. We emphasize here that parents can be responsive to their childrens needs, plan ahead, provide reassurance, and depart firmly without vacillating, and we provide other tips to avoid inadvertently shaping childrens negative or anxiety behaviors as they go back to school.

Among coronaviruses, the main protease (M(pro)) is an essential drug target which, along with papain-like proteases catalyzes the processing of polyproteins translated from viral RNA and recognizes specific cleavage sites. There are no human proteases with similar cleavage specificity and therefore, inhibitors are highly likely to be nontoxic. Therefore, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) enzyme with small molecules can block viral replication. The present study is aimed at the identification of promising lead molecules for SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) enzyme through virtual screening of antiviral compounds from plants. The binding affinity of selected small drug-like molecules to SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), SARS-CoV M(pro) and MERS-CoV M(pro) were studied using molecular docking. Bonducellpin D was identified as the best lead molecule which shows higher binding affinity (?9.28 kcal/mol) as compared to the control (?8.24 kcal/mol). The molecular binding was stabilized through four hydrogen bonds with Glu166 and Thr190 as well as hydrophobic interactions via eight residues. The SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) shows identities of 96.08% and 50.65% to that of SARS-CoV M(pro) and MERS-CoV M(pro) respectively at the sequence level. At the structural level, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and SARS-CoV M(pro) was found to be 0.517 ? and 0.817 ? between SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and MERS-CoV M(pro).

SR) and the original formulation (reference preparation [R]: Glucophage? XR) in 36 healthy Chinese volunteers under postprandial conditions. METHODS Subjects received 500 mg T/R in each period, with a 7-day washout period. Venous blood samples of 4 mL each were collected from each subject 19 times spanning predose (0 h) to 36 h postdose. The metformin concentration in deproteinized plasma was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Bioequivalence (80.00-125.00%) was assessed by adjusted geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and two-sided 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) for each component. SAS 9.4 software was used for statistical analysis and Phoenix WinNonlin software v7 was used to analyze the pharmacokinetic parameters. RESULTS Thirty-four volunteers completed the clinical study. The 90% CIs (96.12-105.44% for AUC from time zero to the time of the last measurable concentration [AUCt], 96.22-105.54% for AUC extrapolated from time zero to infinity [AUC], and 98.42-105.00% for Cmax) of T/R adjusted GMRs were within the bioequivalence acceptance range of 80.00-125.00%, indicating that they are bioequivalent.

Many researchers have expressed their conclusions from different perspectives on various factors such as spatial changes, climate risks, preparedness, blood type, age and comorbidities that may be contributing to COVID-19 mortality rate. However, as the number of people coming to the hospital for COVID-19 treatment increases, the mortality rate is likely to increase due to the lack of medical facilities. In order to provide medical assistance in this situation, we need to consider not only the extent of the disease impact, but also other important factors. No method has yet been proposed to calculate the priority of patients taking into account all the factors. We have provided a solution to this in this research article. Based on eight key factors, we provide a way to determine priorities. In order to achieve the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method, we studied individuals with different results on all factors. The sigmoid function helps to easily construct factors at different levels. In addition, the Cobweb solution model allows us to see the potential of our proposed algorithm very clearly. Using the method we introduced, it is easier to sort high-risk individuals to low-risk individuals. This will make it easier to deal with problems that arise when the number of patients in hospitals continues to increase. It can reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients.

We demonstrate that viral expression of IL-10, which occurs during the peak of virus replication and at the site of disease, enhanced survival and diminished morbidity in rJ2.2-infected wild-type B6 and IL-10(-/-) mice. The protective effects of increased IL-10 levels were associated with reductions in microglial activation, inflammatory cell infiltration into the brain, and proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production. Additionally, IL-10 increased both the frequency and number of Foxp3(+) regulatory CD4 T cells in the infected central nervous system. Most strikingly, the ameliorating effects of IL-10 produced during the first 5 days after infection were long acting, resulting in decreased demyelination during the resolution phase of the infection. Collectively, these results suggest that the pathogenic processes that result in demyelination are initiated early during infection and that they can be diminished by exogenous IL-10 delivered soon after disease onset.

The necessary restrictive measures applied, especially in the first stages of the pandemic, had an impact in the accessibility of psychiatric patients to the mental health services, both in- and outpatient ones.6 This led to decreased outpatient appointments and admissions in inpatient wards, depriving a large number of these patients from necessary treatments and interventions, often resulting in worsening their mental state or relapse of acute episodes. The lack of accessibility to mental health services, had a greater impact on persons with social and financial problems, which deteriorated during the pandemic, leading to mental health problems.3 An additional problem is that persons suffering from severe mental disorders, such as chronic psychoses, face a greater risk of infection and death by Covid-19.7 These problems, arising during the pandemic (increased prevalence of mental disorders, increase of relapses of serious mental disorders, increased risk of infection and death by Covid-19, increased prevalence in those infected, especially those in the ICUs, problems of accessibility) underline the chronic insufficiencies of the mental health care system, which in many countries, especially in Greece, is fragmented and is not covering adequately the mental health needs of the population.

Among the 32 COVID-19 volunteers, the median interval from the onset of symptoms to semen collection was 4 days [IQR: 0C8]. Only one presented positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in semen and seminal plasma fractions, although the spermatozoa pellet was negative. Viral cultures were all negative. We observed slightly higher concentrations of bacterial DNA in the SARS-CoV-2 positive specimen than in all negative samples. The bacteria identified neither confirm nor rule out contamination by oropharyngeal secretions during collection. SARS-CoV-2 was rarely present in semen during the acute phase of the disease. This very rare situation could be connected to oral or manual contamination during semen collection. The possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen calls for nasopharyngeal viral testing and strict hygiene protocols during semen collection before assisted reproductive attempts.","output":"Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 in semen, seminal plasma, and spermatozoa pellet of COVID-19 patients in the acute stage of infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines are among the most successful and cost-effective public health tools and have greatly contributed to eliminating or controlling several serious vaccine-treatable diseases over the past century. To curb the spread of COVID-19, efficacious vaccination is emerging as essential in mitigating the disease and preventing deaths. Health care workers (HCW) are one of the first groups to receive vaccinations, so it is important to consider their attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination to better address barriers to widespread vaccination acceptance. This study aimed to evaluate variables that are linked with the recommendation of vaccines and intention to take-up vaccination against COVID-19 among the HCWs, in the context of the current pandemic. The study was conducted during the first week of the vaccination campaign dedicated to Italian HCWs, beginning in December 2020, and it involved all doctors in a public hospital in Sicily. The following questionnaires were administered: (1) The perceived vaccine trust questionnaire, measuring the degree of trust in vaccines by healthcare professionals both in general and for the protection of healthcare professionals themselves and patients; (2) the positive and negative affect scale-state (PANAS), for assessing positive and negative emotions in relation to their work as frontline care providers; (3) The locus of control of behaviour (LCB) to measure the extent to which subjects perceive responsibility for their personal behaviour (internal vs. external); (4) recommendation vaccines item, referring to the intention to recommend vaccination. The findings suggest that socio-demographic control variables (age, gender, and seniority) showed little or no predictive power in vaccine recommendation, while vaccine confidence, positive emotions, and internal locus of control were excellent predictors of vaccine recommendations by doctors. Younger doctors, both in age and experience, are more confident in vaccines and recommend them more frequently.

We sought to know whether the timing of prophylactic doses of LMWH during the course of COVID-19 may affect the time to SARS-CoV-2 nasal-oropharyngeal swab negativization. METHODS: Retrospective monocentric cross-sectional study on patients requiring sub-intensive ward admission due to first SARS-CoV-2 infection and undergoing early (EH; within 7 days from COVID-19 signs and symptoms onset) versus delayed prophylactic LMWH (DH; after 7 days). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was measured by reverse transcription real-time PCR according to scheduled time points: first swab after 2 weeks from COVID-19 onset, then at 1-week intervals until negativity. RESULTS: Time to SARS-CoV-2 swab negativity was shorter in EH (38 patients) compared with DH (55 patients): 22 versus 37 days (P=0.004). The number of confirmative negative swabs in EH was significantly higher compared with DH at week 2 (21.1% versus 3.6%; P=0.017) and 4 (60.0% versus 19.6%; P<0.001). At univariate, EH differed from DH for several disease severity and clinical management parameters. Nevertheless, after accounting for the differences, Cox regression showed early LMWH administration (hazard ratio [HR] 2.91 [1.51, 5.63]; P=0.002) and higher lymphocytes nadir (HR 1.04 [1.01, 1.08]; P=0.020) as predictors of shorter time to swab negativity.

Cancer patients seem to exhibit exacerbated conditions and higher mortality rates. Vaccines are a promising solution to minimize the problem amongst cancer patients but there are limitations to be considered. Case summary: Herein, we present two cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) cases which were in long-term remission and experienced a flare after immunization with a viral vector COVID-19 vaccine (Vaxzevria, Oxford/AstraZeneca). The first case was a 60-year-old male with early-stage (T1a) folliculotropic mycosis fungoides (MF) clinically presented as alopecia areata-like lesions. The patient was in clinical remission during the last two years, maintaining a T1aN0M0 stage with only a single, stable alopecic patch on the scalp. Four weeks after the first COVID-19 vaccine dose, a minor lichenoid induration was observed in the periphery of the lesion, while a week after the second dose, small nodules surrounding the lesion were also noted. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of CD30+ Large cell transformation (LCT) of tumor-stage MF. The second case was a 73-year-old female with early-stage MF (T1a/IA) and Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP). Clinically, she presented with pruritic erythematous patches and nodules on the trunk and upper legs. The patient was successfully treated with psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) phototherapy remaining in clinical remission for six years. After vaccination, she developed multiple erythematous papules and nodules on the trunk and limbs. A flare of LyP was confirmed from the pathology, which correlated to her clinical picture. Discussion: These cases raise the question of whether and via which pathways the vaccine might induce disease exacerbation of both MF and LyP. According to the literature, the education of T (CD4+ and CD8+) and B cells against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein appears to be the main strategy for COVID-19 vaccine production. Both cancers and viral infections can provide a chronic and persistent antigenic load, leading to up-regulated programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) expression and ultimately T cell exhaustion. CD30 is known to be expressed in a small subset of activated T and B cells, as well as a variety of lymphoid neoplasms. Initial studies showed that CD30 expression on lymphocytes could be induced via in vitro antigenic stimulation by mitogens or viruses. CD30 expression also appears to be higher on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing a Th2-type cytokine profile. In our cases, the viral vector-based vaccines used do not contain a live virus but specific parts of the coronavirus attached to adenovirus, which can also stimulate an anti-viral immune response. Conclusion: The reported cases suggest that disease flare-ups may be associated with overproduction and exhaustion of CD4+/CD8+ T cells expressing CD30 after stimulation by the adenovirus. Expression of CD30, which can be a marker for disease progression, was high in biopsy samples of our patients.","output":"Epi-P-04 Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) exacerbation after viral vector COVID-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV) is known to cause the most significant disease in the mink industry.

Peak systolic velocities (PSV) of 200cm/s and 275cm/s for CA and SMA, respectively, were compared with CTA. Subgroup analysis was performed for the patients with (n=21) and without (n=29) prior revascularization treatment of CMI. The diagnostic ability of E-DUS and TA-DUS was tested with crosstabulation analysis. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was performed, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to investigate the test accuracy. Results: In the patients with 70% stenosis, E-DUS had higher sensitivity than TA-DUS (91% vs 81% for CA and 100% vs 92% for SMA). AUC for SMA 70% in E-DUS was 0.75 and with TA-DUS 0.68.

There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for ZIKV, and exploration of therapies targeting host processes could avoid viral development of drug resistance. The purpose of our study was to determine if the non-toxic and widely used disaccharide trehalose, which showed antiviral activity against Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in our previous work, could restrict ZIKV infection in clinically relevant neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Trehalose is known to induce autophagy, the degradation and recycling of cellular components. Whether autophagy is proviral or antiviral for ZIKV is controversial and depends on cell type and specific conditions used to activate or inhibit autophagy. We show here that trehalose treatment of NPCs infected with recent ZIKV isolates from Panama and Puerto Rico significantly reduces viral replication and spread. In addition, we demonstrate that ZIKV infection in NPCs spreads primarily cell-to-cell as an expanding infectious center, and NPCs are infected via contact with infected cells far more efficiently than by cell-free virus. Importantly, ZIKV was able to spread in NPCs in the presence of neutralizing antibody.Importance Zika virus causes birth defects and can lead to neurological disease in adults. While infection rates are currently low, ZIKV remains a public health concern with no treatment or vaccine available. Targeting a cellular pathway to inhibit viral replication is a potential treatment strategy that avoids development of antiviral resistance. We demonstrate in this study that the non-toxic autophagy-inducing disaccharide trehalose reduces spread and output of ZIKV in infected neural progenitor cells (NPCs), the major cells infected in the fetus. We show that ZIKV spreads cell-to-cell in NPCs as an infectious center and that NPCs are more permissive to infection by contact with infected cells than by cell-free virus.

This article aims to propose guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemic in France. Methods: The authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and in local initiatives in France. Results: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities among patients with mental disorders during this pandemic: 1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found among patients with mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which are risk factors for severe covid-19 infection; 2) age (the elderly form the population most vulnerable to the coronavirus); 3) cognitive and behavioural disorders, which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and 4) psychosocial vulnerability as a result of stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly suited to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortages of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds have been closed, wards have high densities of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, and medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. There are also major issues when referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain the continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of \\"COVID+ units\\". These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and an internist / infectious disease specialist; all new entrants are placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nursing staff receives specific training, daily medical check-ups and close psychological support. Family visits are prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management are organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support patients when they get back home and to help them cope with the experience of confinement, which is liable to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of community mental health facilities is particularly disturbing for patients, but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of suicide risk and psycho-education strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private practice psychiatrists also have a crucial role of information towards their patients on confinement and barrier measures, and also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent in confinement: maintenance of regular sleep r, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic.

In addition, it is likely that the conflicts between the two countries intensify as the multilateralism would be threatened and protectionism would emerge in the post-COVID 19 era. Latin America is not an exception to this issue of the US-China conflict. In terms of national security, the United States has only option to react sensitively to the growing influence of China in Latin America, considering the geographical proximity between the United States and Latin America. For this reason, varied conflicts between the United States and China occur in Latin America. This study nvestigated the patterns of US-China rivalry that appeared in Latin America and analyzed the effects of this rivalry on Latin American countries in multifaceted ways. In Chapter 2, we examined how the US and Chinese foreign policies against Latin America have changed. Furthermore, we summarized specific policies against Latin America that were implemented under the Trump administration. The fundamental goal of the US policy was to occupy a regional hegemony in Latin America by giving them incentive and pressure. In particular, the Trump administration tended to weigh on Latin America in many sectors such as immigration, infrastructure, and so on. By contrast, Chinese policies against Latin America aim at maintaining cooperative relations with Latin America in the absence of specifics. In Chapter 3, we presented several examples of the US-China conflict that were observed in Latin America. This conflict was mostly prominent in the infrastructure sector, in which the United States was likely to press Latin America in order to exclude China from related projects. In Chapter 4, we conducted an empirical analysis by focusing on the trade dispute between the United States and China that occurred in 2018. Specifically, we analyzed the impact of the retaliatory tariffs between the two countries on exports of major Latin America countries to United States and China. In addition, we complementarily examined the effect of the trade dispute on the welfare of the Latin American countries with the CGE (Computational General Equilibrium) model. As a result of the empirical analysis, Brazils export to China have increased significantly since the imposition of the tariffs, and then the effect has disappeared over time. In contrast, there was no consistent pattern for countries other than Brazil. The impact of the US-China conflict on the welfare of the countries in Latin America was trivial. The conflict between the United States and China that occurs in Latin America could be an opportunity for Korean companies that seek to advance into Latin America. The companies may be given an unintended chance as Latin America is faced by US pressure to rule out China from infrastructure sector.

This article also explores the right to dismiss employees who are non-compliant with their obligations.What is known about the topic?It is well known that health workers are an at-risk population for COVID-19, particularly those with direct exposure to affected patients. Since early 2020, healthcare services have faced substantial challenges in managing employee risk while complying with Occupational, Health and Safety law in Australia.What does this paper add?This paper explores the standard of care that healthcare services owe their staff in terms of reduction of risk exposure within the current Australian legal framework, as well as the rights and obligations of healthcare service employees.What are the implications for practitioners?Health services should be aware of the range of legal obligations to protect healthcare workers from the consequences of COVID-19 in order to minimise risk as much as reasonably practicable for employees. This includes ensuring access to adequate personal protective equipment, psychological support, adequate hygiene and cleaning of the physical workspace as well as the appropriate reporting of incidents and exposures.","output":"Obligations of Australian health services as employers during COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus disease which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The purpose of this paper is to discuss the role of a pharmacokinetic and viral load analysis as a basis for adjusting immunoglobulin dosing to treat COVID-19. We reviewed the pre-clinical and clinical literature that describes the impact of a high antigen load on pharmacokinetic data following antibody treatment. Representative examples are provided to illustrate the effect of high viral and tumor loads on antibody clearance. We then highlight the implications of these factors for facilitating the development and dosing of hyperimmune anti-SARS CoV2 immunoglobulin. Both nonclinical and clinical examples indicate that high antigen loads, whether they be viral, bacterial, or tumoral in origin, result in increased clearance and decreased area under the curve and half-life of antibodies. A dosing strategy that matches the antigen load can be achieved by giving initially high doses and adjusting the frequency of dosing intervals based on pharmacokinetic parameters. We suggest that study design and dose selection for immunoglobulin products for the treatment of COVID-19 require special considerations such as viral load, antibody-virus interaction, and dosing adjustment based on the pharmacokinetics of the antibody.","output":"Dosing Considerations for Antibodies Against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper aims to report process findings of two online inclusive research projects with people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).

Design/methodology/approach: Two researchers describe the transition of their inclusive research projects from in-person to online formats and highlight how they operationalized the principles of inclusive research throughout these transitions. Findings: Potential benefits of inclusive research include enabling participation of research participants with IDD when in-person methods are not safe or feasible, increasing participant control of the research environment, stimulating participants online skill development and reducing geographic and support barriers to participation in research. A barrier to participation in online inclusive research includes people with IDDs lack of access to online spaces and Web-enabled devices. Additionally, people with IDD have support and communication needs that are not always accommodated by online skills training and access to the internet. To conclude, inclusive researchers need to develop skills and reflexivity specific to online research environments.

Part of these active learning activities using a gamification process were presented last year together with student assessments (EB 2020 poster: Tejada-Simon and Silverthorn;?Low-tech? gamification and TBL strategies to teach physiology). With the current COVID-19 pandemic, we had to transform the newly developed TBL and game session to a new and engaging system for the online world. The task required more effort than originally predicted, as instructors were trying to learn new technological skills at the same time than developing new materials. The goals for those new materials were to conserve equivalency and reusability for future academic years, as well as possible application to all, face-to-face, hyflex, hybrid and online delivery systems. Our learning objective was to assist first year Pharmacy students in understanding the autonomic nervous system structure and function using an interactive approach coupled to a team-based learning session. The original 2-hour session was converted to a 3-hour interactive problem-solving game (InProGAME). As in prior years, the students completed pre-class activities in form of diagrams, crossword puzzles and fill-in the blank to engage them with anatomical terminology and function. During the InProGAME, the whole class (123 students) met first in a Zoom room to discuss foundational learning, followed by 15 breakout Zoom rooms with eight students/group to facilitate small group interaction and initiate the collaborative/active learning part of the session.

This study aimed at investigating the impact of IFNL4 on acute HCV genotype 2 or 3 infections, and whether ITPase activity influenced outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two hundred and seven people who injected drugs (PWID) with documented anti-HCV seroconversion, and 57 PWID with reinfection with HCV were analyzed regarding IFNL4 (rs368234815 and rs12979860) and ITPA (rs1127354 and rs7270101), and longitudinally followed regarding HCV RNA. RESULTS The spontaneous clearance of HCV infection in anti-HCV seronegative PWID was enhanced when IFN-4 was absent (44% vs. 20% for IFNL4 TT/TTrs1368234815 and Grs1368234815 respectively, p < .001; OR 3.2) across genotypes 1-3. The proportion lacking IFN-4 was further increased following resolution of repeated re-exposure to HCV (74% among re-infected participants who had cleared at least two documented HCV infections). ITPA genetic variants did not independently impact on the outcome, but among males lacking IFN-4, reduced ITPase activity markedly augmented the likelihood of resolution (65% vs. 29% for <100% and 100% ITPase activity, p = .006).

Appropriate and effective health and social support are required to potentially prevent some of the need for these proceedings. More comprehensive evidence of the health needs and vulnerabilities of parents will enable enhanced response from family courts and integrated other services. OBJECTIVE: To examine health vulnerabilities of parents involved in care proceedings in the two-year period prior to involvement. METHODS: Family court data provided by Cafcass Cymru were linked to population-based health records held within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank. Linked data were available for 8,821 parents of children involved in care proceedings between 2011 and 2019. Findings were benchmarked with reference to a comparison group of parents matched on sex, age, and deprivation (n = 32,006), not subject to care proceedings. Demographic characteristics, overall health service use, and health profiles of parents were examined. Descriptive and statistical tests of independence were used. RESULTS: Nearly half of cohort parents (47.6%) resided in the most deprived quintile. They had higher levels of healthcare use compared to the comparison group across multiple healthcare settings, with the most pronounced differences for emergency department attendances (59.3% vs 37.0%). Health conditions with the largest variation between groups were related to mental health (43.6% vs 16.0%), substance use (19.4% vs 1.6%) and injuries (41.5% vs 23.6%). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the heightened socioeconomic and health vulnerabilities of parents who experience care proceedings concerning a child.

Human genetic polymorphisms in Ide have been linked to increased risk for T2DM. In mice, hepatic Ide ablation causes glucose intolerance and insulin resistance when mice are fed a regular diet. OBJECTIVE These studies were undertaken to further investigate its regulatory role in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obesity. METHODS To this end, we have compared the metabolic effects of loss versus gain of IDE function in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). RESULTS We demonstrate that loss of IDE function in liver (L-IDE-KO mouse) exacerbates hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance without changes in insulin clearance but in parallel to an increase in pancreatic -cell function. Insulin resistance was associated with increased FoxO1 activation and a ~2-fold increase of GLUT2 protein levels in the liver of HFD-fed mice in response to an intraperitoneal injection of insulin. Conversely, gain of IDE function (adenoviral delivery) improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, in parallel to a reciprocal ~2-fold reduction in hepatic GLUT2 protein levels. Furthermore, in response to insulin, IDE co-immunoprecipitates with the insulin receptor in liver lysates of mice with adenoviral-mediated liver overexpression of IDE.

The identification of locations with potential and unknown spread of ZIKV is a key yet understudied component for outbreak preparedness. Here, we aim to identify locations at a high risk of cryptic ZIKV spread during 2015C2016 to further the understanding of the global ZIKV epidemiology, which is critical for the mitigation of the risk of future epidemics. METHODS: We developed an importation simulation model to estimate the weekly number of ZIKV infections imported in each susceptible spatial unit (i.e. location that did not report any autochthonous Zika cases during 2015C2016), integrating epidemiological, demographic, and travel data as model inputs. Thereafter, a global risk model was applied to estimate the weekly ZIKV transmissibility during 2015C2016 for each location. Finally, we assessed the risk of onward ZIKV spread following importation in each susceptible spatial unit to identify locations with a high potential for cryptic ZIKV spread during 2015C2016. RESULTS: We have found 24 susceptible spatial units that were likely to have experienced cryptic ZIKV spread during 2015C2016, of which 10 continue to have a high risk estimate within a highly conservative scenario, namely, Luanda in Angola, Banten in Indonesia, Maharashtra in India, Lagos in Nigeria, Taiwan and Guangdong in China, Dakar in Senegal, Maputo in Mozambique, Kinshasa in Congo DRC, and Pool in Congo. Notably, among the 24 susceptible spatial units identified, some have reported their first ZIKV outbreaks since 2017, thus adding to the credibility of our results (derived using 2015C2016 data only). CONCLUSION: Our study has provided valuable insights into the potentially high-risk locations for cryptic ZIKV circulation during the 2015C2016 pandemic and has also laid a foundation for future studies that attempt to further narrow this key knowledge gap. Our modelling framework can be adapted to identify areas with likely unknown spread of other emerging vector-borne diseases, which has important implications for public health readiness especially in resource-limited settings.","output":"Mapping the cryptic spread of the 2015C2016 global Zika virus epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Now a days coronavirus is the most discussed topic in everywhere and recent outbreak in the worldwide.

B- and T-cell epitopes from 6KMF and 6JKZ were detected and evaluated based on critical factors to produce a multi-epitope vaccine construct. It was assessed based on allergenicity, antigenicity, stability. The vaccine's dual major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I and MHC-II) binding epitopes allowed it to reach a larger population. P. gingivalis fimbriae induce immune subversion through TLR -CXCR4 receptor complex pathway. The ClusPro 2.0 server was used to do the molecular docking using TLR2 - CXCR4 and vaccine epitopes as receptor and ligand respectively. RESULTS: The designed vaccine was non-allergenic and had a high antigenicity, solubility, and stability. The 3D structure of the vaccine revealed strong interaction with CXCR4(TLR2) using molecular docking. The vaccine-CXCR4 interface was more consistent, possibly because the vaccination has a higher affinity for the CXCR4-TLR2 complex.

Fortnightly, associations between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and 60 demographic and behavioural characteristics were estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders, considering multiple testing, collinearity, and reverse causality. FINDINGS: Of 4,091,537 RT-PCR results from 482,677 individuals, 29,903 (073%) were positive. As positivity rose September-November 2020, rates were independently higher in younger ages, and those living in Northern England, major urban conurbations, more deprived areas, and larger households. Rates were also higher in those returning from abroad, and working in healthcare or outside of home. When positivity peaked December 2020-January 2021 (Alpha), high positivity shifted to southern geographical regions. With national vaccine roll-out from December 2020, positivity reduced in vaccinated individuals. Associations attenuated as rates decreased between February-May 2021.

RESULTS: Multiple sequence alignment of the spike (S), membrane (M), enveloped (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins was employed to identify the sequence conservation among MERS and Bat (HKU4, HKU5) coronaviruses. We used various in silico tools to predict the conserved antigenic sites. We found that MERS-CoV shared 30 % of its S protein antigenic sites with HKU4 and 70 % with HKU5 bat-CoV. Whereas 100 % of its E, M and N proteins antigenic sites are found to be conserved with those in HKU4 and HKU5.

This study explored the feeding experiences and support of caregivers with children who have CP. A qualitative approach was used where semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted and audio recorded. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyse the transcribed interview data from the eleven mothers that participated. Four major themes were identified from the data: Child-centred world, Making decisions, Knowing their child, and Seeking and receiving support. Caregivers knew their childs unique needs and made daily decisions around feeding based upon the childs feedback and changing condition. Family support was viewed as important, although the caregivers still reported feeling stressed. Health professional support varied from amazing to frustrating, which contributed to the caregivers stress. However, no single support strategy was appropriate as their needs or preferences varied. It is recommended that health professionals take an individualised partnership approach with caregivers and their child, with particular attention to those caregivers who lack a friend or family support and those who are physically isolated.","output":"Caregivers Feeding Experiences and Support of Their Child with Cerebral Palsy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses and arteriviruses are distantly related human and animal pathogens that belong to the order Nidovirales. Nidoviruses are characterized by their polycistronic plus-stranded RNA genome, the production of subgenomic mRNAs and the conservation of a specific array of replicase domains, including key RNA-synthesizing enzymes. Coronaviruses (26C34 kilobases) have the largest known RNA genomes and their replication presumably requires a processive RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and enzymatic functions that suppress the consequences of the typically high error rate of viral RdRps. The arteriviruses have significantly smaller genomes and form an intriguing package with the coronaviruses to analyse viral RdRp evolution and function. The RdRp domain of nidoviruses resides in a cleavage product of the replicase polyprotein named non-structural protein (nsp) 12 in coronaviruses and nsp9 in arteriviruses. In all nidoviruses, the C-terminal RdRp domain is linked to a conserved N-terminal domain, which has been coined NiRAN (nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyl transferase). Although no structural information is available, the functional characterization of the nidovirus RdRp and the larger enzyme complex of which it is part, has progressed significantly over the past decade. In coronaviruses several smaller, non-enzymatic nsps were characterized that direct RdRp function, while a 3-to-5 exoribonuclease activity in nsp14 was implicated in fidelity. In arteriviruses, the nsp1 subunit was found to maintain the balance between genome replication and subgenomic mRNA production. Understanding RdRp behaviour and interactions during RNA synthesis and subsequent processing will be key to rationalising the evolutionary success of nidoviruses and the development of antiviral strategies.","output":"Nidovirus RNA polymerases: Complex enzymes handling exceptional RNA genomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Topological electronic flatten bands near or at the Fermi level are a promising avenue towards unconventional superconductivity and correlated insulating states. However, the related experiments are mostly limited to the engineered materials, such as moire systems. Here we present a catalogue of all the three-dimensional stoichiometric materials with flat bands around the Fermi level that exist in nature. We consider 55,206 materials from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database catalogued using the Topological Quantum Chemistry website which provides their structural parameters, space group (SG), band structure, density of states and topological characterization. We combine several direct signatures and properties of band flatness to a high-throughput analysis of all crystal structures. In particular, we identify materials hosting line-graph or bipartite sublattices - either in two or three dimensions - likely leading to flat bands. From this trove of information, we create the Materials Flatband Database website, a powerful search engine for future theoretical and experimental studies. We use it to extract a curated list of 2,379 materials, with among them 345 promising candidates, potentially hosting flat bands whose charge centers are not strongly localized on the atomic sites.

Technologic development of the surgical techniques makes the demands for the lesser pain and bruising, shorter operation time, better quality of life and less time off work. METHODS: The study is set for the determination of the preferences for the endovenous therapy and planned among the patients who had the diagnosis of venous insufficiency with doppler usg of the lower limbs (CEAP 2S) and were hospitalized in the Sakarya University Research and Training Hospital cardiovascular clinic. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether Biochemical Vein Ablation systems (BVA) of the great saphaenous vein (GSV) was associated with less pain and bruising than Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)and Endovenous Laser Ablation (EVLA). The secondary aims were to assess efficacy of vein ablation and quality of life following these procedures. In total 402 patients of chronic venous insufficiency were taken to our study. Endovenous treatment methods were compared for the peroperative and postoperative comfort for the patient and the physician. Treatment procedures for EVLA the BioLITEC (Biolitec AG, Germany) and for RFA Covidien ClosureFast Endovenous Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) Catheter (MA, USA) and for BVA (ClariVein catheter Vascular Insights, Madison, CT, USA). Aethoxysklerol 40 mg (2%) was used as the sclerosant material (Aethoxysklerol, Kreussler Pharma, Wiesbaden, Germany) were used. Phlebectomies were performed as required. Primary endpoints were patient assessed pain and bruising measured by visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary endpoints were patency assessed by duplex ultrasound at 6 weeks and 6 months. RESULTS: The operation was easier either to the physician and the patient in the BVA group. The pain and postoperative comfort were superior in both BVA and RFA groups in comparison to the EVLA group. There were no significant differences in mean postoperative pain, bruising and activity scores among BVA, RFA and EVLA groups. All BVA, RFA and EVLA resulted at least occlusion rates of 95% at 10 days postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: BVA and RFA was less painful for patients than EVLA and produced less bruising in the postoperative period with comparable success rates but there was no difference in the long-term results of the study. ? 2019 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA","output":"A comparison of choosing the best technique in endovenous ablation of varicose veins of the lower limbs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Daily Achilles tendon vibration has been shown to increase muscle force, likely via corticospinal neural adaptations.

Scientific literature suggests that by 2030, African Americans will have a 30% increased prevalence rate of HF coupled with depression. In addition to depression, anxiety is a predictor of worsening functional capacity, decreased quality of life, and increased hospital readmission rates. There is no consensus on the best way to treat patients with HF, depression, and anxiety. One promising type of treatmentcognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)has been shown to significantly improve patients quality of life and treatment compliance, but CBT has not been used with SMS text messaging reminders to enhance the effect of reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety in racial and ethnic minority patients with HF. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of our study are to (1) adapt and modify the Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment (COPE) curriculum for delivery to patients with HF by using an SMS text messaging component to improve depression and anxiety symptoms, (2) administer the adapted intervention to 10 patients to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the approach and modify it as needed, and (3) examine trends in depression and anxiety symptoms postintervention. We hypothesize that patients will show an improvement in depression scores and anxiety symptoms postintervention. METHODS: The study will comprise a mixed methods approach. We will use the eight steps of the ADAPT-ITT (assessment, decision, administration, production, topical expert, integration, training, and testing) model to adapt the intervention. The first step in this feasibility study will involve assembling individuals from the target population (n=10) to discuss questions on a specific topic. In phase 2, we will examine the feasibility and acceptability of the enhanced SMS text messaging intervention (TXT COPE-HF [Texting With COPE for Patients With HF]) and its preliminary effects with 10 participants. The Beck Depression Inventory will be used to assess depression, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory will be used to assess anxiety, and the Healthy Beliefs and Lifestyle Behavior surveys will be used to assess participants lifestyle beliefs and behavior changes. Changes will be compared from baseline to end point by using paired 2-tailed t tests. An exit focus group (n=10) will be held to examine facilitators and barriers to the SMS text messaging protocol.

Here, the biomechanical effectiveness of ligament tethers strengthening and vertebral body augmentation, in proximal junctional kyphosis prevention was explored using the finite element analysis. METHODS Based on a validated model of T1-L5 with the pedicle screw system instrumented T8-L5, strengthening models with different strategies were created to assess the range of motion in proximal vertebrae, vertebrae stress, pedicle screw stress, and pressure on intervertebral discs during extension, flexion, lateral bending, and axial rotation motions. Strengthening strategies included two- and three-level posterior ligament tethers (TE-T7-T9 and TE-T6-T9), and tethers with T7 &T8 vertebral body augmentation (TECE-T7-T9 and TECE-T6-T9). FINDINGS Compared to the spinal fusion model, the ligament tethers strengthening significantly reduced the flexion-extension range of motion difference among the proximal vertebrae. During the flexion-extension motion, the T8 vertebra stresses in the TE-T7-T9, TE-T6-T9, TECE-T7-T9, and TECE-T6-T9 models were distinctively reduced, the values decreased by 26.8%, 28.3%, 28.8%, and 9.6%, respectively, during flexion, and by 21.9%, 35.2%, 23%, and 18.6%, respectively, during extension. In the strengthening models, the maximum stresses on the T7/T8 intervertebral disc in the TE-T6-T9 model were reduced by 13.8% during flexion and by 14.7% during extension. INTERPRETATION Based on our results, the ligament strengthening configuration of the three-level posterior tethers produced a more gradual transition in range of motion, vertebrae stresses, and intervertebral discs stress between the fused and non-fused segments, especially during flexion-extension, which may significantly decrease the proximal junctional kyphosis biomechanical risk.","output":"A biomechanical study of ligament tethers strengthening for the prevention of proximal junctional kyphosis after posterior long-segment spinal fusion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We investigated the ocular surface disturbances in COVID\\\\19 patients discharged from the hospital.

Previous suggestions included surveying the population for COVID-19 symptoms, and a few countries performed randomized serological testing.

We differentiate between susceptibility to infection, which we assume to be uniform across all population sub-groups, and susceptibility to developing symptoms and complications, which may differ between sub-group. Our key assumption is that the Pivot sub-group's proportion within the infected Iceberg is similar to its proportion within the population (or even lower). We compute the minimal Iceberg Factor that allows for a sufficient number of people from the Pivot sub-group within the presumed Iceberg to explain the portion of the Pivot group that is confirmed positive, and also the minimal Iceberg Factor when allowing for a statistically insignificant deviation from the population's Pivot group proportion.

Whether cancers avoid poisoning from oxidized nucleotides by preventing incorporation via the oxidized purine diphosphatase MTH1 remains under debate. Also, little is known about DNA polymerases incorporating oxidized nucleotides in cells or how oxidized nucleotides in DNA become toxic. Here we show that replacement of one of the main DNA replicases in human cells, DNA polymerase delta (Pol ?), with an error-prone variant allows increased 8-oxodG accumulation into DNA following treatment with TH588, a dual MTH1 inhibitor and microtubule targeting agent. The resulting elevated genomic 8-oxodG correlated with increased cytotoxicity of TH588. Interestingly, no substantial perturbation of replication fork progression was observed, but rather mitotic progression was impaired and mitotic DNA synthesis triggered. Reducing mitotic arrest by reversin treatment prevented accumulation of genomic 8-oxodG and reduced cytotoxicity of TH588, in line with the notion that mitotic arrest is required for ROS buildup and oxidation of the nucleotide pool. Furthermore, delayed mitosis and increased mitotic cell death was observed following TH588 treatment in cells expressing the error-prone but not wild-type Pol ? variant, which is not observed following treatments with antimitotic agents. Collectively, these results link accumulation of genomic oxidized nucleotides with disturbed mitotic progression. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings uncover a novel link between accumulation of genomic 8-oxodG and perturbed mitotic progression in cancer cells, which can be exploited therapeutically using MTH1 inhibitors.See related commentary by Alnajjar and Sweasy, p. 3459.","output":"MTH1 Inhibitor TH588 Disturbs Mitotic Progression and Induces Mitosis-Dependent Accumulation of Genomic 8-oxodG"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global challenge for public health systems.

In this paper, we propose a distant domain transfer learning (DDTL) method for medical image classification. Moreover, we apply our methods to a recent issue (Coronavirus diagnose). Several current studies indicate that lung Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used for a fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.

In order to get a real image of sustainability in ECE practices, responses were coded using the SOLO Taxonomy and the OMEP ESD Rating Scale. The empirical study showed that ECE teachers often understand sustainability differently from that described in educational policy documents but also pointed to creative approaches to implementation.","output":"Unmasking Sustainability in Early Childhood Education: Teachers' Voices from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Slovenia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent Covid-19 epidemic has pointed out the inadequacy of the plans applied by industrial countries to limit the epidemic spread and frailty of the global economy to cope with a pandemic. Many countries were forced to a global lockdown with a great socio-economic impact. In Italy, one of the problems was the complex mobility network structure of the Northern regions that made ineffective the attempts to isolate the initial hotspots. In the paper we study a simple model that simulates the epidemic spread on a community network that may exchange population according to a daily mobility rate. In each community the epidemic evolution is provided by a stochastic compartmental model whose parameters are tuned to reproduce the Covid-19 evolution observed in Italy before the global lockdown policies. We initially study the delay in the epidemic spread due to the finite local mobility by proposing a power law relation for the increasing of the infection peak time in each node and the network distance from the initial node where the epidemic starts. We consider two scenarios to study the effectiveness of local lockdown policies: the presence of two clusters weakly connected by the mobility or a homogeneous chain of communities that exchange the population at a fixed rate. In both cases we show the existence of a threshold effect, in a probabilistic sense, for the effectiveness of lockdown policies as a function of the delay time at which such policies are applied, or of the network distance from the outbreak node.","output":"A stochastic compartmental model to simulate the Covid-19 epidemic spread on a simple network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytidine-5-triphosphate (CTP) synthase (CTPS) is the class I glutamine-dependent amidotransferase (GAT) that catalyzes the last step in the de novo biosynthesis of CTP. Glutamine hydrolysis is catalyzed in the GAT domain and the liberated ammonia is transferred via an intramolecular tunnel to the synthase domain where the ATP-dependent amination of UTP occurs to form CTP. CTPS is unique among the glutamine-dependent amidotransferases, requiring an allosteric effector (GTP) to activate the GAT domain for efficient glutamine hydrolysis. Recently, the first cryo-electron microscopy structure of Drosophila CTPS was solved with bound ATP, UTP, and, notably, GTP, as well as the covalent adduct with 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine. This structural information, along with the numerous site-directed mutagenesis, kinetics, and structural studies conducted over the past 50 years, provide more detailed insights into the elaborate conformational changes that accompany GTP binding at the GAT domain and their contribution to catalysis. Interactions between GTP and the L2 loop, the L4 loop from an adjacent protomer, the L11 lid, and the L13 loop (or unique flexible wing region), induce conformational changes that promote the hydrolysis of glutamine at the GAT domain; however, direct experimental evidence on the specific mechanism by which these conformational changes facilitate catalysis at the GAT domain is still lacking. Significantly, the conformational changes induced by GTP binding also affect the assembly and maintenance of the NH(3) tunnel. Hence, in addition to promoting glutamine hydrolysis, the allosteric effector plays an important role in coordinating the reactions catalyzed by the GAT and synthase domains of CTPS.","output":"GTP-Dependent Regulation of CTP Synthase: Evolving Insights into Allosteric Activation and NH(3) Translocation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most countries have well-established pricing and reimbursement pathways for vaccines which differ from the pathway for other pharmaceutical products The review, purchasing, and distribution of vaccines varies between healthcare systems in high-income countries During global viral pandemics, such as that caused by H1N1pdm09 in 2009 or more recently SARS-CoV-2;countries adapt their appraisal pathways to allow for expedient approval and distribution of vaccines Understanding such adaptions is important to enable rapid market access for COVID-19 vaccines as well as providing the opportunity to identify possibilities to establish more global approaches to the challenges of such diseases For this evaluation, a targeted review was undertaken to identify reimbursement pathways for both seasonal and pandemic vaccines in four markets with different underlying healthcare systems: nationalised (UK), social insurance-based (Germany), decentralised (Italy), and private insurance-based (USA) The H1N1 vaccine was used as an analogue for a pandemic vaccine and the seasonal influenza vaccine for standard processes The two pathways were compared across key variables including: relevant stakeholders, evidence requirements, pricing strategies, and procurement and distribution Despite considerable differences in the pathways used for seasonal vaccines, the emergent pathway used during the H1N1pdm09 pandemic was almost identical in each market All four markets accelerated the appraisal process and used a centralised procurement pathway National governments relied on licensing authorities to provide the initial review of quality and safety data on new vaccines Governments then directly oversaw tender processes, supplier selection, financial agreements and contracting, in order to purchase vaccines directly from manufacturers and distribute them to regional healthcare providers European markets all used advance purchasing agreements and the USA negotiated a sole-source direct purchase The parallels in pandemic vaccine processes between the markets indicates opportunities for greater international co-ordination to accelerate both the technical reviews of new vaccines and implementation of vaccination programmes","output":"CO4 An Evaluation of the Differences in Vaccine Approval and Procurement Processes between Healthcare Systems during a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection may present with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).

The objective of this study was to assess the extent that the availability of emergency cash reserves modified the association between experience of economic distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and behavioral health outcomes in the general adult population of Thailand. METHODS: We conducted a nationally-representative phone-based survey in late April 2021. Survey questions included questions on experience of economic distress, and a question on what participants would do to cover a 5,000 Thai Bahts (THB) emergency expense within one week, anxiety and depression screening questions, and questions regarding sleep, exercise, gambling, smoking, and drinking behaviors. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses with adjustment for complex survey designs, and stratified analyses with assessment of heterogeneity of odds ratios between strata and assessment of additive and multiplicative interactions. RESULTS: A total of 1,555 individuals from 15 provinces participated in the survey (participation rate = 68.3%). Approximately 19.6%  1.0% of the participants reported that they would cover the 5,000 THB emergency expense only with cash or cash equivalent without resorting to other means. Experience of economic distress was associated with anxiety disorder after adjusting for covariables (Adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.47; 95% CI [1.45C4.19]). There was no evidence that availability of emergency cash reserves significantly modified the stated association, nor the association between experience of economic distress and other outcomes. However, with regard to anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms and history of gambling in past 30 days, the p-for-trend values (p-for-trend < 0.001) suggested that those with emergency cash reserves had lower prevalence of these outcomes than those without emergency cash reserves. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings did not support our hypothesis that availability of emergency cash reserves modified the association between experience of economic distress and behavioral health outcomes. Nonetheless, the study findings can serve as potentially useful basic information for relevant stakeholders. Future studies should consider qualitative data collection and longitudinal study design in order to explore these associations at greater depths.","output":"Modification of the association between experience of economic distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and behavioral health outcomes by availability of emergency cash reserves: findings from a nationally-representative survey in Thailand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Influenza, commonly known as flu, is a contagious, febrile viral disease. Common symptoms are chills, fever, sore throat, coughing, sneezing, muscle pains, headache, myalgia, etc. Influenza viruses (IVs) belonging to orthomyxovirus group are of three types (types A, B, and C). IVs are enveloped, segmented, negative-stranded RNA viruses containing eight distinct RNA segments (types A and B) and seven RNA segments (type C). Only type A viruses exhibit different subtypes. Currently, 18 hemagglutination (HA) subtypes (H1 to H18) and 11 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes (N1 to N11) are known in humans and other warm-blooded animals. Flu outbreaks occur as annual epidemics in fall and winter and infrequently, as worldwide pandemics. Annual epidemics are caused by antigenic drift due to mutations in HA and NA antigens, whereas pandemics are caused by antigenic shift due to genetic reassortment among different subtype viruses. The first pandemic of the twenty-first century, declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2009, was caused by an H1N1 virus, derived from quadruple reassortment among swine, avian, and human IVs. Currently, two types of antiinfluenza drugs, based on either blocking the M2 proton channel (amantadine and rimantadine) or inhibiting NA (oseltamivir or Tamiflu by Roche and zanamivir or Relanza by GlaxoSmithKline) are available. The virus is commonly spread by aerosol droplets and by fingertips. Therefore, washing hands and avoiding contact with infected persons are the first lines of defense. Indoor living and closeness of people in an enclosed environment in winter facilitate virus transmission leading to epidemics. Annual vaccination is the best preventative measure. Currently, two types of vaccines (subunit vaccine by injection and live attenuated vaccine by nasal spray) are available and recommended by WHO and Centers for Disease Control.","output":"Influenza Virus Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is no identified pharmacological therapy for COVID-19 patients, where potential therapeutic strategies are underway to determine effective therapy under such unprecedented pandemic. Therefore, combination therapies may have the potential of alleviating the patient's outcome. This study aimed at comparing the efficacy of two different combination regimens in improving outcomes of patients infected by novel coronavirus (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a single centered, retrospective, observational study of 60 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive inpatients (&#8805;18 years old) at two wards of the Baqiyatallah Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Patient's data including clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded. According to the drug regimen, the patients were divided into two groups; group I who received regimen I consisting azithromycin, prednisolone, naproxen, and lopinavir/ritonavir and group II who received regimen II including meropenem, levofloxacin, vancomycin, hydroxychloroquine, and oseltamivir. RESULTS: The oxygen saturation (SpO2) and temperature were positively changed in patients receiving regimen I compared to regimen II (P = 0.013 and P = 0.012, respectively). The serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP) changed positively in group I (P < 0.001). Although there was a significant difference in platelets between both groups (75.44 vs 51.62, P < 0.001), their change did not clinically differ between two groups. The findings indicated a significant difference of the average length of stay in hospitals (ALOS) between two groups, where the patients under regimen I showed a shorter ALOS (6.97 vs 9.93, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study revealed the beneficial effect of the short-term use of low-dose prednisolone in combination with azithromycin, naproxen and lopinavir/ritonavir (regimen I), in decreasing ALOS compared to regimen II. Since there is still lack of evidence for safety of this regimen, further investigation in our ongoing follow-up to deal with COVID-19 pneumonia is underway.

Subsequently, a connection of autophagy and SPCs maintenance and survival was demonstrated in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, mTOR was identified as an essential factor for autophagy in SPCs with a complicated mechanism: (1) mTOR is phosphorylated by AKT to activate its target genes, p70s6 kinase, resulting in the inhibition of autophagy during short-term busulfan treatment. (2) mTOR mediates autophagy with p53 together, to regulate the fate of SPCs.

A studies regarding the median recovery time and its predictors are limited globally and specifically in Ethiopia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the median time to recovery from COVID-19 and its predictors among COVID-19 cases admitted to WURH, Western Ethiopian. METHODS: This was a hospital-based retrospective cohort study conducted among 263 adult patients admitted with COVID-19 in WURH treatment center from March 29, 2020 through September 30, 2020. Epidata version 3.2 was used for data entry, and STATA version 14 for analysis. A Cox proportional hazard regression model was fitted to determine factors associated with recovery time. A variable with P-value  0.25 at bivariable Cox regression analysis were selected for multivariable Cox proportional model. Multivariable Cox regression model with 95% CI and Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR) was used to identify a significant predictor of time to recovery from COVID-19 at P-value < 0.05.

Based upon this fundamental assumption, I compose three interdisciplinary studies which analyze individual, collective and government actions at multiple levels of aggregation, and how they in turn lead to various economic and psychological outcomes. In the first study, I explore the key predictors of the level of compliance to social distancing and mask wearing in the United states by aggregating interdisciplinary datasets and applying multi-level analysis. I use a behavioral model to classify the determinants of compliance to COVID-19 response measures into economic incentives and psychological motivations and show that the former would have an increasing marginal effect on working hours. Empirically, I show that (a) economic vulnerability was the key predictor of failure of social distancing in 2020, even taking partisanship into account. (b) mask wearing was more politicized than social distancing, and in Fall (close to the elections), Republican partisanship was the only dominant indicator of noncompliance of mask wearing. In the second study, we use a coordination game model to discuss the dynamics of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) on COVID-19 in the United States. We use a theoretical model to justify that there exist social reinforcement effects between policies in US states, i.e. the implementation of an NPI in a state would increase the possibility that others follow suit. Under certain conditions, if enough states engage in NPIs, they will tip others that have not yet done so to follow suit and thus shift the Nash equilibrium to the greatest one (all states follow). Then, we show that there can be equilibria where states with different political leanings adopt different strategies when politics is a determinant of the interaction intensity. Empirically, we use a random utility model (RUM) to test it in reality with Probit and Logit regressions, and find robust evidence that inter-state social reinforcement is important and that equilibria can be tipped in mask wearing, and slightly weaker confirmation for social distancing. In the last study, I explore how personality traits in China are different from the traditional Five-Factor model by a large twin dataset in Yunnan Province. I find robust evidence about personality structures, formation and impacts in China and state three findings: (1) Personality traits in China seem to have a significance deviation from the well-accepted Five Factor Model. Instead, it has two general factors, relying on whether the item is positive or negative in tone. Positive factors include Social Desirability, Extraversion and Openness;negative factors include Disorderliness, Neuroticism and Introversion. (2) The genetic heritability of personality traits in China is significantly lower than that measured in the Western countries. For some traits, such as Social Desirability and Disorderliness, the genetic effect is around 0 and the shared environmental effect is much larger. This challenges previous findings in the West.

If heparin was avoided during the 4-day treatment phase with high-dose antithrombin III (n = 140) or placebo (n = 162), the treatment effect appeared to be even more pronounced: 28-day mortality rate, 35.7% vs. 44.4% (risk ratio, 0.804; 95% confidence interval, 0.607-1.064); 56-day mortality rate, 39.9% vs. 52.2% (risk ratio, 0.764; 95% confidence interval, 0.593-0.984); 90-day mortality rate, 42.8% vs. 55.1% (risk ratio, 0.776; 95% confidence interval, 0.614-0.986). Like in the overall population, the percentage with any bleeding was increased in patients receiving high-dose antithrombin III compared with placebo. Survival rates were in favor of high-dose antithrombin III in patients both with and without bleeding complications. CONCLUSIONS Treatment with high-dose antithrombin III may increase survival time up to 90 days in patients with severe sepsis and high risk of death. This benefit may even be stronger when concomitant heparin is avoided.","output":"High-dose antithrombin III in the treatment of severe sepsis in patients with a high risk of death: efficacy and safety."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The global COVID-19 pandemic caused great impacts and influences to human psychology. As a result, youths who are kept at home for a long time easily develop irritability and problematic behaviors. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the relations among irritability, coping style, and subjective well-being of the youth. METHODS: Overall, 1,033 youth respondents (aged 18C30 yr) from seven provinces in China were investigated in 2020 using the irritability, depression, and anxiety scale, coping style scale, and well-being index scale. RESULTS: Among the dimensions of irritability of the youth, anxiety received the highest score, followed by introversion irritability, extroversion irritability, and depression. Irritability had significant regional differences. The total score of irritability among rural youth was significantly higher than that of urban youth (P<0.05). The irritability level of youths with parents emotional status was harmonious and good relations with family members and peers was far lower than those of youths who have poor relations between parents, family members, and peers (P<0.05). The irritability level of youths with a lower monthly household income was higher (P<0.05). Irritability of the youth had significantly negative correlations with positive response and SWB, and it had a significantly positive correlative with negative response. Coping style can mediate the relationship between irritability and SWB of the youth to some extent. CONCLUSION: Significant correlations exist among irritability, coping style, and SWB of the youth. Irritability can be used to predict SWB indirectly through positive response.","output":"Effects of Irritability of the Youth on Subjective Well-Being: Mediating Effect of Coping Styles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a systemic disease, impacting multiple organs in the human body. But COVID-19 also impacts other diseases of relevance to public and planetary health. To understand and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, we need an intersectional conceptual lens and systems thinking. For example, the strain on health care systems due to COVID-19 has adversely impacted global malaria elimination programs. With many epidemiological, clinical, and biological parallels documented, we examined in this study the scenario of malaria and COVID-19 syndemic in India. The disruptive influence of COVID-19 on the National Framework for Malaria Elimination (NFME), impact of unintended chemoprophylaxis, population genetic influences, and the shifting patterns of epidemiology are compared. Importantly, a time series analysis forecasted the burden of malaria increasing in the upcoming years. Although reported malaria cases showed a decline in 2020 compared to the previous years, an increase in cases was documented in 2021, with nine states reporting an increase up to July 2021. Pandemics often cause crosscutting disruptions in health care. Reshaping the priorities of the malaria elimination program and a diligent implementation of the priorities in the NFME would, therefore, be well-advised: (1) vector control, (2) antimalarial therapy recommendations, (3) monitoring drug resistance, (4) prevention of the spread of asymptomatic disease-causing low-density transmission, and (5) large-scale testing measures. In conclusion, the findings from the present study inform future comparative studies in other world regions to better understand the broader, systemic, temporal, and spatial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on existing and future diseases across public health systems and services.","output":"Malaria Epidemiology and COVID-19 Pandemic: Are They Interrelated?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within the environmental risk assessment conducted for pesticide registration in the EU, avian reproductive toxicity is characterized after exposing adults. However, eggs of ground-nesting species can be exposed when pesticide applications occur during laying or incubation. We simulated environmentally realistic exposures of red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) eggs to an herbicide (2,4-D) and a fungicide (tebuconazole) applied to winter cereal crops during the breeding season of most farmland birds. We analyzed effects on hatching success, offspring survival and physiology. Exposure by overspray led to greater pesticide accumulation in the eggshell or content than exposure through contact with treated soil (3.1 to 13.7 times higher, depending on the pesticide and target sample). Egg overspray with tebuconazole significantly increased chick mortality, which was 26% higher than that of controls. 2,4-D caused a similar but close to significant increase (chick mortality 24% higher than controls). Exposure to either pesticide through contact with treated soils did not affect chick survival but altered some biochemical parameters post-hatching. Our experiment shows that egg spraying with pesticides should be considered as a relevant exposure scenario in risk assessment procedures, given its potential to affect the reproductive success of ground-nesting farmland birds.","output":"Egg overspray with herbicides and fungicides reduces survival of red-legged partridge chicks."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Why have some territories performed better than others in the fight against COVID\\\\19?

First, we investigate whether regions characterized by a low social and political trust witnessed a higher excess mortality.

Accounting for a host of potential confounders, we find robust support that regions with lower levels of both social and political trust are associated with higher excess mortality, along with citizen polarization in institutional trust in some models. On the ideological make\\\\up of regional parliaments, we find that, ceteris paribus, those that lean more tan on the GAL\\\\TAN spectrum yielded higher excess mortality. Moreover, although we find limited evidence of elite polarization driving excess deaths on the left\\\\right or GAL\\\\TAN spectrums, partisan differences on the attitudes towards the European Union demonstrated significantly higher deaths, which we argue proxies for (anti)populism.

In this emergency state that highlighted existing inadequacies in US government and tribal public health infrastructures, many tribal nations contracted with commercial entities and other organization types to conduct rapid diagnostic and antibody testing, often based on proprietary technologies specific to the novel pathogen. They also partnered with public-private enterprises on clinical trials to further the development of vaccines. Indigenous people contributed biological samples for assessment and, in many cases, broadly consented for indefinite use for future genomics research. A concern is that the need for crisis aid may have placed Indigenous communities in a position to forego critical review of data use agreements by tribal research governances. In effect, tribal nations were placed in the unenviable position of trading short-term public health assistance for long-term, unrestricted access to Indigenous genomes that may disempower future tribal sovereignties over community members' data. Diagnostic testing, specimen collection, and vaccine research is ongoing; thus, our aim is to outline pathways to trust that center current and future equitable relationship-building between tribal entities and public-private interests. These pathways can be utilized to increase Indigenous communities' trust of external partners and share understanding of expectations for and execution of data protections.

Primary precursors such as NO and CO dropped dramatically as early as 13 March 2020, due to school closures, but ambient ozone did not change. In this work we use a chemical box model in order to estimate regimes of ozone production before and after the lockdown. We constrain the model with observations in Quito (ozone, NO(x), CO, and meteorology) and with estimations of traffic-associated VOCs that are tightly linked to CO. To this end, we use the closest observational data of VOC/CO ratios at an urban area that shares with Quito conditions of high altitude and is located in the tropics, namely Mexico City. A shift in the chemical regime after mobility restrictions was evaluated in light of the magnitude of radical losses to nitric acid and to hydrogen peroxide. With reduced NO(x) in the morning rush hour (lockdown conditions), ozone production rates at 08:30C10:30 increased from 4.2 to 17 to 9.7C23 ppbv h(?1), respectively. To test further the observed shift in chemical regime, ozone production was recalculated with post-lockdown NO(x) levels, but setting VOCs to pre-lockdown conditions. This change tripled ozone production rates in the mid-morning and stayed higher throughout the day. In light of these findings, practical scenarios that present the potential for ozone accumulation in the ambient air are discussed.","output":"What the COVID-19 lockdown revealed about photochemistry and ozone production in Quito, Ecuador"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 114 million people and has resulted in >2.5 million deaths so far. Some people have greater susceptibility which influences both SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19 severity. Smoking is associated with increased ACE-2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which facilitates its entry through the lung. However, despite the widespread use of e-cigarettes, also known as 'vaping', little is known regarding the effects of vaping on ACE-2 expression and how this affects SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the added effect of nicotine in the vapor is also unknown. Thus, we tested whether vaping induces ACE-2 expression in the mouse lung. BALB/c mice exposed to e-cigarette vapor (nicotine) resulted in a significant increase in peribronchiolar inflammation and influx of immune cells into the airways. Vapor increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin 1, and KC levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in both sexes, which were further enhanced by nicotine (whereas increase in interleukin 6 was sex and nicotine independent). The reduction in basal inspiratory capacity with vapor exposure occurred independent of sex or nicotine. The increase in methacholine-induced airway hyper-responsiveness was independent of sex; however, in female mice it was only significant in the nicotine-exposed group. Lung ACE-2 expression was increased in male mice in a nicotine-dependent manner as compared with female mice. Collectively, while vaping (nicotine) induced airway inflammation and impaired lung function, the induction of lung ACE-2 occurred to a significantly greater degree in males exposed to vapor containing nicotine as compared with females. Thus, via these effects on ACE-2 expression in the lungs and airways, vaping itself may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry into the airways.","output":"Sex differences in the induction of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) in mouse lungs after e-cigarette vapor exposure and its relevance to COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Medical education in India always relied on the traditional classroom method of teaching. The current COVID pandemic brought a situation where online classes have taken precedence over the traditional classroom teaching.

Materials and methods: Online live streamed classes using Free Conference Call app were held in the Department of Anatomy, AIIMS Raipur. Live streaming, pre-recorded lecture videos were supplemented by cadaveric dissection videos, assignments etc posted in Google Classroom. Feedback regarding the online classes were obtained from first year undergraduate medical students using Google Forms. Results: A total of 72 students responded to the survey. 57 students used mobile phones to access the classes. 10 students preferred the online classes with chalk and board lecture, 23 students preferred lecture with PowerPoint presentation while the rest preferred online classes with chalk and board lecture followed by PowerPoint presentation. Out of the total (n=72) respondents, majority of them experienced technical issues which hampered their online learning experience. Owing to this reason, 43 students showed preference for prerecorded videos over online live classes. 41.7% of the students opined that online classes should be included as a part of MBBS anatomy curriculum. Conclusion: Online learning in the form of live classes and recorded videos can be included as a part of routine Anatomy curriculum but it can never be a substitute for interactive face to face classroom learning and practical session. ? 2021 Asian Pacific Journal of Reproduction Produced by Wolters Kluwer- Medknow.

We aimed at evaluating [18F]FDG PET brain datasets of healthy controls (HC), based on publicly available data, for the extraction of voxel-based brain metabolism maps at the single-subject level. METHODS: Selection of HC images was based on visual rating, after Cook's distance and jack-knife analyses, to exclude artefacts and/or outliers. The performance of these HC datasets (ADNI-HC and AIMN-HC) to extract hypometabolism patterns in single patients was tested in comparison with the standard reference HC dataset (HSR-HC) by means of Dice score analysis. We evaluated the performance and comparability of the different HC datasets in the assessment of single-subject SPM-based hypometabolism in three independent cohorts of patients, namely, ADD, bvFTD and DLB. RESULTS: Two-step Cook's distance analysis and the subsequent jack-knife analysis resulted in the selection of n = 125 subjects from the AIMN-HC dataset and n = 75 subjects from the ADNI-HC dataset. The average concordance between SPM hypometabolism t-maps in the three patient cohorts, as obtained with the new datasets and compared to the HSR-HC standard reference dataset, was 0.87 for the AIMN-HC dataset and 0.83 for the ADNI-HC dataset.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1134 HCPs in June 2020. A systematic random sampling and consecutive sampling techniques were used to select the study participants. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the data and Chi-square test was used to assess the association between the groups. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with satisfaction of healthcare workers. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the participants was 30.26  6.43 year and 52.6% were females. Nurses constituted about 40% of the overall sample, followed by physicians (22.2%), interns (10.8%), midwives (10.3%) and others (16.7%).

In this cohort, we piloted an alternative testing model to provide access to low-barrier, high-touch testing and augment student-driven testing with data-driven adaptive surveillance that targets higher-risk students and triggers testing notifications based on reported symptoms, exposures, or other relevant information. A total of 2,180 students enrolled in the study, 51% of them undergraduates. Overall, 6,247 PCR tests were administered to 2,178 students over the two-month period. Overall test positivity rate was 0.9%; 2.6% of students tested positive. Uptake and acceptability of regular symptom and exposure surveys was high; 98% of students completed at least one survey, and average completion rate was 67% (Median: 74%, IQR: 39%) for daily reporting of symptoms and 68% (Median: 75%, IQR: 40%) for weekly reporting of exposures. Of symptom-triggered tests, 5% were PCR-positive; of exposure-triggered tests, 10% were PCR-positive.

Several of these highly infectious pathogens, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been cemented in human history as causing epidemics or pandemics due to their lethality and contagiousness. SARS-CoV-2 is an example of these highly infectious pathogens that have recently become one of the leading causes of globally reported deaths, creating one of the worst economic downturns and health crises in the last century. As a result, the necessity for highly accurate and increasingly rapid on-site diagnostic platforms for highly infectious pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, has grown dramatically over the last two years. Current conventional non-microfluidic diagnostic techniques have limitations in their effectiveness as on-site devices due to their large turnaround times, operational costs and the need for laboratory equipment.

This implementation uses relatively inexpensive equipment and can be performed outside the clinic, allowing for regular monitoring of spatial-hearing performance. The SSiN-VA simultaneously assesses speech discrimination and relative localization with changing source locations in the presence of noise. The use of simultaneous tasks increases the cognitive load to better represent the difficulties faced by listeners in noisy real-world environments.

Additionally, as patients take greater control of their healthcare outcomes and a greater number of clinical appointments are conducted remotely, outcome measures that allow patients to carry out assessments at home are becoming more relevant. The SSiN-VA was implemented using the 3D Tune-In Toolkit, simulating seven loudspeaker locations spaced at 30 intervals with azimuths between ?90 and +90, and rendered for headphone playback using the binaural spatialization technique. Twelve normal-hearing participants were assessed to evaluate if SSiN-VA produced patterns of responses for relative localization and speech discrimination as a function of azimuth similar to those previously obtained using loudspeaker arrays. Additionally, the effect of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the direction of the shift from target to reference, and the target phonetic contrast on performance were investigated. SSiN-VA led to similar patterns of performance as a function of spatial location compared to loudspeaker setups for both relative localization and speech discrimination. Performance for relative localization was significantly better at the highest SNR than at the lowest SNR tested, and a target shift to the right was associated with an increased likelihood of a correct response. For word discrimination, there was an interaction between SNR and word group. Overall, these outcomes support the use of virtual audio for speech discrimination and relative localization testing in noise.","output":"Evaluating Spatial Hearing Using a Dual-Task Approach in a Virtual-Acoustics Environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduccin Desde el comienzo de la pandemia de COVID-19, se han desarrollado diversas investigaciones sobre el pronstico de pacientes con SARS-CoV-2 asociado a factores como edad, condiciones biodemogrficas, comorbilidades, factores sociales, parmetros clnicos, hematolgicos, marcadores inflamatorios, de coagulacin, bioqumicos y gasomtricos, entre otros.

Vall d?Hebron University Hospital (HUVH) implemented an unprecedented critical patient-care planning and management of resources. METHODS: We describe a cohort of critically ill patients during the first two months of the pandemic (from March 3, 2020, to May 2, 2020) in HUVH, Barcelona. In this manuscript, we report our previsions, strategies implemented, and the outcomes obtained. RESULTS: Three-thousand and thirty-three patients were admitted to the HUVH Critical Care Units. Throughout the study period, the proportion of patients on IMV or IMV and ECMO remained above 78%. Most patients were men (65%); the most common age group was 60-70 years. Twenty-three patients received ECMO, and eighteen were cannulated at another center and transferred to HUVH. At the end of the study, fourteen patients were successfully decannulated, three patients died, and the rest of the patients were still on ECMO. Eight pregnant women have been treated in the ICU, with a survival rate of 100%. The ICU mortality of patients younger than 60 years was 3.2%. The mean ICU stay of both survivors and nonsurvivors was 14 days. CONCLUSION: The adequate preparation for resource expansion for critically ill patients care, main challenges, and overall positive results can serve as a precedent for similar future scenarios.","output":"Organizacin de la atencin a pacientes crticos en situacin de pandemia: Experiencia del Hospital Vall d'Hebron durante el brote de neumona por SARS-CoV-2./ Organizacin de la atencin a pacientes crticos en situacin de pandemia: Experiencia del Hospital Vall d'Hebron durante el brote de neumona por SARS-CoV-2./ Planning for the assistance of critically ill patients in a Pandemic Situation: The experience of Vall d'Hebron University Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus associated with various AIDS-related malignancies. Like other herpesviruses, multiple processes required for KSHV lytic replication, including viral transcription, viral DNA synthesis and capsid assembly occur in virus-induced intranuclear structures, termed replication and transcription compartments (RTCs). Here we utilised a novel methodology, combining subcellular fractionation and quantitative proteomics, to identify cellular proteins which are recruited to KSHV-induced RTCs and thus play a key role in KSHV lytic replication. We show that several isoforms of the HSP70 chaperone family, Hsc70 and iHsp70, are redistributed from the cytoplasm into the nucleus coinciding with the initial formation of KSHV-induced RTCs. We demonstrate that nuclear chaperone foci are dynamic, initially forming adjacent to newly formed KSHV RTCs, however during later time points the chaperones move within KSHV RTCs and completely co-localise with actively replicating viral DNA. The functional significance of Hsp70 isoforms recruitment into KSHV RTCs was also examined using the specific Hsp70 isoform small molecule inhibitor, VER-155008. Intriguingly, results highlight an essential role of Hsp70 isoforms in the KSHV replication cycle independent of protein stability and maturation. Notably, inhibition of Hsp70 isoforms precluded KSHV RTC formation and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) relocalisation to the viral genome leading to the abolishment of global KSHV transcription and subsequent viral protein synthesis and DNA replication. These new findings have revealed novel mechanisms that regulate KSHV lytic replication and highlight the potential of HSP70 inhibitors as novel antiviral agents.","output":"Hsp70 Isoforms Are Essential for the Formation of Kaposis Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus Replication and Transcription Compartments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by disturbances in neuronal circuits of the brain underpinned by synapse loss, neuronal dysfunction and neuronal death. Amyloid beta and tau protein cause these pathological changes and enhance neuroinflammation, which in turn modifies disease progression and severity. Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), via activation of the locus coeruleus (LC), results in the release of catecholamines in the hippocampus and neocortex, which can enhance synaptic plasticity and reduce inflammatory signalling. Vagal nerve stimulation has shown promise to enhance cognitive ability in animal models. Research in rodents has shown that VNS can have positive effects on basal synaptic function and synaptic plasticity, tune inflammatory signalling, and limit the accumulation of amyloid plaques. Research in humans with invasive and non-invasive VNS devices has shown promise for the modulation of cognition. However, the direct stimulation of the vagus nerve afforded with the invasive procedure carries surgical risks. In contrast, non-invasive VNS has the potential to be a broadly available therapy to manage cognitive symptoms in early AD, however, the magnitude and specificity of its effects remains to be elucidated, and the non-inferiority of the effects of non-invasive VNS as compared with invasive VNS still needs to be established. Ongoing clinical trials with healthy individuals and patients with early AD will provide valuable information to clarify the potential benefits of non-invasive VNS in cognition and AD. Whether invasive or non-invasive VNS can produce a significant improvement on memory function and whether its effects can modify the progression of AD will require further investigation.","output":"Vagus Nerve Stimulation as a Potential Therapy in Early Alzheimer's Disease: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This rapid expert consultation responds to a request from the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) concerning the implementation of crisis standards of care (CSC) in response to the COVID-19 outbreak Building on a 10-year foundation of work by the Institute of Medicine, this document summarizes the broad principles and core elements of CSC planning and implementation The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine convened a standing committee of experts to help inform OSTP on critical science and policy issues related to emerging infectious diseases and other public health threats The standing committee includes members with expertise in emerging infectious diseases, public health, public health preparedness and response, biological sciences, clinical care and crisis standards of care, risk communication, and regulatory issues","output":"Rapid Expert Consultation on Crisis Standards of Care for the COVID-19 Pandemic (March 28, 2020)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"3,4-Dihydroxyphenylethanol (DOPET) is a polyphenol found in olive oil.

However, there is no much literature available on pulmonary rehabilitation in pediatric patients post lung transplant. Through this case report, we would like to present our intensive PR program for pediatric patients post-lung transplant. PATIENT CONCERNS: The 10-year-old boy's breathing before receiving a lung transplant continued to deteriorate and he eventually became dependent on a wheelchair. DIAGNOSIS: He was diagnosed with infantile acute lymphoblastic leukemia at 6 months of age. At the age of one year, he underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, but was diagnosed with post-transplantation bronchiolitis obliterans (PTBO) two months later. He had a lung transplant at the age of 10. INTERVENTIONS: He was hospitalized and received an initial assessment. This assessment included functional, cognitive, and psychological evaluations. He additionally completed PR exercises twice daily for two weeks. After discharge, he continued to participate in an outpatient-based PR program for three months. During the outpatient phase, PR exercises were performed once weekly, in addition to home-based cognitive training. OUTCOMES: Our intensive post-lung PR program improved our patient's exercise capacity, lung function, and quality of life. As a comprehensive rehabilitation service, our program also included a cognitive training component. CONCLUSION: We describe an intensive PR program tailored to pediatric patients post-lung transplant. The program was feasible and resulted in improvements in functional exercise capacity, lung function, and quality of life.

Findings from a small UK study suggested that myeloma patients were more likely to die from COVID-19 than members of the general population who contracted the virus [Cook et al, 2020]. Focus groups were conducted to learn more about the impact of COVID-19 on the lives of patients and their families, with a focus on its impact on diagnosis and treatment. Method MPE researchers conducted four online focus groups in Europe examining the views and experiences of myeloma and AL amyloidosis patients and caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fifteen patients and two caregivers took part. Thirteen patients had myeloma and two had AL amyloidosis. Participants were from Spain (n = 6), the UK (n = 2), Belgium (n = 2), Germany (n = 2), the Netherlands (n = 1), Iceland (n = 1), Israel (n = 1), Poland (n = 1), and Romania (n = 1). Eleven patients had been diagnosed within the last few years, while four were living with myeloma for a decade or longer. Ten patients were receiving active treatment for myeloma or AL amyloidosis during the pandemic, while others were in remission. Results Sixty percent of study participants reported that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected their treatment. Three patients said that medicines given in hospital (by infusion or injection) were delayed due to COVID-19 restrictions. Sometimes, the frequency of these treatments was reduced. In contrast, most patients taking oral medicines (tablets) reported that their treatment continued as normal. Seven participants said their or another patients invasive procedure (such as a bone marrow biopsy or stem cell transplant) had been delayed. These procedures took place after approximately 1C6 months later than originally scheduled, once HCPs and patients felt it was safe to do so. One patient reported an improvement in her treatment due to the pandemic restrictions. Her 4- to 5-hour long infusions of daratumumab in hospital had been switched to subcutaneous injections with fewer side-effects. Conclusions Findings suggest that COVID-19 had an impact on patients with myeloma and AL Amyloidosis and their treatments. Some aspects of this may be positive, with preference data showing that patients have a preference for oral administrations (Fifer et al, 2020) and as such, switching patients to at home treatment regimens may have both avoided treatment delays and also been in line with patient preferences for treatment administration. MPE suggest that the administration of treatments should be examined regularly. COVID-19 upended existing treatments and other healthcare services, but patients and their healthcare providers should be reviewing options on an ongoing basis to ensure both high quality of care and changes in patient preferences over time.","output":"P-130: The impact of COVID-19 on the treatment regimens of myeloma and AL amyloidosis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE We aimed to test the efficiency of CHA2DS2-VASc, CHA2DS2-VASc-HS, R2CHA2DS2-VASc score systems on the prediction of mortality in the patients with COVID-19.

Comorbidity features including coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular event, cancer status, and renal disease were recorded. The patients were divided as surviving group (n=440) and non-survivors (n=68). RESULTS The in-hospital mortality rate of the patients with COVID-19 was 13.4%. Factors found to be associated with mortality in univariate analysis were CHA2DS2-VASc, CHA2DS2-VASc-HS, R2CHA2DS2-VASc, cancer state, atrial fibrillation, hemoglobin, lymphocyte count, CRP, albumin and ferritin. Model 1 multivariate cox regression analysis revealed CHA2DS2-VASc, hemoglobin, CRP and ferritin levels to be independently associated with mortality. Factors that were found to be independently associated with in-hospital mortality in Model 2 analysis were CHA2DS2-VASc-HS, R2CHA2DS2-VASc, hemoglobin, CRP and ferritin whereas except hemoglobin in Model 3 analysis, the other variables had been the same. Predictive power of R2CHA2DS2-VASc was better than of both CHA2DS2-VASc (p=0.002) and CHA2DS2-VASc-HS (p=0.034) in determining the in-hospital mortality.

There was an urgent need to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 to reduce its spread and economic burden. The main objective of this study was to understand the attitudes and concerns of healthcare workers (HCWs) towards the upcoming COVID-19 vaccine, whether their decision was influenced by their history of taking the seasonal influenza vaccine, and factors that influence the acceptance of the upcoming COVID-19 vaccine. This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We selected and surveyed 356 HCWs via an electronic self-administered questionnaire. A total of 61.16% of HCWs were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and 55.9% of them had received the seasonal influenza vaccine in the preceding year (2019C2020). The strongest predictors for taking the COVID-19 vaccine were the HCWs belief that the COVID-19 vaccine would be safe, needed even for healthy people, that all HCWs should be vaccinated against COVID-19, and that HCWs will have time to take the vaccine. Being female, being middle aged, having <5 years of work experience, having no fear of injections, and being a non-smoker were predictive factors for taking the upcoming COVID-19 vaccine. No associations were found between the intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine and a history of taking the seasonal influenza vaccine.","output":"Healthcare Workers Perspectives on the Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccine in Terms of Their Exposure to the Influenza Vaccine in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of host genetic variation in pneumonia development and outcome is poorly understood. We studied common polymorphisms in the genes of proinflammatory cytokines (IL6 rs1800795, IL8 rs4073, IL1B rs16944), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL10 rs1800896, IL4 rs2243250, IL13 rs20541) and toll-like receptors (TLR2 rs5743708 and rs4696480, TLR4 rs4986791, TLR9 rs352139, rs5743836 and rs187084) in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (390 cases, 203 controls) and nosocomial pneumonia (355 cases, 216 controls). Experimental data were included in a series of 11 meta-analyses and eight subset analyses related to pneumonia susceptibility and outcome. TLR2 rs5743708 minor genotype appeared to be associated with CAP/Legionnaires disease/pneumococcal disease. In CAP patients, the IL6 rs1800795-C allele was associated with severe sepsis/septic shock/severe systemic inflammatory response, while the IL10 rs1800896-A allele protected against the development of these critical conditions. To contribute to deciphering of the above results, we performed an in silico analysis and a qualitative synthesis of literature data addressing basal and stimulated genotype-specific expression level.

Our prospective study evaluated post-operative immune response at baseline and postoperative day (POD) 1 and 2 after direct-to-implant pre-pectoral (PP) breast reconstruction with titanium-coated polypropylene mesh versus subpectoral (SP) breast reconstruction. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between January and December 2020, 37 patients were randomized between PP (n=17) or SP (n=16) reconstruction. Baseline and operative data were analyzed. Postoperative pain assessment using numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), and a full blood count with lymphocyte subsets were collected before surgery, and on POD1 and POD2. Data were evaluated by two-way analysis of variance test. RESULTS Baseline data did not demonstrate any statistical difference. Inter-group analysis did not provide any statistically significant difference in leukocytes, total lymphocytes, and lymphocytes subsets among SP and PP reconstruction groups (p>0.05). However, compared to specificity, the PP group experienced shorter operative time, with a mean difference 30.19 min, lower blood loss (p=0.017), lower rate of postoperative anemia (p=0.039), and a more favorable profile in inter-group pain analysis (p<0.001). CONCLUSION PP reconstruction with titanium-coated polypropylene mesh does not increase immunological impairment in the early postoperative period when compared with SP reconstruction and provides lower postoperative pain, reduction of operative time, and lower rate of postoperative anemia.","output":"Pre-pectoral Breast Reconstruction Does Not Affect Early Immunological Response: A BIAL 2.20 Study Subanalysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Jail incarceration and social confinement due to a sanitary stay-at-home law against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are compared to the introduction of dance workshops for imprisoned women charged with long sentences, then followed by an outside performance Soul Kitchen.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative value placed on different outcomes to be used in a pivotal trial for the upper extremity configuration of the Networked Neuroprosthesis (NNP) as well as the tolerance of the expected adverse event profile. SETTING: Academic medical center in the United States. METHODS: Distribution of an online survey to adults living with tetraplegia; extent of agreement with each question/statement was obtaining using a 1C7 Likert scale. RESULTS: There were 8 statements about potential benefits in arm/hand function; for all statements, more than 70% of participants rated the functions as 1-very important to regain. There were variable degrees of concern related to risks that could occur during the 30-day post-surgical period and increasing degrees of concern related to risks that could occur in the first 5 years, potentially due to the device, based on the increasing degree of invasiveness of the intervention required to address the event. When analysing the results based on all degrees of interest, more than 64% of responders were interested in getting the NNP with a success rate threshold as low as 50% regardless of time post-injury. Chi-squared analyses revealed some associations between responses and sex, injury level, and injury duration; however, none of these were statistically significant upon post-hoc analysis.

The Seahorse XFe24 analyzer was used to generate foundational immune cellular metabolic data in layer, broiler, and legacy genetic strains using fresh chicken peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Baseline mitochondrial respiration [oxygen consumption rate (OCR)] and glycolytic activity [extracellular acidification rate (ECAR)] were determined in modern commercial laying hen (Bovans White) and broiler (Ross 308) lines, as well as the highly inbred lines of Iowa State University (L8, Fayoumi M-15.2, Spanish, Ghs-6), partially inbred broiler line, and advanced intercrosses of broiler by Fayoumi M-15.2 and broiler by Leghorn lines. Commercial broiler vs. Bovans layer and unvaccinated vs. vaccinated Bovans layer immune cell metabolic potential were compared following an in-assay pathway inhibitor challenge. Titrations consistently showed that optimal PBMC density in laying hens and broilers was 3 million cells per well monolayer. Assay media substrate titrations identified 25 mM glucose, 1 mM glutamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate as the optimal concentration for layer PBMCs. Pathway inhibitor injection titrations in Bovans layers and broilers showed that 0.5 M carbonyl cyanide-4 phenylhydrazone (FCCP) and 1 M oligomycin were optimal. Baseline OCR and ECAR were significantly affected by genetic line of bird (p < 0.05), with the dual-purpose, L8 inbred line showing the highest OCR (mean 680 pmol/min) and the partially inbred broiler line showing the greatest ECAR (mean 74 mpH/min). ECAR metabolic potential tended to be greater in modern layers than broilers (p < 0.10), indicating increased ability to utilize the glycolytic pathway to produce energy. OCR was significantly higher in vaccinated than unvaccinated hens (p < 0.05), while baseline ECAR values were significantly lower in vaccinated Bovans laying hens, showing increased oxidative capacity in activated immune cells. These baseline data indicate that different genetic strains of birds utilized the mitochondrial respiration pathway differently and that modern commercial lines may have reduced immune cell metabolic capacity compared with legacy lines due to intense selection for production traits. Furthermore, the Seahorse assay demonstrated the ability to detect differences in cellular metabolism between genetic lines and immune status of chickens.","output":"Mitochondrial and Glycolytic Capacity of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Isolated From Diverse Poultry Genetic Lines: Optimization and Assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This chapter explains the application of shikimic acid as preventive medicine for the outbreak of swine or Avian flu due to H1N1 virus. Shikimic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxy-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid), a natural organic compound, is generally utilized as a starting material for industrial synthesis of the antiviral oseltamivir, a drug against the H1N1 influenza virus. It is also an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of lignin, aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan), and most alkaloids of plants and microorganisms. Plant and microbial sources are the only sources of shikimic acid. Being a deadly viral disease, influenza causes the death of around half a million people each year. A neuraminidase present on the surface of the virus is the most important factor for viral reproduction by contributing to the release of viruses from infected host cells and hence the treatment of influenza can only be possible by neuraminidase inhibitors. The neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir or Tamiflu derived from shikimic acid pathway have been found to be potent influenza viral neuraminidase inhibitors against most influenza strains.","output":"Chapter 16 Shikimic acid as intermediary model for the production of drugs effective against influenza virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Time series momentum strategies are widely applied in the quantitative financial industry and its academic research has grown rapidly since the work of Moskowitz, Ooi and Pedersen (2012).

METHODS: A total of 212 COVID-19 confirmed patients in Wuhan were included in this retrospective study. Clinical outcomes were designated as nonseptic shock and septic shock. Log-rank test was conducted to determine any association with clinical progression. A prediction model was established using random forest. RESULTS: The mortality of septic shock and nonshock patients with COVID-19 was 96.7% (29/30) and 3.8% (7/182). Patients taking hypnotics had a much lower chance to develop septic shock (HR = 0.096, p=0.0014). By univariate logistic regression analysis, 40 risk factors were significantly associated with septic shock. Based on multiple regression analysis, eight risk factors were shown to be independent risk factors and these factors were then selected to build a model to predict septic shock with AUC = 0.956. These eight factors included disease severity (HR = 15, p < 0.001), age > 65 years (HR = 2.6, p=0.012), temperature > 39.1C (HR = 2.9, p=0.047), white blood cell count > 10  10?

CONCLUSIONS This study informs the feasibility of implementing locally produced influenza vaccines in Vietnam. Educational programs, along with counseling services and government subsidies should be implemented to improve the coverage, demand, and WTP for the vaccine.","output":"Rural-urban differences in preferences for influenza vaccination among women of childbearing age: Implications for local vaccination service implementation in Vietnam."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Dengue is a major public health concern in Sri Lanka. COVID-19 in Sri Lanka was first detected in January 2020, and has continued to be prevalent in the country since that time. The impact of public health measures imposed to restrict COVID-19 transmission on the incidence of dengue throughout the island and particularly its northern Jaffna district in the period March 2020 to April 2021 was determined. Methods: The incidence of dengue and COVID-19, rainfall and the public health measures implemented to contain COVID-19 transmission for each district in Sri Lanka were obtained from Government sources. The Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model was used to predict the dengue incidence expected in March 2020 to April 2021, based on pre-pandemic data and this was compared with the actual reported incidence of dengue during the period of COVID-19 restrictions. Ovitrap collections of Aedes larvae were also carried out in the Gurunagar ward of Jaffna city in the Jaffna district during the 2020 and 2021 lockdown and the findings compared with data from 2019. Results: The reported number of dengue cases for the whole country from March 2020 to April 2021 was significantly lower than the numbers of dengue cases predicted from the five years immediately preceding the COVID-19 pandemic (2015-2019). Decreased numbers of dengue cases were reported compared to predicted numbers of cases in all 25 administrative districts in the country including the Jaffna district. Aedes larval numbers collected from ovitraps in the Gurunagar ward in Jaffna city during the COVID-19 lockdown period were decreased, with significantly lower proportions of Ae. aegypti than Ae. albopictus, compared with 2019. Conclusion: Public health measures that restricted movement of people, closed schools, universities and offices in order to contain COVID-19 transmission unexpectedly led to a marked reduction in the incidence of dengue in Sri Lanka, in contrast to Singapore. The differences between the two tropical islands have significant implications for the epidemiology of dengue.","output":"Reduced Dengue Incidence During COVID-19 Restrictions in Sri Lanka From March 2020 to April 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: : The clinical prognosis of outpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains difficult to predict, with outcomes including asymptomatic, hospitalization, intubation, and death. Here we determined the prognostic value of an outpatient chest radiograph, together with an ensemble of deep learning algorithms predicting comorbidities and airspace disease to identify patients at a higher risk of hospitalization from COVID-19 infection. METHODS: : This retrospective study included outpatients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing who received an ambulatory chest radiography between 3/17/2020 and 10/24/2020. In this study, full admission was defined as hospitalization within 14 days of the COVID-19 test for >2 days with supplemental oxygen. Univariate analysis and machine learning algorithms were used to evaluate the relationship between the deep learning model predictions and hospitalization for >2 days. RESULTS: : The study included 413 patients, 222 men (54%), with a median age of 51 years (interquartile range, 39C62 years). Fifty-one patients (12.3%) required full admission. A boosted decision tree model produced the best prediction. Variables included patient age, frontal chest radiograph predictions of morbid obesity, congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias, and radiographic opacity, with an internally validated area under the curve (AUC) of 0.837 (95% CI: 0.791C0.883) on a test cohort. CONCLUSIONS: : Deep learning analysis of single frontal chest radiographs was used to generate combined comorbidity and pneumonia scores that predict the need for supplemental oxygen and hospitalization for >2 days in patients with COVID-19 infection with an AUC of 0.837 (95% confidence interval: 0.791C0.883).

Many websites offer users the opportunity to leave comments, which may provide rich insights into public perspectives on health issues. With an established role in public health, fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption is central to the governments dietary guidelines. However, FV intake continues to fall short of government recommendations. OBJECTIVE: Using comments from news websites, this study aims to explore public perspectives on FV intake and related government dietary guidelines. METHODS: Data comprised 2696 web user comments generated in response to substantial media coverage for a meta-analysis examining FV consumption and the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and total cancer. Using an inductive thematic approach, the data were analyzed and coded in an iterative process. RESULTS: Four overarching themes emerged: personal factors, rejection, lack of knowledge, and food landscape, each with component subthemes. The lack of clarity around government dietary health guidelines was apparent, and this, along with emergent personal factors, may hinder better consumption. Rejection was also evident, as was a quality versus quantity of life debate. CONCLUSIONS: There are gaps in the publics understanding of government guidelines, which may act as a constraint to better compliance. Further work should examine this issue and rejection and the possibility of public fatigue related to dietary health information and news.

To compare the rate of clinical improvement between those who started LPV/ritonavir (LPV/r)+HCQ within 5 days of symptom onset (early treatment, ET) and those who started later (delayed treatment, DT). This was a retrospective intent-to-treat analysis of the hospitalized patients who started LPV/r + HCQ between 21 February and 20 March 2020. The association between the timing of treatment and the probability of 30-day mortality was assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic models. The study involved 172 patients: 43 (25%) in the ET and 129 (75%) in the DT group. The rate of clinical improvement increased over time to 73.3% on day 30, without any significant difference between the two groups (Gray's test P = .213).

The second wave of the pandemic in India caused unprecedented havoc and it can be stated that all the knowledge of the game of transmission of COVID-19 acquired and shared was not played with right precision and preparations. Rapid spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the second phase made us rethink if the choice of information given to the common people pertaining to the selective transmission restriction pathways with pressing concern on lethality were inadequate. Most of the governmental and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) including the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended droplet-based and airborne transmission restrictions as the major steps to control rapid spread of the virus. While, no caution was advised for other plausible pathways like sewage, wastewater-based and non-ventilated indoor air-based transmissions, which are still unknown or not well investigated, and are equally dangerous. The main focus of this article is to analyse the past development about SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathway related recommendation(s) provided by WHO and track the trajectory to alert all the concerning stakeholders and policymakers to rethink and to collect adequate scientific data before they recommend or neglect any specific or all the possible transmission pathways to control the spread of infectious agents further.","output":"Game of Transmissions (GoT) of SARS-CoV-2: Second Wave of COVID-19 is here in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Early reports from the COVID-19 pandemic identified coronary thrombosis leading to ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) as a complication of COVID-19 infection. However, the epidemiology of STEMI in patients with COVID-19 is not well characterized. We sought to determine the incidence, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, and outcomes in STEMI patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Methods and Results Patients with data on presentation ECG and in-hospital myocardial infarction were identified from January 14, 2020 to November 30, 2020, from 105 sites participating in the American Heart Association COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry. Patient characteristics, resource use, and clinical outcomes were summarized and compared based on the presence or absence of STEMI. Among 15 621 COVID-19 hospitalizations, 54 (0.35%) patients experienced in-hospital STEMI. Among patients with STEMI, the majority (n=40, 74%) underwent transthoracic echocardiography, but only half (n=27, 50%) underwent coronary angiography. Half of all patients with COVID-19 and STEMI (n=27, 50%) did not undergo any form of primary reperfusion therapy. Rates of all-cause shock (47% versus 14%), cardiac arrest (22% versus 4.8%), new heart failure (17% versus 1.4%), and need for new renal replacement therapy (11% versus 4.3%) were multifold higher in patients with STEMI compared with those without STEMI (P<0.050 for all). Rates of in-hospital death were 41% in patients with STEMI, compared with 16% in those without STEMI (P<0.001). Conclusions STEMI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is rare but associated with poor in-hospital outcomes. Rates of coronary angiography and primary reperfusion were low in this population of patients with STEMI and COVID-19.

We aimed to assess the effects of COVID-19-related disruption on dengue, a major expanding acute public health threat, in southeast Asia and Latin America. METHODS: We assembled data on monthly dengue incidence from WHO weekly reports, climatic data from ERA5, and population variables from WorldPop for 23 countries between January, 2014 and December, 2019 and fit a Bayesian regression model to explain and predict seasonal and multi-year dengue cycles. We compared model predictions with reported dengue data January to December, 2020, and assessed if deviations from projected incidence since March, 2020 are associated with specific public health and social measures (from the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracer database) or human movement behaviours (as measured by Google mobility reports). FINDINGS: We found a consistent, prolonged decline in dengue incidence across many dengue-endemic regions that began in March, 2020 (228 million cases in 2020 vs 408 million cases in 2019; a 441% decrease). We found a strong association between COVID-19-related disruption (as measured independently by public health and social measures and human movement behaviours) and reduced dengue risk, even after taking into account other drivers of dengue cycles including climatic and host immunity (relative risk 001C017, p<001). Measures related to the closure of schools and reduced time spent in non-residential areas had the strongest evidence of association with reduced dengue risk, but high collinearity between covariates made specific attribution challenging. Overall, we estimate that 072 million (95% CI 012C147) fewer dengue cases occurred in 2020 potentially attributable to COVID-19-related disruption. INTERPRETATION: In most countries, COVID-19-related disruption led to historically low dengue incidence in 2020. Continuous monitoring of dengue incidence as COVID-19-related restrictions are relaxed will be important and could give new insights into transmission processes and intervention options.

METHODS An obesity model was established by feeding Sprague-Dawley rats (ORs) a high-fat diet (HFD) and treating them with COST for 8 weeks. A model of lipid accumulation in hepatocellular carcinoma cells was established by treating HepG2 cells with free fatty acids and COST for 24 h. RESULTS COST treatment of ORs reduced weight gain, inhibited adipose tissue hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and reduced the fat-to-weight ratio. COST improved dyslipidaemia, reduced liver weight and organ index, inhibited hepatic lipid accumulation, and prevented liver steatosis, and the high COST dose increased TC and TG excretion in the stool. Treatment of lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells with COST reduced lipid accumulation and TG levels. COST modulated the expression of genes related to fat metabolism and ER stress response pathway-related factors in liver tissue and HepG2 cells.

Viral outbreaks are characterized by socio-behaviorally-oriented public health efforts aimed at reducing exposure and prevention of morbidity/mortality once infected. These efforts involve different points-of-view, generally, than do those aimed to understand the virus' natural history. Rampant spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cities clearly signals that urban areas contain conditions favorable for rapid transmission of the virus. MAIN TEXT: The Critical Medical Ecology model is a multidimensional, multilevel way of viewing pandemics comprehensively, rooted simultaneously in microbiology and in anthropology, with shared priority for evolution, context, stressors, homeostasis, adaptation, and power relationships. Viewing COVID-19 with a Critical Medical Ecological lens suggests three important interpretations: 1) COVID-19 is equally - if not more - a socially-driven disease as much as a biomedical disease, 2) the present interventions available for primary prevention of transmission are social and behavioral interventions, and 3) wide variation in COVID-19 hospitalization/death rates is not expected to significantly be attributable to a more virulent and rapidly-evolving virus, but rather to differences in social and behavioral factors - and power dynamics - rather than (solely) biological and clinical factors. Cities especially are challenged due to logistics and volume of patients, and lack of access to sustaining products and services for many residents living in isolation. CONCLUSIONS: In the end, SARS-CoV-2 is acting upon dynamic social human beings, entangled within structures and relationships that include but extend far beyond their cells, and in fact beyond their own individual behavior. As a comprehensive way of thinking, the Critical Medical Ecology model helps identify these elements and dynamics in the context of ecological processes that create, shape, and sustain people in their multidimensional, intersecting environments.","output":"Critical medical ecology and SARS-COV-2 in the urban environment: a pragmatic, dynamic approach to explaining and planning for research and practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bethany Boddy reflects on the changes and challenges faced by health visitors during the coronavirus pandemic","output":"Newly qualified health visitor: Adapting practice in difficult times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Results from cohort studies evaluating the severity of respiratory viral co-infections are conflicting. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the clinical severity of viral co-infections as compared to single viral respiratory infections. METHODS: We searched electronic databases and other sources for studies published up to January 28, 2013. We included observational studies on inpatients with respiratory illnesses comparing the clinical severity of viral co-infections to single viral infections as detected by molecular assays. The primary outcome reflecting clinical disease severity was length of hospital stay (LOS). A random-effects model was used to conduct the meta-analyses. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies involving 4,280 patients were included. The overall quality of evidence applying the GRADE approach ranged from moderate for oxygen requirements to low for all other outcomes. No significant differences in length of hospital stay (LOS) (mean difference (MD) ?0.20 days, 95% CI ?0.94, 0.53, p = 0.59), or mortality (RR 2.44, 95% CI 0.86, 6.91, p = 0.09) were documented in subjects with viral co-infections compared to those with a single viral infection.

The most common treatment for wet AMD is the intravitreal injections for inhibiting vascular-endothelial-derived growth factor (VEGF). This treatment usually involves multiple injections and thus multiple clinic visits, which not only causes increased cost on national health services but also causes exposure to the hospital environment, which is sometimes high risk considering current COVID crisis. The treatment, in spite of the above concerns, is usually effective. However, in some cases, either the medicine fails to produce the anticipated favourable outcome, resulting in waste of time, medication, efforts, and above all, psychological distress to the patients. Hence, early predictability of anatomical as well as functional effectiveness of the treatment appears to be a very desirable capability to have. METHOD: A machine learning approach using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) of two-sample prediction model has been presented that requires only the baseline measurements and changes in visual acuity (VA) as well as macular thickness (MAC) after four months of treatment to estimate the values of VA and MAC at 8 and 12 months. In contrast to most of the AI techniques, ANFIS approach has shown the capability of the algorithm to work with very small dataset as well, which makes it a perfect candidate for the presented solution. RESULTS: The presented model has shown to have a very high accuracy (> 92%) and works in near-real-time scenarios. It has been converted into a smart phone App, OphnosisAMD, for convenient usage. With this App, the clinician can visualize the progression of the patient for a specific treatment and can decide on continuing or changing the treatment accordingly. The complete AI engine developed with the ANFIS algorithm is localized to the phone through the App, implying that there is no need for internet or cloud connectivity for this App to function. This makes it ideal for remote usage, especially under the current COVID scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: With a smart AI-based App on their fingertips, the presented system provides ample opportunity to the doctors to make a better decision based on the estimated progression, if the same drug is continued with (good/fair prognosis) or alternate treatment should be sought (bad prognosis). From a functional point of view, a prediction algorithm is triggered through simple entry of the relevant parameters (baseline and 4 months only). No internet/cloud connectivity is needed since the algorithm and the trained network are fully embedded in the App locally. Hence, using the App in remote and/or non-connected isolated areas is possible, especially in the secluded patients during the COVID scenarios.","output":"Smart AMD prognosis through cellphone: an innovative localized AI-based prediction system for anti-VEGF treatment prognosis in nonagenarians and centenarians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. By decoupling economic growth from an intensive use of resources, preventing the impairment of natural capital, and enhancing resilience to system-wide shocks, Circular Economy (CE) is a powerful opportunity for economic agents willing to hedge against sustainability risk factors. In fact, it helps shielding against the risk of assets becoming stranded, can generate fresh and non-speculative demand for investments, and can improve companies results at both individual and portfolio levels. Problem. Therefore, equity investors into circular un- dertakings could benefit from (H1) reduced stock return volatility, as well as (H2) a greater ability to withstand exogenous negative events. Approach. For testing these hypotheses, we constructed a sample of ~600 listed com- panies across EU-15 countries, plus Switzerland, and 17 resource intensive industries. We retrieved their market data in 2019-20, as well as their accounting fundamentals in 2018-19. By controlling for the latter, we investigated whether market-based risk  either in total terms (i.e., the standard deviation of returns) or circumscribed to the systematic component thereof (i.e., the Beta against both a European and global market index)  may be explained by a companys degree of circularity, measured by the Circularity Score (CS). This is a novel indicator originally proposed by Zara et al. (2020), based on selected indicators included in the Refinitiv ESG dataset. As a core improvement, in weighting an entitys circular performance, we assessed the latters financial materiality (i.e., relevance to the companys business) at sub-industry level, applying the SASB Materiality Map. Methodology. Via OLS estimation, we tested our hypotheses (i) over the whole-time horizon, in a pooled model;(ii) on specific timeframes, in a standard cross-sectional model. The latter was applied to either the entire 2020 or subperiods thereof: namely, with respect to the COVID-19 outbreak, we distinguished between a pre-shock, a shock and a post-shock phase, as proposed in Ramelli and Wagner, 2020. Our quest was refined to conduct a deeper investi- gation into the Oil & Gas industry, which is intrinsically the most exposed to sustainability risks and, also, did experience the widest volatility in 2020. Findings. Both H1 and H2 received widespread confirmation. The CS was found to exert a widespread negative, significant and robust effect on all the risk measures, regardless of the timespan considered. Also, amplifying effects were recorded as of the Oil & Gas industry. Conclusions. Our results lend remarkable support to the idea that the CE can be a powerful de-risking strategy, also in case of a severe shock, with a view to mitigating the negative consequences and building back better.

Overall, 57.6% of participants (n = 571) intended to be vaccinated, 31.6% (n = 313) were not sure, and 10.8% (n = 107) did not intend to be vaccinated. Factors independently associated with vaccine hesitancy (a response of no or not sure) included younger age, Black race, lower educational attainment, and not having received the influenza vaccine in the prior year. Reasons for vaccine hesitancy included vaccine-specific concerns, a need for more information, antivaccine attitudes or beliefs, and a lack of trust. LIMITATIONS: Participants' intent to be vaccinated was explored before a vaccine was available and when the pandemic was affecting a narrower swath of the United States. Questions about specific information or factors that might increase vaccination acceptance were not included. The survey response rate was 16.1%. CONCLUSION: This national survey, conducted during the coronavirus pandemic, revealed that approximately 3 in 10 adults were not sure they would accept vaccination and 1 in 10 did not intend to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Targeted and multipronged efforts will be needed to increase acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available.

This home confinement has affected students of all levels, including university students, and has forced faculties to adapt online teaching strategies. Thus, traditional classroom face-to-face teaching has suddenly been replaced by online classes. This has revealed particularly challenging for medical courses. For such purpose we have designed an online teaching proposal addressed to the Degree in Physiotherapy and the Double Degree in Nursing and Physiotherapy of the University of Jan (Spain). The objective is to implement an online virtual teaching protocol through the use of Virtual Reality. For such a goal, the Leap Motion Controller (LMC) will be used to teach the neuroanatomy of the brain and spinal cord and to teach and practice neurorehabilitation exercises. Along with devices like the LMC students will be asked to use Health Sciences databases in order to achieve a significative learning of the course topics. The project is structured in two phases. First, students will learn neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the most relevant neurological conditions using LMC-based models. Then, they will learn to combine LMC games and conventional physiotherapy for neurorehabilitation purposes. The work of students will include the recording of videoreports demonstrating the acquisition of neuroanatomy concepts and simulating a clinical case. With this project we will assess the usability of LMC as an educative tool, the perception, satisfaction and self-regulated learning of physiotherapy students.","output":"An Innovative Approach for Online Neuroanatomy and Neurorrehabilitation Teaching Based on 3D Virtual Anatomical Models Using Leap Motion Controller During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its first detection in China in late 2019 the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the associated infectious disease COVID-19 continue to have a major impact on global health care and clinical practice.

Animal coronaviruses remain as one of the intriguing problems, known to cause deadly viral diseases on economically important animal population, and also these infections may spread to other animals and humans. Through isolation of the infected animals from others and providing appropriate treatment using antiviral drugs, it is possible to prevent the virus transmission from animals to other species. In recent times, antiviral drug-resistant strains are being emerged as a deadly virus which are known to cause pandemic. To overcome this, nanoparticles-based formulations are developed as antiviral agent which attacks the animal coronaviruses at multiple sites in the virus replication cycle. Nanovaccines are also being formulated to protect the animals from coronaviruses. Nanoformulations contain particles of one or more dimensions in nano-scale (few nanometers to 1000 nm), which could be inorganic or organic in nature. This review presents the comprehensive outline of the nanotechnology-based therapeutics formulated against animal coronaviruses, which includes the nanoparticles-based antiviral formulations and nanoparticles-based adjuvant vaccines. The mechanism of action of these nanoparticles-based antivirals against animal coronavirus is also discussed using relevant examples.

Many fertility clinicians currently prescribe MI for subfertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as pre-treatment to in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or for ovulation induction; however no high-quality evidence is available to support this practice. This review assessed the evidence for the effectiveness of inositol in subfertile women with a diagnosis of PCOS. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of oral supplementation of inositol for reproductive outcomes among subfertile women with PCOS who are trying to conceive. SEARCH METHODS We searched the following databases (to July 2018): Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGFG) Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and AMED. We also checked reference lists and searched the clinical trials registries. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any type, dose, or combination of oral inositol versus placebo, no treatment/standard treatment, or treatment with another antioxidant, or with a fertility agent, or with another type of inositol, among subfertile women with PCOS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently selected eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes were live birth and adverse effects; secondary outcomes included clinical pregnancy rates and ovulation rates. We pooled studies using a fixed-effect model, and we calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the overall quality of the evidence by applying GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS We included 13 trials involving 1472 subfertile women with PCOS who were receiving myo-inositol as pre-treatment to IVF (11 trials), or during ovulation induction (two trials). These studies compared MI versus placebo, no treatment/standard, melatonin, metformin, clomiphene citrate, or DCI. The evidence was of 'low' to 'very low' quality. The main limitations were serious risk of bias due to poor reporting of methods, inconsistency, and lack of reporting of clinically relevant outcomes such as live birth and adverse events.We are uncertain whether MI improves live birth rates when compared to standard treatment among women undergoing IVF (OR 2.42, 95% CI 0.75 to 7.83; P = 0.14; 2 RCTs; 84 women; I2 = 0%). Very low-quality evidence suggests that for subfertile women with PCOS undergoing pre-treatment to IVF who have an expected live birth rate of 12%, the rate among women using MI would be between 9% and 51%.We are uncertain whether MI may be associated with a decrease in miscarriage rate when compared to standard treatment (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.86; P = 0.02; 4 RCTs; 535 women; I2 = 66%; very low-quality evidence). This suggests that among subfertile women with PCOS with an expected miscarriage rate of 9% who are undergoing pre-treatment to IVF, the rate among women using MI would be between 2% and 8%; however this meta-analysis is based primarily on one study, which reported an unusually high miscarriage rate in the control group, and this has resulted in very high heterogeneity. When we removed this trial from the sensitivity analysis, we no longer saw the effect, and we noted no conclusive differences between MI and standard treatment.Low-quality evidence suggests that MI may be associated with little or no difference in multiple pregnancy rates when compared with standard treatment (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.71; P = 0.89; 2 RCTs; 425 women). This suggests that among subfertile women with PCOS who are undergoing pre-treatment to IVF, with an expected multiple pregnancy rate of 18%, the rate among women using inositol would be between 12% and 27%.We are uncertain whether MI may be associated with an increased clinical pregnancy rate when compared to standard treatment (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.85; P = 0.22; 4 RCTs; 535 women; I2 = 0%; very low-quality evidence). This suggests that among subfertile women with PCOS who are undergoing pre-treatment to IVF, with an expected clinical pregnancy rate of 26%, the rate among women using MI would be between 24% and 40%. Ovulation rates were not reported for this comparison.Other comparisons included only one trial in each, so for the comparisons MI versus antioxidant, MI versus an insulin-sensitising agent, MI versus an ovulation induction agent, and MI versus another DCI, meta-analysis was not possible.No pooled evidence was available for women with PCOS undergoing ovulation induction, as only single trials performed comparison of the insulin-sensitising agent and the ovulation induction agent. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS In light of available evidence of very low quality, we are uncertain whether MI improves live birth rate or clinical pregnancy rate in subfertile women with PCOS undergoing IVF pre-treatment taking MI compared to standard treatment. We are also uncertain whether MI decreases miscarriage rates or multiple pregnancy rates for these same women taking MI compared to standard treatment. No pooled evidence is available for use of MI versus placebo, another antioxidant, insulin-sensitising agents, ovulation induction agents, or another type of inositol for women with PCOS undergoing pre-treatment to IVF. No pooled evidence is available for use of MI in women undergoing ovulation induction.","output":"Inositol for subfertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ ]those who merely describe a normatively charged situation without availing themselves of theoretical guardrails risk missing the bigger picture [ ]we suggest that philosophers (and others with a propensity toward abstract thinking) should consider collaborating with clinicians and policy-makers, where relevant and appropriate, when planning a submission to JME [ ]it is also crucial to step back a bit to consider how medical ethicists, philosophers, political and social scientists, economists, health policy specialists and others, can collaborate to shed light on the wider systemic/structural, political and economic dimensions of this situation [ ]what does the reality of COVID-19 say about bioethics as a discipline, or the role of bioethicists in society?","output":"Pandemic medical ethics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objectives To investigate how successfully SARS-CoV-2 elimination strategies fulfil their promise of allowing a return to a \\"normal\\" social life, and to identify obstacles and challenges that may inhibit the realisation of this goal. Design Qualitative cross-sectional survey. Setting New Zealand community cohort. Participants 1040 respondents entered the study (18-90 years, M = 48.18.11, SD = 15.52, 76% women). 966 completed the questions relevant to this article. Participants were recruited via online advertisement campaigns designed to maximise variation in the sample as far as practicably possible. Main outcome measures Thematic analysis of participants' narratives. Results A majority of participants reported that the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 had allowed their life to go back to being \\"more or less the same\\" as before the pandemic. A small number indicated the pandemic had inspired them to become more social following elimination. Nevertheless, a sizeable minority of respondents reported being less social, even many months after SARS-CoV-2 had been eliminated. This was often because of fears that the virus might be circulating undetected, or because the March-May 2020 lockdown had led to changes in relationships and personal habits that were not easily reversed. Becoming less social was associated with having an underlying health condition that heightened one's vulnerability to COVID-19 (p = 0.00005) and older age (p = 0.007). Conclusions Elimination strategies can successfully allow the public to return to a pre-pandemic \\"normal\\" - or reinvent and improve their social lives should they wish. However, such outcomes are not inevitable. Re-establishing social connections after elimination can sometimes be a challenging process, with which people may need support.

This study aimed to appraise the sleep quality in medical and science students during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This questionnaire-based cross sectional study was conducted in the Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during September-December 2020. In this study, a validated self-administered electronic questionnaire was distributed to 1000 students, 782 (78.2%) of whom completed the study. The selection of students was based on using the stratified random sampling. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) instrument scale was used to assess the sleep quality among medical and general sciences students. RESULTS: Out of 782 respondents, 410 (52.4%) were medical students, and 372 (47.6%) were science students, including Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Statistics, Botany, and Zoology. Among the medical students, 143 (34.9%) were in pre-clinical years (1st and 2nd), while 266 (64.9%) of them were in clinical years (3rd, 4th, and 5th). Among all medical and general sciences students, it was found that 669 (85.5%) had poor sleep quality with a mean PSQI global score (mean 8.356) among them 336 (50.2%) were medical, and 333 (49.8%) were science students. Science students sleep quality was poorer (mean 8.78) than their medical counterparts (mean= 7.93). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant negative impact on students mental health and sleep quality. Both medical and general science students showed alarming levels of sleep deprivation and concerning low sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sleep deprivation among students may be due to the sudden change of pedagogy in education driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.

To contain its spread, Nigeria like many other countries, imposed drastic measures such as lockdown/curfew. OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the knowledge, attitude and perception (KAP) about COVID-19 pandemic among members of staff of a university community in Nigeria. University staff members contribute to national development through dissemination of specialized knowledge and skills and guiding the young generation. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey using an anonymous, self-designed, online KAP questionnaire was conducted from April 18 to May 31, 2020. The questionnaire consisted of ten knowledge questions regarding the transmission and prevention of COVID-19. The questions on attitude (15) and perception (10) assessed respondents behaviour towards adherence to government policies and views on government efforts to contain the infection respectively. RESULTS: A total of 125 (teaching) and 102 (non-teaching) staff responded. Approximately 59.1% of the respondents were males. The mean knowledge and positive attitude levels were 70.8% (SD  9.6%) and 83.1% (SD  13.07 %) respectively. Significant differences in the knowledge mean scores were observed for demographic categories such as educational qualification (p = 0.001), staff work category (p  0.000), work background (p  0.000), and type of lockdown (p = 0.027). Most of the respondents (85.3%) opined that COVID-19 was a biological weapon and viewed the lockdown as necessary (81.5%). However, they thought that the Nigerian government was not doing enough to mitigate COVID-19 spread.

In this paper, we collected the epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, outcomes, laboratory results and images of a SARS-CoV-2 carrier with no significant past medical history. The patient was quarantined because of her colleague had been diagnosed. After the onset of clinical symptoms, chest CT results showed patchy ground-glass opacity (GGO) in her lungs, but it took a total of nine nucleic acid tests to confirm the diagnosis, among which the first eight RT-PCR results were negative or single-target positive. In addition to coughing up phlegm during her stay in the hospital, she did not develop chills, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and other clinical symptoms. Since initial antiviral treatment, the lung lesions were absorbed. But the sputum nucleic acid test was still positive. In combination with antiviral and immune therapy, the patient tested negative for the virus. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 was detected only in the lower respiratory tract samples (sputum) throughout the diagnosis and treatment period. This is a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with common symptoms, and her diagnosis has undergone multiple false negatives ,suggesting that it is difficult to identify certain carriers of the virus and that such patients may also increase the spread of the SARS-CoV-2.","output":"A case of SARS-CoV-2 carrier for 32 days with several times false negative nucleic acid tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, we should not forget about chronic, underlying and important diseases, especially diseases that cause immune system deficiency, of which TB is one and may be missed.

Gardening has been found to have many benefits for people living with dementia. Although such research is important, most research frames people with dementia as passive recipients of stimulation. Research into the impact of a community-based gardening group, where people living with dementia are active in the development of an outdoor space, is underdeveloped. Knowledge about the impact of participating in such groups is also sparse. The Good Life Club (GLC) was co-developed and evaluated to respond to these gaps. OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this article is to present the findings regarding the impact of attending the GLC on the self-reported well-being for people living with dementia and care partners. METHODS: Qualitative data were collected via 22 semi-structured interviews. Fourteen interviews were conducted before the GLC and eight after the GLC. Thematic analysis was used to analyse data. Dementia Care Mapping data were collected to supplement the interview data. FINDINGS: Four key themes were identified. The first was that participants considered having active participation in social life to be a key aspect of living a good life. The second was that the way that the GLC was set up and delivered gave the participants ownership of the GLC and within this they felt able to contribute. The third was the importance of social connectedness and peer support to the well-being of both people living with dementia and care partners. Fourth, positive mood and well-being was directly experienced through gardening.

Approximately forty bills have been proposed since the 1980s and they mainly concern the proposal of an NHIS based on a certain degree of compulsoriness (the voluntary system is contemplated only on a subordinate basis). Two possible main hurdles to the promulgation of such laws were inferred: the insurance scheme to be adopted and the issue of illegal buildings. Furthermore, the item of natural hazard risk perception was a factor not adequately considered by the bills. Based on the critical scrutiny of the bills and taking advantage of international experiences, the establishment of a voluntary national scheme managed by a public authority with specific competences on NHIS is proposed.","output":"Building a Natural Hazard Insurance System (NHIS): The Long-lasting Italian Case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to extraordinary changes in family literacy instruction, forcing face-to-face programmes to shift rapidly (or \\"on the fly\\") to online, remote instruction.

Previously, mutations in the equine arteritis virus (EAV) nsp10 ZBD were shown to block arterivirus reproduction by disrupting RNA synthesis and possibly virion biogenesis. Here, we characterized the ATPase and helicase activities of bacterially expressed mutant forms of nsp10 and its human coronavirus 229E ortholog, nsp13, and correlated these in vitro activities with specific virus phenotypes. Replacement of conserved Cys or His residues with Ala proved to be more deleterious than Cys-for-His or His-for-Cys replacements. Furthermore, denaturation-renaturation experiments revealed that, during protein refolding, Zn2+ is essential for the rescue of the enzymatic activities of nidovirus helicases. Taken together, the data strongly support the zinc-binding function of the N-terminal domain of nidovirus helicases. nsp10 ATPase/helicase deficiency resulting from single-residue substitutions in the ZBD or deletion of the entire domain could not be complemented in trans by wild-type ZBD, suggesting a critical function of the ZBD in cis. Consistently, no viral RNA synthesis was detected after transfection of EAV full-length RNAs encoding ATPase/helicase-deficient nsp10 into susceptible cells. In contrast, diverse phenotypes were observed for mutants with enzymatically active nsp10, which in a number of cases correlated with the activities measured in vitro.

Quality of life, an important measure of physical, emotional, and social well-being, appears to be negatively associated with vision impairment, and increasingly, ophthalmic interventions are being assessed for their association with quality of life. Objective To examine the association between vision impairment or eye disease and quality of life, and the outcome of ophthalmic interventions on quality of life globally and across the life span, through an umbrella review or systematic review of systematic reviews. Evidence Review The electronic databases MEDLINE, Ovid, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Proquest Dissertations, and Theses Global were searched from inception through June 29, 2020, using a comprehensive search strategy. Systematic reviews addressing vision impairment, eye disease, or ophthalmic interventions and quantitatively or qualitatively assessing health-related, vision-related, or disease-specific quality of life were included. Article screening, quality appraisal, and data extraction were performed by 4 reviewers working independently and in duplicate. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal and data extraction forms for umbrella reviews were used. Findings Nine systematic reviews evaluated the association between quality of life and vision impairment, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, or mendelian eye conditions (including retinitis pigmentosa). Of these, 5 were reviews of quantitative observational studies, 3 were reviews of qualitative studies, and 1 was a review of qualitative and quantitative studies. All found an association between vision impairment and lower quality of life. Sixty systematic reviews addressed at least 1 ophthalmic intervention in association with quality of life. Overall, 33 unique interventions were investigated, of which 25 were found to improve quality of life compared with baseline measurements or a group receiving no intervention. These interventions included timely cataract surgery, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for age-related macular degeneration, and macular edema. Conclusions and Relevance There is a consistent association between vision impairment, eye diseases, and reduced quality of life. These findings support pursuing ophthalmic interventions, such as timely cataract surgery and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, for common retinal diseases, where indicated, to improve quality of life for millions of people globally each year.","output":"A Global Assessment of Eye Health and Quality of Life: A Systematic Review of Systematic Reviews."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Coeliac disease (CD) is a genetic autoimmune disorder characterised by a permanent sensitivity to the gluten contained in some grains.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS Our protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols 2015 guidelines. We will search PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase databases for relevant articles. Variant and broad search terms will be selected for identifying epidemiological studies reporting on the crude and/or adjusted association between TS and CD. Retrieved citations will be screened, and data from the eligible research reports against specific eligibility criteria will be extracted. We will then assess the risk of bias associated with the eligible studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The overall weighted strength of the pooled association will be quantified using the random-effects model. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This review will use data from published literature; hence, ethical approval will not be needed. The resulting review will be the first to produce a comprehensive synthesis of the strength of the association between TS and CD. The results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal as well as in local and international conferences and symposiums.

The purposes of this study were to assess the safety and efficacy of the Penumbra 5MAX ACE catheter for revascularization of large vessels and to compare its cost to the cost of stent retrievers. METHODS In this retrospective, single-center case review study, data were captured on consecutive patients treated with the Penumbra 5MAX ACE as first-line therapy during an 11-month period. Good functional outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 2 at discharge. Results were directly compared with previously published data for stent retrievers, and length of stay was analyzed in relation to revascularization. RESULTS The 31 patients studied had a mean age of 66.3  17.8 years and a mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 19.4  5.7. Intravenous tissue recombinant plasminogen activator therapy was initiated in 35.5% (11/31) of patients. A Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) grade of 2b-3 reperfusion after endovascular therapy was achieved in 26/31 (83.9%) of cases; TICI grade 3 was achieved in 19/31 (61.3%) patients. The average time from groin puncture to TICI grade 2b-3 reperfusion was 40 minutes. The average estimated cost for aspiration with the 5MAX ACE alone was $4,916 per case compared with an estimated cost of $9,620 if a stent retriever was used as the primary device. Our actual average cost per case, including all adjunctive devices used in the neurointerventional procedure, was $6,997. Good functional outcome was achieved in 19/31 (61.3%) patients. Two patients experienced symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (6.5%), and 1 (3.2%) patient died. The length of stay was significantly shorter among patients with TICI grade 2b-3 reperfusion compared to patients with TICI grade <2 (6.8  5.34 days vs 15.8  11.32 days, respectively; P<0.05). CONCLUSION These findings suggest that direct aspiration with the large-bore 5MAX ACE catheter can be considered a first-line approach to mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions. Our results demonstrated high rates of successful reperfusion in a timely manner with excellent clinical outcomes, although our sample size was small. In addition, this direct-aspiration technique has important cost-savings potential compared to stent retrievers.","output":"The Penumbra 5MAX ACE Catheter Is Safe, Efficient, and Cost Saving as a Primary Mechanical Thrombectomy Device for Large Vessel Occlusions in Acute Ischemic Stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The CDC hosts monthly panel presentations titled 'Public Health Grand Rounds' and publishes monthly reports known as Vital Signs. Hashtags #CDCGrandRounds and #VitalSigns were used to promote them on Twitter.

METHODS Through Twitter Search Application Programming Interface, original tweets containing the hashtag #CDCGrandRounds (n = 6,966; April 21, 2011-October 25, 2016) and the hashtag #VitalSigns (n = 15,015; March 19, 2013-October 31, 2016) were retrieved respectively. Negative binomial regression models were applied to each corpus to estimate the associations between retweet frequency and three predictors (hashtag count, mention count, and URL link count). Each corpus was sub-set into cycles (#CDCGrandRounds: n = 58, #VitalSigns: n = 42). We manually coded the 30 tweets with the highest number of retweets for each cycle, whether it contained visual cues (images or videos). Univariable negative binomial regression models were applied to compute the prevalence ratio (PR) of retweet frequency for each cycle, between tweets with and without visual cues. FINDINGS URL links increased retweet frequency in both corpora; effects of hashtag count and mention count differed between the two corpora. Of the 58 #CDCGrandRounds cycles, 29 were found to have statistically significantly different retweet frequencies between tweets with and without visual cues. Of these 29 cycles, one had a PR estimate < 1; twenty-four, PR > 1 but < 3; and four, PR > 3. Of the 42 #VitalSigns cycles, 19 were statistically significant.

Microsatellites have well established effects on (a) the genetic structure of diverse human populations and (b) expression of nearby genes. These lines of inquiry have uncovered 3,984 ethnically biased microsatellite loci (EBML) and 28,375 expression STRs (eSTRs), respectively. We hypothesize that a combination of EBML, eSTRs, and gene expression data (RNA-seq) can be used to show that microsatellites contribute to differential gene expression and phenotype in human populations. In fact, our previous study demonstrated a degree of mutual overlap between EBML and eSTRs but fell short of quantifying effects on gene expression. The present work aims to narrow the gap. First, we identify 313 overlapping EBML/eSTRs and recapitulate their mutual overlap. The 313 EBML/eSTRs are then characterized across ethnicity and tissue type. We use RNA-seq data to pursue validation of 49 regions that affect whole blood gene expression; 32 out of 54 affected genes are differentially expressed in Africans and Europeans. We quantify the relative contribution of these 32 genes to differential expression; fold change tends to be less than other differentially expressed genes. Repeat length correlates with expression for 15 of the 32 genes; two are conspicuously involved in glutathione metabolism. Finally, we repurpose a mathematical model of glutathione metabolism to investigate how a single polymorphic microsatellite affects phenotype.

Italy was the first country after China to experience a lock-down period. Our objective is to determine whether, during the COVID-19 period, there has been any modification in urological emergencies. METHODS: we retrospectively reviewed urgent urological consultations requested by the Emergency Department (ED) of Padua University Hospital in the 36-day period between February 22nd and March 30th, 2020 and compared them to the prior year cases within a similar time frame (February 24th to March 31st, 2019). Pediatric population (age < 15 years); surgical complications and traumas were excluded to avoid confounding from the reduction of activities during the lockdown. The number of daily consultations, the number of invasive procedures performed and admissions were evaluated, together with the predictors of admission were identified through multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: The final sample resulted in 107 consultations performed in 2020 and 266 in 2019. A higher number of daily consultations was performed during 2019 (7.33 vs 2.97, p < 0.001). Similarly, the number of daily-invasive procedures was higher in 2019 (p = 0.006), while there was no difference in the number of daily admissions (15 vs 12, p = 0.80).

Additionally, we demonstrate the use of these forborne mortgage payments range from enhancing the financial safety net for distressed borrowers by increasing precautionary savings, to buying necessities, to equity investing and debt consolidation.","output":"Reducing Strategic Forbearance under the CARES Act: an Experimental Approach Utilizing Recourse Attestation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread over 210 countries and territories beyond China shortly. On February 29, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) denoted it in a high-risk category, and on March 11, 2020, this virus was designated pandemic, after its declaration being a Public Health International Emergency on January 30, 2020. World over high efforts are being made to counter and contain this virus. The COVID-19 outbreak once again proves the potential of the animal-human interface to act as the primary source of emerging zoonotic diseases. Even though the circumstantial evidence suggests the possibility of an initial zoonotic emergence, it is too early to confirm the role of intermediate hosts such as snakes, pangolins, turtles, and other wild animals in the origin of SARS-CoV-2, in addition to bats, the natural hosts of multiple coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The lessons learned from past episodes of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are being exploited to retort this virus. Best efforts are being taken up by worldwide nations to implement effective diagnosis, strict vigilance, heightened surveillance, and monitoring, along with adopting appropriate preventive and control strategies. Identifying the possible zoonotic emergence and the exact mechanism responsible for its initial transmission will help us to design and implement appropriate preventive barriers against the further transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

How this impacts Obstetrics & Gynecology (OB/GYN) resident approaches to fellowship application and Match navigation is largely unknown. Methods: : We performed a cross-sectional survey study of fourth year OB/GYN residents who participated in at least one virtual fellowship interview in 2020. We collected information regarding demographics, application strategy, perceived strengths and weaknesses of virtual interviews, and confidence with rank list creation. Descriptive statistics were used for categorical variables and responses pre- and post- match were compared using Fishers exact test. Results: : 75 out of an estimated 490 applicants (~15% response rate) completed the survey. 65.3% felt they interviewed at more programs virtually than they would anticipate completing in person, but perceived less confidence in having the necessary information (n=45, 60%) or understanding the culture of programs (n=59, 78.7%) to create a rank list. Cost savings were the main benefit of virtual interviews (n=50, 66.7%), and inability to get a true feel for a program was the biggest limitation (n=43, 57.3%). A majority (46.7%) advocate for a future hybrid interview process.

Methods EGFR+ NSCLC patients treated with first/second-generation (1G/2G) TKI at our institution with a last follow-up after osimertinib approval (February 2016), were analyzed retrospectively, and the results compared with published data under osimertinib. Results A total of 207 patients received erlotinib (37%), gefitinib (16%) or afatinib (47%). The median age was 66 years, with a predominance of female (70%), never/light-smokers (69%). T790M testing was performed in 174/202 progressive cases (86%), positive in 93/174 (53%), and followed by osimertinib in 87/93 (94%). Among the 135 deceased patients, 94 (70%) received subsequent systemic treatment (43% chemotherapy, 39% osimertinib), while 30% died without, either before (4%) or after progression, due to rapid clinical deterioration (22%), patient refusal of further therapy (2%), or severe competing illness (2%). Lack of subsequent treatment was significantly (4.5x, p < 0.001) associated with lack of T790M testing, whose most frequent cause (in approximately 50% of cases) was also rapid clinical decline. Among the 127 consecutive patients with failure of 1G/2G TKI started after November 2015, 47 (37%) received osimertinib, with a median overall survival of 36 months versus 24 and 21 months for patients with alternative and no subsequent therapies (p = 0.003). Conclusion Osimertinib after 1G/2G TKI failure prolongs survival, but approximately 15% and 30% of patients forego molecular retesting and subsequent treatment, respectively, mainly due to rapid clinical deterioration. This is an important remediable obstacle to sequential TKI treatment for EGFR+ NSCLC. It pertains also to other actionable resistance mechanisms emerging under 1G/2G inhibitors or osimertinib, whose rate for lack of next-line therapy is similar (approximately 35% in the FLAURA/AURA3 trials), and highlights the need for closer monitoring alongside broader profiling of TKI-treated EGFR+ NSCLC in the future.","output":"Real-world implementation of sequential targeted therapies for EGFR-mutated lung cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, we developed a monoclonal antibody-based rapid nucleocapsid protein detection assay for diagnosis of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in humans and dromedary camels.

It has previously been shown that the N-terminal portion of this gene product is cleaved into a protein of 28 kilodaltons (p28). To further understand the mechanism of synthesis of the p28 protein, cDNA clones representing the 5'-most 5.3 kilobases of murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM were sequenced and subcloned into pT7 vectors from which RNAs were transcribed and translated in vitro. The sequence was found to encode a single long open reading frame continuing from near the 5' terminus of the genome. Although p28 is encoded from the first 1 kilobase at the 5' end of the genome, translation of in vitro-transcribed RNAs indicated that this protein was not detected unless the product of the entire 5.3-kilobase region was synthesized. Translation of RNAs of 3.9 kilobases or smaller yielded proteins which contained the p28 sequence, but p28 was not cleaved. This suggests that the sequence in the region between 3.9 and 5.3 kilobases from the 5' end of the genomic RNA is essential for proteolytic cleavage and contains autoproteolytic activity. The p28 protein could not be cleaved from the smaller primary translation products of gene A, even in the presence of the larger autocleaving protein. Cleavage of the p28 protein was inhibited by addition of the protease inhibitor ZnCl2. This study thus identified a protein domain essential for autoproteolytic cleavage of the gene A polyprotein.","output":"Identification of a domain required for autoproteolytic cleavage of murine coronavirus gene A polyprotein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After a long period of endeavor, immunotherapy has become the mainstream of cancer therapies. This success is mostly ascribed to immune checkpoint blockade, chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T cell therapies, and bispecific antibodies. However, these methods have been effective or applicable to only a limited proportion of patients so far. Thus, further development of broadly applicable and effective immunotherapies is eagerly anticipated. Given that innate immunity is key to the induction of robust adaptive immunity and that the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is a major hurdle to overcome, intratumoral immunotherapy in which delivery of immunostimulatory microbial agents to the tumor site triggers innate immunity in situ is a rational strategy. There has been a plethora of preclinical and clinical trials conducted involving the delivery of either mimetics of viral nucleic acids or oncolytic viruses intratumorally to trigger innate immunity via various nucleic acid sensors in the tumor site. Many of these have shown significant antitumor effects in mice, particularly in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. Oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1 has been approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma in the United States and Europe and of glioblastoma in Japan. Whereas direct intratumoral administration has mainly been chosen as a delivery route, several promising compounds amenable to systemic administration have been developed.

However, each sign may have a different risk of death. The current study aims to calculate the case fatality ratio for infants with individual or combined signs of possible serious infection, stratified by inpatient or outpatient treatment. METHODS: We analysed data from the African Neonatal Sepsis Trial conducted in five sites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya and Nigeria. Trained study nurses classified sick infants as pneumonia (fast breathing in 7-59 days old), severe pneumonia (fast breathing in 0-6 days old), clinical severe infection [severe chest indrawing, high (> = 38C) or low body temperature (<35.5C), stopped feeding well, or movement only when stimulated] or critical illness (convulsions, not able to feed at all, or no movement at all), and referred them to a hospital for inpatient treatment. Infants whose caregivers refused referral received outpatient treatment. The case fatality ratio by day 15 was calculated for individual and combined clinical signs and stratified by place of treatment. An infant with signs of clinical severe infection or severe pneumonia was recategorised as having low- (case fatality ratio 2%) or moderate- (case fatality ratio >2%) mortality risk. RESULTS: Of 7129 young infants with a possible serious infection, fast breathing (in 7-59 days old) was the most prevalent sign (26%), followed by high body temperature (20%) and severe chest indrawing (19%). Infants with pneumonia had the lowest case fatality ratio (0.2%), followed by severe pneumonia (2.0%), clinical severe infection (2.3%) and critical illness (16.9%). Infants with clinical severe infection had a wide range of case fatality ratios for individual signs (from 0.8% to 11.0%). Infants with pneumonia had similar case fatality ratio for outpatient and inpatient treatment (0.2% vs. 0.3%, p = 0.74). Infants with clinical severe infection or severe pneumonia had a lower case fatality ratio among those who received outpatient treatment compared to inpatient treatment (1.9% vs. 6.5%, p<0.0001). We recategorised infants into low-mortality risk signs (case fatality ratio 2%) of clinical severe infection (high body temperature, or severe chest indrawing) or severe pneumonia and moderate-mortality risk signs (case fatality ratio >2%) (stopped feeding well, movement only when stimulated, low body temperature or multiple signs of clinical severe infection). We found that both categories had four times lower case fatality ratio when treated as outpatient than inpatient treatment, i.e., 1.0% vs. 4.0% (p<0.0001) and 5.3% vs. 22.4% (p<0.0001), respectively. In contrast, infants with signs of critical illness had nearly two times higher case fatality ratio when treated as outpatient versus inpatient treatment (21.7% vs. 12.1%, p = 0.097). CONCLUSIONS: The mortality risk differs with clinical signs. Young infants with a possible serious infection can be grouped into those with low-mortality risk signs (high body temperature, or severe chest indrawing or severe pneumonia); moderate-mortality risk signs (stopped feeding well, movement only when stimulated, low body temperature or multiple signs of clinical severe infection), or high-mortality risk signs (signs of critical illness). New treatment strategies that consider differential mortality risks for the place of treatment and duration of inpatient treatment could be developed and evaluated based on these findings.

This study aimed to determine the knowledge, acceptance and perception of Malaysian adults regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. METHODOLOGY: An online survey was conducted for two weeks in December 2020. A bilingual, semi-structured questionnaire was set up using Google Forms and the generated link was shared on social media (i.e., Facebook and WhatsApp). The questionnaire consisted of questions on knowledge, acceptance and perception of COVID-19 vaccine. The association between demographic factors with scores on knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine were analysed using the Mann-Whitney test for two categorical variables, and the Kruskal-Wallis test used for more than two categorical variables. RESULTS: A total of 1406 respondents participated, with the mean age of 37.07 years (SD = 16.05) years, and among them 926 (65.9%) were female. Sixty two percent of respondents had poor knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine (mean knowledge score 4.65; SD = 2.32) and 64.5% were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine.

Of particular concerns are human-environment interactions and the handling and reusing the environmental materials, such as effluents, sludge, or biosolids laden with the SARS-CoV-2 without adequate treatments, thereby suggesting potential transmission and health risks. This study assesses the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in effluents, sludge, and biosolids. Further, we evaluate the environmental, ecological, and health risks of reusing these environmental materials by wastewater/sludge workers and farmers. A systematic review of literature from the Scopus database resulted in a total of 21 articles (11 for effluents, 8 for sludge, and 2 for biosolids) that met the criteria for meta-analysis, which are then subdivided into 30 meta-analyzed studies. The prevalence of SAR-CoV-2 RNA in effluent and sludge based on random-effect models are 27.51 and 1012.25, respectively, with a 95% CI between 6.14 and 48.89 for the effluent, and 104.78 and 1019.71 for the sludge. However, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the biosolids based on the fixed-effect model is 30.59, with a 95% CI between 10.10 and 51.08. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in environmental materials indicates the inefficiency in some of the treatment systems currently deployed to inactivate and remove the novel virus, which could be a potential health risk concern to vulnerable wastewater workers in particular, and the environmental and ecological issues for the population at large. This timely review portends the associated risks in handling and reusing environmental materials without proper and adequate treatments.","output":"A safe haven of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment: prevalence and potential transmission risks in the effluent, sludge, and biosolids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread to all 7 continents Due to yet unknown reasons, the African continent has remained relatively unaffected, especially Chad We discuss the importance of Mitigating Spread in Ndjamena focused on specific target population","output":"The late arrival of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Chad: mitigating spread in Ndjamena focused on specific target population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionAnxiety are among the most common (Huang, Zhao, 2020, Rajkumar, 2020, Roy et al., 2020) and stable (Wang et al., 2020) mental complaints in a pandemic situation. Based on cognitive approach (Beck, Emery, Greenberg, 2005) one should differentiate unrealistic (dysfunctional) anxiety as well as different types of anxiety (Roy et al., 2020).ObjectivesThe aim was to reveal relationship of different types of anxiety with the search for information about coronavirus and protective behavior.MethodsIn April 2020 (2-3 weeks of self-isolation regimen) 409 respondents not infected by coronavirus (186 men, 223 women) aged 18 to 64 years appraised their anxiety of infection and pandemic consequences (Cronbachs alphas .77-.82), the degree to which anxiety disturbs their usual activities, the frequency of tracking information about the coronavirus (.75) and various protective actions against the coronavirus (.76).Results17.1% reported that anxiety disturbed their activities. Anxiety of pandemic negative consequences was more prominent than anxiety of infection and was unrelated to age and gender. Anxiety of infection was higher in females (t=-5.48, p<.01, =.26) and elder people (r=.20, p<.01). Both anxiety of infection and of pandemic consequences was equally related to information tracking and protective behavior (r=.25-.36, p<.01). Dysfunctional anxiety was unrelated to adherence to self-isolation (r=.08) but was related to information tracking (r=.21, p<.01).ConclusionsDysfunctional anxiety is unrelated to self-isolation and should be differentiated from realistic anxiety in studies of pandemic.

The aim of this study was to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 presence in urban streams from a low sanitation context. Three river locations along the urban rivers of Quito were sampled on the 5th of June during a peak of COVID-19 cases. River samples were evaluated for water quality parameters and afterwards, concentrated for viral analysis using skimmed milk flocculation method. The viral concentrates were quantified for SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2 target regions) and Human Adenovirus as a human viral indicator. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was detected for both target regions in all samples analyzed in a range of 2,91E+05 to 3,19E+06 GC/L for N1 and from 2,07E+05 to 2,22E+06 GC/L for N2.

However, its measurement for the working-age populations, on a global scale and over time, is still unsatisfactory. Most indicators either only consider the quantity dimension of education and disregard the actual skills or are demographically inconsistent by applying the skills of the young cohorts in school to represent the skills of the working-age population at the same time. In the case of rapidly expanding or changing school systems, this assumption is untenable. However, an increasing number of countries have started to assess the literacy skills of their adult populations by age and sex directly. Drawing on this literacy data, and by using demographic backprojection and statistical estimation techniques, we here present a demographically consistent indicator for adult literacy skills, the skills in literacy adjusted mean years of schooling (SLAMYS). The measure is given for the population aged 20 to 64 in 185 countries and for the period 1970 to 2015.

There is substantial concern that the use of existing ICU triage protocols to allocate scarce ventilators and critical care resourcesmost of which are designed to save as many lives as possiblemay compound these inequities. As governments and health systems revisit their triage guidelines in the context of impending resource shortages, scholars have advocated a range of alternative allocation strategies, including the use of a random lottery to give all patients in need an equal chance of ICU treatment. However, both the save-the-most-lives approach and random allocation are seriously flawed. In this Perspective, we argue that ICU triage policies should simultaneously promote population health outcomes and mitigate health inequities. These ethical goals are sometimes in conflict, which will require balancing the goals of maximizing the number of lives saved and distributing health benefits equitably across society. We recommend three strategies to mitigate health inequities during ICU triage: introducing a correction factor into patients triage scores to reduce the impact of baseline structural inequities; giving heightened priority to individuals in essential, high-risk occupations; and rejecting use of longer-term life expectancy and categorical exclusions as allocation criteria.

IgM and total antibodies (Ab) against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA). RESULTS: Among the 206 patients, the positive rate of IgM and Ab were 149/206 (72.3 %) and 187/206 (90.8 %), respectively. And the specificity of IgM and Ab detection were 99.3 % and 98.9 %, respectively. The sensitivity of CMIA for Ab detection was significantly higher than that of IgM. An increase of the positive rate and S/CO value for detecting IgM and Ab accompanied with the increasing of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.) were observed.

Towards this, we introduce two general notions of fairness for PBMs, namely gamma-fairness and qualitative fairness. To satisfy these notions, our framework provides trustworthy agents with additional chances of pairing. We introduce Temporal Reputation Model (TERM) to quantify agents' trustworthiness across tasks.

Although an efficacious vaccine for HEV has been developed, we lack key epidemiologic data needed to understand how best to use the vaccine for hepatitis E control in endemic countries. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of articles published on hepatitis E in low-income and lower-middle-income countries in Africa and Asia. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases to identify articles with data on anti-HEV immunoglobulin (Ig)G seroprevalence, outbreaks of HEV, or risk factors for HEV infection, disease, or death, and all relevant data were extracted. Using these data we describe the evidence around temporal and geographical distribution of HEV transmission and burden. We estimated pooled age-specific seroprevalence and assessed the consistency in risk factor estimates. RESULTS: We extracted data from 148 studies. Studies assessing anti-HEV IgG antibodies used 18 different commercial assays. Most cases of hepatitis E during outbreaks were not confirmed. Risk factor data suggested an increased likelihood of current or recent HEV infection and disease associated with fecal-oral transmission of HEV, as well as exposures to blood and animals.

For this purpose, a multi-objective mathematical model is suggested that minimizes the carbon emissions and the total costs and maximizes the responsiveness of the system. Due to the dynamic space of the business environment, uncertainty is an integral part of the supply chain problem. Therefore, this research applies the robust possibilistic programming method to cope with uncertainty. Afterwards, since the research problem has a high level of the complexity, a hybrid solution approach based on a heuristic method and the meta-goal programming method is developed to solve the research problem in a reasonable time. Then, due to the importance of the ventilator device during the recent pandemic (COVID-19), this study considers this product as a case study. The main contribution of the current study is to design a green-responsive closed-loop supply chain network under uncertainty using a multi-objective robust possibilistic programming model, for the first time in the literature, especially in the medical devices industry.

The achieved results demonstrate the efficiency of the offered model and the developed hybrid method. Eventually, by carrying out sensitivity analysis, the impact of some of the critical parameters on the model is investigated.

We showed that intradermal (i.d.) miR-Let7b injection promoted skin inflammation, which was characterized by amplified Th1 cells, CD68+ M1 macrophages and transcriptional upregulation of glycolytic mediators, GLUT1, C-MYC and HIF1&#945;. Expansion of skin Th1 cells driven by miR-Let7b was also linked to elevated M1-associated IRFs. Interestingly, i.d. miR-Let7b administration exacerbated suboptimal joint inflammation along with metabolic reconfiguration of the PsA-like preclinical model. Moreover, TLR7 agonist, R837, potentiated metabolic reprogramming and expression of IL-1?, IL-6 and IL-12 in murine macrophages, enabling myeloid-to-T cell crosstalk.

In particular, quarantines are known to have an impact on quality of life and well-being (for example, associated symptoms such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and other psychosocial consequences). Furthermore, these effects are expected to be more pronounced in previously disadvantaged populations, such as LGBT people. This paper describes the main measures taken by LGBT population during quarantine to avoid COVID-19 and its psychosocial consequences on an individual and social basis. Method Non-probability sampling was used. An online self-administered survey including 1181 participants was used. These were lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender residents over 18 years old from Chile. Results Almost eight out of ten participants were in a total quarantine situation. From them, 18.2% were in partial isolation and only 4.6% were not in quarantine. COVID-19 has affected almost all the LGBT participants to a certain extent. COVID-19 has emotionally affected the vast majority of the LGBT participants to a certain extent. In other words, the pandemic has affected their lives.

Here, we identified a cell-intrinsic program that modified the neutrophil proteome in the circulation and caused the progressive loss of granule content and reduction of the NET-forming capacity. This program was driven by the receptor CXCR2 and by regulators of circadian cycles. As a consequence, lungs were protected from inflammatory injury at times of day or in mouse mutants in which granule content was low. Changes in the proteome, granule content and NET formation also occurred in human neutrophils, and correlated with the incidence and severity of respiratory distress in pneumonia patients.

RESULTS: The median age was 10 years, and 57.1% of the children were male. In addition, 78.3% of the children had histories of contact with adult patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19, and 27.0% of our patients had coexisting medical conditions. We found that 40.5% of our patients had mild infection, while 32.4% had moderate infection, and 27.1% had developed severe or critical illness. The most common abnormal laboratory findings in our patients were decreased lymphocytes (45.9%) and increased D-dimer values (43.2%), while abnormal radiological findings were detected in 56.7% of the children. In addition, 64.8% of the patients had received azithromycin, 59.4% of the patients had received oseltamivir, and hydroxychloroquine was used in combination with azithromycin in 35.1% of the children.

In this study, using biochemical, nuclear magnetic resonance, and thermodynamic analyses, we determined that the secondary structure of this 27 nt RNA can be significantly altered and retain the ability to direct RNA synthesis. In contrast, we find that position-specific changes in the RNA sequence will affect replicase recognition, modulate the polymerization process, and contribute to the differential accumulation of viral RNAs. These functional results are in agreement with the phylogenetic analysis of BMV and related viral sequences and suggest that a similar mechanism of RNA synthesis takes place for members of the alphavirus superfamily.","output":"RNA sequence and secondary structural determinants in a minimal viral promoter that directs replicase recognition and initiation of genomic plus-strand RNA synthesis 1 1 Edited by D.

Our primary objective was to estimate the percentage of cases reported in the general community, considered as those that occurred outside of long-term care facilities (LTCFs), in specific provinces and Canada as a whole. We applied a methodology using the delay-adjusted case fatality ratio (CFR) to all cases and deaths, as well as those representing the general community. Our second objective was to assess whether the assumed CFR (mean = 1.38%) was appropriate for calculating underestimation of cases in Canada. Estimates were developed for the period from March 11th, 2020 to September 16th, 2020. Estimates of the percentage of cases reported (PrCR) and CFR varied spatially and temporally across Canada. For the majority of provinces, and for Canada as a whole, the PrCR increased through the early stages of the pandemic. The estimated PrCR in general community settings for all of Canada increased from 18.1% to 69.0% throughout the entire study period. Estimates were greater when considering only those data from outside of LTCFs. The estimated upper bound CFR in general community settings for all of Canada decreased from 9.07% on March 11th, 2020 to 2.00% on September 16th, 2020. Therefore, the true CFR in the general community in Canada was likely less than 2% on September 16th. According to our analysis, some provinces, such as Alberta, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Saskatchewan reported a greater percentage of cases as of September 16th, compared to British Columbia, Ontario, and Qubec. This could be due to differences in testing rates and criteria, demographics, socioeconomic factors, race, and access to healthcare among the provinces. Further investigation into these factors could reveal differences among provinces that could partially explain the variation in estimates of PrCR and CFR identified in our study. The estimates provide context to the summative state of the pandemic in Canada, and can be improved as knowledge of COVID-19 reporting rates and disease characteristics are advanced.","output":"Exploring the percentage of COVID-19 cases reported in the community in Canada and associated case fatality ratios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies on the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and humoral immunity are fundamental to elaborate effective therapies including vaccines.

METHODS: We reviewed clinical data from pregnant patients with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, who were admitted to two tertiary care hospitals in Turkey. Demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, imaging findings, treatment received, maternal and neonatal outcomes were collected.

The goal of this study was to provide further insights into the relationship between pregnancy and DLGG. METHODS A total of 12 patients were selected from a shared database of DLGGs, according to the following inclusion criteria: DLGG diagnosis in post-partum, DLGG recurrence after pregnancy in patients previously operated for DLGG. The extent of surgical resection (EOR) at first surgery were evaluated. All cases were assessed based on the 2016 WHO classification. The tumor growing patter, expresses by preoperative T2T1 MRI index was evaluated. RESULTS In four cases newly diagnosed DLGG were detected patients in post-partum. Seven women, previously operated for DLGG, experienced pregnancy during the natural history of glioma, and were affected by tumor recurrence after pregnancy. One singular had an incidental LGG not surgically treated, who presented an important tumor growth after pregnancy. Radiological and surgical data were discussed according to literature. CONCLUSIONS Pregnancy does not seem to have an impact on the survival of women with DLGG. The potential role of pregnancy as risk factor in tumor recurrence is described, however, not proven. In this regard, the association between pregnancy and Tumor recurrence is extremely doubtful, and currently attributable to the simple coincidence.

Alphaviruses are a large group of positive-stranded RNA viruses that maintain their transmission and life cycles in both mosquitoes and mammals. However, there is little knowledge about how alphaviruses antagonize RNAi in both host organisms. In this study, we identified that Semliki Forest virus (SFV) capsid protein can efficiently suppress RNAi in both insect and mammalian cells by sequestrating dsRNA and siRNA. More importantly, when the VSR activity of SFV capsid was inactivated by reverse genetics, the resulting VSR-deficient SFV mutant showed severe replication defects in mammalian cells, which could be rescued by blocking the RNAi pathway. Besides, capsid protein of Sindbis virus (SINV) also inhibited RNAi in cells. Together, our findings show that SFV uses capsid protein as VSR to antagonize RNAi in infected mammalian cells, and this mechanism is probably used by other alphaviruses, which shed new light on the knowledge of SFV and alphavirus.Importance Alphaviruses are a genus of positive-stranded RNA viruses and include numerous important human pathogens, such as Chikungunya virus, Ross River virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, etc, which create the emerging and re-emerging public health threat worldwide. RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the most important antiviral mechanisms in plants and insects. Accumulating evidence has provided strong support for the existence of antiviral RNAi in mammals. In response to antiviral RNAi, viruses have evolved to encode viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs) to antagonize the RNAi pathway. It is unclear if alphaviruses encode VSRs that can suppress antiviral RNAi during their infection in mammals. In this study, we first uncovered that capsid protein encoded by Semliki Forest virus (SFV), a prototypic alphavirus, had a potent VSR activity that can antagonize antiviral RNAi in the context of SFV infection in mammalian cells, and this mechanism is probably used by other alphaviruses.","output":"The Capsid Protein of Semliki Forest Virus Antagonizes RNAi in Mammalian Cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Characterisation of germinal centre B and T cell responses yields critical insights into vaccine immunogenicity.

Importantly data indicating trends in food-borne infectious intestinal disease is limited to a few industrialised countries, and even fewer pathogens. It has been predicted that the importance of diarrhoeal disease, mainly due to contaminated food and water, as a cause of death will decline worldwide. Evidence for such a downward trend is limited. This prediction presumes that improvements in the production and retail of microbiologically safe food will be sustained in the developed world and, moreover, will be rolled out to those countries of the developing world increasingly producing food for a global market. In this review evidence is presented to indicate that the microbiological safety of food remains a dynamic situation heavily influenced by multiple factors along the food chain from farm to fork. Sustaining food safety standards will depend on constant vigilance maintained by monitoring and surveillance but, with the rising importance of other food-related issues, such as food security, obesity and climate change, competition for resources in the future to enable this may be fierce. In addition the pathogen populations relevant to food safety are not static. Food is an excellent vehicle by which many pathogens (bacteria, viruses/prions and parasites) can reach an appropriate colonisation site in a new host. Although food production practices change, the well-recognised food-borne pathogens, such as Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli, seem able to evolve to exploit novel opportunities, for example fresh produce, and even generate new public health challenges, for example antimicrobial resistance. In addition, previously unknown food-borne pathogens, many of which are zoonotic, are constantly emerging. Current understanding of the trends in food-borne diseases for bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens has been reviewed. The bacterial pathogens are exemplified by those well-recognized by policy makers; i.e. Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Antimicrobial resistance in several bacterial food-borne pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella and Vibrio spp., methicillin resistant Staphylcoccus aureas, E. coli and Enterococci) has been discussed as a separate topic because of its relative importance to policy issues. Awareness and surveillance of viral food-borne pathogens is generally poor but emphasis is placed on Norovirus, Hepatitis A, rotaviruses and newly emerging viruses such as SARS. Many food-borne parasitic pathogens are known (for example Ascaris, Cryptosporidia and Trichinella) but few of these are effectively monitored in foods, livestock and wildlife and their epidemiology through the food-chain is poorly understood. The lessons learned and future challenges in each topic are debated. It is clear that one overall challenge is the generation and maintenance of constructive dialogue and collaboration between public health, veterinary and food safety experts, bringing together multidisciplinary skills and multi-pathogen expertise. Such collaboration is essential to monitor changing trends in the well-recognised diseases and detect emerging pathogens.

Through its first and second waves it was relatively successful in terms of control of outbreaks. Nevertheless, like everywhere, the shock to national systems has been profound, and adjustment remains complex and volatile. Food is a critical human need, and the food industry is recognised as a vital economic sector. We present an examination of some of the adaptive responses of Australia's food systems during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, from January 2020 to October 2020, with a focus on three case studies (seafood exports, consumer behaviour and food sector employment). These case studies provide observations of specific stresses experienced, as well as insights into the adaptation strategies carried out by various actors within the nation's food systems. The shock was experienced differently in different parts of given food systems, and the opportunities for adaptation varied. Some supply chains lost business, others had to adapt to rapidly increased demands, and surges. Our analysis reveals features of Australia's food systems, and their relationships to other systems, that have facilitated resilience, and features that have impeded it. We found that international supply chains are highly vulnerable to global shocks, that insecure employment conditions throughout the food system reduce the resilience of the system overall, and that consumers are not fully confident in supply chains. We observed the importance of agency and adaptive behaviour throughout the food systems as actors worked to build their own resilience, with consequences for other parts of the system. Our findings suggest that food system resilience can be enhanced by ensuring that the goals and priorities of those most vulnerable in society are recognised and addressed within decision making processes throughout the system.

This study examines its early effect on a busy academic emergency department. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients from an academic tertiary care Level I trauma, cardiac and stroke center's emergency department seeing an average of 54,000 adults and 21,000 pediatric patients per year. Total visits, reasons for patient visits, demographics, disposition, and length of stay were analyzed from January through July 2020 and compared with the same time period in the previous 2 y. RESULTS: From March through July 2020 there were statistically significant decreases in the total number of patient visits (-47%) especially among pediatric (-73%) and elderly (-43%) patients and those with cardiovascular (-39%), neurological (-63%) complaints, headaches (-60%), back pain (-64%), abdominal pain (-51%), and minor trauma (-71%). There was, however, a significant increase in pulmonary complaints (+54%), as well as admissions (+32%), and length of stay (+40%). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant drop in overall patients and select groups early in the pandemic, while admissions and emergency department length of stay both increased.

However, therapeutic alternatives are limited, which is particularly critical in situations of treatment resistance or when electroconvulsive therapy is not available. Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising non-invasive neuromodulatory technique that has shown efficacy in other psychiatric conditions. We present the largest case series of tDCS use in catatonia, consisting of eight patients in whom tDCS targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction was employed. We used a General Linear Mixed Model to isolate the effect of tDCS from other confounding factors such as time (spontaneous evolution) or co-prescriptions. The results indicate that tDCS, in addition to symptomatic pharmacotherapies such as lorazepam, seems to effectively reduce catatonic symptoms. These results corroborate a synthesis of five previous case reports of catatonia treated by tDCS in the literature. However, the specific efficacy of tDCS in catatonia remains to be demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial.

Herein, a nanoparticle composed of poly(N,N-diethyl acrylamide) (PDEAA) and poly(2-(diisopropylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (PDPA) is developed. The antitumor drug celastrol (CLT) and the photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) are then loaded in it to form CIPP. ICG generates heat under near-infrared (NIR) stimulation to kill tumor cells and enhance CIPP penetration. Meanwhile, CIPP expands in response to hyperthermia and acid tumor microenvironments, preventing itself from returning to the blood flow, thus accumulating in tumor sites. Ultimately, the acidic lysosomal environment in tumor cells disintegrates CIPP to release CLT, directly inducing immunogenic cell death and sensitizing tumor cells for hyperthermia by disrupting the interaction of heat shock protein 90 and P50cdc37. Most of the tumors in B16F10-bearing mice are eradicated after single laser irradiation. The dual-responsive CIPP with multiple functions and simple design displays a synergistic antitumor effect.

Access to psychological treatment is scarce and, when available, often focuses on treating primary mental health problems rather than illness-related anxiety/depression. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a newly developed, therapist-supported, digital cognitive-behavioural treatment (COMPASS) for reducing LTC-related psychological distress (anxiety/depression), compared with standard charity support (SCS). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A two-arm, parallel-group randomised controlled trial (1:1 ratio) with nested qualitative study will be conducted. Two-hundred adults with LTC-related anxiety and depression will be recruited through national LTC charities. They will be randomly allocated to receive COMPASS or SCS only. An independent administrator will use Qualtrics randomiser for treatment allocation, to ensure allocation concealment. Participants will access treatment from home over 10 weeks. The COMPASS group will have access to the digital programme and six therapist contacts: one welcome message and five fortnightly phone calls. Data will be collected online at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks post-randomisation for primary outcome (Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale) and secondary outcomes (anxiety, depression, daily functioning, COVID-19-related distress, illness-related distress, quality of life, knowledge and confidence for illness self-management, symptom severity and improvement). Analyses will be conducted following the intention-to-treat principle by a data analyst blinded to treatment allocation. A purposively sampled group of COMPASS participants and therapists will be interviewed. Interviews will be thematically analysed.

This decision problem is closely related to the problem of optimal sensor selection, which is a very active research subject in control engineering. The goal of this paper is to propose a policy to smartly select the individuals to be tested. The main idea is to model the epidemics as a stochastic dynamic system and to select the individual to be tested accordingly to some optimality criteria, e.g. to minimize the probability of undetected asymptomatic cases. Every day, the probability of infection of the different individuals is updated making use of the stochastic model of the phenomenon and of the information collected in the previous days. Simulations for a closed community of 10'000 individuals show that the proposed technique, coupled with a selective confinement policy, can reduce the spread of the disease while limiting the number of individuals confined if compared to the simple contact tracing of positive and to an off-line test selection strategy based on the number of contacts.","output":"Smart testing and selective quarantine for the control of epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Problematic substance use (SU) has increased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHOD: We utilized two waves of data collected one month apart from a sample of 212 SGM assigned female at birth who used alcohol and/or cannabis (18C25 years old) collected between August 2020-February 2021. We examined associations between potential risk factors (i.e., retrospectively reported changes in anxiety/depression and in using substances in different contexts since before the pandemic): and 1) retrospectively reported changes in alcohol and cannabis consumption; 2) coping motives for use and SU consequences; and 3) subsequent changes in coping motives and consequences. RESULTS: An increase in solitary SU was a robust risk factor for concurrent and prospective increases in SU, coping motives, and consequences. Increases in SU with romantic partners were associated with concurrent increases in alcohol/cannabis consumption and consequences. Increases in anxiety and depression were associated with concurrent increases in SU and higher coping motives and consequences. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that solitary SU and increases in SU with romantic partners are robust risk factors for increases in SU and consequences in the context of the pandemic.

The outbreak of the disease has caused numerous individuals around the world to become extremely frightened and subsequently present the signs of phobia. Fear is the basic emotion of anxiety disorders and individuals cope with their emotions by different strategies. The present study aimed at developing and validating Emotion Regulation Strategies for Germophobia Questionnaire (ERS-GPQ). Methods: The study participants were 99 individuals (74 females) of the Iranian population with concerns about germs who were selected with the snowball sampling method. They completed the ERS-GPQ and GPQ in the Google Forms platform. Results: The present study results illustrated that the ERS-GPQ has acceptable internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha coefficient (a=0.61), reliability coefficients with split-half (0.70), and one-week test-retest (0.92);the ERS-GPQ also presented a moderate positive correlation with the contamination obsessions checklist of GPQ (r = 0.44) as the convergent coefficient. Besides, the confirmatory factor analysis indicated 2 factors of the ERS-GPQ. Finally, the ERS-GPQ has 2 components with good convergent and discriminate validities and composite reliability. Conclusion: Based on the current research findings, the ERS-GPQ has acceptable and good psychometric properties;researchers can use the ERS-GPQ as a reliable and valid instrument for assessing ER strategies concerning germophobia.

Clinical observations have shown that Qing-Fei-Da-Yuan (QFDY) granules have good anti-COVID-19 effects, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we explored the potential mechanism of QFDY with regard to its anti-COVID-19 effect. We first screened the active chemical constituents of QFDY based on the pharmacodynamic activity parameters, followed by screening with the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform. The Uniprot database was used for querying the corresponding genes of the target, and Cyoscape 3.6.1 software was used to construct the network of herb-compound-target. Protein interaction analysis, target gene function enrichment analysis, and signal pathway analysis were performed via STRING database, Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery, and KEGG Pathway database. Molecular docking was used to predict the binding capacity of the core compound with COVID-19 hydrolase 3CL and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The results showed that a network of herb-compound-target was successfully constructed, with key targets involving PTGS2, HSP90AA1, CAMKK2, NCOA2, and ESR1. Major metabolic pathways affected were those in cancer, procancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and apoptosis. The core compounds, such as quercetin, luteolin, and naringenin, showed a strong binding ability with COVID-19 3CL hydrolase; compounds such as anemasaponin C and medicocarpin showed a strong binding ability with ACE2. Thus, it is predicted that QFDY has the characteristics for multicomponent, multitarget, and multichannel overall control. The mechanism of action of QFDY in the treatment of COVID-19 may be associated with the regulation of genes co-expressed with ACE2, the regulation of inflammation and immune-related signaling pathways, and the influence of COVID-19 3CL hydrolase and ACE2 binding ability.","output":"Network Pharmacology Integrated Molecular Docking Reveals the Anti-COVID-19 Mechanism of Qing-Fei-Da-Yuan Granules"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 outbreak imposed serious mental pressure on people worldwide.

Methods: The present study was conducted on 911 subjects randomly selected and interviewed twice: Before the COVID-19 outbreak (Feb 2020) and at the end of two-month quarantine. The level of anxiety was measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), PA by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ), and daily sleep hours were reported by participants. Results: A high percentage of people experienced a decrease in PA (39.6%), an increase in sleep hours (33.7%), and an increase in anxiety (16.3%) during the quarantine. Women, young people, students, and illiterate people were more susceptible to increased level of anxiety;and women, young people, hypersomniac people, and people with higher education levels experienced lower PA. Furthermore, the odds of an increase in sleep hours was higher in men and young people and lower in people with intense PA and higher levels of anxiety. The changes in the three variables were mostly related to the quarantine, although interaction between PA and sleep was also present. Conclusion: The quarantine caused hypersomnia, a decrease in PA, and an increase in anxiety level especially among young people and women. As these are also risk factors of cardiovascular diseases, it is suggested that health authorities encourage an active lifestyle in the public and provide them with economic and psychological supports during the quarantine.","output":"Effects of quarantine due to the COVID-19 on sleep time, anxiety, and physical activity in adult population: A longitudinal study in Kerman, southeastern Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction/Objectif La dclaration des cas dinfections  SARS-Cov-2 non graves a t initialement limite par laccs  la RT-PCR Les donnes pidmiologiques en temps rel ont t fortement influences par la situation hospitalire Un triage mdical par questionnaire internet est-il un outil destimation de la situation pidmiologique ?

This review aims to clarify in which groups of patients staging with FDG-PET/CT would be beneficial and should be offered. We also discuss how tumor biology and breast cancer subtypes should be taken into account when interpreting FDG-PET/CT scans. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature review and rigorous appraisal of research studies assessing indications for FDG-PET/CT in breast cancer. This assessment regarding breast cancer served as a basis for the recommendations set by a working group of the French Society of Nuclear Medicine, in collaboration with oncological societies, for developing good clinical practice recommendations on the use of FDG-PET/CT in oncology. RESULTS: FDG-PET/CT is useful for initial staging of breast cancer, independently of tumor phenotype (triple negative, luminal or HER2 +) and regardless of tumor grade. Considering histological subtype, FDG-PET/CT performs better for staging invasive ductal carcinoma, although it is also helpful for staging invasive lobular carcinomas. Based on the available data, FDG-PET/CT becomes useful for staging starting from clinical stage IIB. FDG-PET/CT is possibly useful in patients with clinical stage IIA (T1N1 or T2N0), but there is not enough strong data to recommend routine use in this subgroup. For clinical stage I (T1N0) patients, staging with FDG-PET/CT offers no added value.

The factors associated with the outcome of COVID-19 have not been completely characterized to date.

The severity of COVID-19 is mainly related to host factors, especially cellular immune responses in patients. Patients with mild COVID-19 and improved patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit a normal immune response to effectively eliminate the virus. The immune response in patients with fatal severe COVID-19 includes three stages: normal or hypofunction, hyperactivation, and anergy. Eventually, the patients were unable to resist viral infection and died. Based on our understanding of the kinetics of immune responses during COVID-19, we suggest that type I interferon (IFN) could be administered to patients with severe COVID-19 in the hypofunctional stage, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and glucocorticoid therapy could be administered in the immune hyperactivation stage.

Following pilots in Mumbai and Patna (two major cities in India), an initiative known as the PublicCPrivate Interface Agency (PPIA) is now being expanded across the country. We aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of scaling up PPIA operations, in line with Indias National Strategic Plan for TB control. METHODS: Focusing on Mumbai and Patna, we collected cost data from implementing organisations in both cities and combined this data with models of TB transmission dynamics. Estimating the cost per disability adjusted life years (DALY) averted between 2014 (the start of PPIA scale-up) and 2025, we assessed cost-effectiveness using two willingness-to-pay approaches: a WHO-CHOICE threshold based on per-capita economic productivity, and a more stringent threshold incorporating opportunity costs in the health system. FINDINGS: A PPIA scaled up to ultimately reach 50% of privately treated TB patients in Mumbai and Patna would cost, respectively, US$228 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 159 to 320) per DALY averted and US$564 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 409 to 775) per DALY averted. In Mumbai, the PPIA would be cost-effective relative to all thresholds considered. In Patna, if focusing on adherence support, rather than on improved diagnosis, the PPIA would be cost-effective relative to all thresholds considered. These differences between sites arise from variations in the burden of drug resistance: among the services of a PPIA, improved diagnosis (including rapid tests with genotypic drug sensitivity testing) has greatest value in settings such as Mumbai, with a high burden of drug-resistant TB. CONCLUSIONS: To accelerate decline in TB incidence, it is critical first to engage effectively with the private sector in India. Mechanisms such as the PPIA offer cost-effective ways of doing so, particularly when tailored to local settings.","output":"Engaging with the private healthcare sector for the control of tuberculosis in India: cost and cost-effectiveness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of alerts from the Bronx RHIO, a health information exchange (HIE) to identify James J Peters VAMC patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the community was described to facilitate COVID-19 VA primary care follow-up COVID-19 hospitalization and testing alerts were delivered on a Bronx RHIO facility report VA COVID-19 follow-up care by telephone and video was guided by local COVID-19 clinical pathways, electronic health record (EHR) templates, and tracking through a database VA received 180 RHIO alerts for 111 unique patients, and 88 had positive non-VA testing from March to June 2020 41% of the 88 had non-VA admissions and 23% died 63% received VA primary care follow-up of COVID-19 symptoms documented by custom EHR templates The HIE identified 11% of the facility COVID-19 patients HIE alerts can be used to identify facility COVID-19 patients diagnosed in the community and facilitate follow-up by their VA primary care teams","output":"Utilizing a health information exchange to facilitate COVID-19 VA primary care follow-up for Veterans diagnosed in the community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus have boosted the need of knowledge about inactivation mechanisms to minimize the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.

In spite of recent crystallographic structures, little is known about the molecular changes induced by the temperature. Here, we unravel the molecular basis of the effect of the temperature over the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which is a homotrimer with three identical monomers, by executing atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at 298, 310, 324, 338, 358 and 373 K. Furthermore, both the closed down and open up conformational states, which affect the accessibility of receptor binding domain, have been considered. Our results suggest that the spike homotrimer undergoes drastic changes in the topology of the hydrogen bonding interactions and important changes on the secondary structure of the receptor binding domain (RBD), while electrostatic interactions (i.e. salt bridges) are mainly preserved. The proposed inactivation mechanism has important implications for engineering new approaches to fight the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, as for example, cleaving or reorganizing the hydrogen bonds through chaotropic agents or nanoparticles with local surface resonant plasmon effect.","output":"Temperature effect on the SARS-CoV-2: A Molecular dynamics study of the spike homotrimeric glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Home confinement, imposed as part of the social distancing measures in the fight against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19), poses several problems for patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA), including the lack of physical activity, psychological factors, and the confusion related to the prescriptions of NSAIDs.

Here, we incorporated the protein information to analyse the expression of ACE2, together with TMPRSS2 and Furin, two proteases assisting SARS-CoV-2 infection, at single cell level in situ, which we called protein-proofed single-cell RNA (pscRNA) profiling. Systemic analysis across 36 tissues revealed a rank list of candidate cells potentially vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.

Whereas, the polarized kidney proximal tubule cells, liver cholangiocytes and intestinal enterocytes are less likely to be the primary SARS-CoV-2 targets as ACE2 localizes at the apical region of cells, where the viruses may not readily reach. These findings are in concert with the clinical characteristics of prominent lung symptoms, frequent heart injury, and uncommon intestinal symptoms and acute kidney injury.

We used data from two recent clinical trials to develop and validate ML\\\\based clinical prediction models of the overall and progression\\\\free survival rates in patients with urothelial cancer initiating the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) atezolizumab. We demonstrated that ML can efficiently develop an accurate prediction model of survival, enable an accurate prognostic risk classification, and provide realistic expectations of treatment outcomes in patients undergoing urothelial cancer-initiating ICIs therapy. ABSTRACT: Machine learning (ML) may enhance the efficiency of developing accurate prediction models for survival, which is critical in informing disease prognosis and care planning. This study aimed to develop an ML prediction model for survival outcomes in patients with urothelial cancer-initiating atezolizumab and to compare model performances when built using an expert-selected (curated) versus an all-in list (uncurated) of variables. Gradient-boosted machine (GBM), random forest, Cox-boosted, and penalised, generalised linear models (GLM) were evaluated for predicting overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) outcomes. C-statistic (c) was utilised to evaluate model performance. The atezolizumab cohort in IMvigor210 was used for model training, and IMvigor211 was used for external model validation. The curated list consisted of 23 pretreatment factors, while the all-in list consisted of 75. Using the best-performing model, patients were stratified into risk tertiles. KaplanCMeier analysis was used to estimate survival probabilities. On external validation, the curated list GBM model provided slightly higher OS discrimination (c = 0.71) than that of the random forest (c = 0.70), CoxBoost (c = 0.70), and GLM (c = 0.69) models. All models were equivalent in predicting PFS (c = 0.62). Expansion to the uncurated list was associated with worse OS discrimination (GBM c = 0.70; random forest c = 0.69; CoxBoost c = 0.69, and GLM c = 0.69). In the atezolizumab IMvigor211 cohort, the curated list GBM model discriminated 1-year OS probabilities for the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups at 66%, 40%, and 12%, respectively. The ML model discriminated urothelial-cancer patients with distinctly different survival risks, with the GBM applied to a curated list attaining the highest performance.

Participants: Population consists of 24,145 university students and employees undergoing weekly Covid-19 testing between January 3rd and January 31st, 2022. The analytic sample was constructed via propensity score matching on vaccination status: Unvaccinated, completion of 2-dose mRNA series within previous 5 months, and receipt of mRNA booster dose within previous 5 months. The resulting analytic sample consists of 1,944 university students and 658 university employees. Intervention: Vaccination with a two dose or 3 dose regimen of the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine. Results: Booster protection against any SARS-CoV-2 infection was 66.4% among employees (95% CI: 46.1-79.0%; P<.001) and 45.4% among students (95% CI: 30.0-57.4%; P<.001). Compared to the 2-dose mRNA series, estimated increase in protection from the booster dose was 40.8% among employees (P=.024) and 37.7% among students (P=.001). We did not have enough evidence to conclude a statistically significant protective effect of the 2-dose mRNA vaccination series, nor did we have enough evidence to conclude that protection waned in the 5-month period after receipt of the 2nd or 3rd mRNA dose.

During development, physicians discussed individualized results with patients using shared decision-making (SDM). During the trial, patients were randomized to receive individualized recommendations or usual care (nonmasked, parallel, 1:1 ratio). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was patient interest in individualized recommendations, assessed by survey. Secondary outcomes were use of SDM, decisional comfort, readiness to change, and preventive services received within 1 year. RESULTS: The study enrolled 104 patients (31 development, 39 intervention, 34 control), of whom 101 were included in analysis (mean [SD] age, 56.5 [5.3] years; 73 [72.3%] women; 80 [79.2%] Black patients) and 20 physicians. Intervention patients found the tool helpful and wanted to use it again, rating it a median 9 of 10 (IQR, 8-10) and 10 of 10 (8-10), respectively. Compared with the control group, intervention patients more often correctly identified the service least likely (18 [46%] vs 0; P = .03) to improve their life expectancy. A greater number of patients also identified the service most likely to improve their life expectancy (26 [69%] vs 10 [30%]; P = .07), although this result was not statistically significant. Intervention patients reported greater mean [SD] improvement in SDM (4.7 [6.9] points) and near-term readiness to change (13.8 points for top-3-ranked recommendations). Point estimates indicated that patients in the intervention group experienced greater, although nonCstatistically significant, reductions in percentage of body weight (?2.96%; 95% CI, ?8.18% to 2.28%), systolic blood pressure (?6.42 mm Hg; 95% CI, ?16.12 to 3.27 mm Hg), hemoglobin A(1c) (?0.68%; 95% CI, ?1.82% to 0.45%), 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score (?1.20%; 95% CI, ?3.65% to 1.26%), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (?8.46 mg/dL; 95% CI, ?26.63 to 9.70 mg/dL) than the control group. Nineteen of 20 physicians wanted to continue using the decision tool in the future. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this clinical trial, an individualized preventive care decision support tool improved patient understanding of primary prevention and demonstrated promise for improved shared decision-making and preventive care utilization.

The main objective of this work is to propose a high speed, accurate and highly sensitive CT scan approach for diagnosis of COVID19. The CT scan images display several small patches of shadows and interstitial shifts, particularly in the lung periphery. The proposed method utilizes the ResNet architecture Convolution Neural Network for training the images provided by the CT scan to diagnose the coronavirus-affected patients effectively. By comparing the testing images with the training images, the affected patient is identified accurately. The accuracy and specificity are obtained 95.09% and 81.89%, respectively, on the sample dataset based on CT images without the inclusion of another set of data such as geographical location, population density, etc. Also, the sensitivity is obtained 100% in this method.

However, no study has specifically evaluated the relationship between obesity and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). RESEARCH QUESTION: Is obesity associated with an increased incidence of VAP? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a post hoc analysis of the Impact of Early Enteral vs. Parenteral Nutrition on Mortality in Patients Requiring Mechanical Ventilation and Catecholamines (NUTRIREA2) open-label, randomized controlled trial performed in 44 French ICUs. Adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support for shock and parenteral nutrition or enteral nutrition were included. Obesity was defined as BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2 at ICU admission. VAP diagnosis was adjudicated by an independent blinded committee, based on all available clinical, radiologic, and microbiologic data. Only first VAP episodes were taken into account. Incidence of VAP was analyzed by using the Fine and Gray model, with extubation and death as competing risks. RESULTS: A total of 699 (30%) of the 2,325 included patients had obesity; 224 first VAP episodes were diagnosed (60 and 164 in obese and nonobese groups, respectively). The incidence of VAP at day 28 was 8.6% vs 10.1% in the two groups (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI 0.63-1.14; P = .26). After adjustment on sex, McCabe score, age, antiulcer treatment, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment at randomization, the incidence of VAP remained nonsignificant between obese and nonobese patients (hazard ratio, 0.893; 95% CI, 0.66-1.2; P = .46). Although no significant difference was found in duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, 90-day mortality was significantly lower in obese than in nonobese patients (272 of 692 [39.3%] patients vs 718 of 1,605 [44.7%]; P = .02). In a subgroup of patients (n = 123) with available pepsin and alpha-amylase measurements, no significant difference was found in rate of abundant microaspiration of gastric contents, or oropharyngeal secretions between obese and nonobese patients.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic and wearing face mask is recommended across the globe to break the transmission chain of infection. The masks available in the market are of different types and materials and tend to alter the voice characteristics of the speaker. This can therefore impair optimal communication and the present study is a systematic review exploring the effect of various masks on voice production parameters. STUDY DESIGN: . Systematic review MATERIALS AND METHODS: . The titles and abstracts screening was carried out for the inclusion of articles using eight electronic databases spanning the period from 1(st) January 2020 to 30(th) April 2021. Ten articles (eight published & two in pre-print) that met the inclusion criteria were considered for this systematic review and the pooled age range was 18C69 years. RESULTS: . Three primary studies from the USA, two each from Australia & Italy, one each from Brazil, China, and Germany were found to have investigated the influence of wearing N95, KN95, surgical and fabric masks on voice related measures. The users significantly reported vocal fatigue, discomfort, and also perceived voice problems. Attenuation of speech sound amplitude was highest for the transparent mask followed by cloth mask, N95, KN95, and surgical mask. CONCLUSION: . The World Health Organization (WHO) has been repeatedly endorsing the need to use a face mask in the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, for an unintruded voice production, the surgical mask is recommended for everyone, including healthcare professionals when they are not in close contact with patients, and not involved in aerosol-generating procedures. For teachers, doing direct teaching (offline classes), surgical mask can reduce the vocal load of teachers, smoothen the teacher-student interaction and thereby facilitate better learning by the students. Additionally, it would be useful to protect oneself from the risk of developing voice problems by following standard vocal healthcare tips.","output":"Effect of face mask on voice production during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review: Effect of face mask on voice during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new global public health emergency The therapeutic benefits of Cold?Damp Plague Formula (CDPF) against COVID-19, which was used to treat cold?dampness stagnation in the lung in Trial Versions 6 and 7 of the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19, have been demonstrated, but the effective components and their mechanism of action remain unclear In this study, a network pharmacology approach was employed, including drug-likeness evaluation, oral bioavailability prediction, protein?protein interaction (PPI) network construction and analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation, and virtual docking, to predict the bioactive components, potential targets, and molecular mechanism of CDPF for COVID-19 treatment The active compound of herbs in CDPF and their candidate targets were obtained through database mining, and an herbsingredientstargets network was constructed Subsequently, the candidate targets of the active compounds were compared to those relevant to COVID-19, to identify the potential targets of CDPF for COVID-19 treatment Subsequently, the PPI network was constructed, which provided a basis for cluster analysis and hub gene screening The seed targets in the most significant module were selected for further functional annotation GO enrichment analysis identified four main areas: (1) cellular responses to external stimuli, (2) regulation of blood production and circulation, (3) free radical regulation, (4) immune regulation and anti-inflammatory effects KEGG pathway analysis also revealed that CDPF could play pharmacological roles against COVID-19 through multi components?multi targets?multi pathways at the molecular level, mainly involving anti-viral, immune-regulatory, and anti-inflammatory pathways;consequently, a CDPFherbsingredientstargetspathwaysCOVID-19 network was constructed In hub target analysis, the top hub target IL6, and ACE2, the receptor via which SARS-CoV-2 typically enters host cells, were selected for molecular docking analyses, and revealed good binding activities This study revealed the active ingredients and potential molecular mechanism by which CDPF treatment is effective against COVID-19, and provides a reference basis for the wider application and further mechanistic investigations of CDPF in the fight against COVID-19","output":"Potential mechanism prediction of Cold-Damp Plague Formula against COVID-19 via network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The existence of youth organizations in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak is urgently needed to partner with the government and related agencies as volunteers and spearheads in dealing social problems that arise due to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.

However, the strain diversity of species and its association with LC have received little attention. Here, we constructed a computational framework to study the strain heterogeneity in the gut microbiome of patients with LC. Only Faecalibacterium prausnitzii shows different single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) patterns between the LC and healthy control (HC) groups. Strain diversity analysis discovered that although most F. prausnitzii genomes are more deficient in the LC group than in the HC group at the strain level, a subgroup of 19 F. prausnitzii strains showed no sensitivity to LC, which is inconsistent with the species-level result. The functional differences between this subgroup and other strains may involve short-chain fatty acid production and chlorine-related pathways. These findings demonstrate functional differences among F. prausnitzii subgroups, which extend current knowledge about strain heterogeneity and relationships between F. prausnitzii and LC at the strain level. IMPORTANCE Most metagenomic studies focus on microbes at the species level, thus ignoring the different effects of different strains of the same species on the host. In this study, we explored the different microbes at the strain level in the intestines of patients with liver cirrhosis and of healthy people. Previous studies have shown that the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii has a lower abundance in patients with liver cirrhosis than in healthy people. However, our results found multiple F. prausnitzii strains that do not decrease in abundance in patients with liver cirrhosis. It is more sensitive to select the appropriate strains as indicators to distinguish between the disease and the control samples than to use the entire species as an indicator. We clustered multiple F. prausnitzii strains and discuss the functional differences of different clusters. Our findings suggest that more attention should be paid to metagenomic studies at the strain level.","output":"Comprehensive Strain-Level Analysis of the Gut Microbe Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in Patients with Liver Cirrhosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While direct-to-test diagnostics have been advocated for patients with suspected upper GI cancer in order to provide a timely diagnosis, only about 4% of such patients will have a cancer confirmed.2 When endoscopy capacity is restricted, as during the COVID-19 pandemic, a strategy of clinic review first would help to target those patients most likely to benefit from endoscopy. * PERMINDER S PHULL Consultant gastroenterologist, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Aberdeen, UK References 1Rees CJ, East J, Oppong K et al.

The objective of this report is to verify the use of intravascular placement to establish an appropriate microcatheter shape. Methods Fifteen patients (15 aneurysms) were included in this study because of the predicted difficulty of microcatheter insertion and stabilisation. The SL-10 straight microcatheter was inserted into the parent artery until the tip of the catheter passed through the neck of the aneurysm. After 5 minutes, the microcatheter was pulled out and the shape acquired from intravascular placement was confirmed and compared with the three-dimensional rotational angiography. In addition, the microcatheter tip was steam-shaped for coiling and coil embolisation was performed. A silicone flow model was also used to confirm our findings. The first experiment compared the bend angle in four different microcatheters placed in the model for 5 minutes. In the second experiment, the SL-10 straight microcatheter was placed in the model, and the bend angle was measured at 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 minutes to observe the changes in bend angle over time. Results The SL-10 straight microcatheter, in place for 5 minutes, acquired a shape similar to the patient's own vessel. Among the 15 patients included, 13 were treated using an intravascular shaped microcatheter.

This is of paramount importance when counseling pregnant women with hepatitis B virus (HBV) on risks and benefits to their offspring. Objective: To quantify the association between administration of ETV and ADV in pregnant women and occurrence of adverse events (AEs) during pregnancy (AEDP). Methods: Pregnancy reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) were used to perform a retrospective analysis of AEDP associated with ETV or ADV. Disproportionality analysis estimating the reporting odds ratio (ROR) was conducted to identify the risk signals. A signal was defined as ROR value >2, and lower limit of 95% confidence interval (CI)> 1. Results: A total of 1,286,367 reports involving AEDP were submitted to FAERS by healthcare professionals. Of these, there were 547 cases reporting ETV and 242 cases reporting ADV as primary suspected drugs. We found a moderate or strong signal for increased risk of spontaneous abortion when comparing ETV with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and telbivudine (LdT), with RORs equal to 1.58 (95% CI, 1.09C2.30) and 2.13 (95% CI, 1.04C4.36), respectively. However, when the included reports were limited to indication containing HBV infection, no signals for increased AEDP were detected. Futhermore, a strong signal for increased risk of spontaneous abortion was identified in patients with HBV infection when comparing ETV or ADV with lamivudine (LAM), with RORs of 3.55 (95% CI, 1.54C8.18) and 2.85 (95% CI, 1.15C7.08), respectively. Conclusion: We found a strong signal for increased risk of spontaneous abortion in patients with HBV infection taking ETV or ADV, in comparison with those prescribed with LAM. Moreover, no obvious signal association of human teratogenicity with exposure to ETV or ADV was identified in fetuses during pregnancy. Nevertheless, owing to the limitations of a spontaneous reporting database, which inevitably contains potential biases, there is a pressing need for well-designed comparative safety studies to validate these results in clinical practice.","output":"Adverse Events During Pregnancy Associated With Entecavir and Adefovir: New Insights From a Real-World Analysis of Cases Reported to FDA Adverse Event Reporting System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to assess how clinical outcomes of immunotherapy in real-world (effectiveness) correspond to outcomes in clinical trials (efficacy) and to look into factors that might explain an efficacy-effectiveness (EE) gap.

Individual PEB is personally driven, self-reliant, and are conducted on one's own (e.g., home recycling). Group focused PEB is other people-reliant and completed as part of a group (e.g., attending meetings of an environmental organisation). A wide range of identities have been related to PEBs. For example, a recent systematic qualitative review revealed 99 different types of identities studied in a PEB context. Most studies were correlational, few had an experimental design. However, the relationships between all these identities and PEBs have so far not been tested quantitatively with meta-analytical techniques. As such, a clear overview of this field is currently lacking. Due to the diverse nature of the field, a priori hypotheses were not possible and relatively broad definitions of identity had to be used to encompass all types of identities and the diverse meanings of identity that have been included in PEB research. What prior theory did allow for was to assess the distinction between two main types of identity, namely how people label, describe, and recognise oneself individually (individual identity), or as part of a group (group identity). Our overall goal was thus to assess the current state of knowledge on identities and PEBs. In 104 studies using a meta-regression following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines, our random-effects meta-analysis showed that the overall concept of identity associated with PEB with a medium Pearson's r (Aim 1). Furthermore, we found that individual identities associated more strongly with PEBs than group identities (Aim 2). The associations between individual and group identities were stronger when the identity and PEB were from the same category (e.g., when both were group-focused; Aim 3). Methodologically, the findings revealed that group identities and group PEBs were most strongly associated for self-reported rather than observed PEBs (Aim 4). Overall identity associated most strongly with group PEBs in the field rather than in the lab (Aim 5) and in student- rather than non-student samples (Aim 6). We discuss the theoretical and practical implications.","output":"How I See MeA Meta-Analysis Investigating the Association Between Identities and Pro-environmental Behaviour"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Data monitoring of clinical trials is a tool aimed at reducing the risks of random errors (e.g. clerical errors) and systematic errors, which include misinterpretation, misunderstandings, and fabrication. Traditional good clinical practice data monitoring with on-site monitors increases trial costs and is time consuming for the local investigators. This paper aims to outline our approach of time-effective central data monitoring for the SafeBoosC-III multicentre randomised clinical trial and present the results from the first three central data monitoring meetings. METHODS: The present approach to central data monitoring was implemented for the SafeBoosC-III trial, a large, pragmatic, multicentre, randomised clinical trial evaluating the benefits and harms of treatment based on cerebral oxygenation monitoring in preterm infants during the first days of life versus monitoring and treatment as usual. We aimed to optimise completeness and quality and to minimise deviations, thereby limiting random and systematic errors. We designed an automated report which was blinded to group allocation, to ease the work of data monitoring. The central data monitoring group first reviewed the data using summary plots only, and thereafter included the results of the multivariate Mahalanobis distance of each centre from the common mean. The decisions of the group were manually added to the reports for dissemination, information, correcting errors, preventing furture errors and documentation. RESULTS: The first three central monitoring meetings identified 156 entries of interest, decided upon contacting the local investigators for 146 of these, which resulted in correction of 53 entries. Multiple systematic errors and protocol violations were identified, one of these included 103/818 randomised participants. Accordingly, the electronic participant record form (ePRF) was improved to reduce ambiguity. DISCUSSION: We present a methodology for central data monitoring to optimise quality control and quality development. The initial results included identification of random errors in data entries leading to correction of the ePRF, systematic protocol violations, and potential protocol adherence issues. Central data monitoring may optimise concurrent data completeness and may help timely detection of data deviations due to misunderstandings or fabricated data.

Participants were 541 individuals from family members of patients with COVID-19 (F = 52.3%, Mean age = 41.313.2 years). Data were collected with a packet including socio-demographic and risk factors, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Short Health Anxiety Inventory, the Metacognitions Questionnaire-30, the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12, and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed a full mediation of metacognitions (i.e., positive beliefs about worry, negative beliefs about thoughts concerning uncontrollability and danger, cognitive confidence, and beliefs about the need to control thoughts), intolerance of uncertainty, and expressive suppression in the relation between FC-19 and health anxiety. Moreover, the strongest indirect links were found between FC-19 and health anxiety through negative beliefs about thoughts concerning uncontrollability and danger and intolerance of uncertainty. These associations were independent of gender and risk status. The final model accounted for 71% of the variance of health anxiety. These findings suggest that particularly metacognitions, intolerance of uncertainty and expressive suppression play a full mediational role in the relation between FC-19 and health anxiety.","output":"The relationship between fear of COVID-19 and health anxiety among families with COVID-19 infected: The mediating role of metacognitions, intolerance of uncertainty, and emotion regulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the last few years, the occupational health (OH) of healthcare workers (HCWs) has been shown increasing concern by both health departments and researchers.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a predictive indicator of prostate pathology. Men with elevated PSA levels are at increased risk of developing PC. There is currently no UK national PC screening programme, therefore patients often present to general practices (GPs) at later stages of pathology, worsening patient prognosis and outcomes. LOCAL PROBLEM: The location of the GP surgery had a large patient population at increased risk of PC, namely Afro-Caribbean/Asian males. METHODS: We conducted baseline measurements to identify male patients over the age of 65 and/or male patients who were at high risk of developing PC. These included previous referred patients or patients with a PSA over 10.0. We then implemented three plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles and measured their effect after 2 weeks of starting the respective intervention. INTERVENTIONS: PDSA1: Generating a list of target patients who have not had repeat/follow-up/referral and directly contacting by telephone to invite them for a blood test. PDSA2: Creating patient-specific electronic pop-up reminders on the electronic-patient-record system for PSA follow-up/referral/repeat test. Planned PDSA3: Patient education of prostate health and general self-checking, as well as benefits/risks of undergoing PSA screening in the form of patient focus groups and informative leaflets. RESULTS: We identified 220 male patients over 65 registered at a large South London GP surgery. 77.7% of eligible patients had a PSA measurement since 1 April 2019. Our results showed an overall increase in screening of 13.5% from baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Our project identified patients that may potentially have undiagnosed prostate pathology. However, a key factor for not reaching our goal was blood test refusal.

Studies on SPB have been hampered by the limited availability of markers for SPB in predelivery clinical samples that can be easily compared with gestational age-matched normal controls. We hypothesize that SPB involves aberrant placental RNA expression, and that such RNA transcripts can be detected in predelivery maternal plasma samples, which can be compared with gestational age-matched controls. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using gene expression microarray to profile essentially all human genes, we observed that 426 probe signals were changed by >2.9-fold in the SPB placentas, compared with the spontaneous term birth (STB) placentas. Among the genes represented by those probes, we observed an over-representation of functions in RNA stabilization, extracellular matrix binding, and acute inflammatory response. Using RT-quantitative PCR, we observed differences in the RNA concentrations of certain genes only between the SPB and STB placentas, but not between the STB and term elective cesarean delivery placentas. Notably, 36 RNA transcripts were observed at placental microarray signals higher than a threshold, which indicated the possibility of their detection in maternal plasma. Among them, the IL1RL1 mRNA was tested in plasma samples taken from 37 women. It was detected in 6 of 10 (60%) plasma samples collected during the presentation of preterm labor (32.9 weeks) in women eventually giving SPB, but was detected in only 1 of 27 (4%) samples collected during matched gestational weeks from women with no preterm labor (Fisher exact test, p = 0.00056). CONCLUSION: We have identified 36 SPB-associated RNA transcripts, which are possibly detectable in maternal plasma. We have illustrated that the IL1RL1 mRNA was more frequently detected in predelivery maternal plasma samples collected from women resulting in SPB than the gestational-age matched controls.","output":"Systematic Identification of Spontaneous Preterm Birth-Associated RNA Transcripts in Maternal Plasma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose This paper aims to highlight lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic for planning for the future of our ageing society. It looks at trends, changes in our society and implications for people of all ages. It focusses on the importance of planning and whether COVID-19 will lead to long-term changes. Design/methodology/approach This paper draws on the author's experiences running an intergenerational organisation during the pandemic and other work associated with ageing well. Findings This paper highlights some of the risks and unknowns we face going forwards and points to lessons and opportunities for \\"building back better\\". Research limitations/implications This paper is based on a review of published articles and viewpoints. Practical implications The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged people of all ages in different ways, some of which have tested intergenerational solidarity. At the same time, the pandemic has raised issues which we must all address going forward: planning for future pandemics, planning for an ageing society and ensuring that future planning works for all generations. This paper explores all these themes in the light of lessons from COVID-19. Firstly, despite much risk assessment and scenario planning, we were not well placed in the UK or across the world to respond to the multiple challenges of COVID-19. Have we learned the lessons to be able to deal better with the inevitable pandemics that will follow in the future? It is also well documented that the pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities in our society. What will the long-term impact be for longevity and will less healthy lives reverse the trend of increasing life expectancy? Secondly, what are the lessons for our ageing society? As life expectancy rises, what will the quality of life be like in those added years? Many of today's babies can expect to have a 100-year life. What does that mean for the way we lead our lives and can we ensure that everyone can age well? Third, these are not just issues for older people, but for people of all ages and generations. The Covid-19 experience has been different for younger and older people - whether it has been health or job security, income, taxation or housing. Questions of intergenerational fairness have again raised their heads, alongside the longer term impact for future generations. Social implications Firstly, despite much risk assessment and scenario planning, we were not well placed in the UK or across the world to respond to the multiple challenges of COVID-19. Have we learned the lessons to be able to deal better with the inevitable pandemics that will follow in the future? It is also well documented that the pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities in our society.

As life expectancy rises, what will the quality of life be like in those added years? Many of today's babies can expect to have a 100-year life. What does that mean for the way we lead our lives and can we ensure that everyone can age well? Thirdly, these are not just issues for older people, but for people of all ages and generations. Measures that bring older and younger people together and encourage meaningful mixing will help increase understanding and awareness between generations. This has huge implications for our society and communities. Originality/value This paper reaches two main conclusions. Firstly, the well-known saying: \\"failing to plan is planning to fail\\". This applies to all the issues discussed in this paper re future pandemics, our ageing society and future generations. Secondly, the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic should be the catalyst for changing the way we live and lead to new beginnings.

Previous studies have shown that general practitioners (GPs) have both expectations and concerns regarding patients use of mHealth apps that could impact their willingness to recommend the apps to patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this qualitative study is to investigate French GPs attitudes toward the prescription of mHealth apps or devices aimed toward patients by analyzing GPs perceptions and expectations of mHealth technologies. METHODS: A total of 36 GPs were interviewed individually (n=20) or in a discussion group (n=16). All participants were in private practice. A qualitative analysis of each interview and focus group was conducted using grounded theory analysis. RESULTS: Considering the value assigned to mHealth apps by participants and their willingness or resistance to prescribe them, 3 groups were defined based on the attitudes or positions adopted by GPs: digital engagement (favorable attitude; mHealth apps are perceived as additional resources and complementary tools that facilitate the medical work, the follow-up care, and the monitoring of patients; and apps increase patients compliance and empowerment); patient protection (related to the management of patient care and fear of risks for patients, concerns about patient data privacy and security, doubt about the usefulness for empowering patients, standardization of the medical decision process, overmedicalization, risks for individual freedom, and increasing social inequalities in health); doctor protection (fear of additional tasks and burden, doubt about the actionability of patient-gathered health data, risk for medical liability, dehumanization of the patient-doctor relationship, fear of increased drug prescription, and commodification of patient data). CONCLUSIONS: A deep understanding of both the expectations and fears of GPs is essential to motivate them to recommend mHealth apps to their patients. The results of this study show the need to provide appropriate education and training to enhance GPs digital skills. Certification of the apps by an independent authority should be encouraged to reassure physicians about ethical and data security issues.

Although the seroepidemiological studies in Japan observed a reported prevalence of 0.10% in Tokyo, 0.17% in Osaka, and 0.03% in Miyagi, sampling bias was not considered. The study objective was to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a random sample of households in Utsunomiya City in Tochigi Prefecture, Greater Tokyo, Japan. Methods: We launched the Utsunomiya COVID-19 seROprevalence Neighborhood Association (U-CORONA) Study to assess the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Utsunomiya City. The survey was conducted between 14 June 2020 and 5 July 2020, in between the first and second wave of the pandemic. Invitations enclosed with a questionnaire were sent to 2,290 people in 1,000 households randomly selected from Utsunomiya basic resident registry. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The level of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by chemiluminescence immunoassay analysis. Results: Among 2,290 candidates, 753 returned the questionnaire and 742 received IgG tests (32.4 % participation rate). Of the 742 participants, 86.8% were 18 years or older, 52.6% were women, 71.1% were residing within 10 km from the test clinic, and 89.2% were living with another person. The age and sex distribution, distance to clinic and police district were similar with those of non-participants, while the proportion of single-person households was higher among non-participants than participants (16.2% vs. 10.8%). We confirmed three positive cases through quantitative antibody testing. No positive cases were found among the people who live in the same household as someone with positive. All cases were afebrile.

Methods: Click and Connectwas developed to determine the feasibility of online groups for YP with CF.We designed a closed, online group over 4  1 hour sessions. The group was facilitated by two qualified Clinical Psychologists, and a trainee Clinical Psychologist. Group sessions covered: Introductions and Ground rules;Stress and Strategies;Emotions and wellbeing;and Problem-solving skills. Sessions were structured to provide information, enable discussion, as well as practical hands-on tasks. Packs were posted out each week with all materials required for each session. Results: 9 YP with CF were invited to the group, and 7 joined in total. The platform Zoom was used as it offered the best functions for group work whilst maintaining security. Parents consented to their children participating in the group;all correspondence was sent via the parents. Formal measures were not collected;instead we used the platform mentimeter to gauge feedback from the YP at the end of each session. Feedback from the YP was consistently positive. Conclusion: Despite some reservations about working online, and concerns over YP engagement, the online platform allowed more engagement than perhaps face-to-face might have. The YP appeared happy and comfortable working online, and functions such as the chat allowed those who perhaps were wary of talking on camera to interact in the sessions.

Synchronous participation included an average of75 participants per session. In total, there were 98 responses to thethree questions in the survey. Respondents include both MBG andClinical Biochemical Genetics (CBG) fellows (22 responses), as well asattending physicians, genetics/pediatrics residents, genetic counselors,advanced practice providers, and nurses. Participants scored thethree questions as follows: This session will improve my ability todiagnose and manage metabolic patients (4.60  0.59);This sessionmade me feel more connected to the larger metabolic community(4.62  0.65);and This session was high-yield given breadth anddepth of content and time allotted (4.61  0.65). Of note, MBG andCBG fellow responses to the three questions were 4.73  0.54,4.36  0.83, and 4.77  0.41, respectively. Free text comments weregenerally positive, with the major critiques being the large amount ofcontent for time allotted and the desire for board-related practicequestions.Conclusions: The MBG-CCSS endeavored to create a unique opportunityfor trainees to network, facilitate teaching by nationallyrecognized experts, and minimize duplication of effort in individualtraining programs. These goals were all achieved with great success.An unexpected finding was the level of interest from a much largernumber of individuals than expected, far more than th US cohort ofMBG fellows. This points to a significant unmet demand for IEMfocusededucation at all levels around the country. Evaluation scoresfrom fellows, as well as comments, indicate several areas forimprovement including 1) less content per session 2) more participantinteraction 3) incorporated board practice questions and 4) formalassessment of knowledge using a written final exam. We will alsostrive to improve fellow-fellow and fellow-faculty dialogue through interactive questions and smaller fellow-faculty-only discussions.Moving forward, we will continue to build on the success of the firstyear, to prepare and inspire IEM providers for independent clinicalpractice","output":"Opportunities for fellowship education: the first year of the Medical Biochemical Genetics Clinical Core Seminar Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mealtimes occur six times a day on eating disorder (ED) inpatient units and are a mainstay of treatment for EDs. However, these are often distressing and anxiety provoking times for patients and staff. A product of patients' distress is an increase in ED behaviours specific to mealtimes. The aim of this quality improvement project was to decrease the number of ED behaviours at mealtimes in the dining room through the implementation of initiatives identified through diagnostic work. METHODS: The Model for Improvement was used as the systematic approach for this project. Baseline assessment included observations in the dining room, gathering of qualitative feedback from staff and patients and the development of an ED behaviours form used by patients and staff. The first change idea of a host role in the dining room was introduced, and the impact was assessed. RESULTS: The introduction of the host role has reduced the average number of ED behaviours per patient in the dining room by 35%. Postintervention feedback demonstrated that the introduction of the host role tackled the disorganisation and chaotic feeling in the dining room which in turn has reduced distress and anxiety for patients and staff. CONCLUSIONS: This paper shows the realities of a quality improvement (QI) project on an ED inpatient unit during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results are positive for changes made; however, a large challenge, as described has been staff engagement.","output":"Improving mealtimes for patients and staff within an eating disorder unit: understanding of the problem and first intervention during the pandemic-an initial report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Globally, there have been 212,544,565 confirmed cases of Corona Virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including 4,441,428 deaths by 24 August 2021, reported to WHO. Facing the global pandemic of COVID-19, countries and regions have implemented different policies and taken different non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) according to their own circumstances. However, the quantitative assessment of national policies and local resilience capabilities is a huge challenge. Methods: In order to assess interventions and improve local resilience from a comprehensive perspective, this study aims to establish a multi-dimensional and dynamic prevention and control system. The main body of the system is an index system. To make our evaluation system more scientific and useful, the comparative study with several widely used tools or lessons is conducted to report what they have done. Then analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to set up the framework under the concept of a multi-level strategy of public health management. Indicators in the system are determined by literature research and expert interviews. Results: Emergency capability assessment includes building a well-established system, execution of the system, and measurement. The well-established system exhibits several characteristics: 1) considering indicators about whole-of-society involvement, including country-, city-, local community- and individual-level;2) improving capability at multi-phases, from the preparedness ability to response ability;3) at both policy level and implementation level. Categories of containment and closure, response in economic system, and response in public health system constitute the main body of the framework. The well-established system does not necessarily apply to all scenarios, and the actual situation should be taken into consideration in the process of implementation/execution. At the stage of measurement, the case of Wuhan/Hubei response is introduced to implement and test our system. Empirical researches will be conducted to verify the index system quantitatively in our future research. Conclusions: Our index system can assess national policies and capabilities quantitatively. When enough data are available, it will become a tool to assess the local resilience capability for countries or regions.","output":"Hierarchical Model of Multi-level Index to Assess Local Resilience Capability in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Expensive optimization problem (EOP) widely exists in various significant real-world applications. However, EOP requires expensive or even unaffordable costs for evaluating candidate solutions, which is expensive for the algorithm to find a satisfactory solution. Moreover, due to the fast-growing application demands in the economy and society, such as the emergence of the smart cities, the internet of things, and the big data era, solving EOP more efficiently has become increasingly essential in various fields, which poses great challenges on the problem-solving ability of optimization approach for EOP. Among various optimization approaches, evolutionary computation (EC) is a promising global optimization tool widely used for solving EOP efficiently in the past decades. Given the fruitful advancements of EC for EOP, it is essential to review these advancements in order to synthesize and give previous research experiences and references to aid the development of relevant research fields and real-world applications. Motivated by this, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey to show why and how EC can solve EOP efficiently. For this aim, this paper firstly analyzes the total optimization cost of EC in solving EOP. Then, based on the analysis, three promising research directions are pointed out for solving EOP, which are problem approximation and substitution, algorithm design and enhancement, and parallel and distributed computation. Note that, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first that outlines the possible directions for efficiently solving EOP by analyzing the total expensive cost. Based on this, existing works are reviewed comprehensively via a taxonomy with four parts, including the above three research directions and the real-world application part. Moreover, some future research directions are also discussed in this paper. It is believed that such a survey can attract attention, encourage discussions, and stimulate new EC research ideas for solving EOP and related real-world applications more efficiently.","output":"Evolutionary Computation for Expensive Optimization: A Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to describe a new secondary tracheoesophageal puncture technique with voice prosthesis insertion under local anesthesia with a low-cost device and evaluate its outcome.

Despite abundant data on that many COVID-19 patients also displayed kidney disease, there is limited information available about the recovery of kidney disease after discharge. METHODS: Retrospective and prospective cohort study to patients with new-onset kidney disease during the COVID-19 hospitalization, admitted between January 28 to February 26, 2020. The median follow-up was 4 months after discharge. The follow-up patients were divided into the recovery group and non-recovery group. Descriptive statistics and between-groups comparison were used. RESULTS: In total, 143 discharged patients with new-onset kidney disease during the COVID-19 hospitalization were included. Patients had a median age was 64 (IQR, 51C70) years, and 59.4% of patients were men. During 4-months median follow-up, 91% (130 of 143) patients recovered from kidney disease, and 9% (13 of 143) patients havent recovered. The median age of patients in the non-recovery group was 72 years, which was significantly higher than the median age of 62 years in the recovery group. Discharge serum creatinine was significantly higher in the non-recovery group than in the recovery group. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the new-onset kidney diseases during hospitalization of COVID-19 patients recovered 4 months after discharge. We recommend that COVID-19 patients with new-onset kidney disease be followed after discharge to assess kidney recovery, especially elderly patients or patients with high discharge creatinine.

BUILDING A EUROPEAN HEALTH DATA SPACE AND INFRASTRUCTURES SUPPORTING IT: The Commission will put forward a legislative proposal on European Health Data Space, supporting the use of data for healthcare, for research and policy making. As part of the European Health Data Space, it will also support the infrastructure allowing patients to share their health data with healthcare professionals when travelling abroad, in the language of the professional, thus avoiding repeating costs or diagnostic and medication errors stemming from misunderstandings. While aiming at creating a vibrant data ecosystem in the European Health Data Space, the Commission is exploring ways to overcome cross-border challenges on re-use of health data for policy, regulatory and research activities. Leveraging on the know-how and experience of national health data permit authorities and established data infrastructures, the EHDS pilot initiative aims at setting up a demonstrator for an overarching federated infrastructure enabling cross-country, cross-domain (health domains: mental health, genomic, cancer, rare diseases, etc.) re-use of health data. A set of use cases (observational studies) will be piloted to assess the value and impact that such overarching infrastructure would entail for EU-wide health data analytical studies. THE EUROPEAN DIGITAL COVID CERTIFICATE: Following the start of the vaccination campaign in December 2020, a lot of hope was placed in the use of vaccination certificates as a potential tool for supporting the gradual lifting of travel restrictions. Later, test and recovery certificates were added in the scope of the system, named EU Digital COVID Certificate. A legal proposal was prepared by the Commission, and fast-tracked by both the Council and the European Parliament. Current state of play on the use of EU Digital COVID Certificate will be presented. A COMMON EUROPEAN APPROACH FOR DIGITAL CONTACT TRACING: One of the key challenges during the early weeks of the pandemic was the establishment of an effective tracing system given the testing capacity limitations. Several research teams, in the EU and across the globe, started early on developing digital systems for contact tracing that would preserve privacy of users. This led soon to the deployment of the first contact tracing and warning applications that allow automatically alerting users at risk of COVID-19 infection. There are currently over 20 national contact tracing applications rolled out in the EU, and almost all of them are connected at European level enabling citizens to rely on a single mobile application when travelling across the connected countries.

Available data indicate that the oral cavity may be an active site of infection and an important reservoir of SARS-CoV-2. Considering that the oral surfaces are colonized by a diverse microbial community, it is likely that viruses have interactions with the host microbiota. Patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 may have alterations in the oral and gut microbiota, while oral species have been found in the lung of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, interactions between the oral, lung, and gut microbiomes appear to occur dynamically whereby a dysbiotic oral microbial community could influence respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. However, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can alter the local homeostasis of the resident microbiota, actively cause dysbiosis, or influence cross-body sites interactions. Here, we provide a conceptual framework on the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 oral infection on the local and distant microbiomes across the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (oral-tract axes), which remains largely unexplored. Studies in this area could further elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and the course of infection as well as the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 across different sites in the human host.","output":"Potential implications of SARS-CoV-2 oral infection in the host microbiota"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To radiologically examine how the spleen size, which has important functions in hematological and immunological balance, is affected in COVID-19. METHODS: Between July 1 and August 31, 2020, consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were analyzed. Among these patients, those who underwent chest computed tomography (CT) examination at the time of presentation, patients with follow-up CT due to clinical deterioration were included in the study. The CTs of the patients were evaluated in terms of spleen size and volume. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients (88 females, 55%) were included in the study. The mean time between the initial and follow-up CT was 7.2  2.8 days. The splenic volume (244.3  136.7 vs. 303.5  156.3 cm3) and splenic index (421.2  235.5 vs. 523.2  269.4 cm3) values were significantly higher in the follow-up CT compared to the initial CT (p < 0.001). The increase in the splenic volume and splenic index values was 59.2  52.4 cm3 and 101.9  90.3 cm3 (p < 0.001), respectively. The COVID-19 severity score was significantly higher in the follow-up CT compared to the initial CT (3.7  4.2 vs. 12.5  5.7, respectively; p < 0.001). The spleen width measured separately on the initial and follow-up CTs showed a highest positive correlation (r = 0.982, p < 0.001).

The COVID-19 pandemic is threatening the gains made in the fight against both diseases. DISCUSSION: Although crucial guidance has been released on how to maintain TB and HIV services during the pandemic, it is acknowledged that what was considered normal service pre-pandemic needs to improve to ensure that we rebuild person-centred, inclusive and quality healthcare services. The threat that the pandemic may reverse gains in the response to TB and HIV may be turned into an opportunity by pivoting to using proven differentiated service delivery approaches and innovative technologies that can be used to maintain care during the pandemic and accelerate improved service delivery in the long term. Models of care should be convenient, supportive and sufficiently differentiated to avoid burdensome clinic visits for medication pick-ups or directly observed treatments. Additionally, the pandemic has highlighted the chronic and short-sighted lack of investment in health systems and the need to prioritize research and development to close the gaps in TB diagnosis, treatment and prevention, especially for children and people with HIV. Most importantly, TB-affected communities and civil society must be supported to lead the planning, implementation and monitoring of TB and HIV services, especially in the time of COVID-19 where services have been disrupted, and to report on legal, policy and gender-related barriers to access experienced by affected people. This will help to ensure that TB services are held accountable by affected communities for delivering equitable access to quality, affordable and non-discriminatory services during and beyond the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Successfully reaching the related targets of ending TB and AIDS as public health threats by 2030 requires rebuilding of stronger, more inclusive health systems by advancing equitable access to quality TB services, including for people with HIV, both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, services must be rights-based, community-led and community-based, to ensure that no one is left behind.","output":"Turning threats into opportunities: how to implement and advance quality TB services for people with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spain has become one of the European epicenters of coronavirus (COVID-19), a virus that particularly affects the elderly, since this group accounts for the majority of hospitalized cases and has the highest mortality rates Therefore, the aim of this research is to understand how elderly people represent and emotionally cope with COVID-19 during the days when the pandemic emerged in Spain Using a qualitative methodology, a free association exercise elicited by the word \\"COVID-19\\" was completed by 115 participants (age range: 60-85 years) from the North of Spain Lexical analysis was used to analyze the content The results revealed that the government and the mass media are criticized for failing to communicate a clear message, and for giving out information that is both insufficient and contradictory However, participants are clear that it is essential to follow the guidelines of the scientists and doctors, which are represented as credible sources However, when the state of alarm and the lockdown of all citizens was declared, most of the participants represented the risk as being associated with the elderly and the pandemic became something that might also affect their families Due to these circumstances, negative emotions appear such as fear, nervousness, uncertainty, restlessness, and insecurity Feelings of solitude and loneliness also emerged, and these are represented as being linked to death These results indicate the need for governments to manage the current situation with the elderly by placing greater emphasis on social and inclusive policies to help alleviate the possible effects of the pandemic and the lockdown","output":"Exploring the Social and Emotional Representations Used by the Elderly to Deal With the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: SARS-CoV-2 has caused healthcare systems globally to reorganise. A pandemic paradox emerged; while clinicians were desperate for information on a new disease, they had less time to find and evaluate the vast volume of publications at times of significant strain on healthcare systems. A multidisciplinary team undertook a weekly literature search capturing all COVID-19 publications. We also monitored free open access medical education (FOAMed) sources for emerging themes. Title and abstract screening pooled the most relevant papers for emergency medicine. Three summary types were created, a Top 5 Flash Update, a journal club and a rapid response to emerging FOAMed themes. From these summaries, three modes of dissemination were used: short written summaries, blogs and podcasts. These were amplified through social media. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review was conducted assessing the impact of this knowledge dissemination strategy for the period of March to September 2020.

METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search of the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Medline, Cochrane and MedRxiv, was carried out. RESULTS: The presence of orchitis as a potential complication of the infection by SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed. One study reported that 19% of males with COVID-19 infection had scrotal symptoms suggestive of viral orchitis which could not be confirmed. It is possible that the virus, rather than infecting the testes directly, may induce a secondary autoimmune response leading to autoimmune orchitis. COVID-19 has been associated with coagulation disorders and thus the orchitis could be the result of segmental vasculitis. Existing data concerning the presence of the virus in semen are contradictory. Only one study reported the presence of RNA in 15.8% of patients with COVID-19. However, the presence of nucleic acid or antigen in semen is not synonyms of viral replication capacity and infectivity. It has been reported an increase in serum levels of LH in males with COVID-19 and a significant reduction in the T/LH and FSH/LH ratios, consistent with subclinical hypogonadism. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of recent reports related to the potential effects of COVID-19 infection on the male reproductive system are based on poorly designed, small sample size studies that provide inconclusive, contradictory results. Since there still exists a theoretical possibility of testicular damage and male infertilty as a result of the infection by COVID-19, males of reproductive age should be evaluated for gonadal function and semen analysis. With regard to the sexual transmission of the virus, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend asymptomatic couples to abstein from having sex in order to protect themselves from being infected by the virus.

Sequences of proteobacterial and Gram-positive lineage were retrieved most frequently (58% and 31% of all clone sequences, respectively), with Gram-positive and -proteobacterial sequences dominating international flight samples and - and -proteobacterial sequences comprising the largest portion of those retrieved from domestic flights. Significant differences in bacterial load and diversity were noted between samples obtained on domestic and international flights. The disparities observed in microbial abundance and diversity further underscore the immense value of state-of-the art molecular assays in augmenting traditional culture-based techniques.

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficiency of using a new LigaSure(?) vessel sealing system (LigaSure(?) Small Jaw Instrument; Covidien, Boulder, CO, USA). METHODS We evaluated 83 patients who underwent thyroid surgery between July 2009 and June 2012. The patients were allocated to two groups, which underwent thyroid surgery using either the LigaSure(?) Small Jaw Instrument or conventional techniques. We investigated the duration of operation, estimated blood loss, pathological characteristics, postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay. As for duration of operation and estimated blood loss, we also performed analyses by subgroups according to the extent of thyroid resection, as either total thyroidectomy or hemithyroidectomy. RESULTS The study groups showed no significant differences in age, sex, indications, extent of operation and estimated blood loss. Complication rates for recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, hypoparathyroidism, hematoma, and wound infection did not differ between groups, except for temporary hypoparathyroidism. Operation time was significantly shorter in the LigaSure(?) Small Jaw Instrument group than in the conventional group for all extents of thyroid resection. CONCLUSION Use of the LigaSure(?) Small Jaw Instrument seems likely to reduce the operating time for thyroid surgery without increasing estimated blood loss or the frequency of postoperative complications compared to conventional techniques.","output":"New technique using an energy-based device versus conventional technique in open thyroidectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused massive casualties, severe economic losses, and poses a threat to the world This study's primary objective was to analyze the hospital's potential hazards of COVID-19 prevention and control The second objective was to review the disaster plan and make recommen-dations to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals Methods: An expert group for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in the First People's Hospital of Long-quanyi Dis-trict, Chengdu, China was established We adopted the hazard vulnerability analysis (HVA) to risk-stratify potential hazards and calculated relative risk values We used the Delphi expert consultation method to propose and implement targeted improvement measures for the top five potential hazards Then, the effects before and after the intervention were compared Results: The top five hazards were: insufficient Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (25 68%), inadequate diagnosis ability of clinicians (22 55%), and inadequate management strategies of patients and caregivers (22 38%), lack of professional ability of pre-checking and triage staff (16 96%), lack of knowledge of COVID-19 of medical staff (15 59%) After taking targeted improvement measures, the average score of the hospital staff's COVID-19 knowledge test increased from 73 26 points to 90 44 points, the average test score of the outsourcing company employees increased from 68 55 to 89 75 points The differences were statistically significant (P&lt;0 05) Conclusion: HVA can be used to systematically risk-stratify potential threats, measure the probability of those potential hazards, and develop various hospital prevention and control measures for COVID-19 epidemics ? 2021 Ma et al","output":"The application of hazard vulnerability analysis in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in medical institutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 run on medical resources crashed Wuhans medical care system, a medical disaster duplicated in many countries facing the COVID-19 pandemic.

We present an investigation of individual differences in facial expression of emotion using observational techniques. Given descriptions of highly psychopathic persons as successful liars and manipulators, we investigate the ability to intentionally pose emotional expressions when no emotion is elicited. A mixed sample of adult men (N = 316 community volunteers, prison inmates, and forensic-psychiatric patients) ranging along the psychopathy continuum were asked to facially express a nonfelt emotion, specifically anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise, through either written instructions or through imitation of a target's facial expression. Through structural equation modeling, we evaluate relations between this emotion expression ability and general mental ability, interpersonal abilities, and psychopathy. We find that psychopathy is moderately associated with poorer emotion expression ability, meaning highly psychopathic individuals are poorer at imitating the expressions of others and poorer at expressing all emotions. However, this deficit is largely attributable to deficits in general mental ability. These results challenge the view that highly psychopathic individuals have the cognitive skills to support a superior ability to deceive or manipulate others.

This study aimed to compare the effect of the measures taken by Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom (UK) governments on the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic as predicted by a mathematical model. Method: Data on the numbers of cases, deaths and government measures were collected from Saudi Ministry of Health and Public Health England. A prediction of the trend of cases, deaths and days to peak was then modelled using the mathematical technique, Exponential Logistic Growth and Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) model. The measures taken by the governments and the predicted outcomes were compared to assess effectiveness. Result: We found over three months that 22 fast and extreme measures had been taken in Saudi Arabia compared to eight slow and late measures in the UK. This resulted in a decline in numbers of current infected cases per day and mortality in Saudi Arabia compared to the UK. Based on the SIR model, the predicted number of COVID-19 cases in Saudi as of 31st of March was 2064, while the predicted number of cases was 63012 in the UK. In addition, the pandemic is predicted to peak earlier on the 27th of March in Saudi Arabia compared to the 2nd of May 2020 in the UK. The end of transition phases for Saudi and UK according to the model, were predicted to be on 18th of April and 24th of May, respectively. These numbers relate to early and decisive measures adopted by the Saudi government. Conclusion: We show that early extreme measures, informed by science and guided by experience, helped reduce the spread and related deaths from COVID-19 in Saudi.

Leiomyomas have been classified as solid angiomyoma, angioleiomyoma (vascular leiomyoma), and epithelioid variants. Angioleiomyomas are benign mesenchymal tumors derived from smooth muscle, which rarely occur in the oral cavity.

The CV service had to quickly evaluate and implement measures to reduce the rate of transmission of the coronavirus, which included adapting the clinic workflow to comply with state and federal recommendations. To minimize the interruption of clinical services and the associated revenue, a rapid transition from outpatient clinic visits to telehealth visits was implemented. CASES: Two cases reports of patients with wounds managed with 2 different telehealth platforms are described. Doxy.me platform allows the provider to e-mail or text a link to their personal waiting room for patients to join the video call.

It frequently presents with unremitting fever, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and systemic complications (e.g., gastrointestinal, renal, cardiac, and hepatic involvement), encephalopathy, and thrombotic events. The respiratory symptoms are similar to those accompanying other genetically related beta-coronaviruses (CoVs) such as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). Hypoxemic respiratory symptoms can rapidly progress to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, leading to multi-organ system dysfunction syndrome. Severe cases are typically associated with aberrant and excessive inflammatory responses. These include significant systemic upregulation of cytokines, chemokines, and pro-inflammatory mediators, associated with increased acute-phase proteins (APPs) production such as hyperferritinemia and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as lymphocytopenia. The neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection are high among those with severe and critical illnesses. This review highlights the central nervous system (CNS) complications associated with COVID-19 attributed to primary CNS involvement due to rare direct neuroinvasion and more commonly secondary CNS sequelae due to exuberant systemic innate-mediated hyper-inflammation.

This risk is especially critical with the on-going development of COVID-19 vaccines. The ability to track and trace vaccines through the vaccine supply chain down to persons vaccinated has to be enhanced. In this context of traceability, the global immunization community has recently set the barcoding of the primary packaging of vaccines, specifically vaccine vials and pre-filled syringes, as a top priority. Emerging vaccine manufacturers are already engaged in investigating ways to incorporate barcoding in their labelling and packaging using GS1 international standards. A specific pilot taking place in Indonesia by the national vaccine manufacturer, Bio Farma, shows the innovation of barcoding on primary packaging already underway with a relatively modest level of investment and success at this stage. This article highlights the efforts of industry and governments on the value of traceability and introduction to 2D barcodes.

Methods Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment type, and clinical outcome data were collected from patients medical records. Multivariable analyses were used to determine factors associated with COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. For the former, the competing risk analysis - based on Fine and Grays model - took death into account. Results 480 residents were included. Median age was 88 years (IQR 80-93), and 330 residents were women. A total of 371 residents were symptomatic (77.3%), the most common symptoms being asthenia (47.9%), fever or hypothermia (48.1%), and dyspnea (35.6%).

In practice, randomisation can lead to accidental differences due to chance. Researchers have offered alternatives to reduce such differences, but these methods are not used frequently due to the requirement of advanced statistical methods. Here, we recommend a simple assignment procedure based on variance minimisation (VM), which assigns incoming participants automatically to the condition that minimises differences between groups in relevant measures. As an example of its application in the research context, we simulated an intervention study whereby a researcher used the VM procedure on a covariate to assign participants to a control and intervention group rather than controlling for the covariate at the analysis stage. Among other features of the simulated study, such as effect size and sample size, we manipulated the correlation between the matching covariate and the outcome variable and the presence of imbalance between groups in the covariate. Our results highlighted the advantages of VM over prevalent random assignment procedure in terms of reducing the Type I error rate and providing accurate estimates of the effect of the group on the outcome variable. The VM procedure is valuable in situations whereby the intervention to an individual begins before the recruitment of the entire sample size is completed. We provide an Excel spreadsheet, as well as scripts in R, MATLAB, and Python to ease and foster the implementation of the VM procedure.

Successful health policy implementation relies on early identification of infected individuals and extensive contact tracing. However, rural communities, where resources for testing are sparse or simply absent, face distinctive challenges to achieving this success. Accordingly, we report the development of an academic, public land grant University laboratory-based detection assay for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from various clinical specimens that can be readily deployed in areas where access to testing is limited. The test, which is a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-based procedure, was validated on samples provided by the state laboratory and submitted for FDA Emergency Use Authorization. Our test exhibits comparable sensitivity and exceeds specificity and inclusivity values compared to other molecular assays. Additionally, this test can be re-configured to meet supply chain shortages, modified for scale up demands, and is amenable to several clinical specimens. Test development also involved 3D engineering critical supplies and formulating a stable collection media that allowed samples to be transported for hours over a dispersed rural region without the need for a cold-chain. These two elements that were critical when shortages impacted testing and when personnel needed to reach areas that were geographically isolated from the testing center. Overall, using a robust, easy-to-adapt methodology, we show that an academic laboratory can supplement COVID-19 testing needs and help local health departments assess and manage outbreaks. This additional testing capacity is particularly germane for smaller cities and rural regions that would otherwise be unable to meet the testing demand.","output":"Development and Implementation of a scalable and versatile test for COVID-19 diagnostics in rural communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The world, now in an emergency of preventing the drastic spread of COVID-19.

Stapler resection is supposed to be faster than CUSA resection. However, whether speed impacts on the inflammatory response in patients undergoing liver resection (LR) remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a randomized controlled trial including 40 patients undergoing anatomical LR. Primary endpoint was transection speed (cm2/min). Secondary endpoints included the perioperative change of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, overall surgery duration, length of hospital stay, morbidity and mortality. RESULTS Mean transection speed was significantly higher in patients undergoing stapler hepatectomy compared to CUSA resection (CUSA: 1 (0.4) cm2/min vs. Stapler: 10.8 (6.1) cm2/min; p<0.0001). Analyzing the impact of surgery duration on inflammatory response revealed a significant correlation between IL-6 levels measured at the end of surgery and the overall length of surgery (p<0.0001, r = 0.6188). Patients undergoing CUSA LR had significantly higher increase of interleukin-6 (IL-6) after parenchymal transection compared to patients with stapler hepatectomy in the portal and hepatic veins, respectively (p = 0.028; p = 0.044). C-reactive protein levels on the first post-operative day were significantly lower in the stapler cohort (p = 0.010). There was a trend towards a reduced overall surgery time in patients with stapler LR, especially in the subgroup of patients undergoing minor hepatectomies (p = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS Liver resection using staplers is fast, safe and suggests a diminished inflammatory response probably due to a decreased parenchymal transection time.

Nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is stable, conserved and highly immunogenic along with being less prone to mutations during infection, which makes it a suitable candidate for designing vaccine. In our study, B- and T-cells epitopes were identified from N protein and screened based on crucial parameters to design the multi-epitope vaccine construct. Additionally, human beta-defensin-2 was incorporated into the vaccine construct as an adjuvant along with suitable linkers followed by its further evaluation based on crucial parameters including allergenicity, antigenicity, stability etc. Combined major histocompatibility complexes (MHC-I and MHC-II) binding epitopes presented broader population coverage of the vaccine throughout the world. The three-dimensional structure of vaccine candidate implied strong interaction with toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) using molecular docking. The vaccine-TLR3 complex was observed to be highly stable during simulation and electrostatic free energy was foremost contributor for stabilization of the structure.

Results showed that IFs with less funding had a significantly more innovative approach that their counterparts, that the perception of the impact of COVID-19 on the innovative capability was not unanimous, that they identified sport-specific programmes as the most innovative of all initiatives delivered during the pandemic, and that crowdfunding projects were implemented in their sport but mostly at individual and local levels. From a research perspective, since this is the first study that investigates the innovation and crowdfunding strategies of IFs, future directions include the need for further research with national and regional federations on these topics. Practical implications are suggested for IFs to deliver innovative programmes to satisfy their stakeholder needs and to consider new funding methods such as crowdfunding as part of their strategies.","output":"How do International Olympic Sport Federations innovate? the use of crowdfunding and the impact of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a pandemic and a public health emergency.

Assessing the quality of mass reared, sterilized males that are transported to release sites is of the utmost importance for the success of the SIT programs. The current paper presents a series of quality control (QC) tests that have been conducted at the mass rearing facility in Italy and at delivery points in Greece and Montenegro to assess the impact of mass rearing, sterilization, and shipping on survival during transportation, longevity, flight ability and mating performance. Overall, our results reveal the detrimental effects of a long transportation period on the sterile male Ae. albopictus and provide a series of reliable QC tests to be considered in future SIT operations. ABSTRACT: Genetic based mosquito control methods have been gaining ground in recent years for their potential to achieve effective suppression or replacement of vector populations without hampering environments or causing any public health risk. These methods require the mass rearing of the target species in large facilities sized to produce millions of sterile males, as already well established for a number of insects of agricultural importance. Assessing the performance of released males in Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) control programs is of the utmost importance for the success of the operation. Besides the negative effects of mass rearing and sterilization, the handling of sterilized insects and shipment to distant areas may also negatively impact the quality of sterilized males. The aim of the current study was to design and executive quality control (QC) tests for sterilized Aedes albopictus (Asian tiger mosquito) males delivered by air shipment from the mass production facility located in Italy to Greece and Montenegro field release sites. Mass reared mosquito strains were based on biological materials received from Italy, Greece and Montenegro. Tests conducted at the mass rearing facility before transportation revealed a rather high residual female contamination following mechanical sex separation (approximately 1.5% females, regardless of the mosquito strain). Irradiated males of all three mosquito strains induced high levels of sterility to females. Shipment lasting approximately 24 h resulted in approximately 15% mortality, while when shipment lasted nearly two days this increased to almost 40%. The flight ability of sterilized males following one day transportation time was satisfactory (over 60%). The response of sterile males to food and water starvation was comparable and slightly lower than that of wild non-transported males. Longevity of sterile males was shorter than that of wild counterparts and it seems it was not affected by mating to wild females. Both mating propensity and mating competitiveness for wild virgin females was higher for the wild, control males compared to the sterile, transported ones. Overall, the performance of sterile male Ae. albopictus delivered from the mass rearing facility of Italy to Greece in approximately 24 h was satisfactory. Transportation lasting two days or longer incurred detrimental effects on males, which called into question the outcome of the SIT release programs. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the need of quality control procedures, especially when sterile male production facilities are not near to the releasing point. Transportation could be a serious drawback for the implementation of Sterile Insect Releases and, consequently, it is important to establish an efficient and fast transportation of sterilized males in advance.","output":"Quality Control Methods for Aedes albopictus Sterile Male Transportation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The reproduction number R, the average number of people that a single individual with a contagious disease infects, is central to understanding the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic. Values greater than one correspond to increasing rates of infection, and values less than one indicate that control measures are being effective. Here, we summarise how changes in the behaviour of individuals alter the value of R. We also use matrix models that correctly recreate distributions of times that individuals spend incubating the disease and being infective to demonstrate the accuracy of a simple approximation to estimate R directly from time series of case numbers, hospital admissions or deaths. The largest uncertainty is that the generation time of the infection is not precisely known, but this challenge also affects most of the more complex methods of calculating R. We use this approximation to examine changes in R in response to the introduction of lockdown restrictions in England. This suggests that there was a substantial reduction in R before large scale compulsory restrictions on economic and social activity were imposed on 23rd March 2020. From mid-April to mid-June decline of the epidemic at national and regional level has been relatively slow, despite these restrictions (R values clustered around 0.81). However, these estimates of R are consistent with the relatively high average numbers of close contacts reported by confirmed cases combined with directly measured attack rates via close interactions. This implies that a significant portion of transmission is occurring in workplaces; overcrowded housing or through close contacts that are not currently lawful, routes on which nationwide lockdown will have limited impact.","output":"The reproduction number R for COVID-19 in England: Why hasn't ''lockdown'' been more effective?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research was conducted to find out how the shifting of marriage customs values occurred in Gorontalo during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

We aim to conduct a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the effect of higher versus lower protein delivery (with similar energy delivery between groups) on clinical and patient-centered outcomes in critically ill patients. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and CINAHL from database inception through April 1, 2021.We included RCTs of (1) adult (age  18) critically ill patients that (2) compared higher vs lower protein with (3) similar energy intake between groups, and (4) reported clinical and/or patient-centered outcomes. We excluded studies on immunonutrition. Two authors screened and conducted quality assessment independently and in duplicate. Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the pooled risk ratio (dichotomized outcomes) or mean difference (continuous outcomes). RESULTS: Nineteen RCTs were included (n = 1731). Sixteen studies used primarily the enteral route to deliver protein. Intervention was started within 72 h of ICU admission in sixteen studies. The intervention lasted between 3 and 28 days. In 11 studies that reported weight-based nutrition delivery, the pooled mean protein and energy received in higher and lower protein groups were 1.31  0.48 vs 0.90  0.30 g/kg and 19.9  6.9 versus 20.1  7.1 kcal/kg, respectively. Higher vs lower protein did not significantly affect overall mortality [risk ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75C1.10, p = 0.34] or other clinical or patient-centered outcomes. In 5 small studies, higher protein significantly attenuated muscle loss (MD ?3.44% per week, 95% CI ?4.99 to ?1.90; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients, a higher daily protein delivery was not associated with any improvement in clinical or patient-centered outcomes. Larger, and more definitive RCTs are needed to confirm the effect of muscle loss attenuation associated with higher protein delivery.

The socioeconomic conditions for implementation of the conceptual project are considered, as well as changes in these factors and corresponding fundamental concepts over the past half century. It is demonstrated how the ideal model of the territorial structure of the cultural landscape is related to the lifestyle of its creator; how his ideas about work and leisure formed the pattern of a regular network of cities surrounded by buffer functional zones with decreasing population density from the center to the periphery, occupied by natural parks and reserves. The big city and wildlife are considered the equivalent poles of the biosphere. The author traces how Russias transport infrastructure has changed and how modern transport policy, at least in Moscow and Moscow Oblast, contradicts the ideas of a polarized biosphere. At the same time, the growth of territorial contrasts of socioeconomic development leads to growth of the so-called inner periphery, where the processes of restoration of natural landscapes proceed spontaneously as the anthropogenic load decreases. Some polarization of the landscape favorable for the biosphere, occurs by itself, and this process should not be hindered. The author traces the relationship of his concept with classical works on theoretical geography, in particular, with The Isolated State by I. von Thnen; he talks about the history of penetration of the polarized biosphere into the national geographical science, and outlines paths for further development of this project.","output":"Polarized Landscape: Half a Century Later"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The personal experience of events such as financial crises and natural disasters can alter economic preferences.

In this study, through bioactivity guided fractionation of the crude extract, the data demonstrate that penta-1,2,3,4,6-O-galloyl--D-glucose (PGG) was a primary constituent responsible for hLDH-A inhibition, present at ~9.95  0.34% dry weight. Theoretical molecular docking studies of hLDH-A indicate that PGG acts through competitive binding at the NADH cofactor site, effects confirmed by functional enzyme studies where the IC(50) = 27.32 nM was reversed with increasing concentration of NADH. Moreover, we confirm protein expression of hLDH-A in MDA-231 human breast carcinoma cells and show that PGG was toxic (LC(50) = 94.18 M), parallel to attenuated lactic acid production (IC(50) = 97.81 M). In a 72-hour cell proliferation assay, PGG was found to be a potent cytostatic agent with ability to halt cell division (IC(50) = 1.2 M) relative to paclitaxel (IC(50) < 100 nM).

Therefore, their prompt detection is mandatory for successful patient treatment. Solid phase red cell adherence (SPRCA) assay allows for platelet antibody detection widely. However, preparation of fresh platelets with HLA-I and human platelet antigens (HPA)1-5,15 genotyped as target cells is inconvenient and fresh platelets have a short shelf life. In this study, the lyophilised human platelets for antibody detection in SPRCA were prepared. Firstly, platelets were resuspended in lyophilisation buffer and freeze-dried. Then the characteristics of lyophilised platelet were analysed. Rehydrated platelets were recovered with a mean rate of 80.91%  2.87%, and still retained spherical morphology. Indirect flow cytometry showed that glycoproteins IIb/IIIa, Ia/IIa, Ib/IX, IV, CD109, and HLA class I were present on the surface of the lyophilised platelets at a comparable level to that of fresh platelets. The consistent results obtained with WHO reference reagents containing anti-HPA-1a, anti-HPA-3a, and anti-HPA-5b, as well as clinical samples from the same donors containing anti-HLA antibodies when reacting with lyophilised versus fresh platelets confirmed good antigenicity preservation of platelets after freeze-drying. Further investigation showed that the lyophilised platelets could be stored at 2-8 C for up to 14 months and the reconstituted suspension was stable for 48 h.

Objectives: To report the expansion of telehealth activities of Regula Mais Brasil in response to COVID-19 and to assess qualification of referrals in primary health care (PHC) units as well as the added value of teleconsultation in qualifying referral cases. Methods: Descriptive study of the teleconsultations carried out as an additional strategy to the remotely operated referral management system, responsible for navigating cases from PHC units to specialized care in Recife, Brazil, between May 6, 2020 and September 30, 2020. Teleconsultation was implemented as a tool for reducing delays in the access to health care due to COVID-19 and ultimately allowed for reclassification of the referral adequacy and priority. Changes in referral priority ratings and referral decisions after teleconsultation were analyzed. Results: A total of 622 referral cases were analyzed. Approved referrals represented 51.9% of cases. The main reason for approved referrals was the need for diagnostic resources. There was a reduction in priority ratings in 449 cases (72.2%) after teleconsultation.

Despite the high incidence, the economic impact of non-influenza-related VRTI has not been rigorously explored. Our objectives were to obtain an updated incidence of non-influenza-related VRTI in the United States and to quantify the health care resource use (direct costs) and productivity losses (indirect costs) associated with these infections. METHODS A nationwide telephone survey of US households (N = 4051) was conducted between November 3, 2000, and February 12, 2001 to obtain a representative estimate of the self-reported incidence of non-influenza-related VRTI and related treatment patterns. Direct treatment costs measured included outpatient clinician encounters, use of over-the-counter and prescription drugs, and associated infectious complications of non-influenza-related VRTI. Absenteeism estimates for infected individuals and parents of infected children were extrapolated from National Health Interview Survey data. RESULTS Of survey respondents, 72% reported a non-influenza-related VRTI within the past year. Respondents who experienced a self-reported non-influenza-related VRTI averaged 2.5 episodes annually. When these rates are extrapolated to the entire US population, approximately 500 million non-influenza-related VRTI episodes occur per year. Similarly, if the treatment patterns reported by the respondents are extended to the population, the total economic impact of non-influenza-related VRTI approaches $40 billion annually (direct costs, $17 billion per year; and indirect costs, $22.5 billion per year).

METHODS: Results of all real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV?2 performed at our radio-oncology department between 13 October 2020 and 11 March 2021 were included. Clinical data and anamnestic information at the time of testing were documented and examined for (i) the presence of COVID-19-related symptoms and (ii) virus-related anamnesis (high-risk [prior positive test or contact to a positive tested person within the last 14 days] or low-risk [inconspicuous anamnesis within the last 14 days]). RESULTS: A total of 1056 SARS-CoV?2 tests in 543 patients were analyzed. Of those, 1015 tests were performed in asymptomatic patients and 41 tests in patients with COVID-19-associated symptoms. Two of 940 (0.2%) tests in asymptomatic patients with low-risk anamnesis and three of 75 (4.0%) tests in asymptomatic patients with high-risk anamnesis showed a positive result.

Many reconstructive modalities are available, each with varying utility and efficacy. The goal of this study was to provide an algorithmic approach to nasal reconstruction and illustrate lessons learned from decades of reconstructing Mohs defects. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of consecutive patients who underwent nasal reconstruction after Mohs excision from 2003 to 2019 performed by the senior author (J.F.T.). Data were collected and analyzed regarding patient and clinical demographics, defect characteristics, reconstructive modality used, revisions, and complications. RESULTS A total of 2553 cases were identified, among which 1550 (1375 patients) were analyzed. Defects most commonly affected the nasal ala (48.1 percent); 74.8 percent were skin-only. Full-thickness skin-grafts were the most common reconstructive method (36.2 percent); 24.4 percent of patients underwent forehead flaps and 17.0 percent underwent nasolabial flaps. The overall complication rate was 11.6 percent (n = 181), with poor wound healing being most common. Age older than 75 years, defects larger than 2 cm2, and active smoking were associated with increased complication rates. CONCLUSIONS Nasal reconstruction can be divided based on anatomical location, and an algorithmic approach facilitates excellent results. Although local flaps may be suitable for some patients, they are not always the most aesthetic option. The versatility and low risk-to-benefit profile of the forehead flap make it a suitable option for elderly patients. Although reconstruction is still safe to be performed without discontinuation of anticoagulation, older age, smoking, and large defect size are predictors of complications.

METHODS In this cross-sectional matched sample study, we compared the rates of involuntary treatment in a sample of first-generation immigrants admitted in a Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit of a large metropolitan academic hospital to their age-, gender-, and psychiatric diagnosis-matched native counterparts. Clinical, sociodemographic, and migratory variables were collected. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-expanded (BPRS-E) and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scale were administered. McNemar test was used for paired categorical variables and a binary logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS A total of 234 patients were included in the analysis. Involuntary treatment rates were significantly higher in immigrants as compared to their matched natives (32% vs. 24% respectively; p < .001).

Climates vary in Brazil due to the territorial extension of the country, its relief, geography, and other factors. Since the most common COVID-19 symptoms are related to the respiratory system, many researchers have studied the correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases with meteorological variables like temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc. Also, due to its high transmission rate, some researchers have analyzed the impact of human mobility on the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission. There is a dearth of literature that considers these two variables when predicting the spread of COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we analyzed the correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases and human mobility, and meteorological data in Brazilian capitals. We found that the correlation between such variables depends on the regions where the cities are located. We employed the variables with a significant correlation with COVID-19 cases to predict the number of COVID-19 infections in all Brazilian capitals and proposed a prediction method combining the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Exogenous inputs (ARIMAX) method, which we called EEMD-ARIMAX. After analyzing the results poor predictions were further investigated using a signal processing-based anomaly detection method. Computational tests showed that EEMD-ARIMAX achieved a forecast 26.73% better than ARIMAX. Moreover, an improvement of 30.69% in the average root mean squared error (RMSE) was noticed when applying the EEMD-ARIMAX method to the data normalized after the anomaly detection.","output":"Meteorological and human mobility data on predicting COVID-19 cases by a novel hybrid decomposition method with anomaly detection analysis: a case study in the capitals of Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 as an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown origin. Previous studies have suggested the utility of chest computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of COVID-19 because of its high sensitivity (93%-97%), relatively simple procedure, and rapid test results. This study, performed in Japan early in the epidemic when COVID-19 prevalence was low, evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT in a population presenting with lung diseases having CT findings similar to those of COVID-19. We retrospectively included all consecutive patients (18 years old) presenting to the outpatient department of Keio University Hospital between March 1 and May 31, 2020, with fever and respiratory symptoms. We evaluated the performance of diagnostic CT for COVID-19 by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results as the reference standard. We determined the numbers of false-positive (FP) results and assessed the clinical utility using decision curve analysis. Of the 175 patients, 22 were PCR-positive. CT had a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 57%. Patients with FP results on CT diagnosis were mainly diagnosed with diseases mimicking COVID-19, e.g., interstitial lung disease. Decision curve analysis indicated that the clinical utility of CT imaging was limited. The diagnostic performance of CT for COVID-19 was inadequate in an area with low COVID-19 prevalence and a high prevalence of other lung diseases with chest CT findings similar to those of COVID-19. Considering this insufficient diagnostic performance, CT findings should be evaluated in the context of additional medical information to diagnose COVID-19.","output":"Diagnostic Performance of Computed Tomography Imaging for COVID-19 in a Region with Low Disease Prevalence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To develop prognosis prediction models for COVID-19 patients attending an emergency department (ED) based on initial chest X-ray (CXR), demographics, clinical and laboratory parameters. Methods: : All symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital ED between February 24th and April 24th 2020 were recruited. CXR features, clinical and laboratory variables and CXR abnormality indices extracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN) diagnostic tool were considered potential predictors on this first visit. The most serious individual outcome defined the three severity level: 0) home discharge or hospitalization  3 days, 1) hospital stay >3 days and 2) intensive care requirement or death. Severity and in-hospital mortality multivariable prediction models were developed and internally validated. The Youden index was used for model selection. Results: : A total of 440 patients were enrolled (median 64 years;55.9% male);13.6% patients were discharged, 64% hospitalized, 6.6% required intensive care and 15.7% died. The severity prediction model included oxygen saturation/inspired oxygen fraction (SatO2/FiO2), age, C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocyte count, extent score of lung involvement on CXR (ExtScoreCXR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer level and platelets count, with AUC-ROC=0.94 and AUC-PRC=0.88. The mortality prediction model included age, SatO2/FiO2, CRP, LDH, CXR extent score, lymphocyte count and D-dimer level, with AUC-ROC=0.97 and AUC-PRC=0.78. The addition of CXR CNN-based indices slightly improved the predictive metrics for mortality (AUC-ROC=0.97 and AUC-PRC=0.83).

Objective: To set the standard on the transverse section of the pancreas looking for a safer surgical access to repair the portal vein injuries. Methods: A quantitative analysis was performed to characterize the anatomical relationship between the portal vein and their tributaries relating them to the pancreas. On these corpses, the measurements of a anatomical triangle were studied. It base was the upper limit of the superior mesenteric vein and the initial portion of the portal vein; the apex, a point located on the upper limit of the confluence of the splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein, situated at the middle line of the superior mesenteric_ vein. Results: The portal vein is formed 3.24cm from the internal border of the duodenal arc at a distance of 1.61cm and 1.07 from the inferior and superior pancreas borders, respectively.

In order to prevent further spread and slow down the increase in confirmed cases and deaths, many countries in European Union have taken some interventions since mid-March. In this study, a metapopulation model was used to model the outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe and the effectiveness of these interventions were also estimated. The findings suggested that many countries successfully kept the reproduction number R_t less than 1 (e.g., Belgium, Germany, Spain, and France) while other countries exhibited R_t greater than 1 (e.g., United Kingdom, Cyprus). Based on the assumed reopen strategy, this study also revealed that a 2-week delay in response predicted approximately 2,000 deaths and 200,000 cases (daily peak value), while a 3-week delay predicted approximately 5,000 deaths and 600,000 cases (daily peak value).

However, the U.S. has no national paid sick leave policy, and even unpaid FMLA leave-often viewed as a foundation for new paid leave legislation-is often inaccessible. We analyzed a nationally representative survey to determine the extent to which specific FMLA features produce gaps and disparities in leave access. We then use comparative policy data from 193 countries to analyze whether these policy features are necessary or prevalent globally, or whether there are common alternatives. We found that the FMLA's minimum hours requirement disproportionately excludes women, while its tenure requirement disproportionately excludes Black, Indigenous, and multiracial workers. Latinx workers face greater exclusion due to employer size. Of the 94% of countries that provide permanent paid sick leave, none broadly restrict leave based on employer size and 93% cover part-time workers without a minimum hour requirement.

The objective of this single-center, randomized, controlled trial was to investigate the relationship between VAP and various methods of oral health care. All patients included in the study (n=142) were on mechanical ventilation with oral intubation at the intensive care unit of the Tokyo Dental College Ichikawa General Hospital. They were divided into two groups, one receiving standard oral health care (Standard group), and the other receiving oral health care using an oral moisture gel instead of water (Gel group). After removal of the intubation tube, biofilm on cuff of the tube was stained with a disclosing agent to determine the contamination level. Factors investigated included sex, age, number of remaining teeth, intubation time, fever 38.5C, VAP, cuff contamination level, and time required for one oral health care session. No VAP occurred in either group during the study period. The level of cuff contamination was significantly lower in the Gel group than the Standard group, and the time required for one session of oral health care was shorter (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed use of the oral moisture gel as a factor affecting cuff contamination level. Use of an oral moisture gel decreased invasion of the pharynx by bacteria and contaminants together with biofilm formation on the intubation tube cuff.

Using a novel SARS-Cov-2-specific artificial antigen presenting cell (aAPC), coupled with a rapid expansion protocol (REP) as practiced in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) therapy, we generate an immune catalytic quantity of Virus Induced Lymphocytes (VIL). Using T cell receptor (TCR)-specific aAPCs carrying co-stimulatory molecules and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 peptide-pentamer complexes, we expand virus-specific VIL derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of convalescent COVID-19 patients up to 1,000-fold. This is achieved in a clinically relevant 7-day vein-to-vein time-course as a potential adoptive cell therapy (ACT) for COVID-19. We also evaluate this approach for other viral pathogens using Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific VIL from donors as a control. Rapidly expanded VIL are enriched in virus antigen-specificity and show an activated, polyfunctional cytokine profile and T effector memory phenotype which may contribute to a robust immune response. Virus-specific T cells can also be delivered allogeneically via MHC-typing and patient human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matching to provide pragmatic treatment in a large-scale therapeutic setting.

However, the ability of the healthcare supply chain function to strategically contribute to the improvement of value has been held back by a lack of practical tools for turning value-based procurement from concept into action. Two recently developed conceptual models C the American CQO Movement and the European MEAT VBP Framework C have been developed to support the implementation of value-based procurement in healthcare. We demonstrate how the latter of these models can be adapted and applied pragmatically to generate insights into the value of a specific medical device, technology or consumable.

Since the global Covid-19 pandemic prevented fieldwork, structured interviews were conducted via Zoom and corroborated by a literature review. RESULTS: We identified ten cost criteria and eight outcome criteria with which the value of surgical gloves can be analysed and understood. For each of these criteria we propose definitions and value impact metrics that decision-makers can use during a procurement exercise to describe, quantify and compare glove value.

RECENT FINDINGS: Previous research efforts to develop a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) vaccine in the years following the 2003 pandemic have opened the door for investigators to design vaccine concepts and approaches for the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a high degree of genetic similarity and bind to the same host cell ACE2 receptor. Based on previous experience with SARS-CoV vaccines, it is expected that all COVID-19 vaccines will require careful safety evaluations for immunopotentiation that could lead to increased infectivity or eosinophilic infiltration. Besides this, a COVID-19 vaccine target product profile must address vaccinating at-risk human populations including frontline healthcare workers, individuals over the age of 60, and those with underlying and debilitating chronic conditions. Among the vaccine technologies under evaluation are whole virus vaccines, recombinant protein subunit vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines.

Nearly 800 000 people around the world lose their life to suicide every year, and many more attempt suicide. METHODS: A decomposition analysis was performed using global suicide mortality and population data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. RESULTS: Despite a significant decrease in age-specific suicide rate between 1990 and 2019 (-4.01; from 13.8% to 9.8% per 100 000), the overall numbers of suicide deaths increased by 19 897 (from 738 799 to 758 696) in the same time period. The reductions in age-specific suicide rates (-6.09; 152%) contributed to the overall reductions in suicide rates; however, this was offset by overtime changes in population age structure (2.08; -52%). The increase in suicide numbers was partly attributable to population growth (300 942; 1512.5%) and population age structure (189 512; 952.4%), which was attenuated by the significant reduction in overall suicide rates (-470 556; 2364.9%). The combined effect of these factors varied across the World Bank income level regions. For example, in the upper-middle-income level region, the effect of the reduction in age-specific suicide rates (-289 731; -1456.1%) exceeded the effect of population age structure (124 577; 626.1%) and population growth (83 855; 421.4%), resulting in its substantial decline in total suicide deaths (-81 298; -408.6%). However, in lower-middle income region, there was a notable increase in suicide death (72 550; 364.6%), which was related to the net gain of the reduction in age-specific suicide rates (-115 577; -580.9%) and negated by the increase in the number of suicide deaths due to population growth (152 093; 764.4%) and population age structure (36 034; 181.1%).

The prevalence of pleurisy has been increasing during the last decade also in Finland. The aim of this prospective case-control study was to search for environmental, infectious and management-related herd-level risk factors for pleurisy in the slaughterhouse. Altogether 46 Finnish pig herds, including 25 control (low pleurisy prevalence in meat inspection) and 21 case (high pleurisy) herds, were enrolled in the study and visited during the tenth week of the rearing period of finishing pigs. Herd personnel were asked about basic herd information, management and environmental factors. Selected pigs were examined clinically, environmental parameters were measured and 15 blood samples per herd were taken during herd visits. Antibodies against Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia serotype 2 (APP2) and ApxIV toxin and swine influenza virus were measured. After the slaughter of study pigs, meat inspection results of the batch were gathered from slaughterhouses. Multivariate logistic regression model was built to identify possible risk factors for a herd to be a case herd (i.e. having high pleurisy values).

The majority of the children, who may not be able to grasp the entire emergency, are at a bigger risk with other problems lurking behind the attack of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The risk of infection in children was 1.3%, 1.5%, and 1.7 % of total confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, Italy and United States respectively which is less compared to 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), when 5-7 % of the positive cases were children, with no deaths reported while another recent multinational multicentric study from Europe which included 582 PCR (polymerase chain reaction) confirmed children of 0- 18 year of age, provide deeper and generalize incite about clinical effects of COVID19 infection in children. According to this study 25% children have some pre-existing illness and 8 % required ICU (intensive care unit) admission with 0.69% case fatality among all infected children. Common risk factor for serious illness as per this study are younger age, male sex and pre-existing underlying chronic medical condition.

Caves and cave-dwelling bats are under-represented in conservation plans. In South Africa, at least two cavernicolous species are of interest as potential zoonotic hosts: the Natal long-fingered bat Miniopterus natalensis and the Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus. Little information is available about the anthropogenic pressures these species face around important roost sites. Both bats are numerous and widespread throughout the country; land-use changes and urban expansions are a rising concern for both conservation and increased bat-human contact. RESULTS: Our study addressed this shortfall by determining the extent of land-cover change around 47 roosts between 2014 and 2018 using existing land cover datasets. We determined the land-cover composition around important roost sites (including maternity, hibernacula and co-roosts), distances to urban settlements and assessed the current protection levels of roost localities. We detected an overall 4% decrease in natural woody vegetation (trees) within 5 km buffer zones of all roost sites, with a 10% decrease detected at co-roost sites alone. Agricultural land cover increased the most near roost sites, followed by plantations and urban land-cover. Overall, roosts were located 4.15  0.91 km from urban settlements in 2018, the distances decreasing as urban areas expand. According to the South African National Biodiversity Institute Ecosystem Threat Status assessment, 72% of roosts fall outside of well-protected ecosystems. CONCLUSIONS: The current lack of regulatory protection of cavernicolous bats and their roosts, increasing anthropogenic expansions and proximity to human settlements raises concerns about increased human-bat contact. Furthermore, uncontrolled roost visitation and vandalism are increasing, contributing to bat health risks and population declines, though the extent of roosts affected is yet to be quantified. In an era where pandemics are predicted to become more frequent and severe due to land-use change, our research is an urgent call for the formal protection of bat-inhabited caves to safeguard both bats and humans.

While humans are constantly exposed to animal viruses, those that can successfully infect and transmit between humans are exceedingly rare. The key event in zoonosis is when an animal virus begins to replicate (one virion making many) in the first human subject. Only at this point will the animal virus first experience the selective environment of the human body, rendering possible viral adaptation and refinement for humans. In addition, appreciable viral titers in this first human may enable infection of a second, thus initiating selection for viral variants with increased capacity for spread. We assert that host genetics plays a critical role in defining which animal viruses in nature will achieve this key event of replication in a first human host. This is because animal viruses that pose the greatest risk to humans will have few (or no) genetic barriers to replicating themselves in human cells, thus requiring minimal mutations to make this jump. Only experimental virology provides a path to identifying animal viruses with the potential to replicate themselves in humans because this information will not be evident from viral sequencing data alone.","output":"How host genetics dictates successful viral zoonosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ultrasound elastography (US-E) is a noninvasive, safe, cost effective and reliable technique to assess the mechanical properties of soft tissue and provide imaging biomarkers for pathological processes. Many lung diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and interstitial lung disease are associated with dramatic changes in mechanical properties of lung tissues. Nevertheless, US-E is rarely used to image the lung because it is filled with air. The large difference in acoustic impedance between air and lung tissue results in the reflection of the ultrasound wave at the lung surface and consequently the loss of most ultrasound energy. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in US-E applications in evaluating lung diseases. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the technological advances of US-E research on lung disease diagnosis.

Bridging Artificial Intelligence and IoT can achieve not only maintaining low infection rates of COVID-19 but can also facilitate an effective rapid testing strategy to reduce community spread.

To this end, a Self Organizing Feature Map is designed to manage MCS-based data for planning of the autonomous mobile assessment centers. Pre-identified zero-day locations and worst-case scenario are considered to determine the best combination for MCS participation rate and budget limitations. Numerical results demonstrate that once 30% of MCS participants are recruited, it becomes possible to cover the pre-identified zero-day locations and enable detection of infected cases under the worst case scenario to determine the AV routes more efficiently than other options for a certain number of neurons in SOFM.

Also discussed are the challenges of online retail systems such as security and fraud, customer loyalty and trust, inventory management, and malfunctions of online retail infrastructure. These challenges lead our paper into the complications of any business which failed to adapt to the pandemic. Furthermore, we highlight implications for theory and research.","output":"Online Retail Systems in the Global COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ferroptosis, nonapoptotic cell death mediated by free radical reactions and driven by the oxidative degradation of lipids, is a therapeutic target because of its role in organ damage, including AKI. Ferroptosis-causing radicals that are targeted by ferroptosis suppressors have not been unequivocally identified. Because certain cytochrome P450 substrate drugs can prevent lipid peroxidation via obscure mechanisms, we evaluated their antiferroptotic potential and used them to identify ferroptosis-causing radicals. METHODS: Using a cell-based assay, we screened cytochrome P450 substrate compounds to identify drugs with antiferroptotic activity and investigated the underlying mechanism. To evaluate radical-scavenging activity, we used electron paramagnetic resonance-spin trapping methods and a fluorescence probe for lipid radicals, NBD-Pen, that we had developed. We then assessed the therapeutic potency of these drugs in mouse models of cisplatin-induced AKI and LPS/galactosamine-induced liver injury. RESULTS: We identified various US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and hormones that have antiferroptotic properties, including rifampicin, promethazine, omeprazole, indole-3-carbinol, carvedilol, propranolol, estradiol, and thyroid hormones. The antiferroptotic drug effects were closely associated with the scavenging of lipid peroxyl radicals but not significantly related to interactions with other radicals. The elevated lipid peroxyl radical levels were associated with ferroptosis onset, and known ferroptosis suppressors, such as ferrostatin-1, also functioned as lipid peroxyl radical scavengers. The drugs exerted antiferroptotic activities in various cell types, including tubules, podocytes, and renal fibroblasts. Moreover, in mice, the drugs ameliorated AKI and liver injury, with suppression of tissue lipid peroxidation and decreased cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Although elevated lipid peroxyl radical levels can trigger ferroptosis onset, some drugs that scavenge lipid peroxyl radicals can help control ferroptosis-related disorders, including AKI.","output":"Drugs Repurposed as Antiferroptosis Agents Suppress Organ Damage, Including AKI, by Functioning as Lipid Peroxyl Radical Scavengers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergency state caused by COVID-19 saw the use of immunomodulators despite the absence of robust research. To date, the results of relatively few randomized controlled trials have been published, and methodological approaches are riddled with bias and heterogeneity. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, convalescent plasma and the JAK inhibitor baricitinib have gained Emergency Use Authorizations and tentative recommendations for their use in clinical practice alone or in combination with other therapies. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are predominating the management of non-hospitalized patients, while the inpatient setting is seeing the use of convalescent plasma, baricitinib, tofacitinib, tocilizumab, sarilumab, and corticosteroids, as applicable. Available clinical data also suggest the potential clinical benefit of the early administration of blood-derived products (e.g. convalescent plasma, non-SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobins) and the blockade of factors implicated in the hyperinflammatory state of severe COVID-19 (Interleukin 1 and 6; Janus Kinase). Immune therapies seem to have a protective effect and using immunomodulators alone or in combination with viral replication inhibitors and other treatment modalities might prevent progression into severe COVID-19 disease, cytokine storm and death.

Consequently, there is a renewed interest in conducting stability studies of these solutions. The goal of this work was to verify the available chlorine concentration in several bleach solutions trademarks and to propose a beyond use date for 1 g/L bleach solutions, obtained after dilution with drinking water from different sources. Methods: Bleach trademarks, with nominal concentrations between 25-60 g/L, were subjected to iodometric titration to determine the available chlorine concentration. One trademark was used to prepare 1 g/L dilutions using water from different purification plants in Crdoba, Argentina. The samples were stored at room-temperature, both exposed or protected from light. The available chlorine concentration was determined by titration at preestablished time intervals. The beyond use date was reached when the available chlorine concentration dropped below 90 % of its initial. Results: The concentration of active chlorine in the different trademark bleaches was within the values established by current regulations. Diluted solutions protected from light showed a decrease of less than 10 % in active chlorine concentration during the first 10 days of assay. However, one sample exceeded the acceptance limit after 14 days. In contrast, in the samples exposed to light, the concentration of active chlorine dropped to 96.4 % at 24 hours and 79.3 % after 48 hours. No differences related to drinking water sources were observed. Conclusions: Compliance of the nominal available chlorine concentration in trademark bleach solutions was confirmed. Regardless the water source used for dilution, 1 g/L bleach solutions were stable for 10 days when stored at room temperature and protected from light. Instead, solutions exposed to light maintain their available chlorine concentration for only 24 hours.","output":"Compliance of commercial bleaches and stability of 1 G/L-dilutions using different sources of drinking water"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The presented work summarizes the results of studies underlining the crucial role of estrogen receptor (ER) signaling in both innate and adaptive immune responses as well as in tissue repairing processes during respiratory virus infection. Experimental studies justify that among respiratory virus infected mice, a weaker ER signaling leads to increased morbidity and mortality in both males and females. In animal experiments, estrogen treatment silences the inflammatory reactions and decreases virus titers leading to improved survival rate; it seems to be an ideal prevention and therapy against COVID-19. We should overcome the widespread reluctance to estrogen therapy as we have a unique estrogen formula; conjugated estrogens, or conjugated equine estrogens available under the brand name of Premarin deriving from natural sources. Premarin can exert similar ER upregulative and gene repairing power like endogenous estrogen without any risk for adverse reactions.

Sixty\\\\three pregnant women with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) participated in the study. Vertical transmission of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 was analyzed with reverse transcriptase\\\\polymerase chain reaction (RT\\\\PCR) tests and blood tests for immunoglobulin G (IgG)Cimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. All patients were in the mild or moderate category for COVID\\\\19. Only one placental sample and two of the vaginal secretion samples were positive for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. Except for one, all positive samples were obtained from patients who gave birth by cesarean. All cord blood and amniotic fluid samples were negative for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2.

Face masks release microplastics, which are directly inhaled during use or transported through the environment. The latter can adsorb chemical contaminants and harbor pathogenic microbiota, and once consumed by organisms, they can translocate to multiple organs upon intake, potentially causing detrimental and cytotoxic effects.

Consistent with previous literature, it was hypothesized that higher HA would predict attentional bias, tested using a visual dot-probe task, to virus-related stimuli. Participants were 132 Italian individuals that participated in the study during the lockdown phase in Italy. Results indicated that the HA level predicts attentional bias toward virus-related objects.

TARGITCintraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) may offer a viable alternative to improve radiation treatment efficiency and alleviate hospital patient loads. The Breast Care Unit in Johannesburg became the first facility in Africa to offer TARGIT-IORT, and the purpose of this study was to present a retrospective review of patients receiving IORT at this center between November 2017 and May 2020. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient selection criteria were based mainly on the latest American Society of Radiation Oncology guidelines. Selection criteria included early-stage breast carcinoma (luminal A) and luminal B with negative upfront sentinel lymph node biopsy that negated external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Patient characteristics, reasons for choosing IORT, histology, and use of oncoplastic surgery that resulted in complications were recorded. RESULTS: One hundred seven patients successfully received IORT/TARGIT-IORT. Mean age was 60.8 years (standard deviation, 9.3 years). A total of 73.8% of patients presented with luminal A, 15.0% with luminal B, and 5.6% with triple-negative cancer. One patient who presented with locally advanced breast cancer (T4N2) opted for IORT as a boost in addition to planned EBRT. Eighty-seven patients underwent wide local excision (WLE) with mastopexy, and 12 underwent WLE with parenchymal. Primary reasons for selecting IORT/TARGIT-IORT were distance from the hospital (43.9%), choice (40.2%), and age (10.3%). CONCLUSION: This retrospective study of IORT/TARGIT-IORT performed in Africa confirms its viability, with low complication rates and no detrimental effects with breast conservation, resulting in positive acceptance and the potential to reduce Oncology Center patient loads.

One-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were experimentally infected with six QX field isolates and the H120 vaccine strain. In the negative control birds, the spleen was MBL negative, while the CT showed scattered MBL-positive cells in close proximity and within the surface epithelium and germinal centre (GC)-like cell clusters. MBL was detectable in the ellipsoid-associated cells (EACs) and cell clusters in the periarterial lymphoid sheath (PALS) by 7 days post infection (dpi). In both organs, the MBL-positive cells occupy antigen-exposed areas, indicating that GC formation depends on resident precursors of dendritic cells. The majority of MBL-positive EACs express the CD83 antigen, providing evidence that coronavirus infection facilitated the maturation of dendritic cell precursors. Surprisingly, co-localisation of MBL and CD83 was not detectable in the CT. In the spleen (associated with circulation), the EACs producing MBL and expressing CD83 are a common precursor of both follicular (FDC) and interdigitating dendritic cells (IDC). In the CT (gut-associated lymphoid tissue, GALT) the precursors of FDC and IDC are MBL-producing cells and CD83-positive cells, respectively.

METHODS: This study includes a primary analysis of cross-sectional data using a self-administered digital survey distributed to Arkansas residents using ARresearch, a volunteer research participant registry. The survey had 1288 responses, and 1221 met eligibility criteria for inclusion in the survey. Participants provided sociodemographic information and were asked to select up to 3 preferred testing locations from 12 options. Chi-square tests assessed differences in testing site preference across relevant sociodemographic groups. RESULTS: Participants preferred drive-through clinics as their top location for COVID-19 testing, with 55% reporting this was their preferred method of testing. This pattern was consistent across all comparison groups (ie, age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, insurance status). Significant differences in testing location preference were observed across age, race and ethnicity, and education, with the most differences observed across race and ethnicity. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that race and ethnicity are important to consider when deciding where to offer COVID-19 testing.

Mumbai was amongst the first cities to see the increase. In this report, we use our agent based simulator to computationally study the second wave in Mumbai. We build upon our earlier analysis, where projections were made from November 2020 onwards. We use our simulator to conduct an extensive scenario analysis - we play out many plausible scenarios through varying economic activity, reinfection levels, population compliance, infectiveness, prevalence and lethality of the possible variant strains, and infection spread via local trains to arrive at those that may better explain the second wave fatality numbers. We observe and highlight that timings of peak and valley of the fatalities in the second wave are robust to many plausible scenarios, suggesting that they are likely to be accurate projections for Mumbai. During the second wave, the observed fatalities were low in February and mid-March and saw a phase change or a steep increase in the growth rate after around late March. We conduct extensive experiments to replicate this observed sharp convexity. This is not an easy phenomena to replicate, and we find that explanations such as increased laxity in the population, increased reinfections, increased intensity of infections in Mumbai transportation, increased lethality in the virus, or a combination amongst them, generally do a poor job of matching this pattern. We find that the most likely explanation is presence of small amount of extremely infective variant on February 1 that grows rapidly thereafter and becomes a dominant strain by Mid-March. From a prescriptive view, this points to an urgent need for extensive and continuous genome sequencing to establish existence and prevalence of different virus strains in Mumbai and in India, as they evolve over time.","output":"Modelling the Second Covid-19 Wave in Mumbai"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The synthesis of racemic substituted 7-amino-5,7,8,9-tetrahydrobenzocyclohepten-6-one hydrochlorides was optimized to enhance reproducibility and increase the overall yield.

Self-isolation regime is an effective measure to contain the pandemic (Alfano, Ercolano, 2020), but the psychological factors predicting compliance with stay-at-home recommendations (CSHR) are understudied. We hypothesized that 1) defensive optimism and constructive optimism will have opposite effects on CSHR, 2) the effect of defensive optimism will be mediated through a decrease of anxiety (fear of infection).Objectives. The purpose of this study was to assess the direct and indirect (through the fear of infection) effects of defensive optimism (belief that coronavirus problem is exaggerated) and constructive optimism (belief that peoples efforts help to prevent infection and spread of the virus) on CSHR, controlling for dispositional optimism.Methods. A longitudinal study (from 10/4/2020 till 2/6/2020) was conducted on a sample of 306 university students (89% women, MA=21.20, SD=4.54) using a single-item measure of CSHR, LOT-R (Scheier et al., 1994), the scales of defensive and constructive optimism (Gordeeva, Sychev, 2020), and anxiety in a pandemic situation questionnaire (Tkhostov, Rasskazova, 2020).Results. During seven-week interval CSHR has decreased dramatically (Cohens d=0.66, p<0.001) while the other variables remained stable. Using SEM we have showed that CSHR at the end of study (T2) is predicted by the CSHR (T1) and through it by the defensive optimism (negative effect, p<0.05) and constructive optimism (positive effect, p<0.001). Negative effect of defensive optimism on CSHR is also mediated by the fear of infection (T2), reducing it. Dispositional optimism is associated only with constructive optimism.Conclusions.

These complaints have historically been attributed to olfactory dysfunction; however, there is evidence of direct, objective, gustatory disturbances in the setting of CRS that are not thoroughly characterized. This study sought to investigate and summarize gustatory dysfunction experienced by patients with CRS. METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were reviewed following PRISMA guidelines. English language, original studies investigating objective taste in adult patients with CRS were included. A meta-analysis with inverse variance, random-effects model was performed. RESULTS Of 2750 studies screened, 11 articles with 471 unique patients were included. Patients with CRS exhibit worse gustatory function compared to healthy controls (standardized mean difference 0.94 [95% CI, 0.44-1.45]). Hypogeusia was identified in 32/95 (33.7%) patients from three studies that used methods with a validated definition of hypogeusia. Older age, male gender, and smoking history were associated with taste dysfunction, while objective gustatory and olfactory dysfunction were not correlated. Subjective taste and quality of life measures were also not associated with objective taste. The impact of sinus surgery on objective taste is unclear. CONCLUSION Approximately 34% of patients with CRS experience hypogeusia. Neither olfactory function nor subjective taste were associated with objective gustatory function. Given the substantial prevalence of taste dysfunction patients with CRS, there is significant potential for growth in understanding of pathogenesis, impact on quality of life, and potential treatment strategies of taste impairment in the CRS patient population.

Progression of cancers during delay will impact on patient long-term survival. METHODS: We generated per-day hazard ratios of cancer progression from observational studies and applied these to age-specific, stage-specific cancer survival for England 2013-2017. We modelled per-patient delay of three months and six months and periods of disruption of one year and two years. Using healthcare resource costing, we contextualise attributable lives saved and life-years gained from cancer surgery to equivalent volumes of COVID-19 hospitalisations. FINDINGS: Per year, 94,912 resections for major cancers result in 80,406 long-term survivors and 1,717,051 life years gained. Per-patient delay of three/six months would cause attributable death of 4,755/10,760 of these individuals with loss of 92,214/208,275 life-years. For cancer surgery, average life-years gained (LYGs) per patient are 18.1 under standard conditions and 17.1/15.9 with a delay of three/six months (an average loss of 0.97/2.19 LYG per patient). Taking into account units of healthcare resource (HCRU), surgery results on average per patient in 2.25 resource-adjusted life-years gained (RALYGs) under standard conditions and 2.12/1.97 RALYGs following delay of three/six months. For 94,912 hospital COVID-19 admissions, there are 482,022 LYGs requiring of 1,052,949 HCRUs. Hospitalisation of community-acquired COVID-19 patients yields on average per patient 5.08 LYG and 0.46 RALYGs. INTERPRETATION: Modest delays in surgery for cancer incur significant impact on survival. Delay of three/six months in surgery for incident cancers would mitigate 19%/43% of life-years gained by hospitalisation of an equivalent volume of admissions for community-acquired COVID-19. This rises to 26%/59% when considering resource-adjusted life-years gained. To avoid a downstream public health crisis of avoidable cancer deaths, cancer diagnostic and surgical pathways must be maintained at normal throughput, with rapid attention to any backlog already accrued.","output":"Collateral damage: the impact on outcomes from cancer surgery of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viral infections pose a serious public health concern, from mild seasonal influenza to pandemics like those of SARS-CoV-2. Spatiotemporal dynamics of viral infection impact nearly all aspects of the progression of a viral infection, like the dependence of viral replication rates on the type of cell and pathogen, the strength of the immune response and localization of infection. Mathematical modeling is often used to describe respiratory viral infections and the immune response to them using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. However, ODE models neglect spatially-resolved biophysical mechanisms like lesion shape and the details of viral transport, and so cannot model spatial effects of a viral infection and immune response. In this work, we develop a multiscale, multicellular spatiotemporal model of influenza infection and immune response by combining non-spatial ODE modeling and spatial, cell-based modeling. We employ cellularization, a recently developed method for generating spatial, cell-based, stochastic models from non-spatial ODE models, to generate much of our model from a calibrated ODE model that describes infection, death and recovery of susceptible cells and innate and adaptive responses during influenza infection, and develop models of cell migration and other mechanisms not explicitly described by the ODE model. We determine new model parameters to generate agreement between the spatial and original ODE models under certain conditions, where simulation replicas using our model serve as microconfigurations of the ODE model, and compare results between the models to investigate the nature of viral exposure and impact of heterogeneous infection on the time-evolution of the viral infection. We found that using spatially homogeneous initial exposure conditions consistently with those employed during calibration of the ODE model generates far less severe infection, and that local exposure to virus must be multiple orders of magnitude greater than a uniformly applied exposure to all available susceptible cells. This strongly suggests a prominent role of localization of exposure in influenza A infection. We propose that the particularities of the microenvironment to which a virus is introduced plays a dominant role in disease onset and progression, and that spatially resolved models like ours may be important to better understand and more reliably predict future health states based on susceptibility of potential lesion sites using spatially resolved patient data of the state of an infection. We can readily integrate the immune response components of our model into other modeling and simulation frameworks of viral infection dynamics that do detailed modeling of other mechanisms like viral internalization and intracellular viral replication dynamics, which are not explicitly represented in the ODE model. We can also combine our model with available experimental data and modeling of exposure scenarios and spatiotemporal aspects of mechanisms like mucociliary clearance that are only implicitly described by the ODE model, which would significantly improve the ability of our model to present spatially resolved predictions about the progression of influenza infection and immune response.","output":"A Multiscale Multicellular Spatiotemporal Model of Local Influenza Infection and Immune Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused an abrupt disruption in residency and fellowship training, with most in-person teaching ceasing in March 2020. The AAHKS (American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons) Board of Directors quickly initiated an online lecture series named the Fellows Online COVID-19 AAHKS Learning initiative. The purpose of this study is to illustrate the impact that this educational platform had on residents and adult hip and knee reconstruction fellows. METHODS: Between March 31, 2020 and June 25, 2020 an online educational platform was simultaneously developed and delivered. Adult hip and knee reconstruction fellows and residents were invited to participate in the free, live, online education sessions. Faculty from well-respected institutions from around the United States volunteered their time to host the initiative, choosing topics to present, ranging from hip (13 lectures) and knee (9 lectures), to practice management/miscellaneous (12 lectures). Attendee registrations were tracked via the online platform and the maximum number of attendees per session was recorded. A survey was administered to attendees for feedback. RESULTS: Thirty-four, 1-hour virtual lectures were delivered in real time by 79 different faculty members from 20 different institutions. A total of 4746 registrations for the 34 lectures were received, with 2768 registrants (58.3%) attending. The average attendance was 81 viewers per session (range 21-143), with attendance peaking mid-April 2020. A survey administered to lecture participants showed that 104/109 (95.4%) attended live lectures and 93/109 (85.3%) watched recorded sessions. About 92.5% of attendees responded that they wanted the lectures to continue after clinical responsibilities resumed. CONCLUSION: Amid a pandemic with cessation of in-person training, AAHKS delivered a robust virtual training alternative, exposing residents and fellows to a variety of renowned faculty and topics. Attendance with the program was very high, along with continued interest to continue this initiative. These worldwide lectures may lead to future opportunities in virtual residency and fellowship education.","output":"Adult Hip and Knee Reconstruction Education during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The impact of a postoperative diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA) remains unknown. The objective of this study is to characterize the effect of COVID-19 infection following TJA on perioperative complication rates. METHODS: The Mariner database was queried for patients undergoing total hip and total knee arthroplasty from January 2018 to April 2020. TJA patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 within 90 days postoperatively were matched in a 1:3 fashion based on age, gender, iron deficiency anemia, payer status, and Charlson Comorbidity Index with patients who were not diagnosed with COVID-19. Preoperative comorbidity profiles and complications within 3 months of surgery were compared. Statistical analysis included chi-squared tests and multivariate logistic regression with outcomes considered significant at P < .05. RESULTS: Of the 239 COVID-19 positive patients, 132 (55.2%) underwent total hip arthroplasty. On multivariate analysis, COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with increased odds of deep vein thrombosis (odds ratio [OR] 4.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.10-11.81, P < .001), pulmonary embolism (OR 6.27, 95% CI 2.57-16.71, P < .001), and all complications (OR 3.36, 95% CI 2.47-4.59, P < .001). Incidence of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism was greater the closer in time the COVID-19 diagnosis was to the surgical procedure (10.24 times at 1 month, 7.87 times at 2 months, and 1.42 times at 3 months; P < .001). A similar relationship was observed with all complications. CONCLUSION: Postoperative COVID-19 infection is associated with higher rates of cardiopulmonary complications, thromboembolic disease, renal injury, and urinary tract infections in patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty.

HFMD has been associated with a growing number of outbreaks resulting in fatal complications since the late 1990s. The outbreaks may result from a combination of rapid population growth, climate change, socioeconomic changes, and other lifestyle changes. However, the modeling of climate variability and HFMD remains unclear, particularly in statistical theory development. The statistical relationship between HFMD and climate factors has been widely studied using generalized linear and additive modeling. When dealing with time-series data with clustered variables such as HFMD with clustered states, the independence principle of both modeling approaches may be violated. Thus, a Generalized Additive Mixed Model (GAMM) is used to investigate the relationship between HFMD and climate factors in Malaysia. The model is improved by using a first-order autoregressive term and treating all Malaysian states as a random effect. This method is preferred as it allows states to be modeled as random effects and accounts for time series data autocorrelation. The findings indicate that climate variables such as rainfall and wind speed affect HFMD cases in Malaysia. The risk of HFMD increased in the subsequent two weeks with rainfall below 60 mm and decreased with rainfall exceeding 60 mm. Besides, a two-week lag in wind speeds between 2 and 5 m/s reduced HFMD's chances. The results also show that HFMD cases rose in Malaysia during the inter-monsoon and southwest monsoon seasons but fell during the northeast monsoon. The study's outcomes can be used by public health officials and the general public to raise awareness, and thus, implement effective preventive measures.","output":"Effect of climate factors on the incidence of hand, foot, and mouth disease in Malaysia: A generalized additive mixed model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study is to examine the evolution of inequality by focusing on the impacts of the economic structure. The technique of decomposition by income sources is employed to evaluate the contribution of the three major sectors, namely the agricultural, industrial, and service sectors to overall inequality.

The first stage of study is to provide an overall view of the evolutionary trend of global inequality, the second stage focuses on the North-South divide, the third stage determines the impacts of income groups, and the fourth stage investigates the impacts for each region. There are several salient findings: First, global inequality had declined in the study period. Second, the service sector is identified as the largest contributor to global inequality, followed by the industrial sector, while the contribution of the agricultural sector is negligible. For the North-South divide, disparity in the service sector was more marked in the North than in the South. The industrial sector played a major role in the South and contributed more than 40% to overall inequality. For the comparison amongst the income groups, our findings show that the higher the income, the higher the percentage contribution of the service sector (except for the low-income group). Finally, for the comparison across regions, although the contribution of the agricultural sector in most regions are below 1.5%; however, the contribution of the agricultural sector in both Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia is more than 8%. It implies that a lot of people in these regions still rely on the agricultural sector for a living, and the development in the industrial and service sectors in these two regions lagged behind those of the other regions.

The benefits of intermodal freight transportation have been studied and are more observable in commercial logistics; however, the potential benefits of humanitarian logistics have not been thoroughly investigated. This research aims to present a resilient transportation framework by modeling intermodal transportation utilizing interoperable loading devices during disaster responses. We developed an integer programming model based on a timeCspace network by considering route and vehicle availabilities that are allowed to change with time. We consider vehicles with varying capacities in three transportation modes (i.e., ground, maritime, and air). The contribution of this study is threefold: (1) Two compatible unit load devices are proposed for humanitarian logistics; (2) a mathematical model that includes integer variable representation for vehicle fleets in different transportation modes is developed; and (3) intermodal transportation is compared with single-mode transportation using a real-life dataset. Our main results are as follows: In terms of cost, intermodal transportation is effective when demand occurs in consecutive periods and response time is short. Inventory is held more in intermodal transportation when it is cost-effective to use transportation modes with large capacities.

In relation to the influence of outdoor air pollutants on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, although the scientific evidence is much more limited, some studies point to PM(2.5) and PM(10) as potential airborne transmitters of the virus.

SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus, which mutates at a higher rate. Multiple studies had been done to identify and study nonsynonymous mutations, which change amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. On the other hand, there is little study on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 synonymous mutations. Although these mutations do not alter amino acids, some studies suggest that they may affect viral fitness. This study aims to predict the effect of synonymous mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Methods: A total of 30,229 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were retrieved from Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza Data (GISAID) database and aligned using MAFFT. Then, the mutations and their respective frequency were identified. A prediction of RNA secondary structures and their base pair probabilities was performed to study the effect of synonymous mutations on RNA structure and stability. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis was also performed to measure the codon usage bias (CUB) of SARS-CoV-2. Results: A total of 150 synonymous mutations were identified. The synonymous mutation identified with the highest frequency is C3037U mutation in the nsp3 of ORF1a, followed by C313U and C9286U mutation in nsp1 and nsp4 of ORF1a, respectively. Conclusion: Among the synonymous mutations identified, C913U mutation in ORF1a and C26735U in membrane (M) protein may affect RNA secondary structure, reducing the stability of RNA folding and possibly resulting in a higher translation rate. However, lab experiments are required to validate the results obtained from prediction analysis.","output":"Prediction of the Effects of Synonymous Variants on SARS-CoV-2 Genome (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The goal of this study is to improve overall screening, detection, and treatment of Neisseria gonorrhea (GC) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) at our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational study with two phases was conducted at a U.S. Army Medical Center. Previously collected samples from January 2014 through December 2015 were compared to prospectively collected data from March 2016 through December 2017. All data were collected from a convenience sample of active duty, HIV-positive men who have sex with men. Concordance between provider-collected and self-collected extragenital screening (EGS) samples was evaluated. RESULTS: The rate of detection using EGS was higher than previously found using urogenital screening alone. Our prospective analysis revealed that expanding screening to include extragenital sites increased rates of detection of GC and CT. Our rates of GC detection at the pharynx and rectum, and CT detection at the rectum, were higher than those reported in the literature for men who have sex with men. Rates of CT infection at the pharynx were comparable with those reported in the literature. Detection of GC at the pharynx was exactly concordant between self-collected and provider-collected samples. Concordance of GC and CT detection at the rectum was very good. The kappa coefficient for detection of CT at the pharynx was zero, which corresponded to 44 out of 45 concordant observations. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to implementation of EGS at our institution, we missed the opportunity to detect a substantial number of GC/CT infections with urogenital screening alone. Our results suggest that self-collection is a reliable method of EGS as compared to provider collection of samples.","output":"Evaluation of Self-Collection as a Method of Extragenital STI Screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led many countries of the world to impose a series of containment measures such as lockdowns (mass quarantines), curfews or similar restrictions (eg, stay-at-home orders, or shelter-in-place orders) All these restrictions were established in order to limit spread of COVID-19 Thus, approximately 3 9 billion people worldwide were under lockdown by early April 2020 During this time (home confinement), some solutions have been proposed by experts to improve work and school productivity, including smart working and online school lessons However, many of the restrictive measures are likely to act as predisposing factors for dry eye disease (DED), directly or related to sick building syndrome (SBS) Herein, we discuss the implications of quarantine measures on eye health, in particular on DED associated with SBS, and introduce some potential preventive strategies for lockdown-related ocular surface disorders Several risk factors are implicated in their pathogenesis, including environmental changes (eg, air quality) and modifications in personal behaviors (eg, the abuse of digital devices, malnutrition, and sleep/psychiatric disorders) Considering a number of predisposing factors for DED, it is possible to state that patients under lockdown are at risk of ocular surface alterations Accordingly, the COVID-19 pandemic era is expected to determine an increase in dry eye patients all around the world (a new phenomenon that we propose to name the \\"quarantine dry eye\\") in the event that the restrictive measures will be recursively extended over time","output":"The \\"Quarantine Dry Eye\\": The Lockdown for Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Its Implications for Ocular Surface Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-pharmaceutical interventions to control COVID-19 spread have been implemented in several countries with different intensity, timing, and impact on transmission As a result, post-lockdown COVID-19 dynamics are heterogenous and difficult to interpret Here we describe a set of contact surveys performed in four Chinese cities (Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Changsha) during the pre-pandemic, lockdown, and post-lockdown period to quantify the transmission impact of relaxing interventions via changes in age-specific contact patterns We estimate that the mean number of contacts increased 5%-17% since the end of the lockdown but are still 3-7 times lower than their pre-pandemic levels We find that post-lockdown contact patterns in China are still sufficiently low to keep SARS-CoV-2 transmission under control We also find that the impact of school interventions depends non-linearly on the share of other activities being resumed When most community activities are halted, school closure leads to a 77% decrease in the reproductive number;in contrast, when social mixing outside of schools is at pre-pandemic level, school closure leads to a 5% reduction in transmission Moving forward, to control COVID-19 spread without resorting to a lockdown, it will be key to dose relaxation in social mixing in the community and strengthen targeted interventions","output":"The impact of relaxing interventions on human contact patterns and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intercellular communication occurring by cell-to-cell contacts and via secreted messengers trafficked through extracellular vehicles is critical for regulating biological functions of multicellular organisms.

Most informal caregivers are women working as nurses within a health organization (also labeled as double-duty caregiver) and they have a high risk of developing mental and physical exhaustion. Until now little research attention has been paid to the expectations and needs of double duty caregivers and the role of self-management in managing private-work balance. Objective: The overall aim of this study was to investigate the expectations and needs of double duty caregivers in Netherlands, and to examine the meaning of self-management in managing work-life balance. Method: Different research methods have been applied in this exploratory study. Firstly, a scoping review has been conducted on the topics self-management and sustainable employability of double-duty caregivers using the search engines: CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Furthermore, a qualitative study has been conducted through focus groups with double duty caregivers. Results: Twenty studies that met the inclusion criteria (i.e., nurses with double duty caregiving tasks) could be identified. We found that double duty caregivers have different motivations for being a double duty caregiver based on internal and external expectations. Double duty caregiving causes a lot of mental and physical pressure for the caregiver. To be able to combine both dutys, double duty caregivers need flexibility and understanding from the workplace. Through two focus groups (N = 17) we found that social support from the workplace is not enough to be able to manage the situation. Self-management skills are important to be able to communicate effectively with the workplace and community care organizations about the kind of support needed. Also, health care organizations should offer the same support to double duty caregivers as any other informal caregiver. Discussion: Double-duty caregivers are at high risk of developing symptoms of overload and risk of reduced self-management quality and employability levels across time. Health care organizations and the double duty caregiver often wait too long to act instead of taking more preventive measures. Furthermore, community care organizations should dialog with double duty caregivers about their wishes concerning the division of caring tasks. This finding calls for special attention, with long-term solutions at both macro (health-care level), organizational (meso-level), and employee level (micro level).","output":"Supporting Double Duty Caregiving and Good Employment Practices in Health Care Within an Aging Society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Crowds express emotions as a collective individual, which is evident from the sounds that a crowd produces in particular events, e.g., collective booing, laughing or cheering in sports matches, movies, theaters, concerts, political demonstrations, and riots. A critical question concerning the innovative concept of crowd emotions is whether the emotional content of crowd sounds can be characterized by frequency-amplitude features, using analysis techniques similar to those applied on individual voices, where deep learning classification is applied to spectrogram images derived by sound transformations. In this work, we present a technique based on the generation of sound spectrograms from fragments of fixed length, extracted from original audio clips recorded in high-attendance events, where the crowd acts as a collective individual. Transfer learning techniques are used on a convolutional neural network, pre-trained on low-level features using the well-known ImageNet extensive dataset of visual knowledge. The original sound clips are filtered and normalized in amplitude for a correct spectrogram generation, on which we fine-tune the domain-specific features.

SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a randomized controlled study. METHODS: This study included subjects with a history of hospitalization with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and discharged within 4 weeks. The subjects were divided into two groups randomly, namely telerehabilitation group (TeleGr, n = 17) or control group (CGr, n = 17). The TeleGr received breathing and range of motion exercises, active cycle of breathing technique, and an aerobic training 3 days a week for 6 weeks, while CGr received an exercise brochure with the same content. Subjects were evaluated using the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea score for dyspnea, 30 s sit-to-stand test (30STS) and short physical performance battery (SPPB) to determine their physical status, Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) to assess quality of their life, and Beck Depression Inventory. All evaluations were carried out at home using videoconferencing. RESULTS: A significant improvement was observed in TelerGr in terms of mMRC (P= 0.035), 30STS (P= 0.005), 5 sit-to-stand time which is one of the subtests of SPPB (P = 0.039) and SGRQ scores. Significant improvement was observed only in the pain score in the CGr (P = 0.039). There was a statistically significant difference between the groups in SGRQ activity (P = 0.035) and total (P = 0.042) scores. In addition, more symptomatic improvement was found in TeleGr.

Despite several regional reports in Iran, the overall burden on IPIs among intellectually disabled individuals is poorly understood. Hence, the present study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of IPIs among intellectually disabled individuals in Iran. METHODS: Using the PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of data retrieved from seven electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and ProQuest for English articles, as well as SID and Magiran for Persian) from their inception up to December 2020. Pooled prevalence was estimated using a random-effects model with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and depicted as a forest plot, while heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochrans Q-test. RESULTS: Exactly 1263 of the 3004 intellectually disabled individuals examined by 14 studies across 10 provinces of Iran were positive for IPIs. Overall pooled prevalence estimate was 41% (95% CI 29C53%) with a range of 21% (95% CI 10C32%) to 68% (95% CI 55C80%) across sub-groups. Entamoeba coli (16.2%; 95% CI 10.3C22%), Blastocystis spp. (12.2%; 95% CI 7.2C17.2%), and Giardia duodenalis (11.9%; 95% CI 7.4C16.3%) were the most prevalent protozoan species. In terms of helminthic agents, the most prevalent species were Enterobius vermicularis (11.3%; 95% CI 6.3C16.3%) followed by Strongyloides stercoralis (10.9%; 95% CI 5.0C16.9%) and Hymenolepis nana (2.8%; 95% CI 0.4C5.2%) CONCLUSION: IPIs are highly prevalent among intellectually disabled individuals in Iran. Improving the health status and implementing infectious disease prevention strategies in rehabilitation centers, health promotion interventions to improve personal hygiene of intellectually disabled individuals, as well as utilize sensitive diagnostic methods besides routine stool examination techniques, and treatment of infected individuals will help in the control of these infections among intellectually disabled individuals.

To deal with misclassification, the tissue prior learning branch is introduced to capture the spatial representation of tumor cells without additional tissue annotation. Moreover, dynamic masks and consistency learning are adopted to learn the invariance of cell scale and shape.

We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes during the first 7 days after diagnosis in newborns with AKI in three neonatal intensive care units in Popayn-Colombia. METHODS: Multi-center prospective cohort study conducted between June 2019 and December 2020 in three NICUs after ethical approval. We included newborns between 2 and 28 days of life, first diagnosed with AKI using the KDIGO classification modified for newborns which consider increased serum creatinine values over baseline values as well as urine output over time in hours or both. Patients with chromosomal abnormalities, major kidney malformations, and complex congenital heart disease were excluded. Patients were followed for up to 7 days after diagnosis and the maximum KDIGO stage, recovery of kidney function, need for renal replacement therapy and cumulative incidence of death were evaluated. RESULTS: Over the 18 months of the study, 4132 newborns were admitted to the NICUs, and 93 patients (2.25, 95% CI 1.82C2.75%) developed neonatal AKI. 59.1% of the newborns were premature and there were no differences in severity according to gestational age. During follow-up, the maximum KDIGO was 64.5% for AKI-stage 1, 11.8% for AKI-stage 2, and 23.7% for AKI-stage 3.

The current study aims to address this research gap by performing a bibliometric analysis of 387 Social Science Citation Index articles relevant to cybercrime victimization from Web of Science database during the period of 2010C2020. The purpose of the article is to examine the research trend and distribution of publications by five main fields, including time, productive authors, prominent sources, active institutions, and leading countries/regions. Furthermore, this study aims to determine the global collaborations and current gaps in research of cybercrime victimization. Findings indicated the decidedly upward trend of publications in the given period. The USA and its authors and institutions were likely to connect widely and took a crucial position in research of cybercrime victimization. Cyberbullying was identified as the most concerned issue over the years and cyber interpersonal crimes had the large number of research comparing to cyber-dependent crimes. Future research is suggested to concern more about sample of the elder and collect data in different countries which are not only European countries or the USA.

Person-to-person transmission is accepted but WHO only considers aerosol transmission when procedures or support treatments that produce aerosol are performed. Transmission mechanisms are not fully understood and there is evidence for an airborne route to be considered, as the virus remains viable in aerosols for at least 3 h and that mask usage was the best intervention to prevent infection. Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Systems (HVAC) are used as a primary infection disease control measure. However, if not correctly used, they may contribute to the transmission/spreading of airborne diseases as proposed in the past for SARS. The authors believe that airborne transmission is possible and that HVAC systems when not adequately used may contribute to the transmission of the virus, as suggested by descriptions from Japan, Germany, and the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. Previous SARS outbreaks reported at Amoy Gardens, Emergency Rooms and Hotels, also suggested an airborne transmission. Further studies are warranted to confirm our hypotheses but the assumption of such way of transmission would cause a major shift in measures recommended to prevent infection such as the disseminated use of masks and structural changes to hospital and other facilities with HVAC systems.","output":"Airborne route and bad use of ventilation systems as non-negligible factors in SARS-CoV-2 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined whether low self-efficacy and heightened perceived stress were associated with dyspareunia at two timepoints during COVID-19.

They may benefit from a program to monitor oxygen levels at home using portable pulse oximeter devices. Our study aims to evaluate patient engagement in and compliance with a home pulse oximetry monitoring program. The results of this study will be important to inform development and operationalization of remote patient monitoring programs. Methods: This was a single center, prospective pilot study of patients who presented to the ED or urgent care for symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection and were considered to have some risk of clinical deterioration and thus could benefit from home SpO2 monitoring. Subjects were given a portable pulse oximeter and diary. They were instructed to perform readings at rest and with exertion twice daily for 14 days. Patients also recorded the presence or absence of symptoms associated with COVID-19 and whether they required additional medical care due to worsening symptoms. Subjects were contacted daily to obtain the recorded data. If contact could not be made with 3 attempts on each of 3 successive days, the subject was considered lost to follow up. The primary outcome of interest was patient engagement in the program defined as completion of the entire 14-day assessment. Secondary outcomes included patient compliance with performing the SpO2 readings and the proportion of subjects who had worsening clinical status requiring medical evaluation. Patient compliance was calculated as a percentage of completed readings out of the total number of possible readings. The difference in engagement and compliance rates between COVID-positive and COVID-negative patients was calculated using the Pearson Chi-squared test and Mann-Whitney U test, respectively. Results: Fifty patients were enrolled in the study with 3 screen failures. The remaining 47 were included in the final analysis. All patients received a qualitative test for detection of SARS-CoV-2;27 (57.4%) patients tested positive. Overall, engagement in the program was 46.8% with no significant difference between COVID- positive and COVID-negative groups (48.15% vs 45 %, p = 0.831). Median compliance was 42.9% (IQR 22.22 78.57) with compliance of 50.0% (IQR 20 - 85.71) and 42.86% (IQR 22.92 - 76.44) for COVID-positive and COVID-negative groups, respectively (p= 0.838). A total of 4 patients required additional medical care during the study period. Of those, two sought medical attention after advisement by the study team members due to decreasing SpO2 levels. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that there was limited engagement and compliance in a 14-days home pulse oximetry monitoring program. A positive SARS-CoV-2 test did not predict a higher likelihood of engagement or compliance. Our program was helpful in detecting worsening SpO2 levels in two patients who sought medical care and were admitted for further management.

The United States (US) opioid epidemic is a persistent and pervasive public health emergency as it continues to claim the lives of Americans through addiction and overdose. There have been sustained efforts to reverse this iatrogenic crisis over the past decade. This study analyzed the changes in prescription opioid distribution for pain and identified regional differences between 2010 and 2019. Methods and Findings. Opioid production data was obtained from the DEAs annual production quotas. Total opioid production has decreased 41.5% from 2013 (87.6 morphine mg equivalent metric tons) to 2019 (51.3). Opioid distribution from 2010 to 2019 was collected for ten prescription opioids (codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, meperidine, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tapentadol) from the US Drug Enforcement Administrations Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System. Regional variance was expressed as the ratio of the 95th to 5th percentiles of opioid distribution per state, corrected for population. The peak year for all ten prescription opioids was identified, individually, as between 2010 and 2013, except for codeine (2015). There was a 51.96% overall decrease in opioid distribution per capita with the largest decrease in Florida (-61.61%) and smallest in Texas (-18.64%). The largest quantities of opioid distribution were observed in Tennessee (520.70 morphine mg equivalent or MME per person) and Delaware (251.45) in 2011 and 2019. The smallest was Nebraska (153.39) in 2011 and Minnesota (90.49) in 2019. The highest to lowest state ratio of total opioid use, corrected for population, was sizable in 2011 (5.25) and 2019 (2.78). Similarly, the mean 95th/5th ratio was relatively stable in from 2011 (4.78 +0.70) and 2019 (5.64+0.98). The 95th/5th ratio in 2019 was greatest for methadone (10.23) and oxymorphone (10.09) and smallest for morphine (2.20) and fentanyl (2.12). Southern states (e.g MS, TN, AL, AK, DE, and NC) had the highest per capita distribution for eight of the ten opioids in 2019. The strength of the correlation between per capita hydrocodone and codeine, and hydromorphone and codeine increased significantly from 2011 to 2019. Conclusions. This study found a decline in total production and distribution for ten prescription opioids during the last half-decade. However, distribution was non-homogeneous at a state level. Analysis of regional differences revealed a three-fold difference in the 95th:5th percentile ratio between states which was unchanged over the past decade. Future research focused on identifying factors contributing to the observed regional variability could prove valuable to understanding, and potentially remediating, the pronounced disparities in prescription opioid use in the US.","output":"Declines and pronounced regional disparities in prescription opioid use in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells exploit an aberrant transcriptional program to sustain their infinite growth and progression. Emerging evidence indicates that the continuous and robust transcription of oncogenes in cancer cells is often driven by super-enhancers (SEs). In this study, we systematically compared the SE landscapes between normal liver and HCC cells and revealed that the cis-acting SE landscape was extensively reprogrammed during liver carcinogenesis. HCC cells acquired SEs at multiple prominent oncogenes to drive their vigorous expression. We identified sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) as an SE-associated oncogene, and we used this gene as an example to illustrate the impact of SEs on the activation of oncogenes in HCC. Concurrently, we also showed that the critical components of the trans-acting SE complex, namely, cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), E1A binding protein P300 (EP300), and mediator complex subunit 1 (MED1), were frequently overexpressed in human HCCs and were associated with the poor prognosis of patients with HCC. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system and specific small-molecule inhibitors, we further demonstrated that HCC cells were highly sensitive to perturbations of the SE complex. The inactivation of CDK7, BRD4, EP300, and MED1 selectively repressed the expression of SE-associated oncogenes in HCC. Finally, we demonstrated that THZ1, which is a small-molecule inhibitor of CDK7, exerted a prominent anticancer effect in both in vitro and in vivo HCC models. Conclusion: The SE landscape and machinery were significantly altered in human HCCs. HCC cells are highly susceptible to perturbations of the SE complex due to the resulting selective suppression of SE-associated oncogenes. Our results suggest that targeting SE complex is a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.","output":"Aberrant Super-Enhancer Landscape in Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) delivered via a mobile phone messaging robot to patients who had their total hip (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The first use of a prototype forced oscillations technique (FOT) device in a mimicked lung tumor setup is investigated by comparing and interpreting the experimental findings. METHODS: The fractional order model parameters are determined for the mechanical properties of the healthy and tumorous lung. Two protocols have been performed for a mimicked lung tumor setup in a laboratory environment. A low frequency evaluation of respiratory impedance model and nonlinearity index were assessed using the forced oscillations technique. RESULTS: The viscoelastic properties of the lung tissue change, results being mirrored in the respiratory impedance assessment via FOT. The results demonstrate significant differences among the mimicked healthy and tumor measurements, (p-values [Formula: see text] 0.05) for impedance values and also for heterogeneity index. However, there was no significant difference in lung function before and after immersing the mimicked lung in water or saline solution, denoting no structural changes.

Learning objectives were set up in order to determine and standardise the contents of the presentations. In accordance with the Bloom Taxonomy, 834 learning objectives were created for a total of 90 lectures (18 lectures for each PGY year). Totally 90 videos were shot by specialised instructors and webcasts were prepared. Webcasts were posted at uropedia.com.tr, which is the web library of the Society of Urological Surgery. The satisfaction of residents and instructors was evaluated with feedbacks. An assessment of knowledge was measured with the multiple-choice exam. RESULTS: A total of 43 centres and 250 urology residents were included in ERTP during the academic year 2018/2019.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcomes of RAMIE using the microanatomy-based concept in the initial introduction phase. METHODS: We have performed more than 500 TEPP procedures as minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE). After performing about 400 cases of MIE, we established a microanatomy-based standardization of UMLND. In October 2018, we introduced RAMIE, and have performed 75 procedures in 20 months. Two groups were analyzed: a group after microanatomy-based standardization in TEPP (100 cases after completing 400 cases of TEPP) and a RAMIE group (75 cases). Finally, 51 paired cases were matched using a propensity score. Furthermore, the change in postoperative short-term outcome for RAMIE in the initial introduction phase was analyzed. RESULTS: Although there were no significant differences between the two groups in the number of upper mediastinal lymph nodes dissected, there was a significant decrease (P = 0.036) in intraoperative blood loss volume with RAMIE, representing a definite benefit for patients. The thoracoscopic operative time for RAMIE decreased by almost 100 min following less than 50 cases of experience, reaching the same level as that for recent TEPP, but with only one-tenth the operator experience.

Henceforth, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to explore the prevalence and determinants of mental health outcomes (anxiety, stress, depression, PTSD, insomnia) among nurses across the globe due to the COVID-19. Methods: A PRISMA compliant systematic review (PROSPERO-CRD 42020204120) was carried out to identify articles from multiple databases reporting the prevalence of mental health outcomes among nurses. Proportion random effect analysis, I2 statistic, quality assessment, and sensitivity analysis were carried out. Results: Pooled data on mental health outcomes were generated from 25 cross-sectional studies: 32% anxiety (95% confidence interval (CI) = 21%-44%, n (number of studies) = 21, N (sample size) = 13 641), 40.6% stress (95% CI = 25.4%-56.8%, n = 10, N = 4204), 32% depression (95% CI = 21%-44%, n = 17, N = 12 294), 18.6% PTSD (95% CI = 4.8%-38%, n = 3, N = 638), 38.3% insomnia (95% CI = 5.8%-78.6%, n = 2, N = 261) and significant risk factors for mental ailments includes; caring for COVID-19 patients, being a female, low self-efficacy, resilience, social support and having physical symptoms (sore-throat, breathlessness, cough, lethargy, myalgia, fever).

This label-free biosensor employs low-cost components and simple fabrication processes to lower the overall cost while achieving high sensitivity using a differential detection method. To experimentally demonstrate its limit of detection (LOD), we conducted biosensing experiments with streptavidin and C-reactive protein (CRP). The optical cavity structure was optimized further for better sensitivity and easier fluid control. We utilized the polymer swelling property to fine-tune the optical cavity width, which significantly improved the success rate to produce measurable samples. Four different concentrations of streptavidin were tested in triplicate, and the LOD of the OCB was determined to be 1.35 nM. The OCB also successfully detected three different concentrations of human CRP using biotinylated CRP antibody. The LOD for CRP detection was 377 pM.

By reducing the sensing area, improving the functionalization and passivation processes, and increasing the sample volume, the LOD of the OCB are estimated to be reduced further to the femto-molar range. Overall, the demonstrated capability of the OCB in the present work shows great potential to be used as a promising POC biosensor.","output":"Demonstration of a Label-Free and Low-Cost Optical Cavity-Based Biosensor Using Streptavidin and C-Reactive Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of these guidelines is to provide primary care physicians with scientifically based algorithms for the implementation of dispensary monitoring in patients with chronic noncommunicable diseases in the conditions of the new coronavirus infection (COVID19) pandemic, including the use of telemedicine technologies.

BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is common in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Proning improves blood oxygenation and survival rates in these patients but is not commonly performed due to the difficulty of the procedure. METHODS: An academic literature review, internet video search, and consultation with five subject-matter experts was performed to identify known methods for proning. Evaluation of each method considered the number of healthcare workers required, physical stresses on staff, risk of adverse events to patients, and equipment cost and availability. RESULTS: Several variations of manual techniques and-lift assisted techniques were identified in addition to a specialized proning bed. Manual methods require more healthcare workers, higher physical stresses, and greater risk of adverse events than lift-assisted methods or the proning bed. CONCLUSION: Both the specialized proning bed and a lift-assisted method using straps largely eliminated manual forces required for proning while allowing for a controlled lowering and positioning of the patient.

In cancer, CAIX expression is associated with tumor hypoxia. CAIX is also overexpressed in renal cell carcinoma and is a molecular target for the therapeutic antibody cG250 (girentuximab). Radionuclide imaging of CAIX expression might be used for identification of patients who may benefit from cG250 therapy and from treatment strategies for hypoxic tumors. Affibody molecules are small (7 kDa) scaffold proteins having a high potential as probes for radionuclide molecular imaging. The aim of the present study was to evaluate feasibility of in vivo imaging of CAIX-expression using radiolabeled Affibody molecules. A histidine-glutamate-histidine-glutamate-histidine-glutamate (HE)3-tag-containing CAIX-binding Affibody molecule (HE)3-ZCAIX:1 was labeled with [(99m)Tc(CO)3](+). Its binding properties were evaluated in vitro using CAIX-expressing SK-RC-52 renal carcinoma cells. (99m)Tc-(HE)3-ZCAIX:1 was evaluated in NMRI nu/nu mice bearing SK-RC-52 xenografts. The in vivo specificity test confirmed CAIX-mediated tumor targeting. (99m)Tc-(HE)3-ZCAIX:1 cleared rapidly from blood and normal tissues except for kidneys. At optimal time-point (4 h p.i.), the tumor uptake was 9.7  0.7% ID/g, and tumor-to-blood ratio was 53  10. Experimental imaging of CAIX-expressing SK-RC-52 xenografts at 4 h p.i. provided high contrast images. The use of radioiodine label for ZCAIX:1 enabled the reduction of renal uptake, but resulted in significantly lower tumor uptake and tumor-to-blood ratio.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from March to April 2020 in medical university. Levels of perceived stress, insomnia and depression were measured using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). The descriptive analyses of the demographic characteristics and correlation analyses of the three variables were calculated. The significance of the mediation effect was obtained using a bootstrap approach with SPSS PROCESS macro. RESULTS: The mean age of medical students was 21.46 years (SD=2.50). Of these medical students, 10,185 (34.3%) were male and 19,478 (65.7%) were female. Perceived stress was significantly associated with depression (?=0.513, P < 0.001). Insomnia mediated the association between perceived stress and depression (?=0.513, P < 0.001). The results of the non-parametric bootstrapping method confirmed the significance of the indirect effect of perceived stress through insomnia (95% bootstrap CI =0.137, 0.149). The indirect effect of insomnia accounted for 44.13% of the total variance in depression. CONCLUSIONS: These findings contribute to a better understanding of the interactive mechanisms underlying perceived stress and depression, and elucidating the mediating effects of insomnia on the association.

This study aims to reveal the underpinning reasons for such MFS surge and its continuance by integrating health belief model (HBM) and expectation confirmation model (ECM). Design/methodology/approach The study analyzes 529 MFS users' responses during the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh using the partial least square method. Findings Satisfaction is more predictive than perceived usefulness in explaining continuance usage intention. Expectation confirmation also indirectly affects continuance intention. Among the HBM constructs, the indirect effect of perceived severity on continuance intention via perceived usefulness and satisfaction is significant. Besides, the impact of self-efficacy on continuance intention is also significant. Moreover, perceived credibility significantly affects satisfaction and indirectly affected continuance usage intention via satisfaction. Practical implications The study projects boosting customers' satisfaction is critical for the successful retention of existing MFS customers. MFS service providers should emphasize the factors that amplify satisfaction. They must evaluate preadoption factors so that customers can have positive confirmation. Especially, the service providers, the policymakers and the regulators should take an active role in improving the users' self-efficacy and the system's credibility. Undertaking the MFS literacy program, installing hotline service to provide emergency help will boost users' confidence in using the system.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospitalisation, intensive care or death due to COVID-19 from March to September 2020, in relation to CRF and muscle strength. RESULTS: High CRF in late adolescence and early adulthood had a protective association with severe COVID-19 later in life with OR (95% CI) 0.76 (0.67 to 0.85) for hospitalisation (n=2 006), 0.61 (0.48 to 0.78) for intensive care (n=445) and 0.56 (0.37 to 0.85) for mortality (n=149), compared with the lowest category of CRF.

DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed studies assessing intervention acceptability with young adults (aged 10C24) in Africa, published between January 2010 and June 2020. DATA SOURCES: Web of Science, Medline, PsycINFO, SociIndex, CINAHL, Africa-wide, Academic Search Complete and PubMed were searched through July 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Papers were selected based on the following inclusion criteria: if they (1) reported primary research assessing acceptability (based on the authors definition of the study or findings) of one or more intervention(s) with adolescents and young adults 10C24; (2) assessed acceptability of intervention(s) aimed at positively influencing one or more development outcome(s), as defined by sustainable development goal (SDG) indicators; (3) reported on research conducted in Africa; (4) were in the English Language; (5) were peer-reviewed and and (6) were published between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2020. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Abstracts were reviewed independently by the two first authors to determine relevance. Full text of potentially eligible studies were retrieved and independently examined by the same two authors; areas of disagreement or lack of clarity were resolved through discussion by the two authors andwhere necessarythe assessment of a third author. RESULTS: 55 studies were considered eligible for inclusion in the review. Most studies were conducted in Southern Africa, of which 32 jointly in South Africa and Uganda. The majority of interventions assessed for acceptability could be classified as HIV or HPV vaccine interventions (10), E-health (10), HIV testing interventions (8), support group interventions (7) and contraceptive interventions (6). The objectives of most interventions were linked to SDG3, specifically to HIV and sexual and reproductive health. Acceptability was overall high among these published studies. 22 studies provided reasons for acceptability or lack thereof, some specific to particular types of interventions and others common across intervention types. CONCLUSIONS: Our review exposes considerable scope for future acceptability research and review work.

In humans, the application of low-intensity magnetic fields has shown to be able to produce neural entrainment at the magnetic pulse frequency, making it useful to induce gamma frequencies. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess if the application of fast gamma magnetic stimulation (FGMS) over the left prefrontal dorsolateral cortex would be a safe and well-tolerated intervention that could potentially improve cognitive scores in subjects with mild cognitive impairment and mild AD. Methods: In these randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study, participants were assigned to either receive daily sessions two times a day of active or sham FGMS for 6 months. Afterward, measurements of adverse effects, cognition, functionality, and depression were taken. Results: Thirty-four patients, 17 in each group, were analyzed for the primary outcome. FGMS was adequately tolerated by most of the subjects. Only four patients from the active FGMS group (23.52%) and one patient from the sham FGMS group (5.88%) presented any kind of adverse effects, showing no significant difference between groups. Nevertheless, FGMS did not significantly change cognitive, functionality, or depressive evaluations.

Using data collected from a rapid survey led by the National Institute of Statistics, on a sample of 1,310 respondents from April to May 2020. These data show that a large proportion of workers suffered a wage cut (60.93%) and temporary job suspension (31.6%), and the smallest proportion suffered job loss (7.47%). The results of the logistic regression show that lower frequency of outgoings to work, difficulties in accessing transport services and the loss of customer confidence have a strong negative impact on both wage cuts and temporary suspensions of work. The closure (total or partial) of activities has increasingly enhanced job loss. Further, the log of odds show that workers in private firms are more affected than their peers in public firms, and the middle-aged are the most affected group. So, it is recommended to revamp the old methods of activity into digital innovation that enables less physical touch and find an appropriate way to support those who have lost their jobs during this Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in the private sector.","output":"The adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the labor market in Cameroon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Appropriate allocation of nursing staff is key to ensuring efficient nursing in hospitals, and is significantly correlated with patient safety, nursing quality, and nurse job satisfaction. However, there are few studies on nursing workforce allocation in the isolation wards of COVID-19 designated hospitals globally. This study aims to better understand the nursing workforce allocation in the isolation wards of COVID-19 designated hospitals in China, and provide a theoretical basis for efficiently deploying first-line nurses in China and across the world in the future. METHODS: An online survey was conducted among the head nurses (n = 229) and nurses (n = 1378) in the isolation wards of 117 hospitals (selected by stratified sampling), using a self-reported human resource allocation questionnaire. RESULTS: The average bed-to-nurse ratios of different isolation wards were different (Z = 36.742, P = 0.000). The bed-to-nurse ratios of the ICU, suspected COVID-19 cases ward, and confirmed COVID-19 cases ward, were 1:1.88, 1:0.56, and 1:0.45, respectively. The nurse work hours per shift in different isolation wards were also different (Z = 8.468, P = 0.014), with the specific values of the ICU, suspected COVID-19 cases ward, and confirmed COVID-19 cases ward, being 5, 6, and 6 h, respectively. A correlation analysis showed that the average work hours per shift was proportional to the overtime work of nurses (r(s) = 0.146), the proportion of nurse practitioners was proportional to the overall utilization rate of nursing human resources in the wards (r(s) = 0.136), and the proportion of nurses with college degrees was proportional to teamwork (r(s) = 0.142). The proportion of nurses above grade 10 was inversely proportional to teamwork and psychological problems (r(s) = 0.135, r(s) = 0.203). The results of multiple stepwise regression analyses showed that the work hours of nurses per shift was the main factor affecting nurse satisfaction and that the proportion of nurses and the work hours of nurses per shift were both independent factors affecting the length of stay (LOS) of patients. CONCLUSION: Hospitals in China have made good nursing workforce allocations during the COVID-19 pandemic, but there are certain shortcomings. Therefore, scientific and efficient nursing workforce allocation practice plans should be established to improve the ability of hospitals to deal with public health emergencies and are urgent problems that need to be addressed soon.","output":"Nursing allocation in isolation wards of COVID-19 designated hospitals: a nationwide study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Head and neck cancer squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer internationally. Established risk factors include smoking, alcohol and presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). The incidence rate of new disease continues to rise, despite falls in alcohol consumption and a reduction in smoking, the rising rates are unlikely to be solely attributed to HPV status alone. Obesity and its associated conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) are implicated in the risk and progression of a variety of cancers, but there is paucity of evidence regarding its role in HNSCC. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic review of cohort studies, reporting a risk of incident HNSCC, will be included. A systematic search strategy has been developed, multiple databases will be searched from January 1966 to November 2021, including Cochrane Library, OVID SP versions of Medline and EMBASE. The primary outcome will be incident HNSCC based on exposures of T2D, obesity, dyslipidaemia and hypertension as defined by the WHO. A combined risk effect across studies will be calculated using meta-analysis, although depending on the heterogeneity in study design, exposure and outcome reporting this may not be possible. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No ethical approval is required for this systematic review. The review will be published in a relevant peer-review journal and findings will be presented at scientific meetings in both poster and oral presentation form.

Advance care plans are commonly associated with treatment limitations; however, key patient agents (such as doctors, allied health, nurses and family) may instead make temporal, best interests or good medical practice decisions on behalf of the patient. Accordingly, there is a need to better understand ancillary decision-makers perspectives, particularly of doctors. PURPOSE: To explain how the potentially conflicting interests of bedside patient agents operates as a factor which influences doctors application of advance care plans of people with a neurodegenerative disorder. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Using a constructivist grounded theory informed thematic analysis, 38 semi-structured interviews were conducted with hospital-based doctors, allied health, nurses and family of people with a neurodegenerative disorder who had an advance care plan. Data were inductively analysed using open and focused coding. RESULTS: Analysis revealed two main themes: dynamics of discerning best interests; and avoiding conflict. Rather than applying advance care plans, doctors largely involved families to attempt best interests decision-making partnerships on patients behalf. Bedside agents demonstrated significant intra and interpersonal challenges associated with their roles as patient agents. Doctors appeared protective of families and patients with neurodegenerative disorder. CONCLUSION: Although bedside agents value advance care plans, doctors often favour temporal healthcare decisions in consultation with family. We suggest there are limitations to the effectiveness of advance care plans in practice, with application typically only occurring close to death. Despite the intentions of advance care planning, bedside agents may still experience considerable dissonance.","output":"Advance Care Plans and the Potentially Conflicting Interests of Bedside Patient Agents: A Thematic Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mass vaccination campaigns to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) are occurring in many countries; estimates of vaccine effectiveness are urgently needed to support decision making. A countrywide mass vaccination campaign with the use of an inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (CoronaVac) was conducted in Chile starting on February 2, 2021. METHODS: We used a prospective national cohort, including participants 16 years of age or older who were affiliated with the public national health care system, to assess the effectiveness of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with regard to preventing Covid-19 and related hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and death. We estimated hazard ratios using the extension of the Cox proportional-hazards model, accounting for time-varying vaccination status. We estimated the change in the hazard ratio associated with partial immunization (14 days after receipt of the first dose and before receipt of the second dose) and full immunization (14 days after receipt of the second dose). Vaccine effectiveness was estimated with adjustment for individual demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: The study was conducted from February 2 through May 1, 2021, and the cohort included approximately 10.2 million persons. Among persons who were fully immunized, the adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 65.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.2 to 66.6) for the prevention of Covid-19 and 87.5% (95% CI, 86.7 to 88.2) for the prevention of hospitalization, 90.3% (95% CI, 89.1 to 91.4) for the prevention of ICU admission, and 86.3% (95% CI, 84.5 to 87.9) for the prevention of Covid-19Crelated death.

The objective of this study was to evaluate healthcare workers mental health problems during the common COVID-19 exposure scenario in Mexico, comparing those on the frontline with other healthcare workers according to gender and profession, determining the main risk factors for the most frequent mental health problems. METHODS: A cross-sectional online study was conducted with a non-probabilistic sample of 5,938 Mexican healthcare workers who completed brief screening measures of mental health problems and ad hoc questions about sociodemographic professional characteristics, conditions related to increased risk of COVID-19 infection, life stressors during the COVID-19 emergency, and perceived need to cope with COVID-19. RESULTS: The identified mental health problems were insomnia, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), all of which were more frequent in frontline healthcare workers (52.1, 37.7, and 37.5%, respectively) and women (47.1, 33.0 %, and 16.3%, respectively).

However, the interactions among major international nonferrous metal futures, especially their extreme connectedness at different time frequencies (horizons), are rarely recognized.

(2018) and frequency connectedness method of Barunik and Krehlik (2018). The main empirical results show that, firstly, these major nonferrous metal futures maintain very tight total connectedness no matter in normal or extreme conditions, and the extreme left- and right-tail connectedness measures are larger than the one at normal case. Secondly, there is no clear difference between the extreme downside (left-tail) and upside (right-tail) total connectedness in both time and frequency domains. Thirdly, the total and net connectedness effects of these nonferrous metal futures are mainly centered in short-term frequency at both normal and extreme quantiles. Fourthly, the dynamic analysis indicates that the total connectedness among these futures are very stable throughout the data sample, even during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, these nonferrous metal futures play quite different roles in net connectedness effects across various quantiles and time frequencies.","output":"Normal and extreme interactions among nonferrous metal futures: A new quantile-frequency connectedness approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Successful management of an event where health-care needs exceed regional health-care capacity requires coordinated strategies for scarce resource allocation.

Human mobility patterns were drastically adjusted as individuals complied with stay-at-home orders, changed their working patterns, and moved increasingly in the proximity of their home. Such behavioural changes brought about many spillover impacts, among which the sharp and immediate reduction in the concentration of nitrogen-based pollutants throughout the country. This work explores the extent to which urban Nitrogen Dioxide (NO(2)) concentration responds to changes in human behaviour, in particular human mobility patterns and commuting. We model the dynamic and responsive change in NO(2) concentration in the period directly following national lockdown and respective opening orders. Using the national urban air quality monitoring network we generate a synthetic NO(2) concentration series built from a time series of historic data to compare expected modelled trends to the actual observed patterns in 2020. A series of pre- and post-estimators are modelled to understand the scale of concentration responsiveness to human activity and varying ability of areas across the UK to comply with the lockdown closing and response to openings. Specifically, these are linked to workday commuting times and observed patterns of human mobility change obtained from Google mobility reports. We find a strong and robust co-movement of air pollution concentration and work-related mobility C concentrations of NO(2) during typical weekday commuting hours saw a higher relative drop, moving in tandem with patterns of human mobility around workplaces over the course of lockdowns and openings. While NO(2) concentrations remained relatively low around the time of reopening, particularly during commuting hours, there is a relatively fast responsiveness rate to concentrations increasing quickly in line with human activity. With one of the key Government advice for workers to take staggered transportation into work and lessen the burden of rush hours and adopting more flexible work-home arrangements, our results would suggest that reductions in NO(2) in urban areas are particularly responsive to broader human patterns and dynamics over time as we transitioned towards new working routines.","output":"Decomposing the Temporal Signature of Nitrogen Dioxide Declines during the COVID-19 Pandemic in UK Urban Areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: At the end of February 2020, the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China had drastically slowed and appeared to be under control compared to the peak data in early February of that year. However, the outcomes of COVID-19 control and prevention measures varied between regions (ie, provinces and municipalities) in China; moreover, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, and the spread of the disease has accelerated in countries outside China. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to establish valid models to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control and prevention among various regions in China. These models also targeted regions with control and prevention problems by issuing immediate warnings. METHODS: We built a mathematical model, the Epidemic Risk Time Series Model, and used it to analyze two sets of data, including the daily COVID-19 incidence (ie, newly diagnosed cases) as well as the daily immigration population size. RESULTS: Based on the results of the model evaluation, some regions, such as Shanghai and Zhejiang, were successful in COVID-19 control and prevention, whereas other regions, such as Heilongjiang, yielded poor performance. The evaluation result was highly correlated with the basic reproduction number (R(0)) value, and the result was evaluated in a timely manner at the beginning of the disease outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: The Epidemic Risk Time Series Model was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control and prevention in different regions in China based on analysis of immigration population data. Compared to other methods, such as R(0), this model enabled more prompt issue of early warnings.

This pilot study's purpose was to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and plausible efficacy of an 8-week intervention employing 30 min of prescribed moderate intensity exercise (ActiveCBT) compared to 30 min of usual activities (CalmCBT) immediately prior to weekly online CBT sessions. Ten adults with DSM-5-diagnosed current DEP were randomized to groups and completed: an intake assessment, eight weekly CBT sessions, final assessment, and 3-month follow-up. ActiveCBT participants were prescribed 30-min of moderate exercise immediately prior to each standardized 50-min CBT session. CalmCBT participants continued with normal activities for 30 min before therapy. Questionnaires regarding DEP symptom severity (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]), between-session effectiveness (Behavioral Activation for Depression Survey [BADS], Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire [ATQ]), in-session effectiveness (Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised [WAI]), and state anhedonia (Dimension Analog Rating Scale [DARS], Visual Analog Scale [VAS]; assessed 3 times: before Active/Calm condition, after, and after therapy) were completed each week. Therapy fidelity ratings were independently coded via a standardized codebook. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) were used to assess DEP at intake, final, and 3-month follow-up. We found strong feasibility and acceptability (100% adherence, 100% retention at final visit, 74.6% therapy fidelity, and high patient satisfaction ratings). Differences between groups favoring ActiveCBT in anhedonia (DARS, Hedges' g = 0.92; VAS, g = 3.16), within- (WAI, g = 0.1.10), and between-session effectiveness (ATQ g = ?0.65; BADS g = ?1.40), suggest plausible efficacy of ActiveCBT for enhancing CBT. DEP rates were reduced in both groups from baseline to final (60% MDD SCID remission) and at follow up (Active: 40%; Calm: 25%). Larger and potentially quicker symptom improvement was found favoring the Active condition to the final visit (HAMD, between-group changes g = ?1.33; PHQ-9, g = ?0.62), with small differences remaining at follow-up (HAMD, g = ?0.45; PHQ-9, g = ?0.19). Exercise priming appears acceptable and plausibly efficacious for enhancing mechanisms of CBT and overall outcomes, though the present small sample precludes efficacy determinations.

LUS correctly identified as positive 217 (99%) patients, but per-zone analysis showed sensitivity = 75% and specificity = 66%. The revision of the 121 (55%) cases with positive LUS and negative CT revealed COVID-compatible lesions in 42 (38%) CT scans. Number of disease-positive zones, Severity Score and %WALV between LUS and CT showed moderate correlations. The AUCs for LUS Severity Score and number of LUS-positive zones did not differ in detecting %WALV  70%. CONCLUSION: LUS in COVID-19 is valuable for case identification but shows only moderate correlation with CT findings as for lesion patterns and severity quantification. The number of disease-positive lung zones in LUS alone was sufficient to discriminate relevant disease burden.","output":"Correlation between lung ultrasound and chest CT patterns with estimation of pulmonary burden in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundDuring a pandemic, estimates of geographic variability in disease burden are important but limited by the availability and quality of data. MethodsWe propose a framework for estimating geographic variability in testing effort, total number of infections, and infection fatality ratio (IFR). Because symptomatic people are more likely to seek testing, we use a noncentral hypergeometric model that accounts for differential probability of positive tests. We apply this framework to the United States (U.S.) COVID-19 pandemic to estimate county-level SARS-CoV-2 IFRs from March 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020. Using data on population size, number of observed cases, number of reported deaths in each U.S. county and state, and number of tests in each U.S. state, we develop a series of estimators to identify the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and IFRs at the county level. We then perform a simulation and compare the estimated values to simulated values to demonstrate the validity of our approach. FindingsApplying the county-level estimators to the real, unsimulated COVID-19 data spanning March 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020 from across the U.S., we found that IFRs varied from 0 to 0.0273, with an interquartile range of 0.0022 and a median of 0.0018. The estimators for IFRs, number of infections, and number of tests showed high accuracy and precision; for instance, when applied to simulated validation data sets, across counties, Pearson correlation coefficients between estimator means and true values were 0.88, 0.95, and 0.74, respectively. InterpretationWe propose an estimation framework that can be used to identify area-level variation in IFRs and performs well to estimate county-level IFRs in the U.S. COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Estimating area-level variation in SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality ratios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Grapevine yellow speckle viroid-2 (GYSVd-2) is a viroid found only in grapevines in China and Australia.

To avoid a humanitarian disaster, governments across the region have responded with a marked expansion of social protection measures. These, however, vary greatly with regard to speed, breadth, and sufficiency. People cannot stay at home if they cannot feed their families. Governments recognised at varying speeds that income assistance measures are central to an effective epidemiological strategy. Both the lockdown measures and the associated economic crises have highlighted the gaps in existing social protections in Latin America, as half of the region's employed population works in the informal sector. Many of these workers lost their income virtually overnight. To cover the needs of informal workers, the most effective governments established relatively inclusive eligibility criteria for cash assistance that allowed low-income households to self-identify and apply. The result is an extended registry that has expanded state capacity, on which further social protection policies can build. The region's two largest economies, Mexico and Brazil, have both suffered high pandemic-related infection and mortality rates, but sharply differ in their social policy approach. The left-wing Mexican government stands out for not establishing any nationwide cash assistance programme in the wake of COVID-19. By contrast, Brazil underwent a massive, opposition-driven expansion of social protection coverage, which eventually boosted the right-wing government's approval ratings among the poor. This year's Nobel Peace Prize awarded to the World Food Programme on 9 October recognizes the fundamental human need for sustenance. The social protection floors that were established ad hoc in the course of the COVID-19 crisis in Latin America need to now be extended to ensure that families can continue to feed themselves. The policy expansion efforts of the crisis could be used as an opportunity to overcome the deficiencies of Latin America's social security schemes and to build a more universal social protection floor for the longer term.","output":"Social Policy Responses to the COVID-19 Crisis and the Road Ahead"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Model-based approach is recognized as a tool to make drug development more productive and to better support regulatory and therapeutic decisions. The objective of this study was to develop a novel model-based methodology based on the response surface analysis and a nonlinear optimizer algorithm to maximize the clinical performances of drug treatments. The treatment response was described using a drug-disease model accounting for multiple components such as the dosage regimen, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of a drug (including the mechanism and the rate of drug delivery), and the exposure-response relationship. Then, the clinical benefit of a treatment was defined as a function of the diseases and the clinical endpoints and was estimated as a function of the target pharmacodynamic endpoints used to evaluate the treatment effect. A case study is presented to illustrate how the treatment performances of paliperidone extended release (ER) and paliperidone long-acting injectable (LAI) can be improved. A convolution-based approach was used to characterize the pharmacokinetics of ER and LAI paliperidone. The drug delivery properties and the dosage regimen maximizing the clinical benefit (defined as the target level of D2 receptor occupancy) were estimated using a nonlinear optimizer. The results of the analysis indicated that a substantial improvement in clinical benefit (from 15% to 27% for the optimization of the in vivo release and from 30% to 70% for the optimization of dosage regimen) was obtained when optimal strategies were deployed either for optimizing the in vivo drug delivery properties of ER formulations or for optimizing the dosage regimen of LAI formulations.","output":"Response Surface Analysis and Nonlinear Optimization Algorithm for Maximization of Clinical Drug Performance: Application to Extended-Release and Long-Acting Injectable Paliperidone."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during human pregnancy may lead to severe fetal pathology and debilitating impairments in offspring. However, the majority of infections are subclinical and not associated with evident birth defects. Potentially detrimental life-long health outcomes in asymptomatic offspring evoke high concerns. Thus, animal models addressing sequelae in offspring may provide valuable information. To induce subclinical infection, we inoculated selected porcine fetuses at the mid-stage of development. Inoculation resulted in trans-fetal virus spread and persistent infection in the placenta and fetal membranes for two months. Offspring did not show congenital Zika syndrome (e.g., microcephaly, brain calcifications, congenital clubfoot, arthrogryposis, seizures) or other visible birth defects. However, a month after birth, a portion of offspring exhibited excessive interferon alpha (IFN-) levels in blood plasma in a regular environment. Most affected offspring also showed dramatic IFN- shutdown during social stress providing the first evidence for the cumulative impact of prenatal ZIKV exposure and postnatal environmental insult. Other eleven cytokines tested before and after stress were not altered suggesting the specific IFN- pathology. While brains from offspring did not have histopathology, lesions, and ZIKV, the whole genome expression analysis of the prefrontal cortex revealed profound sex-specific transcriptional changes that most probably was the result of subclinical in utero infection. RNA-seq analysis in the placenta persistently infected with ZIKV provided independent support for the sex-specific pattern of in utero-acquired transcriptional responses. Collectively, our results provide strong evidence that two hallmarks of fetal ZIKV infection, altered type I IFN response and molecular brain pathology can persist after birth in offspring in the absence of congenital Zika syndrome.","output":"Subclinical in utero Zika virus infection is associated with interferon alpha sequelae and sex-specific molecular brain pathology in asymptomatic porcine offspring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 is a pandemic disorder spreading rapidly worldwide. Most of the countries were affected by the COVID-19 during the year 2020. Demographic data are important to understand the impact of COVID-19 across the country and also provide information on an appropriate response, planning, and allocation of resources. This study aims to assess the demographic data of COVID-19 patients admitted and treated in a tertiary care hospital, Jaipur. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Jaipur. A total of 1149 patients' data like age, gender, area they belong to, duration of the treatment, etc., were collected from the medical records department (MRD) department between July 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020. The data were expressed as counts, number, and percentage (%). The data were analyzed using Excel software. Results: Out of 1149 patients, 70% were males and 30% were females, respectively, and mean  SD (standard deviation) of age was 44.23  3.57. Most of the cases were obtained from Jaipur 63%, Bikaner 5.4%, Ajmer 4.4%, Alwar 2.6%, Sawai Madhopur 2.6%, Dausa 2.3%, Nagaur 2.3%, Bharatpur 2.1%, and Karauli 1.7%, respectively, and remaining places reported <1.5% cases. Also 40 to 80 years age groups were most affected. About 32.4% mild, 55.7% moderate, and 11.8% severe cases were reported. Conclusions: More male patients were affected when compared with female patients. Age and other disease conditions have a positive correlation with COVID-19. Older people should take extra precautions and avoid going to markets, parties, etc., unless it is essential.

However, little is known about average gastric volumes comprising food, fluids and air. Although literature suggests a relevant risk of gastric insufflation when endotracheal intubation (ETI) is required in the pre-hospital setting, this assumption is still unproven. METHODS: Primary whole body computed tomographic (CT) studies of 315 major trauma patients admitted to our Level 1 Trauma Centre Salzburg during a 7-year period were retrospectively assessed. Gastric volumes were calculated employing a CT volume rendering software. Patients intubated in the pre-hospital setting by emergency physicians (PHI, N = 245) were compared with spontaneously breathing patients requiring ETI immediately after arrival in the emergency room (ERI, N = 70). RESULTS: The median (range) total gastric content and air volume was 402 (26C2401) and 94 (0C1902) mL in PHI vs. 466 (59C1915) and 120 (1C997) mL in ERI patients (p = .59 and p = .35). PHI patients were more severely injured when compared with the ERI group (injury severity score (ISS) 33 (9C75) vs. 25 (9C75); p = .004). Mortality was higher in the PHI vs. ERI group (26.8% vs. 8.6%, p = .001). When PHI and ERI patients were matched for sex, age, body mass index and ISS (N = 50 per group), total gastric content and air volume was 496 (59C1915) and 119 (0C997) mL in the PHI vs. 429 (36C1726) and 121 (4C1191) mL in the ERI group (p = .85 and p = .98). Radiologic findings indicative for aspiration were observed in 8.1% of PHI vs. 4.3% of ERI patients (p = .31). Gastric air volume in patients who showed signs of aspiration was 194 (0C1355) mL vs. 98 (1C1902) mL in those without pulmonary CT findings (p = .08). CONCLUSION: In major trauma patients, overall stomach volume deriving from food, fluids and air must be expected to be around 400C500 mL. Gastric dilation caused by air is common but not typically associated with pre-hospital airway management. The amount of air in the stomach seems to be associated with the risk of aspiration. Further studies, specifically addressing patients after difficult airway management situations are warranted.","output":"Computer tomographic assessment of gastric volume in major trauma patients: impact of pre-hospital airway management on gastric air"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The year 2020 was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing with it unprecedented advancements in the fields of healthcare and therapeutic interventions as well as in vaccine and drug development.

To address this challenge, using computational fluid dynamics, we conducted a systematic investigation of airborne transmission in a classroom equipped with a single horizontal unit ventilator (HUV) and evaluate the performance of a low-cost box fan air cleaner for risk mitigation. Our study shows that placing box fan air cleaners in the classroom results in a substantial reduction of airborne transmission risk across the entire space. The air cleaner can achieve optimal performance when placed near the asymptomatic patient. However, without knowing the location of the patient, the performance of the cleaner is optimal near the HUV with the air flowing downwards. In addition, we find that it is more efficient in reducing aerosol concentration and spread in the classroom by adding air cleaners in comparison with raising the flow rate of HUV alone. The number and placement of air cleaners need to be adjusted to maintain their efficacy for larger classrooms and to account for the thermal gradient associated with a human thermal plume and hot ventilation air during cold seasons.

The data of incidence rate and risk factors for RP event and the clinical features of RP patients may provide recommendations for virus containment and cases management for COVID-19. We prospectively collected and analyzed the epidemiological, clinical and virological data from 285 adult patients with COVID-19 and acquired their definite clinical outcome (getting PCR positive or not during post-discharge surveillance). By March 10, 27 (9.5%) discharged patients had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in their nasopharyngeal swab after a median duration of 70 days (IQR 50-80). Compared to first admission, RP patients generally had milder clinical symptoms, lower viral load, shorter length of stay and improved pulmonary conditions at readmission (p<0.05). Elder RP patients (&#8805; 60 years old) were more likely to be symptomatic compared to younger patients (7/8, 87.5% vs. 3/19, 18.8%, p = 0.001) at readmission.

The effects of the pandemic will likely have long-standing effects on the well-being of youth, and access to mental health care is even more critical during this time. For the past 5 years, TRAILS (Transforming Research into Action to Improve the Lives of Students) has been working throughout the state to increase utilization of evidence-based mental health practices among K-12 school mental health professionals (SMHPs). By leveraging SMHPs who are widely accessible to students, TRAILS seeks to improve youth access to effective mental health care and reduce current mental health inequities. In March 2020, TRAILS responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by developing a group manual designed to be delivered virtually by SMHPs to help students develop effective coping skills to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. TRAILS focuses on promoting use of CBT and mindfulness, as these skills are ideally suited for school-based delivery, and thus the new manual, Coping with COVID-19 (CC-19), was grounded in these modalities. This article will describe the design, development, and deployment of the CC-19 program to address the mental health needs of students in the context of the pandemic. Early acceptability and penetration data will also be discussed.","output":"Development of a Brief Group CBT Intervention to Reduce COVID-19-Related Distress Among School-Age Youth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As people all over the world are vulnerable to be affected by the COVID-19 virus, the automatic detection of such a virus is an important concern. The paper aims to detect and classify coronavirus using machine learning. To spot and identify coronavirus in CT-Lung screening and Computer-Aided diagnosis (CAD) system is projected to distinguish and classifies the COVID-19. By utilizing the clinical specimens obtained from the corona-infected patients with the help of some machine learning techniques like Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, K-means clustering, and Radial Basis Function. While some specialists believe that the RT-PCR test is the best option for diagnosing Covid-19 patients, others believe that CT scans of the lungs can be more accurate in diagnosing coronavirus infection, as well as being less expensive than the PCR test. The clinical specimens include serum specimens, respiratory secretions, and whole blood specimens. Overall, 15 factors are measured from these specimens as the result of the previous clinical examinations. The proposed CAD system consists of four phases starting with the CT lungs screening collection, followed by a pre-processing stage to enhance the appearance of the ground glass opacities (GGOs) nodules as they originally lock hazy with fainting contrast. A modified K-means algorithm will be used to detect and segment these regions. Finally, we will use the detected, infected areas that obtained in the detection phase with a scale of 50x50 and we will crop the solid false positives that seem to be GGOs as inputs and targets for the machine learning classifiers, here we will use a support vector machine (SVM) and Radial basis function (RBF).

Design, setting, participants, and outcome measuresA cross-sectional study was conducted between December 2020 and January 2021, involving 1382 respondents aged 18 years and above from all eight divisions in Bangladesh. We used multiple linear regression to identify sociodemographic predictors of risk perception and multiple logistic regression to determine the relationship between risk perception and preventive practice. ResultsLow risk perception regarding COVID-19 was present among one-fifth of the respondents (19.8%). Younger age, being male, low education, single marital status, and rural residence were significantly associated with a low perceived risk of COVID-19. Hand washing and wearing mask were practiced by 80% and 67% of respondents, respectively. A low prevalence was noticed for social distancing (31%), avoiding social gathering (31%), and covering face while coughing/sneezing (18%). Furthermore, respondents with a high risk perception were found to be more likely than those with a low risk perception to practice all recommended COVID-19 preventive behaviors-hand washing (OR=2.4, 95% CI=1.5, 3.7), mask use (OR=3.4, 95% CI=2.3, 5), social distancing (OR=3.7, 95% CI=2.4, 5.6), sanitizer use (OR=2.7, 95% CI=1.8, 4.1), avoiding gathering (OR=2.3, 95% CI=1.6, 3.5), avoid touching face and mouth (OR=2.8, 95% CI=1.5, 5.3), and covering mouth while coughing/sneezing (OR=7, 95% CI=3.6, 13.4). ConclusionConsiderable number of Bangladeshi adults had low risk perception and low practice of some vital COVID-19 preventive behaviors before the onset of second wave of corona.

METHODS: The online survey was conducted in nine European countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo, Italy, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain) in 4108 participants, aged 15-82 years. The survey took place 30 to 40 days after WHO declared COVID-19 pandemic state, from April 15th to May 3rd, 2020. RESULTS: The results have shown 30 minutes longer sleeping time, 50% longer physical inactivity time, 65% longer screen time, 43% shorter walking time, 24% shorter sport time and 37% longer physical work time. Additionally, body mass gains (0.3 kg) could be explained in 20.6% with meals sizes, unhealthy food consumption, screen time and sport time. Further, respondents reported more regular meals (44%) and healthier meals with less alcohol consumption and less smoking, which have been positive outcomes of home confinement. CONCLUSION: The findings draw attention to negative changes in everyday praxis (inactivity, body mass gain) after such a short period.

Regulatory Focus Theory (Higgins, 1998) proposes that people pursue their goals by having a focus on prevention (i.e., motivated by security) or promotion (i.e., motivated by pleasure). Prior research indicates that people focused on prevention (vs. promotion) are more likely to engage in health-protective behaviors, including sexual health behaviors, because they perceive more threats. Extending this reasoning to the sexual activity of single people during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a pre-registered longitudinal study (N = 174) examining the role of regulatory focus on peoples sexual behaviors. As hypothesized, results showed that single people who reported having a more prevention focus at the onset of the pandemic perceived greater threats caused by the pandemic two weeks later, which, in turn, predicted less frequent sexual activity and engagement in sex with fewer sexual partners the following two weeks. These effects were consistent even when controlling for promotion (i.e., pleasure motivations), personality, gender, and sexual orientation.

The biology and infectivity of the virus has been intensively studied in order to gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of virus-host cell interactions during infection. It is known that SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via its spike protein. Priming of the virus by specific proteases leads to viral entry via endocytosis and to the subsequent steps in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Sphingosine and ceramide belong to the sphingolipid family and are abundantly present in cell membranes. These lipids were recently shown to interfere with the uptake of virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 into epithelial cell lines and primary human nasal cells in culture. The mechanisms of action were partly different, as sphingosine blocked, whilst ceramide facilitated viral entry. Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) is vital for the generation of ceramide and functional inhibition of ASM by drugs like amitriptyline reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry into the epithelial cells. Recent data indicates that serum level of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a prognostic factor for COVID-2 severity. Further, stimulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) might also constrain the hyper-inflammatory conditions linked to SARS-CoV-2.

The evolving immunological significance of endolysosomal Ca(2+) signalling warrants further investigations to better characterize the roles of these channels in immunity in order to expand our knowledge about the pathology of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and develop endolysosomal Ca(2+) channels as viable biomarkers and therapeutic and preventive targets for remodelling the immune response.","output":"Deciphering the Role of Endolysosomal Ca(2+) Channels in Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Syringe services programs (SSPs) are essential to preventing injection drug use-related infections and overdose death among people who use drugs (PWUD).

To effectively support these programs, information is needed regarding SSPs' experiences adapting their services and the challenges posed by COVID-19. We conducted qualitative interviews with leadership and staff from a sample of 31 U.S. SSPs. Respondents discussed urgent concerns including reduced reach of services, suspended HIV/hepatitis C testing, high COVID-19 risk among PWUD, and negative impacts of isolation on overdose and mental health. They also noted opportunities to improve future services for PWUD, including shifting to evidence-based distribution practices and maintaining regulatory changes that increased access to opioid use disorder medications post-pandemic. Findings can inform efforts to support SSPs in restoring and expanding services, and provide insight into SSPs' role in engaging PWUD during the COVID-19 response and future emergencies.","output":"Program Adaptations to Provide Harm Reduction Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study of Syringe Services Programs in the U.S"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We examined whether diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious complication of type 1 diabetes (T1D) was more prevalent among Non-Hispanic (NH) Black and Hispanic patients with T1D and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 compared to NH Whites. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study of patients with T1D and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 52 clinical sites in the US, data was collected April - August 2020. We examined the distribution of patient factors and DKA events across NH White, NH Black, and Hispanic race/ethnicity groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the odds of DKA among NH Black and Hispanic patients with T1D as compared to NH White patients, adjusting for potential confounders, such as age, sex, insurance, and last HbA1c. RESULTS: We included 180 patients with T1D and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the analysis. Forty-four percent (n=79) were NH White, 31% (n=55) NH Black, 26% (n=46) Hispanic. NH Blacks and Hispanics had higher median HbA1c than Whites ((%-points) [IQR]:11.7[4.7], p<0.001, and 9.7[3.1] vs. 8.3[2.4], p=0.01). We found that more NH Black and Hispanic presented with DKA compared to Whites (55% and 33% vs. 13%, p<0.001 and p=0.008, respectively). After adjusting for potential confounders, NH Black patients continued to have greater odds of presenting with DKA compared with NH Whites (OR [95%CI]: 3.7 [1.4,10.6]). CONCLUSION: We found that among T1D patients with COVID-19 infection, NH Blacks were more likely to present in DKA compared with NH White patients.

The Texas-Wide Premedical Mentoring Program (TPMP) was established to pair medical student mentors in Texas with medical school applicants attending Texas colleges and universities. Our objective was to demonstrate the effect of the TPMP on application preparedness and self-reported mental health outcomes of program participants. A survey was developed to understand the program's impact on both mentees and mentors. Participants were sent a survey link 3 months after the TPMP launch. In total, 313 participants, comprising 62% premedical student mentees and 38% medical student mentors, completed the survey. Mentees reported a significantly positive effect of the program on anxiety, uncertainty of acceptance, connection to medicine, and making the road to medical school seem less impossible. After participation, mentees felt less alone and reported a positive impact on their perception of the application process. The TPMP positively impacted the mental wellness of both mentees and mentors, and about 80% of mentors felt more fulfilled despite not participating in clinical duties in light of suspensions. In conclusion, program participation was associated with decreasing application knowledge gaps, easing anxiety, and providing alliance for mentees. The TPMP had a similarly positive influence on the mental wellness of mentees and mentors as well as contributed to medical student mentors' sense of fulfillment.","output":"Impact of the Texas-Wide Premedical Mentoring Program during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An online survey was conducted to identify factors associated with financial insecurity, food insecurity and poor quality of daily lives of adults in Nigeria during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Determining which patients are at high risk of severe illness or mortality is essential for appropriate clinical decision making. We propose a novel severity score specifically for COVID-19 to help predict disease severity and mortality. 4711 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. We derived a risk model using the first half of the cohort (n = 2355 patients) by logistic regression and bootstrapping methods. The discriminative power of the risk model was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). The severity score was validated in a second half of 2356 patients. Mortality incidence was 26.4% in the derivation cohort and 22.4% in the validation cohort. A COVID-19 severity score ranging from 0 to 10, consisting of age, oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure, blood urea nitrogen, C-Reactive protein, and the international normalized ratio was developed. A ROC curve analysis was performed in the derivation cohort achieved an AUC of 0.824 (95% CI 0.814-0.851) and an AUC of 0.798 (95% CI 0.789-0.818) in the validation cohort. Furthermore, based on the risk categorization the probability of mortality was 11.8%, 39% and 78% for patient with low (0-3), moderate (4-6) and high (7-10) COVID-19 severity score.

The contribution of public spaces to the propa- gation of SARS-CoV-2 can be reduced to a level necessary for a declining epidemic, i.e. an overall reproduction rate below one. Here, we revisit the quantitative assessment of indoor and outdoor transmission risk. We show that the long-range aerosol transmission is controlled by the flow rate of fresh air and by the mask filtering quality, and is quantitatively re- lated to the CO2 concentration, regardless the room volume and the num- ber of people. The short-range airborne transmission is investigated ex- perimentally using dedicated dispersion experiments performed in two shopping malls. Exhaled aerosols are dispersed by turbulent draughts in a cone, leading to a concentration inversely proportional to the squared dis- tance and to the flow velocity. We show that the average infection dose, called the viral quantum, can be determined from epidemiological data in a manner consistent with biological experimental data. Practical implications. The results provide quantitative guidance useful for making rational public health policy decisions to prevent the dominant routes of viral transmission through reinforced ventilation, air purification, mechanical dispersion using fans, and incentivizing the wear- ing of correctly fitted, quality facial masks (surgical masks, possibly cov- ered by another fabric mask, or non-medical FFP2 masks).

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the changes in poisoning cases regarding distribution, types, and characteristics for better framing and planning of the role of our field in responding to pandemics. METHODS Study of telephone consultation calls and toxicology analysis records of poisoning cases referred to the Dammam Poison Control Center in Saudi Arabia during the first half of 2020. Their distribution according to frequencies, causes, and other characteristics was compared to the first half of 2019. RESULTS Analysis of telephone consultation calls revealed that the proportion of exposure to disinfectants and hand sanitizers during first half of 2020 increased to 20.4% (n = 496) and 3.4% (n = 83), respectively, compared to 9.8% (n = 215) and 0.4% (n = 10) for surface disinfectants and hand sanitizers, respectively, during the first half of 2019. In 2020, exposure to disinfectants and hand sanitizers dominated in preschool children (0-5 years). The total number of cases suspected for drugs/drugs of abuse overdose during the first 6 months of 2020 (n = 783) showed a significant decrease (P < 0.001) compared to the first 6 months of 2019 (n = 1086). CONCLUSION The increased availability and use of disinfectants and sanitizers significantly increased the risk of poisoning, especially in preschool-aged children.

Different process configurations were evaluated and compared, including separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) with cellulase recycle and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) in batch and fed-batch mode. At low enzyme loading, the highest lipid concentration of 26.74 g L(?1) was reached in fed-batch SSF fed with 2.5% (g g(?1)) substrate. Batch SHF was conducted for four rounds with recycling the cellulase adsorbed on unhydrolyzed lignocellulosic biomass. Thirty percent of cellulase saving was achieved for rounds 2C4 without compromising productivity and lipid yield. The addition of Tween 80 to lignocellulosic slurry improved the hydrolysis rate of structural carbohydrates in pretreated lignocellulosic biomass.

Prostate cancer (PCa) services across the globe have been on hold due to changing medical and surgical priorities. There is also epidemiological evidence that PCa patients have increased incidence and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection due to gender differences, age, and higher propensity for risk factors (eg, respiratory disease, obesity, hypertension, and smoking status). Objective To contribute to the emerging body of knowledge on the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection to PCa patients and, in the face of PCa treatment delays, provide evidence-based recommendations for ongoing management of specific PCa patient groups. Evidence acquisition A literature search was performed using all sources (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Libraries, and Web of Science) as well as the media to harness emerging data on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and its influence on PCa. Eligibility criteria were originality of data and relevance to PCa management. The authors note that during these unprecedented times, retrospective data are constantly being updated from multiple sources globally. Evidence synthesis A total of 72 articles and data sources were found initially. Owing to repetition, lack of originality, or nonrelevance, six articles were rejected, leaving 23 retrospective studies, seven basic science research articles, 15 societal and journal guidelines, and 21 epidemiological data sources, from countries at different stages of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These were analyzed qualitatively to produce evidence-based guidelines for the management of PCa patients at different stages of the patient journey, with strategies to reduce the risk of viral spread. Conclusions PCa patients may have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as morbidity and mortality if infected. Once appropriately triaged, and to reduce viral spread, PCa patients can have surveillance by telemedicine, and institute lifestyle changes and social quarantining measures. If risk stratification suggests that treatment should be planned, androgen deprivation therapy can be started, or potentially surgery or radiation therapy is possible on a case-by-case basis.

They are important sources for the isolation, purification and characterization of natural compounds, including peptides with various functions. Innate immune antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play a critical role in warding off invading pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses. They may also have other biological functions such as endotoxin neutralization, chemotaxis, anti-inflammation, and wound healing. This article documents a bioinformatic analysis of over 1000 amphibian antimicrobial peptides registered in the Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD) in the past 18 years. These anuran peptides were discovered in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and America from 1985 to 2019. Genomic and peptidomic studies accelerated the discovery pace and underscored the necessity in establishing criteria for peptide entry into the APD. A total of 99.9% of the anuran antimicrobial peptides are less than 50 amino acids with an average length of 24 and a net charge of +2.5. Interestingly, the various amphibian peptide families (e.g., temporins, brevinins, esculentins) can be connected through multiple length-dependent relationships. With an increase in length, peptide net charge increases, while the hydrophobic content decreases. In addition, glycine, leucine, lysine, and proline all show linear correlations with peptide length. These correlations improve our understanding of amphibian peptides and may be useful for prediction and design of new linear peptides with potential applications in treating infectious diseases, cancer and diabetes.","output":"Bioinformatic Analysis of 1000 Amphibian Antimicrobial Peptides Uncovers Multiple Length-Dependent Correlations for Peptide Design and Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), many studies have been published to determine the spectrum of illness, risk factors, prevention, and treatment strategies Due to relatively fewer cases among children as compared to adults, there is a paucity of clinical data available to fully understand the risk factors and disease course in the pediatric population Our understanding is evolving with limited data showing an increased risk of severe or critical disease in children less than one year of age and those with certain underlying medical conditions Recognition of emerging risk factors for morbidity and mortality is now paramount, to anticipate and provide appropriate clinical care specific to the pediatric population Obesity has only recently been identified as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease in children Case reports such as this are essential in understanding the pathophysiologic association, associated disease severity, and clinical outcome attributed to obesity and COVID-19 infections in children","output":"Obesity as a Risk Factor for Severe Illness From COVID-19 in the Pediatric Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Korea, the number of admissions to nursing colleges has greatly increased over the past 20 years to address the shortage of nurses.

Continued warming will be accompanied by changes in precipitation, which will vary across the country and seasons, and by increasing climate variability and extreme weather events. Climate change will likely drive the emergence of infectious diseases in Canada by northward spread from the United States and introduction from elsewhere in the world via air and sea transport. Diseases endemic to Canada are also likely to re-emerge. This special issue describes key infectious disease risks associated with climate change. These include emergence of tick-borne diseases in addition to Lyme disease, the possible introduction of exotic mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue, more epidemics of Canada-endemic vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus, and increased incidence of foodborne illnesses. Risk is likely to be compounded by an aging population affected by chronic diseases, which results in greater sensitivity to infectious diseases.

However, water contaminated with pathogenic bacteria or thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) will not achieve the SDG target of clean water in the lives of people around the world. The aim of this study is to assess the water quality parameters of basic water services in Amhara and Afar regions of Ethiopia as well as the role and importance of local managerial committees in ensuring basic water functionality. METHODS: This mixed methods research, conducted in January-June 2019, sampled 22 districts from food-insecure areas in the Amhara and Afar regions of Ethiopia. From the 22 districts, which represent nearly one third of all districts in each region, 111 water services classified as basic were randomly selected. For each selected water service, research included: water quality sample testing, visual observation of water services, interviews and focus group discussions with the associated water managerial committee members. Descriptive statistics frequency, percent, mean, median, standard deviations, normal tables, cross-tables and graphs are used to present the data. RESULTS: Although the international water standard for thermotolerant coliform (TTC) levels is 0 CFU/100ml, in our sample of 111 water services, the maximum TTC counts were 71 CFU/100 ml and the mean was 4 CFU/100 ml. Thermotolerant coliform counts were above the permissible standard values for nearly 40% (n = 111) of the basic water services. TTC was detected in 44 (39.64%) (n = 111) basic water services. Of these, 38 (34.23%) were operationally functional while 6 (5.41%) were not functional. Approximately one third of the basic water services sampled, deemed functional by international standards, do not provide potable water due to thermotolerant coliform (TTC) levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings from the Amhara and Afar regions of Ethiopia demonstrate that water quality parameters are not currently considered in classifying basic water services. This suggests that international efforts to address SDG 6 should incorporate water quality as a key parameter to better track international progress toward clean water and sanitation efforts. We discuss two potential pathways for stronger inclusion of water quality parameters in international definitions: (1) to mandate water quality within functional and non-functional definitions or (2) to add a ladder rung titled safe basic water services to the international drinking water ladder. Our findings from Ethiopia suggest that additional research should be undertaken in development contexts to assess whether or not functional basic water services provide safe drinking water to users.","output":"The importance of water quality in classifying basic water services: The case of Ethiopia, SDG6.1, and safe drinking water"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between performing remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic and the level of job and life satisfaction, as well as the assumed, intermediary role of the level of perceived stress and such resources as self-efficacy and self-esteem.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if depressive symptoms are associated with greater likelihood of believing vaccine-related misinformation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study analyzed responses from 2 waves of a 50-state nonprobability internet survey conducted between May and July 2021, in which depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9). Survey respondents were aged 18 and older. Population-reweighted multiple logistic regression was used to examine the association between moderate or greater depressive symptoms and endorsement of at least 1 item of vaccine misinformation, adjusted for sociodemographic features. The association between depressive symptoms in May and June, and new support for misinformation in the following wave was also examined. EXPOSURES: Depressive symptoms. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was endorsing any of 4 common vaccine-related statements of misinformation. RESULTS: Among 15 464 survey respondents (9834 [63.6%] women and 5630 [36.4%] men; 722 Asian respondents [4.7%], 1494 Black respondents [9.7%], 1015 Hispanic respondents [6.6%], and 11 863 White respondents [76.7%]; mean [SD] age, 47.9 [17.5] years), 4164 respondents (26.9%) identified moderate or greater depressive symptoms on the PHQ-9, and 2964 respondents (19.2%) endorsed at least 1 vaccine-related statement of misinformation. Presence of depression was associated with increased likelihood of endorsing misinformation (crude odds ratio [OR], 2.33; 95% CI, 2.09-2.61; adjusted OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.91-2.43). Respondents endorsing at least 1 misinformation item were significantly less likely to be vaccinated (crude OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.36-0.45; adjusted OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.40-0.51) and more likely to report vaccine resistance (crude OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 2.21-2.91; adjusted OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 2.89-3.13). Among 2809 respondents who answered a subsequent survey in July, presence of depression in the first survey was associated with greater likelihood of endorsing more misinformation compared with the prior survey (crude OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.42-2.75; adjusted OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.14-2.33). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This survey study found that individuals with moderate or greater depressive symptoms were more likely to endorse vaccine-related misinformation, cross-sectionally and at a subsequent survey wave.

Nevertheless, real knowledge of gluten and GF-related implications for health is still poor among the general population. The GFD has also been suggested for non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCG/WS), a clinical entity characterized by intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms induced by gluten ingestion in the absence of celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA). NCG/WS should be regarded as an umbrella term including a variety of different conditions where gluten is likely not the only factor responsible for triggering symptoms.

It is anticipated that there will be a substantive fraction of patients who will be contagious, but asymptomatic at the time of surgery. Use multimodal perioperative infection control practices (e.g., including patient decontamination) and monitor performance (e.g., S. aureus transmission from patient to the environment). The consequence of COVID-19 is that such processes are more important than ever to follow because infection affects not only patients but the surgery center staff and surgeons. Dedicate most operating rooms to procedures that are not airway aerosol producing and can be performed without general anesthesia. Increase throughput by performing nerve blocks before patients enter the operating rooms. Bypass the phase I post-anesthesia care unit whenever possible by appropriate choices of anesthetic approach and drugs. Plan long-duration workdays (e.g., 12-h). For cases where the surgical procedure does not cause aerosol production, but general anesthesia will be used, have initial (phase I) post-anesthesia recovery in the operating room where the surgery was done. Use anesthetic practices that achieve fast initial recovery of the brief ambulatory cases. When the surgical procedure causes aerosol production (e.g., bronchoscopy), conduct phase I recovery in the operating room and use multimodal environmental decontamination after each case. Use statistical methods to plan for the resulting long turnover times. Whenever possible, have the anesthesia and nursing teams stagger cases in more than one room so that they are doing one surgical case while the other room is being cleaned. In conclusion, this review shows that COVID-19 will markedly affect daily ambulatory workflow for patients undergoing general anesthesia, with potentially substantial economic impact for some surgical specialties.","output":"Strategies for daily operating room management of ambulatory surgery centers following resolution of the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main element of personal protective equipment against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are masks, which protect against droplets and aerosols that can remain suspended in the air.

METHODS: We collected 16 233 SARS-CoV-2 IgG serum samples from June 8 through July 10, 2020, from a convenience sample of Illinois- and Wisconsin-based adult health care workers. The research team, in collaboration with ACL Laboratories, used a SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Study data included SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay results and demographic characteristics of workers (age, sex, race, ethnicity, clinical role, zip code). We generated crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) to describe disparities in seroprevalence distribution among demographic and social factors. RESULTS: Of 16 233 IgG serum samples tested, 622 (3.8%) test results were positive for SARS-CoV-2. We found significant disparities in SARS-CoV-2 positivity by age, race, ethnicity, and clinical role. Participants aged 32-82 had lower adjusted ORs (aORs) of positive IgG than participants aged 18-31 (aOR range, 0.54-0.66).

We conducted meta-analysis to assess the early hemostatic parameters in retrospective studies in association with severity of infection. MethodsOvid, PubMed, Web of Sciences, and Google Scholar were searched for research articles that addressed clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients and disease severity. Results were filtered using exclusion and inclusion criteria and then pooled into a meta-analysis to estimate the standardized mean difference with 95% CI for each of five coagulation parameters (D-dimers, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, platelets count, activated partial thromboplastin time). Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. To explore the heterogeneity and robustness of our fundings, sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted. Publication bias was assessed with contour-enhanced funnel plots and Egger test by linear regression. ResultsOverall, 41 original studies (17601 patients) on SARS-CoV2 were included. For the two groups of patients, stratified by severity, we identified that D-dimers, fibrinogen, activated partial thromboplastin time, and prothrombin time were significantly higher in the severe group (SMD 0.6985 with 95%CI [0.5155; 0.8815]); SMD 0.661with 95%CI [0.3387; 0.9833]; SMD 0.2683 with 95%CI [0.1357; 0.4009]; SMD 0.284 with 95%CI [0.1472; 0.4208]). In contrast, PLT was significantly lower in patients with more severe cases of COVID-19 (SMD -0.1684 with 95%CI [-0.2826; -0.0542]). Neither the analysis by the leave-one-out method nor the influence diagnostic have identified studies that solely cause significant change in the effect size estimates. Subgroup analysis showed no significant difference between articles originated from different countries but revealed that severity assessment criteria might have influence over estimated effect sizes for platelets and D-dimers. Contour-enhanced funnel plots and the Egger test for D-dimers and fibrinogen revealed significant asymmetry that might be a sign of publication bias. ConclusionsThe standard coagulation laboratory parameters with exception of platelets counts are significantly elevated in patients with severe COVID-19. However, fibrinolysis shutdown requires evaluation outside conventional coagulation tests and analysis of additional specific markers related to clotting formation and PLT characteristics. We hypothesize that a proportion and parameters of immature reticulated platelets may serve as additional biomarkers for prediction of adverse events.","output":"Meta-analysis of coagulation disbalances in COVID-19: 41 studies and 17601 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The yeast Pichia pastoris is a cost-effective and easily scalable system for recombinant protein production.

Beyond isolated efforts (from sidewalk widenings to car-free Open Streets), there is a need for a large-scale and quantitative strategy for cities to handle the challenges that COVID-19 poses in the use of public space. The main obstacle is a generalized lack of publicly available data on sidewalk infrastructure worldwide, and thus city governments have not yet benefited from a complex systems approach of treating urban sidewalks as networks. Here, we leverage sidewalk geometries from ten cities in three continents, to first analyze sidewalk and roadbed geometries, and find that cities most often present an arrogant distribution of public space: imbalanced and unfair with respect to pedestrians. Then, we connect these geometries to build a sidewalk network --adjacent, but not assimilable to road networks, so fertile in urban science. In a no-intervention scenario, we apply percolation theory to examine whether the sidewalk infrastructure in cities can withstand the tight pandemic social distancing imposed on our streets. The resulting collapse of sidewalk networks, often at widths below three meters, calls for a cautious strategy, taking into account the interdependencies between a city's sidewalk and road networks, as any improvement for pedestrians comes at a cost for motor transport. With notable success, we propose a shared-effort heuristic that delays the sidewalk connectivity breakdown, while preserving the road network's functionality.","output":"Planning for sustainable Open Streets in pandemic cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is great variability in clinical presentation of COVID-19 worldwide.

RESULTS: Mean values of random blood sugar, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, serum ferritin, erythrocyte-sedimentation rate, LDH, CRP, D-dimer levels, and blood pressure were significantly higher in obese patients (165.6, 129.5, 105, 1,873, 26, 403, 56.45, 977.16 and 142/87, respectively) than in normal-weight (97.2, 103.5, 70.4, 479, 17.4, 252, 23.2, 612.4, and 118.6/76.8, respectively) and overweight patients (111.4, 106.3, 78.13, 491.3, 19.8, 269.27, 25.42, 618.4, and 120.3/79.3, respectively). Lymphopenia was also significantly predominant in the obese group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that elevated serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, low densityClipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, ferritin, CRP, and low relative lymphocyte count were significant risk factors in obese COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Obesity and its related complications increase the risk of presenting a more severe form of COVID-19 in Egyptian patients.","output":"Impact of Obesity and Its Associated Comorbid Conditions on COVID-19 Presentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has ravaged the world, resulting in an alarming number of infections and deaths, and the number continues to increase.

Due to the lack of effective treatments, different strategies and treatment methods are still being researched, with the use of vaccines to make the body immune becoming the most effective means of prevention. Antiviral drugs and respiratory support are often used clinically as needed, but are not yet sufficient to alleviate the cytokine storm (CS) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. How to neutralize the cytokine storm and inhibit excessive immune cell activation becomes the key to treating neocoronavirus pneumonia. Immunotherapy through the application of hormones and monoclonal antibodies can alleviate the immune imbalance, but the clinical effectiveness and side effects remain controversial.

We developed an efficient saliva RNA extraction method and combined it with an ultrasensitive antibody test based on single molecule array (Simoa) technology. We apply our test to the saliva of patients who presented to the hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, some of whom tested positive with a conventional RT-qPCR nasopharyngeal swab test. We demonstrate that combining viral RNA detection by RT-qPCR with antibody detection by Simoa identifies more patients as infected than either method alone.

Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7%), followed by lung (11.4%), colorectal (10.0 %), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (5.6%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18%), followed by colorectal (9.4%), liver (8.3%), stomach (7.7%), and female breast (6.9%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2-fold to 3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2-fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64% to 95%) versus transitioned (32% to 56%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy.

We aimed to identify the pattern of substance use among high school students and its relationship with psychosocial factors. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: The study was conducted in Oct 2019 among students in the senior secondary school in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State; southwestern Nigeria. Participants were selected using random sampling, and data were collected using a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Kessler Psychological distress scale and an adapted version of the NIDA-Modified ASSIST. Bivariate analysis and multiple logistic regression were carried out to identify factors associated with psychological distress. RESULTS: Overall, 682 students participated in the study. The lifetime and current prevalence of any substance were 17.3% (95% CI: 14.7%, 20.5%) and 11.7% (95% CI: 9.0, 14.0), respectively. Although most substance use variables increases the risk of psychological distress, history of lifetime substance use AOR= 3.03 (95% CI: 1.19, 7.72, P=0.020) and absence of direct parental care AOR=2.04 (1.19, 3.48, P=0.009) significantly increases the risk of experiencing psychological distress.

One of the postulated mechanisms for this high fatality rate is the possible abundance of ACE type 2 receptor in the cardiovascular system that strongly binds with the spike protein of COVID-19 and helps internalise into the cell resulting in acute cardiac injury (ACI). More than 7% of cases with COVID-19 are reported to have this type of ACI.

Adherence to the MD was assessed through the Medi-Lite score. The percentage of UPF in the diet was 16.4% corresponding to 299 g of UPF per day. These amounts were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in men than in women and came mainly from ready-to-eat meals or pre-packaged bread, bread alternatives, pizza, frozen potato chips (24.5% of total UPF intake), pre-packaged biscuits and sweets (20.7%), soft drinks (15.8%), and dairy products such as flavored yogurt (12%). As to the MD adherence, a significant inverse association between the Medi-Lite score and the percentage of UPF in the diet (R = ?0.35; p < 0.001) was observed. Participants with a low adherence to the MD had a significantly higher contribution of UPF in the diet (22.2%) compared to those with a moderate (16.2%) and high (12.6%) adherence.

Fatigue and recovery models of muscles are essential in understanding the accumulation and the reduction in muscle fatigue for forceful exertion tasks. This study aims to explore the onset of muscle fatigue under different work/rest arrangements during manual demolition tasks and the offset of fatigue over time after the tasks were performed. An experiment, including a muscle fatigue test and a muscle fatigue recovery test, was performed. Seventeen male adults without experience in demolition hammer operation were recruited as human participants. Two demolition hammers (large and small) were adopted. The push force was either 20 or 40 N. The posture mimicked that of a demolition task on a wall. In the muscle fatigue test, the muscle strength (MS) before and after the demolition task, maximum endurance time (MET), and the Borg category-ratio-10 (CR-10) ratings of perceived exertion after the demolition task were measured. In the muscle fatigue recovery test, MS and CR-10 at times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 min were recorded. Statistical analyses were performed to explore the influence of push force and the weight of the tool on MS, MET, and CR-10. Both muscle fatigue models and muscle fatigue recovery models were established and validated. The results showed that push force affected MET significantly (p < 0.05). The weight of the tool was significant (p < 0.05) only on the CR-10 rating after the first pull. During the muscle fatigue recovery test, the MS increase and the CR-10 decrease were both significant (p < 0.05) after one or more breaks. Models of MET and MS prediction were established to assess muscle fatigue recovery, respectively. The absolute (AD) and relative (RD) deviations of the MET model were 1.83 (1.94) min and 34.80 (31.48)%, respectively. The AD and RD of the MS model were 1.39 (0.81) N and 1.9 (1.2)%, respectively.

We have computationally evaluated the binding of different classes of RBD targeted antibodies, namely, CB6 (etesevimab), REGN10933 (casirivimab), S309 (sotrovimab), and S2X259 to the omicron mutation-induced RBD. Molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations unveil the binding affinity and stability of the antibody-RBD complexes. All the four antibodies show reduced binding affinity towards the omicron RBD. The therapeutic antibody CB6 aka etesevimab was substantially affected due to numerous omicron mutations occurring in its target epitope.

Reasons given by patients who declined to use video visits were documented, and demographic information was collected from all patients. Surveys were used to assess the levels of satisfaction of treating physicians and patients who agreed to video visits. RESULTS: Of 1,762 patients with cancer who were offered telehealth video visits, 1,477 (83.8%) participated. The patients who declined participation were older (67.7 v 60.2 years; P < .0001), lived in significantly lower-income areas (P = .0021), and were less likely to have commercial insurance (P < .0001) than patients who participated. Most participating patients (92.6%) were satisfied with telehealth video visits. A majority of physicians (65.2%) were also satisfied with its use, and 74% indicated that they would likely use telemedicine in the future. Primary concerns that physicians had in using this technology were inadequate patient interactions and acquisition of medical data, increased potential for missing significant clinical findings, decreased quality of care, and potential medical liability.
