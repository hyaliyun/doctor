Telemedicine can provide both the highest level of patient satisfaction and the lowest risk of infection during a pandemic. The factors associated with its usage and patient adherence are not visible in Bangladeshs resource-constrained settings. Therefore, this study aimed to identify perceptions about telemedicine among populations with chronic diseases amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A closed-ended self-reported questionnaire was created, and the questionnaire was written, reviewed, and finalized by a public health investigator, a psychiatrist, and an epidemiologist. The data for this study were collected from individuals using simple random sampling and snowball sampling techniques. Ethics approval was granted, and written/verbal consent was taken before interviews. Most of the participants showed a positive attitude towards telemedicine. People aged 35C54 years old and a higher level of education were less frequently associated with willingness to receive telemedicine services for current chronic disease (WRTCCD) than their counterparts. People living in urban areas and lower-income participants were more strongly associated with WRTCCD. Additionally, people who did not lose their earnings due to the pandemic were less strongly associated with WRTCCD. However, the main strength of this research is that it is a broad exploration of patient interest in several general forms of telehealth.

The ability of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological tests to detect NAbs has not been widely reported. We sought to correlate the antibodies detected by an automated chemiluminescent immunoassay with NAbs. METHODS: Residual serum samples from 35 patients that had a positive antibody test using the LIAISON? SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG chemiluminescent immunoassay and two antibody-negative control sera were tested for NAbs using a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). RESULTS: NAbs were detected in 66% (23/35) of the antibody-positive samples. The immunoassay signal value ranged from 21.7 to 131.3 AU/mL (median, 90.5) with significant correlation between it and the PRNT (r = 0.61, p = 0.002). In the samples without NAbs, the immunoassay signal ranged from 16.3 to 66.2 AU/mL (median, 27.2). An immunoassay signal cutoff of > 41 AU/mL was 91% sensitive and 92% specific for the detection of NAbs. DISCUSSION: It is important that correlates of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 be identified and NAbs are considered to be central indicators of such. PRNT is the gold-standard test for identifying NAbs but it cannot be used for large-scale testing of populations.

METHOD: This international multi-centre cohort study included patients undergoing elective surgery for 10 solid cancer types, without preoperative suspicion of SARS-CoV-2. Participating hospitals included patients from local emergence of SARS-CoV-2 until 19 April 2020. At the time of surgery, hospitals were defined as having a COVID-19 free surgical pathway (complete segregation of the operating theatre, critical care, and inpatient ward areas) or no defined pathway (incomplete or no segregation, areas shared with COVID-19 patients). The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative pulmonary complications. RESULTS: Of 9171 patients from 447 hospitals in 55 countries, 2481 were operated in COVID-19 free surgical pathways. After adjustment, pulmonary complication rates were lower with COVID-19 free surgical pathways (2.2% versus 4.9%, OR: 0.62 [0.44-0.86]). This was consistent in sensitivity analyses and a propensity-score matched model. The postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was also lower in COVID-19 free surgical pathways (2.1% versus 3.6%; OR 0.53 [0.36-0.76]).

At the time this clinical trial was planned, there were no available vaccine or therapeutic agents with proven efficacy, but the severity of the condition prompted the use of several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. It has long been hypothesized that the use of convalescent plasma (CP) from infected patients who have developed an effective immune response is likely to be an option for the treatment of patients with a variety of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) of viral etiology. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma in adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS/DESIGN: The ConPlas-19 study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label controlled trial. The study has been planned to include 278 adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infection not requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive). Subjects are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (139 per treatment arm), stratified by center, to receive intravenously administered CP (single infusion) plus SOC or SOC alone, and are to be followed for 30 days. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients that progress to category 5, 6, or 7 (on the 7-point ordinal scale proposed by the WHO) at day 15. Interim analyses for efficacy and/or futility will be conducted once 20%, 40%, and 60% of the planned sample size are enrolled and complete D15 assessment.

The study aimed to clarify the effectiveness of Telepsychiatry, providing an evidence base for the growing use of Telepsychiatry. METHOD: The authors searched three databases - Cochrane, PubMed and PsychINFO - using the terms virtual consultation/telepsychiatry/video consultation AND psychiatry/mental illness. The authors excluded all papers that were not in English and that did not focus on the psychiatric consultation. RESULT: 961 papers were identified, reduced to 321 using exclusion criteria and removal of duplicates. Using thematic analysis the authors found five themes that occurred across all papers in relation to the effectiveness of Telepsychiatry. Patient & Clinician Satisfaction There is consistently high patient satisfaction with telepsychiatry but lower clinician satisfaction, often as a result of cynicism and a lack of familiarity. Clinician satisfaction increases when clinicians trial Telepsychiatry and become more positive about its uses. Diagnostic Reliability Telepsychiatry was found to have high levels of inter-rater reliability equivalent to face-to-face consultations for common disorders including mood and psychotic disorders, substance misuse and dementia. It was also found to have high levels of diagnostic reliability across age groups. Outcomes Telepsychiatry has been found to reduce symptoms of common psychiatric disorders and improve quality of life in a variety of environments including emergency departments, inpatient units and prisons. Telepsychiatry increases access to specialised services resulting in quicker access to treatment and reduction in admissions. Technology Without adequate internet connectivity clinicians are unable to conduct an appropriate mental state examination and the therapeutic relationship becomes challenging. Inadequate technology can impact the effectiveness of Telepsychiatry amongst those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged and may not have access to appropriate technology. Professional Guidance There is a concerning lack of guidance around the use of Telepsychiatry. Without clear protocols there is a lack of standardisation and clinicians are unwilling to integrate Telepsychiatry into their practice. Main concerns raised are around confidentiality, consent, the appropriateness of certain patient groups and emergencies. CONCLUSION: This review found evidence for the effectiveness of Telepsychiatry with greatest emphasis on technology and patient satisfaction. The main barrier is the reluctance amongst clinicians to facilitate Telepsychiatry into their practice, often due to cynicism and a lack of familiarity. The authors recommend training in the uses of Telepsychiatry and the provision of professional guidance from medical bodies to allay concerns and provide clear standards.","output":"The effectiveness of telepsychiatry: a thematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the global report of COVID-19 cases is around 110 million, and more than 2.43 million related death cases as of February 18, 2021.

The aim of this study was to assess the differences between men and women in the main measures of infection and mortality by COVID-19, considering its temporal evolution, raising awareness about the weaknesses and contradictions between sources of information. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis based on the microdata on COVID cases notified by the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE), the Death Statistics of the National Statistical Institute (INE) and the estimates of excess mortality from the INE and the Daily Mortality Monitoring System (MoMo) microdata. Standardized rates, prevalences and and ratios by sex were calculated for each indicator. The percentage of excess mortality without COVID-19 diagnosis in each sex was calculated. Male/female ratios for symptoms and risk factors of COVID-19 were also calculated. RESULTS: The rate of infection by COVID-19 was higher in women in the three waves of the pandemic, reaching 65% of infections during April and May 2020. Complications were between 1.5 and 2.5 times higher in men, especially in ICU admissions, which were 2.5 times more frequent than in women. Although mortality rates and excess mortality were also higher in men (around 1.8 times), the percentage of excess mortality without COVID-19 diagnosis was higher in women (44% in men vs. 52% in women the first wave). With regard to the symptoms of COVID-19, fever, cough, and dyspnoea were more frequent in men (20%, 10% and 19% more, respectively) compared to sore throat, vomiting or diarrhea that were more prevalent in women (90%, 40% and 10% more, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The analysis disaggregated by sex has made it possible to identify differences between men and women in the diagnosis, presentation and severity of the COVID-19 that can help a better clinical and epidemiological approach to the disease. However, official sources present important gaps when presenting information disaggregated by sex. It is therefore necessary to advance in the inclusion of a gender perspective in the statistics on COVID-19, starting with a necessary but not sufficient condition such as the disaggregation by sex of the data.","output":"[COVID-19 and gender: certainties and uncertainties in monitoring the pandemic.]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 15, about 20,000,000 voters cast their vote for the first round of the 2020 French municipal elections.

We summarize here the results of studies, which used these technologies to investigate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in different organs. Studies with in vitro models of lung epithelia showed that alveolar epithelial type II cells, but not differentiated lung alveolar epithelial type I cells, are key targets of SARS-CoV-2, which triggers cell apoptosis and inflammation, while impairing surfactant production. Experiments with human small intestinal organoids and colonic organoids showed that the gastrointestinal tract is another relevant target for SARS-CoV-2. The virus can infect and replicate in enterocytes and cholangiocytes, inducing cell damage and inflammation. Direct viral damage was also demonstrated in in vitro models of human cardiomyocytes and choroid plexus epithelial cells. At variance, endothelial cells and neurons are poorly susceptible to viral infection, thus supporting the hypothesis that neurological symptoms and vascular damage result from the indirect effects of systemic inflammatory and immunological hyper-responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Disease Modelling Using Stem Cell Technology and Organoids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Disposal of sewage wastes is a problem of increasing magnitude in the United States.

This study aims to explore household medication practices by and for this population, identify practices that benefit or jeopardise medication safety and develop best practice guidance about household medication safety practices during a pandemic, grounded in individual experiences. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a descriptive qualitative study using semistructured interviews, by telephone or video call. People who have been advised to cocoon/shield and/or are aged 70 years or over and using at least one long-term medication, or their caregivers, will be eligible for inclusion. We will recruit 100 patient/carer participants: 50 from the UK and 50 from Ireland. Recruitment will be supported by our patient and public involvement (PPI) partners, personal networks and social media. Individual participant consent will be sought, and interviews audio/video recorded and/or detailed notes made. A constructivist interpretivist approach to data analysis will involve use of the constant comparative method to organise the data, along with inductive analysis. From this, we will iteratively develop best practice guidance about household medication safety practices during a pandemic from the patients/carers perspective. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has Trinity College Dublin, University of Limerick and University College London ethics approvals. We plan to disseminate our findings via presentations at relevant patient/public, professional, academic and scientific meetings, and for publication in peer-reviewed journals. We will create a list of helpful strategies that participants have reported and share this with participants, PPI partners and on social media.","output":"Household medication safety practices during the COVID-19 pandemic: a descriptive qualitative study protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid and accurate classification and discrimination of bacteria is an important task and has been highlighted recently for rapid diagnostics using real-time results. Coupled with a recent report by Jim O'Neill [https://amr-review.org] that if left unaddressed antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria could kill 10 million people per year by 2050, which would surpass current cancer mortality, this further highlights the need for unequivocal identification of microorganisms. Whilst traditional microbiological testing has offered insights into the characterisation and identification of a wide range of bacteria, these approaches have proven to be laborious and time-consuming and are not really fit for purpose, considering the modern day speed and volume of international travel and the opportunities it creates for the spread of pathogens globally. To overcome these disadvantages, modern analytical methods, such as mass spectrometry (MS) and vibrational spectroscopy, that analyse the whole organism, have emerged as essential alternative approaches. Currently within clinical microbiology laboratories, matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI)-MS is the method of choice for bacterial identification. This is largely down to its robust analysis as it largely measures the ribosomes which are always present irrespective of how the bacteria are cultured. However, MALDI-MS requires large amounts of biomass and infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy are attractive alternatives as these physicochemical bioanalytical techniques have the advantages of being rapid, reliable and cost-effective for analysing various types of bacterial samples, even at the single cell level. In this review, we discuss the fundamental applications, advantages and disadvantages of modern analytical techniques used for bacterial characterisation, classification and identification.","output":"Discrimination of bacteria using whole organism fingerprinting: the utility of modern physicochemical techniques for bacterial typing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide, viral genomic data is available in the order of millions of sequences on public databases such as GISAID.

This study aimed to document the experience of Australians living with cancer, family carers, and Oncology health professionals (HPs) when COVID-19 first emerged. Methods In this qualitative study, participants (cancer patients currently receiving treatment, family carers and HPs) completed a semi-structured interview exploring their experiences of COVID-19 and the impact it had on cancer care. Participants also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (patients) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (carers and HPs) to assess emotional morbidity. Thematic analysis was undertaken on qualitative data. Results 32 patients, 16 carers and 29 HPs participated. Qualitative analysis yielded three shared themes: fear and death anxiety, isolation, and uncertainty. For HPs, uncertainty incorporated the potential for moral distress and work-stress. Patients and carers scoring high on anxiety/depression measures were more likely to have advanced disease, expressed greater death anxiety, talked about taking more extreme precautionary measures, and felt more impacted by isolation. Conclusion Cancer and COVID-19 can have compounding psychological impacts on all those receiving or giving care.

To increase diagnostic capacity and reduce the risk of diagnostic delay, CT colonography (CTC) and colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) are increasingly being relied upon. Endoscopic assessment and treatment will be required for those patients with large colonic polyps or malignant tumours detected by CTC or CCE, provided they are fit enough to undergo further investigation. The management of patients with intermediate (6-9mm) and diminutive (<6mm) colonic polyps, reported by CTC and CCE, will increasingly be decided by clinicians. Published literature suggests the risk of progression to malignancy of intermediate or diminutive polyps over 3 years is low. Furthermore, the risk of intermediate or diminutive polyps harbouring malignancy is extremely low. The benefits, and timeline, for the removal of these polyps must be carefully considered for patients. We present a pragmatic approach to managing intermediate and diminutive polyps. We suggest delayed polypectomy (up to one year) for patients with intermediate polyps who are likely to benefit. For those patients with diminutive polyps, we advocate further surveillance only for younger patients where clinical concern exists.

Development of a specific vaccine can induce an optimal antibody response, thus providing immunity against it. Our study proposes a detailed and comprehensive immunoinformatic approach that can be applied to the currently available coronavirus protein data in the online server for vaccine candidate development. We have identified the receptor binding domain (RBD) of structural spike protein (S1) as a potential target for immunity against COVID- 19 infection. Epitope prediction illustrated cytotoxic T-cell epitopes, helper T-cell epitopes, and B-cell epitopes associated with the target protein. These were joined through specific linkers along with adjuvant beta-defensin located at the N-terminal to create a multi epitope subunit vaccine (MESV). The specificity in the binding of the devised vaccine candidate to the TLR-3 immune cell receptor was evaluated via molecular docking interaction studies. Good docking score combined with robust interactions in the binding cavity certified the stringency of the engineered vaccine. Molecular dynamics simulation data showed minimal variation of the root-mean square deviations (RMSDs) and root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSFs) which confirmed the interaction stability. These results obtained from various in-silico experiments indicate the potency of this vaccine candidate as a probable therapeutic agent against COVID-19. Vaccination strategies targeting conserved epitope-based immune response would be beneficial in providing cross protection across beta-coronaviruses, and such vaccines would be resistant to the ever-evolving viruses.

Early Supported discharge (ESD) for stroke is a proven model of best care for stroke patients with mild to moderate disability (Langhorne et al., 2005). A pilot was implemented with the team consisting of an Occupational Therapist, Speech and Language Therapist, Physiotherapist and Medical Social Worker. METHODS: The service facilitated an early discharge from the hospital with the delivery of specialist stroke rehabilitation in the home. Therapy is provided with the same intensity and expertise that would be received in hospital and is available for up to 8 weeks, it was provided using a blended model of domiciliary care and the introduction of telehealth in response to COVID 19. Data was recorded for 100 service users using an excel spreadsheet. Data was recorded to measure number of new referrals, length of stay, bed days released back into the hospital system, mode of service delivery and functional outcomes. A cost analysis was completed. Service user experience was captured using questionnaires. RESULTS: From September 2020 to July 2021, 100 patients accessed ESD with a reduction of 7.2 days in hospital stay per patient. Improvements in pre- and post- rehabilitation scores on the FIM/FAM were evident. Very positive feedback regarding the rehabilitation experience was captured within the patient satisfaction questionnaire. Therapy delivery was 60% face to face, 37% via telehealth and 3% outpatient appointments. Telehealth received good compliance but with varying reports of experience in comparison to face to face.

To better understand the symptoms of long-COVID19 in adolescents and to distinguish infection-associated symptoms from pandemic-associated symptoms, we conducted a Long-COVID19 survey, comparing responses from seropositive and seronegative adolescents. To our knowledge, data of Long-COVID19 surveys with seronegative control groups have not been published yet. Methods Since May 2020 students grade 8-12 in fourteen secondary schools in Eastern Saxony were enrolled in the SchoolCovid19 study. Seroprevalence was assessed via serial SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in all participants. Furthermore, during the March/April 2021 study visit all participants were asked to complete a 12 question Long-COVID19 survey regarding the occurrence and frequency of difficulties concentrating, memory loss, listlessness, headache, abdominal pain, myalgia/ arthralgia, fatigue, insomnia and mood (sadness, anger, happiness and tenseness). Findings 1560 students with a median age of 15 years participated in this study. 1365 (88%) were seronegative, 188 (12%) were seropositive. Each symptom was present in at least 35% of the students within the last seven days before the survey. However, there was no statistical difference comparing the reported symptoms between seropositive students and seronegative students.

METHODS Eight untrained individuals completed an 8-wk aerobic training program immediately followed by 8 d of hot/humid (38C, 65%RH) heat acclimation. Participants completed a humidity ramp protocol pretraining (PRE-TRN), posttraining (POST-TRN), and after heat acclimation (POST-HA), involving treadmill marching at a heat production of 450 W for 105 min in 37.5C, 2.0 kPa (35%RH). After attaining a steady-state esophageal temperature (Tes), humidity increased 0.04 kPamin. An upward inflection in Tes indicated the upper limit of physiological compensability (Pcrit), which was then used to quantify max. Local sweat rate, activated sweat gland density, and sweat gland output on the back and arm were simultaneously measured throughout. RESULTS Peak aerobic capacity increased POST-TRN by approximately 14% (PRE-TRN: 45.8  11.8 mLkgmin; POST-TRN: 52.0  11.1 mLkgmin, P < 0.001). max values became progressively greater from PRE-TRN (0.72  0.06) to POST-TRN (0.84  0.08; P = 0.02), to POST-HA (0.95  0.05; P = 0.03). These shifts in max were facilitated by a progressively greater local sweat rate and activated sweat gland density from PRE-TRN (0.84  0.21 mgcmmin; 67  20 glands per square centimeter) to POST-TRN (0.96  0.21 mgcmmin, P = 0.03; 86  27 glands per square centimeter; P = 0.009), to POST-HA (1.15  0.21 mgcmmin; P < 0.001; 98  35 glands per square centimeter; P < 0.001). No differences in sweat gland output were observed. CONCLUSIONS A greater max occurred after 8 wk of aerobic training, but max was further augmented with heat acclimation, indicating only a partially increased heat loss capacity with training.

However, it has been associated with a high incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Because the incidence of ICH and prognostic impact of ICH were not scrutinized in general patients, we investigated the impact of ICH after EVT on functional outcome at 90 days in patients with acute LVO. METHODS RESCUE-Japan Registry 2 was a multicenter registry that enrolled 2,420 consecutive patients with acute LVO within 24 h of onset. We analyzed 1,281 patients who received EVT and compared the functional outcomes between those with and without ICH (ICH and no-ICH groups, respectively) within 24 h after EVT. We explored the factors associated with ICH and prognostic impact of symptomatic ICH (SICH) among patients with ICH. We estimated the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for good functional outcome as modified Rankin Scale scores 0-2 and mortality. We also explored the prognostic impact of symptomatic ICH (SICH) among patients with ICH. RESULTS ICH occurred in 333 patients (26.0%). Several factors such as perioperative edaravone, stent retriever, and baseline glucose were associated with development of ICH within 24 h. A good outcome was observed in 80 (24.0%) and 454 (47.9%) patients in the ICH and no-ICH groups, respectively, and the adjusted OR was 0.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.2-0.5, p < 0.0001). Incidence of mortality within 90 days was not significantly different between the groups (adjusted OR 1.2; 95% CI: 0.7-1.9, p = 0.5).

Children are less affected and have a mild form of the illness. The association between SARS-CoV-2 disease, COVID-19 and late symptoms of vasculitis is often suspected, in particular in young asymptomatic patients, especially due to the post-viral immune response. Objective: The aim of the review is to describe the characteristics of children and adolescents affected by the development of Kawasaki-like mult-system inflammatory syndrome (KD) (MISC), and assesses its possible temporal association with SARS-CoV-2 infection Brief description of the state of knowledge: A group of children who presented with KD-type MISC during the COVID-19 pandemic have been identified in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy. Some children were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction and IgG antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 infection and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 can serve as an initial trigger for KD. IVIG should be administered within seven days of onset of illness until KD symptoms disappear and COVID-19 test is negative. Large numbers of children in African countries with the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic are likely to be affected by KD, and in such cases, a shortage of IVIG supplies is expected.

However, challenges arise when trying to quantify the health effects of complex exposure mixtures. Analytical challenges include dealing with high dimensionality, studying the combined effects of these exposures and their interactions, integrating causal pathways, and integrating omics layers. To tackle these challenges, ISGlobal Exposome Hub held a data challenge event open to researchers from all over the world and from all expertises. Analysts had a chance to compete and apply state-of-the-art methods on a common partially simulated exposome dataset (based on real case data from the HELIX project) with multiple correlated exposure variables (P>100) arising from general and personal environments at different time points, biological molecular data (multi-omics: DNA methylation, gene expression, proteins, metabolomics) and multiple clinical phenotypes in 1301 mother-child pairs. Most of the methods presented included feature selection or feature reduction to deal with the high dimensionality of the exposome dataset. Several approaches explicitly searched for combined effects of exposures and/or their interactions using linear index models or response surface methods, including Bayesian methods. Other methods dealt with the multi-omics dataset in mediation analyses using multiple-step approaches. Here we discuss the statistical models and provide the data and codes used, so that analysts have examples of implementation and can learn how to use these methods. Overall, the exposome data challenge presented a unique opportunity for researchers from different disciplines to create and share methods, setting a new standard for open science in the exposome and environmental health field.","output":"State-of-the-Art Methods for Exposure-Health Studies: results from the Exposome Data Challenge Event"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We did a comprehensive exploration of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 136 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in main district of Chongqing which was adjacent to the west of Hubei province.

March 11, 2021, one year after the pandemic, C?te d'Ivoire has notified 36,824 cases of Covid-19 patients and among them 211 have died. As of May 31, 2020, C?te d'Ivoire had already notified 2,833 cases and 33 deaths. At that time, false rumors were circulating in Africa about the setting up of clinical trials on candidate vaccines. The impact of these rumors on the overall use of health services had to be measured and in particular on vaccination centers. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of the pandemic on the activities of the immunization services of the National Institute of Public Hygiene in Abidjan, which comprises four departments: International Vaccination Center, Community Vaccination Service, Rabies Center, and Vaccination Unit of the Expanded Program on Immunization. The study was based on activity reports of the immunization services. RESULTS: At the International Vaccination Center, activities fell by about 50% in March, 86% in April and 82% in May in comparison with 2018 and 2019. Activities of Community Vaccination Service decreased by about 26% in March and 99% in April and May. At the Rabies Control Center, this reduction was estimated at 38% in April and 45% in May. The highest losses were for yellow fever and meningitis vaccines. CONCLUSION: The drop in attendance at vaccination services could increase the risk of epidemics, especially yellow fever, which are recurrent in Abidjan. Intensive awareness and catch-up actions should be carried out and further studies performed to assess the impact of the pandemic on immunization activities.","output":"Effets de la Pandmie  Covid-19 sur les Activits Vaccinales D'un Centre de Vaccination de Rfrence de Treichville en C?te D'ivoire"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have provided an invaluable resource in the fight against this infection. Given the current vaccine shortage, vaccination programs must prioritize their distribution to the most appropriate segments of the population. Methods: We carried out a prospective cohort study with 63 health care workers (HCWs) from a public General Hospital. We compared antibody responses to two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine between HCWs with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection before vaccination (experienced HCWs) and HCWs who were not previously infected (naive HCWs). Results: Seven days after the first vaccine dose HCWs with previous infection experienced a 126 fold increase in antibody levels (GMC 26955 AU; 95% CI 18785-35125). However, in the HCW naive group the response was much lower and only 5 of them showed positive antibody levels (>50 AU). The HCWs with previous infection did not significantly increased their antibody levels after the second dose while there was a significant increase in the naive HCW group (16 fold; GMC 20227 AU; 95% CI: 15179-25275). Approximately two months after completing vaccination, the level of antibodies was much lower in naive HCWs (GMC 6595 AU vs. 25003 AU; p<0.001) Conclusion: The study shows that 10 months after the disease has passed, the immune system is capable of producing a rapid and powerful secondary antibody response after one single dose of the vaccine. This response reflects the persistence of immunological memory and it is independent of whether or not anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are detected in blood. Besides, we found that the second dose does not improve the antibody response in individuals with previous Covid-19 infection. Nonetheless, two months later, the persistence of antibody levels is still higher in the experienced HCWs. These data suggest that immune memory remains for a long time in recovered individuals, and therefore, vaccination in this group could be postponed until immunization of the rest of the population is complete.","output":"Influence of past infection with SARS-CoV-2 on the response to the BioTech/ Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in health care workers: kinetics and durability of the humoral response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Without integration of the available information, appropriate suicide preventive actions can be hindered. Therefore, this study attempts to review the Bangladeshi COVID-19-related suicide studies for the first time. METHODS: For conducting a systematic review, the PRISMA guideline was adhered. Bangladeshi literatures concerning the COVID-19 pandemic related to either suicide case or suicidal behavior were identified within 1 to 10 April 2021, from the databases like PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, etc. Finally, a total of 9 literatures were included in this review. RESULTS: Four literatures were cross-sectional studies assessing the prevalence and risk factors of suicidal behavior, and the rest five were retrospective suicide studies concerned with either case study (n=3) or case-series study (n=2). The prevalence of suicidal ideation was identified to be ranging between 5% and 19.0%, whereas the rate increased over time of the pandemic inception. Significant risk factors concerning suicidal behavior included the factors related to (i) socio-demographic variables: female gender, being divorced or widows or widowers or single in marital status, having lower levels of education, being urban residence, belonging to higher socioeconomic class, being unemployed, and having no children, (ii) behavior and health-related variables: lack of physical exercise, cigarette smoking, alcohol consuming, abnormal sleep status, more exposure to social media, and suffering from the higher number of physical health problems; (iii) COVID-19 pandemic-related variables: lower knowledge of COVID-19, lack of preventive COVID-19 behaviors, higher levels of COVID-19 fear, living in highly COVID-19 infected area, higher economic loss due to the pandemic, and experiencing relatives or acquaintances death by the COVID-19; (iv) psychopathological variables: depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, suicidal thought history, suicide attempt history, and family with a history of suicide.

We describe a new approach that forecasts the number of incident cases in the near future given past occurrences using only a small number of assumptions. METHODS: Our approach to forecasting future COVID-19 cases involves 1) modeling the observed incidence cases using a Poisson distribution for the daily incidence number, and a gamma distribution for the series interval; 2) estimating the effective reproduction number assuming its value stays constant during a short time interval; and 3) drawing future incidence cases from their posterior distributions, assuming that the current transmission rate will stay the same, or change by a certain degree. RESULTS: We apply our method to predicting the number of new COVID-19 cases in a single state in the U.S. and for a subset of counties within the state to demonstrate the utility of this method at varying scales of prediction. Our method produces reasonably accurate results when the effective reproduction number is distributed similarly in the future as in the past. Large deviations from the predicted results can imply that a change in policy or some other factors have occurred that have dramatically altered the disease transmission over time.

METHODS: The Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) reports were identified and recovered from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data sets. The findings of the surveys in 2003, 2006, and 2009 were compared with respect to the prevalence of cigarette smoking and other tobacco use, and the determinants of initiation of tobacco use among the adolescent population. RESULTS: The total tobacco consumption among adolescents was found to have increased from 13.7% in 2006 to 14.6% in 2009. All forms of tobacco use were higher in boys than girls across all three survey periods. Also, the trend of bidi (smoked tobacco form) use had increased in both genders. A reduction in exposure to Secondhand Smoke, with an increase in cessation services, media campaigns, and tobacco-related school curriculum was noted. If the increase in tobacco consumption between 2006 and 2009 had continued at the same rate, then in 2021 around 18% of adolescents are estimated to consume tobacco in some form.

Greater than 90% of all deaths from influenza A virus (IAV) occur in the elderly (>65 years of age). To address this age-related susceptibility to SARS-CoV and IAV, we infected C57BL/6 (B6) mice with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) or IAV (PR8), both of which cause severe disease in aged mice. Intranasal pretreatment of aged mice with poly(IC) (a TLR3 agonist) and, to a lesser extent, CpG, R848, or lipopolysaccharide (TLR9, TLR7/8, or TLR4 agonists), provided a high level of protection [90% to 100% survival rate after poly(IC) treatment] against lethal MA15 or IAV challenge and reduced pathological changes and virus loads in the lungs at early times after infection. Poly(IC) pretreatment upregulated beta interferon (IFN-), IFN-, IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene expression in the lungs. Intranasal pretreatment with IFN- or IFN- but not IL-1 or TNF also protected aged mice, consistent with the notion that poly(IC) pretreatment functioned, at least in part, by inducing IFN- and IFN-. We also identified a potential cellular target for poly(IC) by showing that treatment inhibited virus replication in primary human airway epithelial cells. These results suggest that intranasal poly(IC) should be evaluated as a prophylactic agent in aged individuals at high risk for contracting SARS-CoV or IAV infections.","output":"Intranasal treatment with poly(I?C) protects aged mice from lethal respiratory virus infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a relatively novel term which describes patients who have developed a low platelet count and prothrombotic tendencies secondary to receiving a vaccine.

METHODS: The survey was conducted in the European Hip Society (EHS) and the European Knee Associates (EKA). The survey consisted of 20 questions (single, multiple choice, ranked). Four topics were addressed: (1) origin and surgical experience of the participant (four questions); (2) potential disruption of arthroplasty surgeries (12 questions); (3) influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the particular arthroplasty surgeon (four questions); (4) a matrix provided 14 different arthroplasty surgeries and the participant was asked to state whether dedicated surgery was stopped, delayed or cancelled. RESULTS: Two-hundred and seventy-two surgeons (217 EHS, 55 EKA) from 40 different countries participated. Of the respondents, 25.7% stated that all surgeries were cancelled in their departments, while 68.4% responded that elective inpatient procedures were no longer being performed. With regard to the specific surgical procedures, nearly all primary TJA were cancelled (92.6%) as well as aseptic revisions (94.7%).

We sought to (1) estimate the prevalence of face mask use in northern Vermont and (2) assess the effect of age and sex on the likelihood of face mask use. METHODS We monitored the entrances to public businesses and visually assessed age, sex, and face mask use. We collected 1004 observations during May 16-30, 2020. We calculated estimates of overall face mask use and odds ratios (ORs) for effects by age and sex. RESULTS Of 1004 observations, 758 (75.5%) sampled people used a face mask. Our census-weighted estimate was 74.1%. A higher percentage of females than males wore face masks (83.8% vs 67.6%). The odds of face mask use were lower among males than among females (OR = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.37-0.73). Face mask use generally decreased with decreasing age: 91.4% among adults aged >60, 70.7% among adults aged 26-60, 74.8% among people aged 15-25, and 53.3% among people aged 14. The OR of an adult aged >60 wearing a face mask was 14.70 times higher, for young people aged 15-25 was 2.72 times higher, and for adults aged 26-60 was 2.99 times higher than for people aged 14. Females aged >60 had the highest percentage of face mask use (96.3%) and males aged 14 had the lowest (43.8%).

In the current study, to investigate the spread possibility of COVID-19 via the environmental media, three typical rivers (Yangtze, Han, and Fu River) and watershed cities in Hubei province of China were selected, and a more comprehensive risk assessment analysis method was built with a risk index proposed. Results showed that the risk index in the Yangtze River Basin is about 10?12, compared to 10?10 and 10?8 in the Han and Fu River Basins, and the risk index is gradually reduced from Wuhan city to the surrounding cities. The safety radius and safety time period for the Yangtze, Han, and Fu River are 8 km/14 h, 20 km/30 h and 36 km/36 h, respectively. The linear relationship between the risk potential calculated by the QMRA model and the multiple linear regression proved that the built index model is statistically significant.

Care home residents and staff, frontline health-care workers, and adults aged 80 years and older were vaccinated first. However, few data exist regarding the effectiveness of these vaccines in older people with many comorbidities. In this post-implementation evaluation of two COVID-19 vaccines, we aimed to determine the effectiveness of one dose in reducing COVID-19-related admissions to hospital in people of advanced age. METHODS: This prospective test-negative case-control study included adults aged at least 80 years who were admitted to hospital in two NHS trusts in Bristol, UK with signs and symptoms of respiratory disease. Patients who developed symptoms before receiving their vaccine or those who received their vaccine after admission to hospital were excluded, as were those with symptoms that started more than 10 days before hospital admission. We did logistic regression analysis, controlling for time (week), sex, index of multiple deprivations, and care residency status, and sensitivity analyses matched for time and sex using a conditional logistic model adjusting for index of multiple deprivations and care residency status.

MethodsPubmed and Google were searched on November 4, 2021. Search words included: COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, in vitro, animal studies, clinical trials, and meta-analyses. Studies were assessed for import and included if considered impactful for benefit:risk assessment. ResultsThese searches led to inclusion of 12 in vitro and animal reports; 12 retrospective-observational trials, 19 interventional clinical trials (17 RCTs, 1 single-arm, 1 controlled but unblinded), and 51 meta-analyses in hospitalized patients. Inconsistent efficacy was seen in vitro and in animal studies for coronaviruses and nil in SARS-CoV-2 animal models specifically. Most retrospective-observational studies in hospitalized COVID-19 patients found no efficacy; QT prolongation and increased adverse events and mortality were reported in some. All RCTs and almost all meta-analyses provided robust data showing no benefit in overall populations and subgroups, yet concerning safety issues in many. ConclusionsHC/CQ have inconsistent anti-coronavirus efficacy in vitro and in animal models, and no convincing efficacy yet substantial safety issues in the overwhelming majority of retrospective-observational trials, RCTs, and meta-analyses in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Additionally, as the purpose of the PPP funding was to assist small businesses in retaining their workforce, the authors pose a second research question: Of those who received PPP funding, how many jobs on average were retained? And importantly related to our first research question, are there differences across gender and race in the average number of jobs retained?Design/methodology/approachThis is one of the first empirical studies with an initial sample size of 661,218 loans from July 2020 that examines whether the United States PPP had the intended impact to save jobs in small businesses and to examine any reported differences across gender and race in loans issued and jobs saved.FindingsThe authors find that significant differences exist between women- and men-owned businesses across all five loan categories, with male-owned firms receiving over 80% of PPP loans. However, women-owned firms saved more jobs on average across all but the largest loan category. Significant differences were also found between minority- and White-owned businesses with minority-owned businesses generally saving more jobs on average across most loan categories.Research limitations/implicationsA limitation of this study pertains to certain missing data that were not reported by participants. While a participant may have included their gender, they may not have included their race. Therefore, the varying sets of data may not be a reflection of the same individuals.

METHODS: An updated national search was conducted. Of those identified, 74 persistent pain services provided detailed responses between July 2016 and February 2018 (64 adult, seven pediatric, two pelvic pain, and one cancer pain). A similar structure to the original Waiting in Pain (WIP) survey was used, and participants chose online or telephone completion. RESULTS: Pediatric pain services had more than doubled but remained limited. Adult services had also increased, with a concurrent decrease in median wait times and an increase in the number of new referrals seen each year. Despite this, some lengthy wait times (&#8805;3 years) persisted. Wait times were longest at clinics using public or combined funding models and offering pain management group programs (PMGPs). Although clinical activity had increased, medical staffing had not, suggesting that clinics were operating differently. Privately funded clinics performed more procedures than publicly funded services. Use of PMGPs had increased, but program structure remained diverse. CONCLUSIONS: Specialist pain services have expanded since the original WIP survey, facilitating treatment access for many. However, wait time range suggested that the most disadvantaged individuals still experienced the longest wait times, often far exceeding the recommended 6-month maximum wait. More needs to be done. Numerous developments (e.g., National Strategic Action Plan for Pain Management, health system changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) will continue to influence the delivery of pain services in Australia, and repeated analysis of service structures and wait times will optimize our health system response to the management of this condition.","output":"Waiting in Pain II: An Updated Review of the Provision of Persistent Pain Services in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of the COVID-2019 (coronavirus disease 2019) due to the infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has realized the requirement of alternative therapeutics to mitigate and alleviate this lethal infection These alternative therapies are effective when they are started at the initial stage of the infection Some drugs that were used in previous other related infections SARS-CoV-2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-2012 could be potentially active against currently emerging SARS-CoV-2 This fact imparts some rationale of current interventions, in the absence of any specific therapeutics for SARSCoV-2 It is imperative to focus on the available antimicrobial and adjunct therapies during the current emergency state and overcome the challenges associated with the absence of robust controlled studies There is no established set of drugs to manage SARS-CoV-2 infected patients However, closely following patients conditions and responding with the dosage guidelines of available drugs may significantly impact our ability to slow down the infection Of note, it depends upon the condition of the patients and associated comorbid;therefore, the health workers need to choose the drug combinations judiciously until COVID-19 specific drug or vaccine is developed with the collective scientific rigor In this article, we reviewed the available antimicrobial drug, supportive therapies, and probable high importance vaccines for the COVID-19 treatment","output":"Available compounds with therapeutic potential against covid-19: Antimicrobial therapies, supportive care, and probable vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Priority to emergency vehicles, buses, high occupancy vehicles (HOVs), and priced low occupancy vehicles (LOVs) is critical to their efficiency and reliability, where multi-functional exclusive lane (MFEL) serves as a salient element with independent operation environment.

Primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells are among the first targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we show that ColdZyme medical device mouth spray efficiently protected against virus entry, excessive inflammation, and tissue damage. Applying ColdZyme to fully differentiated, polarized human epithelium cultured at an air-liquid interphase (ALI) completely blocked binding of SARS-CoV-2 and increased local complement activation mediated by the virus as well as productive infection of the tissue model. While SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in exaggerated intracellular complement activation immediately following infection and a drop in transepithelial resistance, these parameters were bypassed by single pretreatment of the tissues with ColdZyme mouth spray. Crucially, our study highlights the importance of testing already evaluated and safe drugs such as ColdZyme mouth spray for maintaining epithelial integrity and hindering SARS-CoV-2 entry within standardized three-dimensional (3D) in vitro models mimicking the in vivo human airway epithelium.IMPORTANCE Although our understanding of COVID-19 continuously progresses, essential questions regarding prophylaxis and treatment remain open. A hallmark of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is a hitherto-undescribed mechanism leading to excessive inflammation and tissue destruction associated with enhanced pathogenicity and mortality. To tackle the problem at the source, transfer of SARS-CoV-2, subsequent binding, infection, and inflammatory responses have to be avoided. In this study, we used fully differentiated, mucus-producing, and ciliated human airway epithelial cultures to test the efficacy of ColdZyme medical device mouth spray in terms of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, we found that pretreatment of the in vitro airway cultures using ColdZyme mouth spray resulted in significantly shielding the epithelial integrity, hindering virus binding and infection, and blocking excessive intrinsic complement activation within the airway cultures. Our in vitro data suggest that ColdZyme mouth spray may have an impact in prevention of COVID-19.","output":"ColdZyme Maintains Integrity in SARS-CoV-2-Infected Airway Epithelia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Portal annular pancreas (PAP) is a rare anatomical anomaly in which the pancreatic parenchyma surrounds the superior mesenteric vein and portal vein (PV) annularly.

The papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a key promising target for antiviral drug development since it plays a pivotal role in viral replication and innate immunity. Here, we employed the all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding free energy calculations based on MM-PB(GB)SA and SIE methods to elucidate and compare the binding behaviors of five inhibitors derived from peptidomimetic inhibitors (VIR250 and VIR251) and naphthalene-based inhibitors (GRL-0617, compound 3, and compound Y96) against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. The obtained results revealed that all inhibitors interacting within the PLpro active site are mostly driven by vdW interactions, and the hydrogen bond formation in residues G163 and G271 with peptidomimetics and the Q269 residue with naphthalene-based inhibitors was essential for stabilizing the proteinCligand complexes. Among the five studied inhibitors, VIR250 exhibited the most binding efficiency with SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, and thus, it was chosen for the rational drug design. Based on the computationally designed ligandCprotein complexes, the replacement of aromatic rings including heteroatoms (e.g., thiazolopyridine) at the P2 and P4 sites could help to improve the inhibitor-binding efficiency. Furthermore, the hydrophobic interactions with residues at P1CP3 sites can be increased by enlarging the nonpolar moieties (e.g., ethene) at the N-terminal of VIR250. We expect that the structural data obtained will contribute to the development of new PLpro inhibitors with more inhibitory potency for COVID-19.","output":"In Silico Elucidation of Potent Inhibitors and Rational Drug Design against SARS-CoV-2 Papain-like Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and voluntary behavioral changes during the COVID-19 pandemic have influenced the circulation of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections. We aimed to examine interactions among common non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus and further estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these viruses. MethodsWe analyzed incidence data for seven groups of respiratory viruses in New York City (NYC) during Oct 2015 - May 2021 (i.e., before and during the COVID-19 pandemic). We first used elastic net regression to identify potential virus interactions and further examined the robustness of the found interactions by comparing the performance of Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models with and without the interactions. We then used the models to compute counterfactual estimates of cumulative incidence and estimate the reduction during the COVID-19 pandemic period from March 2020 to May 2021, for each virus. ResultsWe identified potential interactions for three endemic human coronaviruses (CoV-NL63, CoV-HKU, and CoV-OC43), parainfluenza (PIV)-1, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). We found significant reductions (by ~70-90%) in cumulative incidence of CoV-OC43, CoV-229E, human metapneumovirus, PIV-2, PIV-4, RSV, and influenza virus during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, the circulation of adenovirus and rhinovirus was less affected. ConclusionsCirculation of several respiratory viruses has been low during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may lead to increased population susceptibility.

COVID?19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than SARS-CoV-1. There is a dispute about the origin of COVID-19. Study results showed that all SARS-CoV-2 sequences around the world share a common ancestor towards the end of 2019. METHODS: Virus sequences from COVID-19 samples at the early time should be less diversifiable than those from samples at the later time because there might be more mutations when the virus evolutes over time. The diversity of virus nucleotide sequences can be measured by the nucleotide substitution distance. To explore the diversity of SARS-CoV-2, we use different nucleotide substitution models to calculate the distances of SARS-CoV-2 samples from 3 different areas, China, Europe, and the USA. Then, we use these distances to infer the origin of COVID-19. RESULTS: It is known that COVID-19 originated in Wuhan China and then spread to Europe and the USA. By using different substitution models, the distances of SARS-CoV-2 samples from these areas are significantly different. By ANOVA testing, the p-value is less than 2.2e-16. The analyzed results in most substitution models show that China has the lowest diversity, followed by Europe and lastly by the USA. This outcome coincides with the virus transmission time order that SARS-CoV-2 starts in China, then outbreaks in Europe and finally in the USA. CONCLUSION: The magnitude of nucleotide substitution distance of SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the transmission time order of SARS-CoV-2.

We aimed to find contribution of rare copy number variations (CNVs). As a result, we identified genomic imbalances in 7 regions among 12 CPHD patients. Five out of seven regions showed copy gains whereas two presented losses of genomic fragment. Three regions with detected gains encompassed known CPHD genes namely LHX4, HESX1, and OTX2. Among new CPHD loci, the most interesting seem to be the region covering SIX3 gene, that is abundantly expressed in developing brain, and together with HESX1 contributes to pituitary organogenesis as it was evidenced before in functional studies.

HuaShi XuanFei Formula (HSXFF) was developed to treat patients with mild and general COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province, China. The present study seeks to explore its potentially active compounds and pharmacological mechanisms against COVID-19 based on network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. All components of HSXFF were harvested from the pharmacology database of the TCMSP system. COVID-19-related targets were retrieved from using OMIM and GeneCards databases. The herb-compound-targets network was constructed by Cytoscape. The target proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) network, Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were performed to discover the potential key target genes and mechanism. The main active compounds of HSXFF were docked with 3C-like (3CL) protease hydrolase and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The MD simulation confirmed the binding stability of docking results. The herbs-targets network mainly contained 52 compounds and 70 corresponding targets, including key targets such as RELA, TNF, TP53, IL6, MAPK1, CXCL8, IL-1, and MAPK14. The GO and KEGG indicated that HSXFF may be mainly acting on the IL-17 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, NF-B signaling pathway, etc. The molecular docking results indicated that isovitexin and procyanidin B1 showed the highest affinity with 3CL and ACE2, respectively, which were confirmed by MD simulation. These findings suggested HSXFF exerted therapeutic effects involving multi-compounds and multi-targets. It might be working through directly inhibiting the virus, improving immune function, and reducing the inflammatory in response to anti-COVID-19. In summary, the present study would provide a valuable direction for further research of HSXFF.

However, lateral flow-based serological assays have previously demonstrated poor analytical and clinical performance, limiting their utility. METHODS: We assessed the ADEXUSDx COVID-19 lateral flow assay for agreement with diagnostic RT-PCR testing using 120 specimens from RT-PCRCpositive patients, 77 specimens from symptomatic RT-PCRCnegative patients, and 47 specimens obtained prepandemic. Specimens collected <14 days from symptom onset in RT-PCRCpositive patients were compared relative to the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. RESULTS: The ADEXUSDx COVID-19 Test yielded an overall positive percent agreement (PPA) of 92.5% (95%CI 85.8 to 96.3) and negative percent agreement of 99.2% (95% CI 94.9C100.0) relative to RT-PCR and in prepandemic specimens. Relative to days from symptom onset, the PPA after 13 days was 100% (95% CI 94.2C100); from 7 to 13 days, 89.7 (95% CI 71.5C97.2); and from 0 to 7 days, 53.8 (95% CI 26.1C79.6). The overall agreement between the Abbott and ADEXUSDx assays was 80.9%. Twenty-five specimens were positive by both assays, 9 specimens were negative by both assays, and 8 specimens were positive by only the ADEXUSDx assay. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate high PPA and negative percent agreement of the ADEXUSDx COVID-19 assay and diagnostic testing by RT-PCR, with PPA approximately 90% by 7 days following symptom onset.

Depressive symptoms were defined by the 10-item version of the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Intergenerational contact included in-person meeting and remote connecting, and they were analysed separately. Intergenerational contact frequency was classified into ten categories and then treated as a continuous variable for analysis. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regressions to identify risk covariables. Restrictive cubic spline analysis was used to examine the doseCresponse relationship between intergenerational contact frequency and the outcome of depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Both the frequency of meeting and the frequency of connecting with children were independently associated with depressive symptoms in the elderly, and the odds ratios for depressive symptoms increased with decreasing frequencies (P < 0.01). There was a negative doseCresponse relationship between intergenerational contact frequency and depressive symptoms. The odds of depressive symptoms steadily decreased with increasing frequency of meeting with their children.

Present illness started with intensive dry cough, fever (37.5(?)C), diarrhoea and loss of smell. On the first day patient was febrile up to 38.4?C and later afebrile. Laboratory parameters showed abnormalities in several parameters: D-dimers 13.45 (RR:< 0.50) mg/L, creatinine 110 (49-90) mol/L, ALT 73 (12-28) U/L, LDH 531 (25-241) U/L, creatine kinase 549 (<177) U/L, GGT 277 (9-35) U/L, CRP 38 (<5 mg/L), sedimentation rate 40 (5-28) mm/3.6ks, procalcitonine 0.07 (<0.05) ng/ml, sodium 128 (137-146) mmol/L, hs-TroponinT 18 (< 14) ng/L, neutrophils 8.56 (2.06-6.49 x10(9)/L), lymphocytes 0.52 (1.19-3.35 x10(9)/L) and pO(2) 6.1 (11.0-14.4) kPa. At the admission X-ray showed normal presentation, while four days later on the right side pneumonia was noticed as spotty inhomogeneous shading. He was treated with azithromycin, hydrocortisone (50 mg twice/day) and oxygen supplementation. At the beginning of hospitalization he was addicted to O(2) 10-12 L/min. After 22 days of hospitalization he was discharged without any symptom but with still positive SARS-CoV2 swabs.

We discuss three surveillance components: active sentinel community surveillance, active sentinel hospital surveillance and passive laboratory surveillance, using the EU acute respiratory infection and World Health Organization (WHO) extended severe acute respiratory infection case definitions. Furthermore, we recommend the use of quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR-based assays as the standard detection method for RSV and virus genetic characterisation, if possible, to monitor genetic evolution. These guidelines provide a basis for good quality, feasible and affordable surveillance of RSV.

Patients were also excluded for unknown age, missing data resulting in unknown geriatric risk measure, inadequate data quality, or incomplete follow-up resulting in unknown COVID-19 severity. The exposure of interest was the CCC19 geriatric risk index. The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity and the secondary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality; both were assessed in the full dataset. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were estimated from ordinal and binary logistic regression models. FINDINGS: 5671 patients with cancer and COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Median follow-up time was 56 days (IQR 22C120), and median age was 72 years (IQR 66C79). The CCC19 geriatric risk index identified 2365 (417%) patients as standard risk, 2217 (391%) patients as intermediate risk, and 1089 (192%) as high risk. 36 (06%) patients were excluded due to non-calculable geriatric risk index. Compared with standard-risk patients, high-risk patients had significantly higher COVID-19 severity (adjusted OR 724; 95% CI 620C845). 920 (162%) of 5671 patients died within 30 days of a COVID-19 diagnosis, including 161 (68%) of 2365 standard-risk patients, 409 (185%) of 2217 intermediate-risk patients, and 350 (321%) of 1089 high-risk patients. High-risk patients had higher adjusted odds of 30-day mortality (adjusted OR 107; 95% CI 854C135) than standard-risk patients. INTERPRETATION: The CCC19 geriatric risk index was strongly associated with COVID-19 severity and 30-day mortality. Our CCC19 geriatric risk index, based on readily available clinical factors, might provide clinicians with an easy-to-use risk stratification method to identify older adults most at risk for severe COVID-19 as well as mortality.

These respiratory viruses, often, have common symptoms, including coughing, high temperature, congested nose, and difficulty breathing. However, early diagnosis of the type of the virus, can be crucial, especially in cases such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic. One of the factors that contributed to the spread of the pandemic, was the late diagnosis or confusing it with regular flu-like symptoms. Science has proved that one of the possible differentiators of the underlying causes of these different respiratory diseases is coughing, which comes in different types and forms. Therefore, a reliable lab-free tool for early and more accurate diagnosis that can differentiate between different respiratory diseases is very much needed. This paper proposes an end-to-end portable system that can record data from patients with symptom, including coughs (voluntary or involuntary) and translate them into health data for diagnosis, and with the aid of machine learning, classify them into different respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19.

Two-hundred forty-two out of 407 (59%) CHD patients answered the survey, 123 (51%) had mild defects, 88 (36%) moderate and 31 (13%) great defects, most of them between 18 and 24 years old and 51% were male. Patients were dichotomized to no or mild (PHQ-9 < 10) and moderate to severe ( 10) depressive symptoms. Thirty-four (14%) patients showed a PHQ-9  10 and 10 of them (29%) were under anxiolytic or antidepressant treatment during the quarantine.

Several studies have been proposed and started since then, mainly covering prevention, diagnosis, management, and treatment. Objective: To identify and categorize all intervention studies up to the end of May related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, according to population and geo-graphical location (emphasis in Latin America) and to verify if there is any correlation according to purpose, phase, and recruitment status. Methods: One thousand six hundred seventy-two trials were selected from 1705 until May 24 on the World Health Organization clinical trials platform related to COVID-19. Jupyter and Python tools were used for data processing and cleaning. Results: One thousand six hundred seventy-two intervention studies related to SARS-CoV-2 infection were found. China, The United States, Iran, France, and Spain are the countries participating in the largest number of studies, while only 4,1% are from Latin America (mostly Brazilian). 28 studies are focusing only on older adults, and ten studies are based exclusively on populations under 19 years of age. Conclusion: The worldwide interest in this new disease is reflected in the increasing number of intervention studies that are being carried out to date. How-ever, the studies analyzed do not cover the most vulnerable age groups proportionally and do not have equitable participation of all the coun-tries. In Latin America, this problem is exacerbated by the region's social, economic, and political limitations.

Physical distancing policies, curfews, and a citywide lockdown were implemented in March and April 2020 resulting in sharp decreases in movement across the city. However, most people cannot afford to stay home completely (e.g., leaving daily to fetch water). If still employed, they may need to travel longer distances for work, potentially exposing them COVID-19 or contributing to its spread. We conducted a household survey across five urban slums to describe factors associated with mobility in the previous 24 h. A total of 1695 adults were interviewed, 63% female. Of these, most reported neighborhood mobility within their informal settlement (54%), 19% stayed home completely, and 27% reported long-distance mobility outside their informal settlement, mainly for work. In adjusted multinomial regression models, women were 58% more likely than men to stay home (relative risk ratio (RRR): 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16, 2.14) and women were 60% less likely than men to report citywide mobility (RRR: 0.40; 95% CI 0.31, 0.52). Individuals in the wealthiest quintile, particularly younger women, were most likely to not leave home at all. Those who reported citywide travel were less likely to have lost employment (RRR: 0.49; 95% CI 0.38, 0.65) and were less likely to avoid public transportation (RRR: 0.30; 95% CI 0.23, 0.39). Employment and job hunting were the main reasons for traveling outside of the slum; less than 20% report other reasons. Our findings suggest that slum residents who retain their employment are traveling larger distances across Nairobi, using public transportation, and are more likely to be male; this travel may put them at higher risk of COVID-19 infection but is necessary to maintain income. Steps to protect workers from COVID-19 both in the workplace and while in transit (including masks, hand sanitizer stations, and reduced capacity on public transportation) are critical as economic insecurity in the city increases due to COVID-19 mitigation measures. Workers must be able to commute and maintain employment to not be driven further into poverty. Additionally, to protect the majority of individuals who are only travelling locally within their settlement, mitigation measures such as making masks and handwashing stations accessible within informal settlements must also be implemented, with special attention to the burden placed on women.","output":"Mobility Patterns During COVID-19 Travel Restrictions in Nairobi Urban Informal Settlements: Who Is Leaving Home and Why"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose We aimed to develop a prognostic immunohistochemistry (IHC) signature for patients with head and neck mucosal melanoma (MMHN).

The validation set (n=74) was further built to confirm the prognostic significance of this classifier. We then divided patients into high- and low-risk groups according to the IHC score. In the training set, the 5-year OS rate was 22.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.2%- 43.2%) for the high-risk group and 54.1% (95% CI: 41.8%-69.9%) for the low-risk group (P<0.001), and in the validation set, the 5-year OS rate was 38.1% (95% CI: 17.9%-81.1%) for the high-risk group and 43.1% (95% CI: 30.0%-61.9%) for the low-risk group (P=0.26).

To address this question we applied two mouse models of COVID19, using mice which were chronically infected with Mtb. In both model systems, Mtb-infected mice were resistant to secondary CoV2 infection and its pathological consequences, and CoV2 infection did not affect Mtb burdens.

Neurotrauma/traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause activation of glial cells, neurons, and neuroimmune cells in the brain to release neuroinflammatory mediators. Neurotrauma leads to immediate primary brain damage (direct damage), neuroinflammatory responses, neuroinflammation, and late secondary brain damage (indirect) through neuroinflammatory mechanism. Secondary brain damage leads to chronic inflammation and the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, there are no effective and specific therapeutic options to treat these brain damages or neurodegenerative diseases. Flavone luteolin is an important natural polyphenol present in several plants that show anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, cytoprotective, and macrophage polarization effects.

We have collected data for this study from publications in the PubMed using the keywords luteolin and mast cells, neuroinflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, and TBI. Recent reports suggest that luteolin suppresses systemic and neuroinflammatory responses in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Studies have shown that luteolin exhibits neuroprotective effects through various mechanisms, including suppressing immune cell activation, such as mast cells, and inflammatory mediators released from these cells. In addition, luteolin can suppress neuroinflammatory response, activation of microglia and astrocytes, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and the severity of neuroinflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and TBI pathogenesis.

Laboratory testing is crucial to prompt identification of positive cases, initiation of treatment and management strategies. However, medical scientists are vulnerable to infection due to the risk of exposure in the laboratory and the community. This study sought to determine the awareness of laboratory safety measures, assess the personal efforts of medical scientists in creating a safe laboratory environment for testing and examine the laboratory safety enabling factors. METHODS An internet-broadcasted and validated questionnaire was developed to obtain data from 131 medical scientists in Nigeria. The data generated were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25. RESULTS The majority of the respondents had a high awareness of laboratory safety measures (60.3%, mean  SD= 52.4 2.4) and demonstrated good personal efforts in creating a safe laboratory testing environment (63%, mean  SD= 48.55.9). The level of awareness of laboratory safety measures was significantly associated with respondents level of education ( 2 = 6.143;p = 0.046) and influences respondents efforts in creating a safe laboratory testing environment (F-ratio = 7.529, p = 0.007).However, just a few respondents could convincingly attest to the availability of adequate and appropriate PPE with proper utilization training (45.1%), adequate rest and other welfare packages (45.8%) as well as access to appropriate Biological Safety Cabinets (BSCs) and other essential equipment in their laboratories (48.8%). Furthermore, a significant association existed between the availability of laboratory safety enabling factors and respondents efforts in creating a safe environment for testing with the p-value ranging between <0.0001 to 0.003. CONCLUSION This study revealed that despite the high awareness of safety measures and good personal efforts of the study participants in creating a safe laboratory-testing environment, there was poor availability of safety facilities, equipment, support and welfare packages required to enhance their safety.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: The electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane Library databases were searched for randomised controlled trials of nurse-led care for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) published in English from inception to 23 December 2021. Random effects models were used to calculate weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95%CI. RESULTS: 13 articles were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of3757 participants. Considering baseline measurements, pooled analysis showed that nurse-led care significantly decreased the glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (WMD=?0.68 mmol/L; 95% CI ?0.85 to C0.52; p<0.001), body mass index (BMI) (WMD=?0.54 kg/m(2); 95% CI: ?0.97 to C0.11; p=0.01) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (WMD=?1.17 mmHg; 95% CI: ?2.11 to C0.22; p=0.02) for patients with T2DM.

To date, the immune response of people receiving dialysis after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has not been systematically discussed. OBJECTIVE: To assess immunogenicity rates in people with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, explore postvaccination potential risk factors for nonresponse, and assess whether receiving dialysis is associated with different antibody response rates compared with the nondialysis population. DATA SOURCES: This systematic review and meta-analysis used articles from PubMed, Medline, and Embase published before July 30, 2021, as well as articles in the medRxiv preprint server. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that evaluated the immunogenicity rate according to the postvaccine antibody response rate in patients with ESKD receiving dialysis were selected. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. A random-effects model was used. Two independent reviewers conducted the literature search and extracted the data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the pooled antibody postvaccine response rates in individuals with ESKD. The secondary outcomes were pooled response rates in individuals receiving and not receiving dialysis. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were conducted to identify the sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 32 studies were included. The overall immunogenicity rate of the dialysis group was 86% (95% CI, 81%-89%). Meta-regression showed a significant difference was detected in the postvaccine response rate on the basis of prevalence of diabetes (regression coefficient, ?0.06; 95% CI, ?0.10 to ?0.02; P = .004). Compared with nondialysis controls, patients in the dialysis group had a lower response rate after the first (relative risk [RR], 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47-0.79; I(2) = 70.2%) and second (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82-0.93; I(2) = 72.2%) doses, with statistically significantly increased RR between first and second doses (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that the immunogenicity rate among patients receiving dialysis was 41% after the first dose and 89% after the second dose. Diabetes might be a risk factor for nonresponse in the dialysis population. Patients receiving dialysis had a poorer antibody response rate than did individuals not receiving dialysis, particularly after the first dose.","output":"Immunogenicity Rates After SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in People With End-stage Kidney Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) has increased in recent years, especially in the young population. Urethritis is one of the most common clinical presentations of STD in emergency departments. During the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, in Spain lockdown lasted almost three months, and mobility was greatly restricted. This is the first study of these characteristics conducted in Spain. Methods A cross-sectional study of all patients treated for clinical symptoms of urethritis between March and June 2019 and between March and June 2020 was conducted. We evaluated patients sociodemographic and clinical variables. Results Seventy-nine patients were included in the study: 37 in 2019 and 38 in 2020 of whom 94.9% were men. The main symptoms were urethral discharge (59.5%) followed by dysuria (26.6%). Risky sexual relations were reported by 63.2% of patients in 2019, and this percentage decreased to 43.9% in 2020. Conclusions The number of patients attending an emergency department in our health region for urethritis did not undergo any variations between 2019 and 2020. No significant reduction in the number of cases of urethritis was observed, probably because people continued with unsafe sexual relations despite the social restrictions and difficulties posed by the lockdown.","output":"Impact of the SARS-COV-2 Pandemic Lockdown on Sexually Transmitted Urethritis in a Spanish Health Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Evidence suggests the role of an inflammatory storm in COVID-19 complications.

Methods We performed a randomized, double-blind trial involving non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing or clinical criteria. The patients were randomly assigned to receive colchicine (0.5 mg twice daily for 3 days and once daily thereafter) or placebo for 30 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of death or hospitalization for COVID-19. Results A total of 4488 patients were enrolled. The primary endpoint occurred in 4.7% of the patients in the colchicine group and 5.8% of those in the placebo group (odds ratio, 0.79; 95.1% confidence interval (CI), 0.61 to 1.03; P=0.08).

An abnormal electrocardiogram is associated with poor outcome, and QT prolongation during the illness has been linked to pharmacological effects. This study sought to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 illness on the corrected QT interval (QTc). METHOD: For 293 consecutive patients admitted to our hospital via the emergency department for COVID-19 between 01/03/20 -18/05/20, demographic data, laboratory findings, admission electrocardiograph and clinical observations were compared in those who survived and those who died within 6 weeks. Hospital records were reviewed for prior electrocardiograms for comparison with those recorded on presentation with COVID-19. RESULTS: Patients who died were older than survivors (82 vs 69.8 years, p < 0.001), more likely to have cancer (22.3% vs 13.1%, p = 0.034), dementia (25.6% vs 10.7%, p = 0.034) and ischemic heart disease (27.8% vs 10.7%, p < 0.001). Deceased patients exhibited higher levels of C-reactive protein (244.6 mg/L vs 146.5 mg/L, p < 0.01), troponin (1982.4 ng/L vs 413.4 ng/L, p = 0.017), with a significantly longer QTc interval (461.1 ms vs 449.3 ms, p = 0.007). Pre-COVID electrocardiograms were located for 172 patients; the QTc recorded on presentation with COVID-19 was longer than the prior measurement in both groups, but was more prolonged in the deceased group (448.4 ms vs 472.9 ms, pre-COVID vs COVID, p < 0.01). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis revealed age, C-reactive protein and prolonged QTc of >455 ms (males) and >465 ms (females) (p = 0.028, HR 1.49 [1.04-2.13]), as predictors of mortality. QTc prolongation beyond these dichotomy limits was associated with increased mortality risk (p = 0.0027, HR 1.78 [1.2-2.6]).

Clinical, psychosocial, and structural factors have been shown to impact PrEP use and adherence among Black MSM. Care coordination of HIV prevention services has the potential to improve PrEP use and adherence for Black MSM, as it has been shown to improve HIV-related care outcomes among people living with HIV. METHODS: Client-centered care coordination (C4) is a multi-level intervention designed to address clinical, psychosocial, and structural barriers to HIV prevention services for Black MSM within HPTN 073, a PrEP demonstration project among Black MSM in three cities in the USA. The current study examined the implementation process of C4, specifically investigating the activities, cost, time, and outcomes associated with the C4 intervention. RESULTS: On average, participants engaged in five care coordination encounters. The vast majority of care coordination activities were conducted by counselors, averaging 30 min per encounter. The cost of care coordination was relatively low with a mean cost of $8.70 per client encounter. CONCLUSION: Although client-centered care coordination was initially implemented in well-resourced communities with robust HIV research and service infrastructure, our findings suggest that C4 can be successfully implemented in resource constrained communities.","output":"Implementation of Client-Centered Care Coordination for HIV Prevention with Black Men Who Have Sex with Men: Activities, Personnel Costs, and Outcomes-HPTN 073"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kenya is home to Africas third largest population of dromedary camels, and production at commercial and local levels are increasingly important. In pastoral and nomadic communities in the arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs), camels play a vital role in food security, while commercial milk production and formalized export markets are rapidly emerging as camel populations expand into non-traditional areas. Until recently, little focus was placed on camels as hosts of zoonotic disease, but the emergence of Middle Eastern respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and the discovery of exposure to the virus in Kenyan camels, highlighted the need for further understanding of this area. This systematised review utilised a robust search strategy to assess the occurrence of camel-associated zoonoses in Kenya and to evaluate the quality of the published literature. Seventy-four studies were identified, covering sixteen pathogens, with an increasing number of good quality studies in recent years. Despite this, the area remains under-researched and there is a lack of robust, high-quality research. Trypanosome spp., Echinococcus granulosus and Brucella spp. appeared most frequently in the literature. Pathogens with the highest reported prevalence were MERS-CoV (0C100%), Echinococcus granulosa (7C60%) and Rift Valley fever virus (7C57%). Exposure to Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetii and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus showed higher levels in camel or camel-associated vectors than other livestock species, although brucellosis was the only disease for which there was robust evidence linking camel and human exposure. Zoonotic agents with less severe human health outcomes, such as Dermatophilosus congolensis and contagious ecthyma, were also represented in the literature. This review provides an important summary of the scope and quality of current knowledge. It demonstrates that further research, and improved adherence to robust study design and reporting are essential if the zoonotic risk from camels in Kenya, and elsewhere, is to be better understood.","output":"Zoonotic Pathogens of Dromedary Camels in Kenya: A Systematised Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Household energy insecurity (HEINS) is detrimental to the health of the poor and most vulnerable in resource-poor settings. However, this effect amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and the uneven implementation of restrictions can create a synergistic burden of diseases and health risks for the most vulnerable in low- and middle-income countries, exacerbating the health equity gap. Based on existing literature, this paper develops three key arguments: (1) COVID-19 increases the health risks of energy insecurity; (2) HEINS increases the risk of spreading COVID-19; and (3) the co-occurrence of COVID-19 and HEINS will have compounding health effects. These arguments make context-specific interventions, rather than a generic global health approach without recourse to existing vulnerabilities critical in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and mitigating the effects of energy insecurity. Targeted international efforts aimed at financing and supporting resource security, effective testing, contact tracing, and the equitable distribution of vaccines and personal protective equipment have the potential to ameliorate the synergistic effects of HEINS and COVID-19 in resource-poor countries.","output":"Household Energy Insecurity and COVID-19 Have Independent and Synergistic Health Effects on Vulnerable Populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the resulting response measures have led to severe limitations of peoples exercise possibilities with diminished physical activity (PA) and increased sedentary behavior (SB).

Although CXR is less sensitive than real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in detecting mild COVID-19, it is nevertheless useful because of equipment portability, low cost and practicality in serial assessments of disease progression among hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to review the typical and relatively atypical CXR manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: The CXRs of 136 COVID-19 patients confirmed through real-time RT-PCR from March to May 2020 were reviewed. Literature search was performed using PubMed. RESULTS: A total of 54 patients had abnormal CXR whilst the others were normal. Typical CXR findings included pulmonary consolidation or ground-glass opacities in a multifocal, bilateral peripheral or lower zone distribution, whereas atypical CXR features comprised cavitation and pleural effusion. CONCLUSION: Typical findings of COVID-19 infection in chest computed tomography studies can also be seen in CXR. The presence of atypical features is associated with worse disease outcome.

Hepatitis viruses were readily detected at high coverage in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C, but only a limited number of sequences resembling other viruses were found. The exception was a library from a patient diagnosed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection that contained multiple sequences matching GB virus C (GBV-C). Abundant GBV-C reads were also found in plasma from patients with AIH, whereas Torque teno virus (TTV) was found at high frequency in samples from patients with AIH and NASH. After taxonomic classification of sequences by BLASTn, a substantial fraction in each library, ranging from 35% to 76%, remained unclassified. These unknown sequences were assembled into scaffolds along with virus, phage and endogenous retrovirus sequences and then analyzed by BLASTx against the non-redundant protein database. Nearly the full genome of a heretofore-unknown circovirus was assembled and many scaffolds that encoded proteins with similarity to plant, insect and mammalian viruses. The presence of this novel circovirus was confirmed by PCR. BLASTx also identified many polypeptides resembling nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) proteins. We re-evaluated these alignments with a profile hidden Markov method, HHblits, and observed inconsistencies in the target proteins reported by the different algorithms. This suggests that sequence alignments are insufficient to identify NCLDV proteins, especially when these alignments are only to small portions of the target protein.

The constant Gag to Gag-Pol ratio is essential for the virion structure and infectivity.

This tRNA(Leu) isoacceptor is particularly rare in human cell lines derived from T-lymphocytes, the cells that are targeted by HIV-1. When UUA decoding is delayed, the frameshifting follows an alternative route, which maintains the Gag to Gag-Pol ratio constant. A second potential slippery site downstream of the first one is normally inefficient but can also support C1-frameshifting when altered by a compensatory resistance mutation in response to current antiviral drug therapy. Together these different regimes allow the virus to maintain a constant C1-frameshifting efficiency to ensure successful virus propagation.","output":"Modulation of HIV-1 Gag/Gag-Pol frameshifting by tRNA abundance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this paper is to investigate how optimistic bias, consumption cognition, news attention, information credibility, and social trust affect the purchase intention of food consumption.

Consequently, genetic alterations that affect the functional aspects of IRF4 can result in clonal transformation and have been identified in various lymphoid malignancies. Over the last decades, a series of studies have demonstrated the critical cellular and structural basis underpinning IRF4-mediated B cell development and associated malignancies.

Studies documenting nutritional habits among night shift workers have relied on inaccurate approximations of dietary intake. The primary purpose of this pilot study was to gather feasibility information regarding the use of a free electronic food diary application, MyFitnessPal, to document on-duty and off-duty eating habits among nurses working 12-h night shift. Secondary aims included comparing average daily intake of nutrients when on-duty versus off-duty and to compare average daily sugar intake to national recommendations for sugar intake. A total of 16 nurses participated with 92% compliance for nutritional logging using the application. Nurses reported significantly more calories consumed from sugar on average when compared to national recommendations both when off-duty (m = 293.5 kcal vs. 173.1 kcal) and on-duty (m = 273.0 kcal vs. 180.4 kcal). No significant differences were detected in self-reported macronutrient consumption within-subjects for on-duty versus off-duty conditions.

APVs are distributed worldwide and cause disease in domestic, pet and wild birds of many species. APVs are transmitted by aerosols and biting insects, particularly mosquitoes and arthropods and are usually named after the bird species from which they were originally isolated. The virus species Fowlpox virus (FWPV) causes disease in poultry and associated mortality is usually low, but in flocks under stress (other diseases, high production) mortality can reach up to 50%. APVs are also major players in viral vaccine vector development for diseases in human and veterinary medicine. Abortive infection in mammalian cells (no production of progeny viruses) and their ability to accommodate multiple gene inserts are some of the characteristics that make APVs promising vaccine vectors. Although abortive infection in mammalian cells conceivably represents a major vaccine bio-safety advantage, molecular mechanisms restricting APVs to certain hosts are not yet fully understood. This review summarizes the current knowledge relating to APVs, including classification, morphogenesis, host-virus interactions, diagnostics and disease, and also highlights the use of APVs as recombinant vaccine vectors.","output":"Avipoxviruses: infection biology and their use as vaccine vectors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Among patients with a transient ischemic attack or minor ischemic strokes, those with ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis of cervicocranial vasculature have the highest risk of recurrent vascular events. METHODS In the double-blind THALES (The Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Ticagrelor and ASA for Prevention of Stroke and Death) trial, we randomized patients with a noncardioembolic, nonsevere ischemic stroke, or high-risk transient ischemic attack to ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily for days 2-30) or placebo added to aspirin (300-325 mg on day 1 followed by 75-100 mg daily for days 2-30) within 24 hours of symptom onset. The present paper reports a prespecified analysis in patients with and without ipsilateral, potentially causal atherosclerotic stenosis 30% of cervicocranial vasculature. The primary end point was time to the occurrence of stroke or death within 30 days. RESULTS Of 11 016 randomized patients, 2351 (21.3%) patients had an ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis. After 30 days, a primary end point occurred in 92/1136 (8.1%) patients with ipsilateral stenosis randomized to ticagrelor and in 132/1215 (10.9%) randomized to placebo (hazard ratio 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56-0.96], P=0.023) resulting in a number needed to treat of 34 (95% CI, 19-171). In patients without ipsilateral stenosis, the corresponding event rate was 211/4387 (4.8%) and 230/4278 (5.4%), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.74-1.08]; P=0.23, Pinteraction=0.245). Severe bleeding occurred in 4 (0.4%) and 3 (0.2%) patients with ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis on ticagrelor and on placebo, respectively (P=NS), and in 24 (0.5%) and 4 (0.1%), respectively, in 8665 patients without ipsilateral stenosis (hazard ratio=5.87 [95% CI, 2.04-16.9], P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS In this exploratory analysis comparing ticagrelor added to aspirin to aspirin alone, we found no treatment by ipsilateral atherosclerosis stenosis subgroup interaction but did identify a higher absolute risk and a greater absolute risk reduction of stroke or death at 30 days in patients with ipsilateral atherosclerosis stenosis than in those without. In this easily identified population, ticagrelor added to aspirin provided a clinically meaningful benefit with a number needed to treat of 34 (95% CI, 19-171).

DESIGN: Nationwide population-based cohort study. SETTING: Norway. PARTICIPANTS: We followed more than 80 000 participants in an ongoing cohort study, the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analysed current life satisfaction in April and again in September/October 2020 for subjects whose work situation and infection status had changed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported satisfaction with life, using a scale from 0 (worst) to 10 (best). We analysed the scale both continuously and as a binary variable (<or 6). RESULTS: Temporary and permanent layoffs, working from a home-based office, and getting a COVID-19 diagnosis were all associated with modestly, but significantly lower concurrent life satisfaction, both in the total on a population level and for subjects experiencing a change in job status between spring and autumn. The associations with change in work situation were stronger for men. For men with permanent job loss, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for low life satisfaction (<6) was 3.2 (95% CI 2.4 to 4.2) in April and 4.9 (95% CI 3.5 to 6.9) in autumn. Among all, a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with an adjusted OR for low life satisfaction of 1.9 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.3) in spring. The strength of associations between work situation and life satisfaction did not vary much across socio-economic strata, but layoffs were more common among those with low education. CONCLUSION: Layoffs, home office and infection status had clear impact on the quality of life as measured with a global life satisfaction scale.

In this direction, this study aims to highlight how the walking behaviors of individuals affected in different geographies' neighborhoods before and during the Pandemic. Design/methodology/approach - This paper focuses on the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and the changing walking behavior of 24 sample regions (514 participants) with the highest incidents of COVID-19 infection from American, European, Asian, Western Pacific, African and Middle Eastern cities. The paper's methodology is supported by an /online questionnaire survey conducted in these 24 disparate neighborhoods in December 2020. Findings - Findings show that \\"walkable access\\" varies over geographies during the Pandemic. Urban amenities within 15-20 min of access become more important than ever. The results unravel that either walkable or non-walkable neighborhoods showcased similarities despite that urban amenities were not within 15-20 min of access. Three prominent aspects should be emphasized to plan walkable neighborhoods: providing walkable access, forming spatial proximity and sustaining social cohesion. Social implications - The availability of daily amenities, such as shopping stores, health care, education services and pharmacies within a 15-20-min walking distance maintain everyday life and increase social interactions. In addition, places with walkable access encourage an active lifestyle and contribute the public health. The impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic movement restrictions on the walking behavior of individuals highlights how the qualities of distance-based urban planning need to be supported with time-based practical attributes that can shape neighborhood planning frameworks.

Considering the lack of appropriate therapy for COVID-19, it is crucial to develop effective treatments instead of supportive approaches. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as multipotent stromal cells have been shown to possess treating potency through inhibiting or modulating the pathological events in COVID-19. MSCs and their exosomes participate in immunomodulation by controlling cell-mediated immunity and cytokine release. Furthermore, they repair the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) malfunction, increase alveolar fluid clearance, and reduce the chance of hypercoagulation. Besides the lung, which is the primary target of SARS-CoV-2, the heart, kidney, nervous system, and gastrointestinal tract are also affected by COVID-19. Thus, the efficacy of targeting these organs via different delivery routes of MSCs and their exosomes should be evaluated to ensure safe and effective MSCs administration in COVID-19. This review focuses on the proposed therapeutic mechanisms and delivery routes of MSCs and their exosomes to the damaged organs. It also discusses the possible application of primed and genetically modified MSCs as a promising drug delivery system in COVID-19.

This study aimed to estimate the financial resources required to implement the Ethiopian EHSP from 2020 to 2030. Furthermore, we explored potential alternatives to increase the fiscal space for health in Ethiopia. We used the OneHealth Tool (OHT) to estimate the costs of expanding the EHSP service provision in the public sector in Ethiopia. Combinations of ingredient-based bottom-up and program-based summary costing approaches were applied. We predicted the fiscal space using assumptions for economic growth, government resource allocations to health, external aid for health, the magnitude of out-of-pocket expenditure, and other private health expenditures as critical factors affecting available resources devoted to health. All costs were valued using 2020 US dollars (USD). To implement the EHSP, 13.0 billion USD (per capita: 94 USD) would be required in 2030. The largest (50-70%) share of estimated costs was for medicines, commodities, and supplies, followed by human resources costs (10-17%). However, the expected available resources based on a business-as-usual fiscal space estimate would be 63 USD per capita for the same year. Therefore, the gap as a percentage of the required resources would be 33% in 2030. The resources needed to implement the EHSP would increase steadily over the projection period due mainly to increases in service coverage targets over time.

The aim of this study was to examine perceptions and behaviours of the general public during the early phase of the Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in the Netherlands. METHODS: Two cross-sectional and one follow-up online survey (survey 1, 30 April-4 May; survey 2, 15-19 June; survey 3, 11-20 August 2009). Adults aged 18 years and above participating in a representative Internet panel were invited (survey 1, n = 456; survey 2, n = 478; follow-up survey 3, n = 934). Main outcome measures were 1) time trends in risk perception, feelings of anxiety, and behavioural responses (survey 1-3) and 2) factors associated with taking preventive measures and strong intention to comply with government-advised preventive measures in the future (survey 3). RESULTS: Between May and August 2009, the level of knowledge regarding Influenza A (H1N1) increased, while perceived severity of the new flu, perceived self-efficacy, and intention to comply with preventive measures decreased. The perceived reliability of information from the government decreased from May to August (62% versus 45%). Feelings of anxiety decreased from May to June, and remained stable afterwards. From June to August 2009, perceived vulnerability increased and more respondents took preventive measures (14% versus 38%). Taking preventive measures was associated with no children in the household, high anxiety, high self-efficacy, more agreement with statements on avoidance, and paying much attention to media information regarding Influenza A (H1N1). Having a strong intention to comply with government-advised preventive measures in the future was associated with higher age, high perceived severity, high anxiety, high perceived efficacy of measures, high self-efficacy, and finding governmental information to be reliable. CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing trends over time in perceived severity and anxiety are consistent with the reality: the clinical picture of influenza turned out to be mild in course of time. Although (inter)national health authorities initially overestimated the case fatality rate, the public stayed calm and remained to have a relatively high intention to comply with preventive measures.","output":"Perceived risk, anxiety, and behavioural responses of the general public during the early phase of the Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in the Netherlands: results of three consecutive online surveys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Anecdotal evidence suggest a direct impact of the SARS-COV-2-pandemic on presentation and severity of major trauma.

Quantitative estimates of the global burden of the 1957 influenza pandemic are lacking. Here we fill this gap by modeling historical mortality statistics. Methods. We used annual rates of age- and cause-specific deaths to estimate pandemic-related mortality in excess of background levels in 39 countries in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Americas. We modeled the relationship between excess mortality and development indicators to extrapolate the global burden of the pandemic. Results. The pandemic-associated excess respiratory mortality rate was 1.9/10 000 population (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2C2.6 cases/10 000 population) on average during 1957C1959. Excess mortality rates varied 70-fold across countries; Europe and Latin America experienced the lowest and highest rates, respectively. Excess mortality was delayed by 1C2 years in 18 countries (46%). Increases in the mortality rate relative to baseline were greatest in school-aged children and young adults, with no evidence that elderly population was spared from excess mortality.

Dembo-PCR simultaneously detects a total of 19 diarrhea-causing pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and protozoa. Specific primerCprobe sets were newly designed for 7 pathogens and were synthesized on the basis of previous reports for 12 pathogens. Assays were optimized to react under the same reaction conditions. The PCR efficiency and correlation coefficient (R(2)) of standard curves for each assay were more than 80% and 0.9766, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity of Dembo-PCR in fecal sample analysis was measured with feces spiked with target pathogens or synthesized DNA that included specific nucleotide target regions. The resulting limits of detection (LOD) for virus-spiked samples, bacteria and DNA fragments were 0.16C1.6 TCID(50) (PFU/reaction), 1.3C13 CFU/reaction and 10C100 copies/reaction, respectively. All reactions showed high sensitivity in pathogen detection.

Research Questions: We seek evidence on whether the lockdown has led to a reduced availability of illegal drugs and whether subjects with substance-related problems tried to cope with possible drug availability issues by increasingly obtaining drugs via the internet, replacing their preferred illegal drug with novel psychoactive substances, including new synthetic opioids (NSO), and/or by seeking drug treatment. Methods: A questionnaire was anonymously filled in by subjects with substance-related disorders, typically attending low-threshold settings, drug consumption facilities, and inpatient detoxification wards from a range of locations in the Western part of Germany. Participants had to both identify their main drug of abuse and to answer questions regarding its availability, price, quality, and routes of acquisition. Results: Data were obtained from 362 participants. The most frequent main substances of abuse were cannabis (n = 109), heroin (n = 103), and cocaine (n = 75). A minority of participants reported decreased availability (8.4%), increased price (14.4%), or decreased quality (28.3%) of their main drug. About 81% reported no change in their drug consumption due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown. A shift to the use of novel psychoactive substances including NSO were reported only by single subjects. Only 1C2% of the participants obtained their main drug via the web. Discussion: Present findings may suggest that recent pandemic-related imposed restrictions may have not been able to substantially influence either acquisition or consumption of drugs within the context of polydrug users (including opiates) attending a range of addiction services in Germany.","output":"Availability of Illegal Drugs During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Western Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past 10 years, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have become widely accepted as an integral player in immunothrombosis, due to their complex interplay with both pathogens and components of the coagulation system. While the release of NETs is an attempt by neutrophils to trap pathogens and constrain infections, NETs can have bystander effects on the host by inducing uncontrolled thrombosis, inflammation, and tissue damage. From an evolutionary perspective, pathogens have adapted to bypass the host innate immune response. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), in particular, proficiently overcomes NET formation using several virulence factors. Here we review mechanisms of NET formation and how these are intertwined with platelet activation, the release of endothelial von Willebrand factor, and the activation of the coagulation system. We discuss the unique ability of S. aureus to modulate NET formation and alter released NETs, which helps S. aureus to escape from the hosts defense mechanisms. We then discuss how platelets and the coagulation system could play a role in NET formation in S. aureus-induced infective endocarditis, and we explain how targeting these complex cellular interactions could reveal novel therapies to treat this disease and other immunothrombotic disorders.","output":"Staphylococcus aureus and Neutrophil Extracellular Traps: The Master Manipulator Meets Its Match in Immunothrombosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disruptions in cancer screening due to the COVID-19 pandemic may disproportionally affect patients with inherited cancer predisposition syndromes, including Lynch syndrome. Herein, we study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on endoscopic surveillance in Lynch syndrome through a prospective study of patients with Lynch syndrome at a tertiary referral center who were scheduled for endoscopic surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown between March 16, 2020 and June 4, 2020. Of our cohort of 302 individuals with Lynch syndrome, 34 (11%) had endoscopic procedures scheduled during the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. Of the 27 patients whose endoscopic surveillance was canceled during this period, 85% rescheduled procedures within 6 months with a median delay of 72 days [interquartile range (IQR), 55-84 days], with identification of an advanced adenoma or gastrointestinal cancer in 13%. Individuals who did not have a rescheduled endoscopic procedure were significantly younger than those with a rescheduled procedure [age 35 (IQR, 26-43) vs. age 55 (IQR, 43-63), P = 0.018]. Male sex was also suggestive of increasing likelihood of not having a rescheduled procedure. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown led to delayed endoscopic surveillance in Lynch syndrome, with potentially impactful delays among young patients. These data also emphasize the importance of timely surveillance in Lynch syndrome during this current, as well as potential future, global pandemics.

Understanding maternal antibody response and transplacental transfer after SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination is important to inform public health recommendations. Methods: This prospective observational cohort study included 351 birthing individuals who had SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. IgG and IgM to SARS-CoV-2 S1 receptor binding domain were measured in maternal and cord blood. Antibody levels and transplacental transfer ratios were compared across 1) disease severity for those with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 2) infection versus vaccination. Findings: There were 252 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 99 who received COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. Birthing people with more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection category had higher maternal and cord blood IgG levels (p=0.0001, p=0.0001). Median IgG transfer ratio was 0.87-1.2. Maternal and cord blood IgG were higher after vaccination than infection (p=0.001, p=0.001). Transfer ratio was higher after 90 days in the vaccinated group (p<0.001). Modeling showed higher amplitude and half-life of maternal IgG following vaccination (p<0.0001). There were no significant differences by fetal sex. Interpretation: COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy leads to higher and longer lasting maternal IgG levels, higher cord blood IgG, and higher transfer ratio after 90 days compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Greater infection severity leads to higher maternal and cord blood antibodies. Maternal IgG decreases over time following both vaccination and infection, reinforcing the importance of vaccination, even after infection, and vaccine boosters for pregnant patients.","output":"Maternal Antibody Response and Transplacental Transfer Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection or Vaccination in Pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to determine the factors affecting the use of cleaning products at the home environment and the frequency of problems during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional research was performed online between 30 August 2020 and 15 September 2020. The population of the study consisted of adults aged between 18 and 80 years, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection forms (introductory information and risk perception form and cleaning products usage characteristics form) were shared through Web2 tools. The questionnaire study was completed with 674 participants between the ages of 18 and 80 years in Turkey. Descriptive statistics and classification tree were used in the analysis of the data. Statistical significance was accepted as P &#8804; .01 in all analyses. RESULTS: During the pandemic period compared with the pre-pandemic period, it was observed that the frequency of cleaning (69.3%) and the amount of cleaning product usage (74.2%) increased significantly and the frequency of problems related to the use of cleaning products was found as 46.9%. The most commonly reported problems were skin disturbances (68%) and shortness of breath (23%). It was determined that the history of contact with the COVID-19 patient, the perceived risk of COVID-19 infection and risky cleaning behaviour were predictive in determining the risk of experiencing problems related to cleaning products. The amount of bleach consumed per month among who did experience problems was higher than those who did not experience problems and was associated with the perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: In the COVID-19 pandemic, human beings have been found to increase the frequency of cleaning and using cleaning products.

It is speculated that therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) can dampen CRS via elimination of pathogenic cytokines. OBJECTIVES: The study is intended to compare the outcomes of COVID-19 patients with CRS treated with TPE and standard care (SC) to their counterparts receiving SC alone. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective cohort study of severe COVID-19 confirmed patients presenting with CRS and admitted to the medical ICU was conducted between March and August 2021. Using case-control (CC) matching 1:1, 162 patients were selected and divided into two equal groups. The primary outcome was 28-day in-hospital survival analysis in severe COVID-19 patients with CRS. However, secondary outcomes included the effect of plasmapheresis on inflammatory markers, the need for mechanical ventilation, the rate of extubation, and the duration of survival. RESULTS: After CC matching, the study cohort had a mean age of 55.41 (range 56.4111.56 in TP+SC and 54.428.94 in SC alone; p=0.22). There were 25.95% males and 74.05% females in both groups. The mean time from first day of illness to hospitalization was 6.532.18 days. The majority of patients with CRS had comorbid conditions (75.9%). Diabetes mellitus was the most common comorbidity (40.1%), followed by hypertension (25.3%), and chronic kidney disease (21%). Notable reduction in some inflammatory markers (D-dimers, LDH, CRP and serum ferritin) (p<0.0001) was observed in the group that received TPE+SC. Moreover, the patients in the plasmapheresis plus standard care group required relatively less mechanical ventilation as compared to the group receiving SC alone (46.9% vs 58.1%, respectively; p>0.05). The rate of extubation in the TP+SC group vs SC alone was 60.5% vs 44.7%, respectively (p>0.05). Similarly, the mortality percentages in both groups were 19.8% and 24.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION: For this particular group of matched patients with COVID-19-induced CRS, TPE+SC was linked with relatively better overall survival, early extubation, and earlier discharge compared to SC alone. As these results were not statistically significant, multi-centered randomized control trials are needed to further elaborate the role of therapeutic plasmapheresis in COVID-19 induced CRS.","output":"Role of Therapeutic Plasmapheresis in SARS-CoV-2 Induced Cytokine Release Syndrome: A Retrospective Cohort Study on COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tujuan penelitian ini untuk mendeskripsikan cara membiasakan pola hidup sehat dan bersih pada anak usia dini selama pandemi COVID-19.

Hypertension was diagnosed according to the 2020 International Society of Hypertension. Subjects were monitored for six months. The primary outcome was the rate of Covid-19 diagnosed by the pharyngeal swab for the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) examination. The secondary endpoints were: (1) severity of Covid-19 among infected participants; (2) rate of hospitalizations; and (3) anti-SRBD antibody levels measured by ECLIA. RESULTS Among 155 participants, 18.7% of them were diagnosed with hypertension, and 31.0% had the desirable BP target according to the current guidelines. Subjects with hypertension, especially those with uncontrolled blood pressure, had a higher incidence of Covid-19 infection than subjects without hypertension. Subjects with symptomatic Covid-19 and hospitalized because of Covid-19 were higher in participants with hypertension. The anti-SRBD antibody levels were lower in the second month after CoronaVac vaccination in hypertensive subjects.

Unobtrusive and ecologically valid methods to monitor longitudinal sleep metrics may therefore have practical value for surveillance and monitoring of infectious illnesses. We leveraged sleep metrics from Sleep Number 360 smart bed users to build a COVID-19 predictive model. METHODS: An IRB approved survey was presented to opting-in users from August to November 2020. COVID-19 test results were reported by 2003/6878 respondents (116 positive; 1887 negative). From the positive group, data from 82 responders (44.711.3 yrs.) who reported the date of symptom onset were used. From the negative group, data from 1519 responders (48.412.9 yrs.) who reported testing dates were used. Sleep duration, sleep quality, restful sleep duration, time to fall asleep, respiration rate, heart rate, and motion level were obtained from ballistocardiography signals stored in the cloud. Data from January to October 2020 were considered. The predictive model consists of two levels: 1) the daily probability of staying healthy calculated by logistic regression and 2) a continuous density Hidden Markov Model to refine the daily prediction considering the past decision history. RESULTS: With respect to their baseline, significant increases in sleep duration, average breathing rate, average heart rate and decrease in sleep quality were associated with symptom exacerbation in COVID-19 positive respondents. In COVID-19 negative respondents, no significant sleep or cardiorespiratory metrics were observed. Evaluation of the predictive model resulted in cross-validated area under the receiving-operator curve (AUC) estimate of 0.840.09 which is similar to values reported for wearable-sensors. Considering additional days to confirm prediction improved the AUC estimate to 0.930.05.

Constant updates of recommendations and restrictions from national authorities may have caused great concern for pregnant women. Reports suggested an increased number of pregnant women choosing to give birth at home, some even unassisted (freebirth) due to concerns of transmission in hospital or reduction in birthplace options. During April and May 2020, we aimed to investigate i) the level of concern about coronavirus transmission in Danish pregnant women, ii) the level of concern related to changes in maternity services due to the pandemic, and iii) implications for choice of place of birth. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional online survey study, inviting all registered pregnant women in Denmark (n = 30,009) in April and May 2020. RESULTS: The response rate was 60% (n = 17,995). Concerns of transmission during pregnancy and birth were considerable; 63% worried about getting severely ill whilst pregnant, and 55% worried that virus would be transmitted to their child. Thirtyeight percent worried about contracting the virus at the hospital. The most predominant concern related to changes in maternity services during the pandemic was restrictions on partners attendance at birth (81%). Especially nulliparous women were concerned about whether cancelled antenatal classes or fewer physical midwifery consultations would affect their ability to give birth or care for their child postpartum.. The proportion of women who considered a home birth was equivalent to pre-pandemic home birth rates in Denmark (3%). During the temporary discontinue of public home birth services, 18% of this group considered a home birth assisted by a private midwife (n = 125), and 6% considered a home birth with no midwifery assistance at all (n = 41). CONCLUSION: Danish pregnant womens concerns about virus transmission to the unborn child and worries about contracting the virus during hospital appointments were considerable during the early pandemic.

We analyzed treatment adherence in comparison with the previous, non-pandemic year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis including patients with pectus carinatum under treatment with a dynamic compressor system using telemedicine at the chest wall centers from two hospitals, private and public, between April and July 2020. A free video conference platform for teleconsultations was employed. We evaluated the incidence of pectus cases with telemedicine, the number of dynamic compressor system prescriptions, the number of patients in the correction phase, and the number who ended treatment. To assess adherence, we compared our cohort with an in-person cohort during the same time frame of the previous, non-pandemic year. In addition, we performed a patient satisfaction survey comprising questions related to socioeconomic status, the likeability of telemedicine, simplicity of modification of the system, and desire to continue with telepectus after the pandemic. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-six telepectus consultations were performed in 76 patients. During this time frame, 15 patients started using the dynamic compressor system. Compared to the previous, non-pandemic year, the number of consultations per patient was similar (2019: 1.92  1 .0 vs. 2020: 1.79  0.8, p = 0.32), and there was a significant reduction in the number of dropouts with the use of telemedicine (9% vs. 1%, p = 0.025).

While the course was generally deemed effective at meeting the learning objectives, some important potential improvements were identified, such as the addition of a group assignment using geologic maps at the beginning of the course. This additional module will give students an important background in geologic maps and encourage groupwork and idea sharing. Equipped with these skills, they will be better prepared and remain engaged for the remainder of the course. ? 2021 National Association of Geoscience Teachers.","output":"Building an online field course using digital and physical tools including VR field sites and virtual core logging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a very open competitive context where pure online players are consistently gaining market share, the use of digital devices is a steady trend which is penetrating physical retail stores as a tool for retailers to improve customer experience and increase engagement.

BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of knowledge about the experiences of clinical nurses during COVID\\\\19. However, there is less evidence about the experiences of nurse managers during the pandemic. METHODS: Eight nurse managers, from acute care and outpatient settings, completed semistructured interviews about how their roles had changed during the pandemic, how they felt about these changes, and what had gone well or been difficult. Each participant was interviewed once, for 20C60 min. We used thematic analysis methods to analyse the interview transcripts. FINDINGS: Nurse managers had to coordinate care in a context of uncertainty and guidance that changed frequently. Participants found that their roles and responsibilities either expanded to include more duties, or they were asked to take on a completely new role, with no orientation or training. Nurse managers were expected to provide support to their staff and patients, but did not necessarily receive support themselves. Participants were expected to plan simultaneously for care during the pandemic and for a return to normal working conditions. These factors contributed to challenging and difficult participant experiences of managing during COVID\\\\19. CONCLUSION: Nurse managers' experiences during COVID\\\\19 are influenced by changes to their roles and the support they received. Nurse managers continue to support high\\\\quality care despite working a difficult context. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Where possible, nurse managers can be supported to extend their roles or receive additional education and support if they are required to take on new responsibilities. Nurse managers require support in order to be a resource for their staff.","output":"The office of disaster management nurse managers' experiences during COVID\\\\19: A qualitative interview study using thematic analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article presents the statistics on the percentage of the U.S. citizens staying at home and following government measures for social distancing.","output":"By the Numbers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) implemented an innovative project for assisting neutron activation analysis laboratories in improving the validity of their results by feedback workshops for discussion of results from participation in interlaboratory comparisons rounds in 2010.

This exact computation meant that multiple-comparisons corrected P values also had high precision, which is crucial when performing millions or billions of tests in large databases. Here, we introduce an improvement to the algorithmic complexity of this computation from O(mn(3)) to O(mn(2)), where m and n are the numbers of recombination-informative sites in the candidate recombinant.

The search for alternative diagnostic techniques is still ongoing. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of microultrasound (microUS) for the diagnosis of csPCa within prospectively collected cohort of patients with a suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa) according to MRI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 320 consecutive patients with at least one Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) &#8805;3 lesion according to MRI were prospectively enrolled. INTERVENTION: All patients received microUS before prostate biopsy using the ExactVu system; the Prostate Risk Identification using microUS (PRI-MUS) protocol was used to identify targets. The urologists were blinded to MRI results until after the microUS targeting was completed. All patients received both targeted (based on either microUS or MRI findings) and randomized biopsies. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The sensitivity and specificity of microUS to determine the presence of csPCa (defined as at least one core with a Gleason score &#8805;7 PCa) were determined. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was fitted to determine the predictors of csPCa. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Clinically significant PCa was diagnosed in 116 (36.3%) patients. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of microUS for csPCa diagnosis were 89.7% and 81.5%, while specificity and positive predictive value were 26.0% and 40.8%, respectively. A combination of microUS-targeted and randomized biopsies would allow diagnosing the same proportion of csPCa as that diagnosed by an approach combining MRI-targeted and randomized biopsies (n = 113; 97.4%), with only three (2.6%) csPCa cases diagnosed by a microUS-targeted and three (2.6%) by an MRI-targeted approach. In a logistic regression model, an increasing PRI-MUS score was an independent predictor of csPCa (p &#8804; 0.005). The main limitation of the current study is represented by the fact that all patients had suspicious MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Microultrasound is a promising imaging modality for targeted prostate biopsies. Our results suggest that a microUS-based biopsy strategy may be capable of diagnosing the great majority of cancers, while missing only few patients with csPCa. PATIENT SUMMARY: According to our results, microultrasound (microUS) may represent an effective diagnostic alternative to magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer, providing high sensitivity and a high negative predictive value. Further randomized studies are needed to confirm the potential role of microUS in the diagnostic pathway of patients with a suspicion of prostate cancer.","output":"Diagnostic Accuracy of Microultrasound in Patients with a Suspicion of Prostate Cancer at Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Single-institutional Prospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the registration quality of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical trials for COVID-19, H1N1, and SARS. METHOD: We searched for clinical trial registrations of TCM in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) on April 30, 2020. The registration quality assessment is based on the WHO Trial Registration Data Set (Version 1.3.1) and extra items for TCM information, including TCM background, theoretical origin, specific diagnosis criteria, description of intervention, and outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 136 records were examined, including 129 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) and 7 H1N1 influenza (H1N1) patients. The deficiencies in the registration of TCM clinical trials (CTs) mainly focus on a low percentage reporting detailed information about interventions (46.6%), primary outcome(s) (37.7%), and key secondary outcome(s) (18.4%) and a lack of summary result (0%). For the TCM items, none of the clinical trial registrations reported the TCM background and rationale; only 6.6% provided the TCM diagnosis criteria or a description of the TCM intervention; and 27.9% provided TCM outcome(s). CONCLUSION: Overall, although the number of registrations of TCM CTs increased, the registration quality was low. The registration quality of TCM CTs should be improved by more detailed reporting of interventions and outcomes, TCM-specific information, and sharing of the result data.

Indirect immunofluorescence test and sandwich-ELISA were used to verify that Bm-P12A3C could express the target cassette. Expression products from silkworm were diluted to 30 folds and used as antigen to immunize cattle. Specific antibody was induced in all vaccinated animals. After challenge with virulent homologous virus, four of the five animals were completely protected, and clinical symptoms were alleviated and delayed in the remaining one. Furthermore, a PD(50) (50% bovine protective dose) test was performed to assess the bovine potency of the subunit vaccine. The result showed the subunit vaccine could achieve 6.34 PD(50) per dose.

This situation arises considering that the disaster can directly and indirectly affect the healthcare system's capacity to serve the COVID-19 cases. With severely damaged healthcare facilities due to the disaster, there will be severely ill COVID-19 cases unmanaged. The coupling and interplay between these two phenomena can indeed be catastrophic. One of the regions where this issue becomes concerned is in Southeast Asia, where most of the Asian countries lie in the fragile ring of fire ecosystem, contributing to the high tsunami and earthquake disasters in the world. At the same time, Asia is one of the regions that have been severely impacted due to the current COVID-19 Delta Variant. Recently, a more contagious Omicron Variant has emerged and put a more massive burden on the healthcare facilities that are impacted by disasters. Then, in this situation, this paper aims to assess healthcare resilience in managing the Omicron pandemic amid disaster impacts. SIR simulation was used to determine whether severely ill Omicron cases were below or above healthcare and ICU capacity under different vaccination coverage. Our result confirms that vaccination coverage was the imminent factor in reducing the severely ill cases in every healthcare facility, whether the facilities were damaged or not. Increasing vaccination coverage from 30% to 60% will significantly reduce the number of severely ill cases that fall below the capacity of healthcare. Based on the current SIR model on the Omicron epidemic variables and Ro, it is estimated that the Omicron will reach its peak after 180 days in February 2022 and will totally disappear in May 2022 in this modeled area. When healthcare system facilities were fully operational and no disaster happened, combined with 60% vaccination rates, all Omicron case numbers were below and under the available hospital beds and even available ICU beds. While the situation is changed when a disaster occurs and causes 30% damage or reduction to healthcare facilities. In this situation, there are portions of Omicron cases that cannot be managed by the healthcare system since the cases have exceeded the available beds. The situations become more apparent where the healthcare facilities are severely damaged and lose 60% of their functionality. In this situation, all modeled Omicron cases and even the severe cases have exceeded the ICU capacity.","output":"SIR Modeling the Dual Disaster Impacts of Omicron B.1.1.529 and Natural Disaster Events on Simulated 6 Months (from December 2021 to May 2022) Healthcare System Resiliences in Fragile SE Asia Ring of Fire Ecosystems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To report a case of combined central retinal vein and artery occlusion that evolved into ischemic optic neuropathy following the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination.

In this study, we aimed to determine the impact of HFNOT on oxygenation status and also various predictors of HFNOT failure. Methods: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted in COVID-positive critically ill adult patients (aged>18 years) with AHRF, who were unable to maintain SpO2>90% on a non-rebreathing face mask at an oxygen flow 15 litres/minute. Respiratory variables (PaO2/FiO2, SpO2, and RR) before HFNOT (baseline), then at 1-hour, 6-hour, 7-day, and 14-day after HFNOT application, were recorded. Borg CR10 scale and visual analog scale were used to evaluate the subjective sensation of dyspnoea and comfort level respectively. Students t, MannCWhitney U or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used as applicable. Multivariate logistic regression and Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to determine factors associated with HFNOT failure. Results: 114 patients were included with HFNOT failure rate of 29%. The Median PaO2/FiO2 ratio at baseline (before initiation of HFNOT) was 99.5 (80-110) which significantly increased at various time points (1-hour, 6-hour, 7-days, and 14-day) after HFNOT initiation in the successful group. Patients reported significant improvement in sensation of breathlessness (9 [8-10], 3 [2-4];p<0.001) as well as in comfort level (2 [1-2], 8 [4-9];p<0.001).

Neonates with respiratory viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may pose a risk to healthcare workers. International guidelines differ on methods to minimize the risk due to limited data. OBJECTIVE: We examined the expiratory airflow dispersion during common neonatal resuscitation AGMPs using infant simulators. METHODS: Expiratory airflow dispersion in term and preterm manikins was simulated (n = 288) using fine particle smoke at tidal volumes of 5 ml/kg. Using ImageJ, we quantified dispersion during common airway procedures including endotracheal tube (ETT) and T-piece ventilation. RESULTS: Maximal expiratory dispersion distances for the unsupported airway and disconnected uncuffed ETT scenarios were 30.2 and 22.7 cm (term); 22.1 and 17.2 cm (preterm), respectively. Applying T-piece positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) via an ETT (ETTPEEP ) generated no expiratory dispersion but increased tube leak during term simulation, while ventilation breaths (ETTVENT ) caused significant expiratory dispersion and leak. There was no measurable dispersion during face mask ventilation. For term uncuffed ETT ventilation, the particle filter eliminated expiratory dispersion but increased leak. No expiratory dispersion and negligible leak were observed when combining a cuffed ETT and filter. Angulated T-pieces generated the greatest median dispersion distances of 35.8 cm (ETTPEEP ) and 23.3 cm (ETTVENT ). CONCLUSIONS: Airflow dispersion during neonatal AGMPs is greater than previously postulated and potentially could contaminate healthcare providers during resuscitation of infants infected with contagious viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. It is possible to mitigate this risk using particle filters and cuffed ETTs.

Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptors blockers (ARB) has been shown to increase angiotensin converting enzyme 2 expression by up to 5-fold. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: These findings coupled with observations of the high prevalence and mortality among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with underlying cardiovascular disease have led to a speculation that ACEIs/ARBs may predispose to higher risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis of the association between prior use of ACEIs and ARBs and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or hospitalization due to COVID-19 disease. DATA SOURCES: We searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Scopus, and Medrxiv.org preprint server until June 18, 2020. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: Ten studies (6 cohorts and 4 case control) that enrolled a total of 23,892 patients and 853,369 controls were eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis. One study was excluded from the analysis because of high risk of bias. Prior use of ACEIs was not associated with an increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 or hospitalization due to COVID-19 disease, odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval (0.91-1.05), I2 = 15%. Similarly, prior use of ARBs was not associated with an increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2, odds ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval (0.98-1.10), I2 = 0%. CONCLUSION: Cumulative evidence suggests that prior use of ACEIs or ARBs is not associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 or hospitalization due to COVID-19 disease. Our results provide a reassurance to the public not to discontinue prescribed ACEIs/ARBs because of fear of COVID-19.","output":"Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers and the Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Infection or Hospitalization With COVID-19 Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to explore the relationship between psychological distress and post-traumatic stress disorder among Chinese participants as the result of COVID-19 outbreak.

We aimed to investigate the impact of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic on the management and outcome of the patients with TIA. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from a registry of consecutive TIA patients assessed at the Stroke Department, Imperial College Health Care Trust, London, during the national lockdown period (between March 23 2020 and 30 June 2020). As controls, we evaluated the clinical reports and stroke quality metrics of patients presenting to the TIA clinic in the same period of 2019. RESULTS: Between 23 March 2020 and 30 June 2020, 136 patients were assessed using the telemedicine TIA clinic, compared to 180 patients evaluated with face-to-face consultation in the same period in 2019. Patients' characteristics were similar in both groups. At 3 months after the TIA, there were no significant differences in the proportion of patients admitted to the hospital for recurrent TIA/stroke or any other cardiovascular cause from the 2020 period compared to the same period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed that during the pandemic, our telemedicine consultations of TIA patients were not associated with an increased 3-month rate of recurrent TIA/stroke or cardiovascular hospital admissions.

We also introduce some operative skills for single-incision laparoscopic surgery. METHODS From May 2009 to July 2011, 15 patients underwent umbilical single-incision laparoscopic liver cyst unroofing. All the clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. Another 15 simple liver cyst patients who received standard laparoscopic liver cyst unroofing at our hospital during the same period--with a similar age, nature of the cyst, and position to the single-incision group--were selected to undergo a case-control study. The operative time, blood loss, recovery time of gastrointestinal function, volume of postoperative drainage, postoperative drainage time, postoperative hospitalization time, and postoperative recurrence rate were compared between the two groups. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the single-incision group and standard group in operative time (58.3  7.43 minutes vs 58.7  6.14 minutes), blood loss (17.0  3.19 mL vs 14.7  1.86 mL), recovery time of gastrointestinal function (2.5  0.22 days vs 2.4  0.22 days), volume of postoperative drainage (408.0  119.5 mL vs 450.0  89.5 mL), postoperative drainage time (2.6  0.55 days vs 3.7  0.59 days), or postoperative hospitalization time (4.8  0.44 days vs 5.2  0.56 days) (P > .05). The postoperative follow-up period was 1 to 24 months. CONCLUSIONS Compared with standard laparoscopic liver cyst unroofing, single-incision laparoscopic liver cyst unroofing shows no significant difference during the overall treatment process. In addition to the advantages of less trauma, more rapid recovery, and shorter hospital stay, single-incision laparoscopic surgery can reach the effect of \\"no scar\\" and can be safely and effectively carried out.","output":"Single-incision laparoscopic surgery versus standard laparoscopic surgery for unroofing of hepatic cysts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Subacute thyroiditis is a self-limiting condition brought about by an inflammatory reaction often linked to a recent viral infection. SARS-COV2 (COVID-19), an RNA coronavirus that started a global pandemic in December 2019 has been linked mostly to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, there have been increasing reports of its effect on other organ systems. We present a case of a 32-year-old female recovering from COVID-19, only to develop silent thyroiditis afterwards. Clinical Case: A 32-year-old female with anxiety disorder but otherwise in excellent health was diagnosed with COVID-19 via nasal swab RT-PCR after experiencing low grade fever and cough. She quarantined at home and was on her way to recovery when, a few weeks later, she began to experience increasing bouts of chest pain with no relation to activity, intermittent headaches and lower extremity edema. This prompted her to visit the emergency department. Work-up done at that time was unremarkable and her symptoms were attributed mostly to anxiety. She was advised to follow-up as an outpatient with a cardiologist. One month later, due to the persistence of her fatigue, low exercise tolerance and tremors, she decided to seek consult with a cardiologist. An electrocardiogram done during that visit showed normal sinus rhythm with poor-R wave progression and early repolarization changes. Both the echocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitoring, which were subsequently done, were unremarkable. Blood work-up, however, revealed a significantly low thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 0.17 mU/L, for which she was referred to an endocrinologist. A month later, she sought consult with an endocrinologist. Thyroid gland was non-tender on palpation. Repeat blood work-up showed an elevated TSH level (23.50 mU/L) with a low Free T4 (0.42 ng/dL) and an elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) level (900 mU/mL), indicative of subacute thyroiditis, but without associated neck pain. Thyroid sonography done showed diffusely heterogeneous thyroid lobes with no evidence of a dominant mass or nodule. A decision was made to start her on low dose levothyroxine. Two months into treatment, she underwent repeat thyroid hormone levels. Normal TSH and normal free T4 were observed. However, TPO-Ab was still elevated. It was decided to continue her therapy for one more month before gradually tapering her levothyroxine dose. She was told to follow-up in a month for further monitoring. Conclusion: Subacute thyroiditis associated with COVID-19 infection has become a more common occurrence as more cases of COVID-19 are noted worldwide. Our patient followed the usual course of subacute thyroiditis, initially presenting with a thyrotoxicosis phase which typically lasts 4-10 weeks, then subsequently developing hypothyroidism, inadvertently needing thyroid hormone replacement. What made this case more intriguing was that she did not have severe anterior neck pain, the classic clinical presentation of subacute thyroiditis. While there is a very strong association between COVID-19 and respiratory failure, there is paucity of evidence linking COVID-19 to dysfunction of other body systems. This case of thyroiditis presenting post COVID-19 illness, buttresses the versatility of COVID-19. Physicians should keep this in mind when evaluating a COVID-19 survivor who continue to present with persistent tachycardia or palpitations with or without anterior neck pain even after a month or two from infection. Routine follow-up TSH assay on COVID-19 survivors may be a valuable consideration.","output":"Palpitations and Fatigue Post COVID: A Harbinger of Silent Thyroiditis!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Compartmental models in epidemiology characterize the spread of an infectious disease by formulating ordinary differential equations to quantify the rate of disease progression through subpopulations defined by the Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) scheme. The classic rate law central to the SIR compartmental models assumes that the rate of transmission is first order regarding the infectious agent. The current study demonstrates that this assumption does not always hold and provides a theoretical rationale for a more general rate law, inspired by mixed-order chemical reaction kinetics, leading to a modified mathematical model for non-first-order kinetics. Using observed data from 127 countries during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrated that the modified epidemic model is more realistic than the classic, first-order-kinetics based model. We discuss two coefficients associated with the modified epidemic model: transmission rate constant k and transmission reaction order n. While k finds utility in evaluating the effectiveness of control measures due to its responsiveness to external factors, n is more closely related to the intrinsic properties of the epidemic agent, including reproductive ability. The rate law for the modified compartmental SIR model is generally applicable to mixed-kinetics disease transmission with heterogeneous transmission mechanisms. By analyzing early-stage epidemic data, this modified epidemic model may be instrumental in providing timely insight into a new epidemic and developing control measures at the beginning of an outbreak.","output":"An epidemic model for non-first-order transmission kinetics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The first case of COVID-19 in the Malawi prison system was reported in July 2020. Human rights organisations raised concerns about the possibility of significant COVID-19 outbreaks and deaths in the prison system, because of the poor infrastructure, lack of healthcare and adequate COVID-19 mitigation measures, existing co-morbidities (tuberculosis, HIV and hepatitis C), malnutrition and poor health of many prisoners. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The authors conducted a legal-realist assessment of the Malawian prison system response to COVID-19 during state disaster measures, with a specific focus on the right to health and standards of healthcare as mandated in international, African and domestic law. FINDINGS: The Malawi prison system was relatively successful in preventing serious COVID-19 outbreaks in its prisons, despite the lack of resources and the ad hoc reactive approach adopted. Whilst the Malawi national COVID plan was aligned to international and regional protocols, the combination of infrastructural deficits (clinical staff and medical provisions) and poor conditions of detention (congestion, lack of ventilation, hygiene and sanitation) were conducive to poor health and the spread of communicable disease. The state of disaster declared by the Malawi Government and visitation restrictions at prisons worsened prison conditions for those working and living there. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: In sub-Saharan Africa, there is limited capacity of prisons to adequately respond to COVID-19. This is the first legal-realist assessment of the Malawian prison system approach to tackling COVID-19, and it contributes to a growing evidence of human rights-based investigations into COVID-19 responses in African prisons (Ethiopia, South Africa and Zimbabwe).","output":"A legal-realist assessment of human rights, right to health and standards of healthcare in the Malawian prison system during COVID-19 state disaster measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Low-carbon transformation has become a key priority in China, as demonstrated in the implementation of the Carbon Peak, Carbon Neutralization policy, leading to increasing concern of environmental performance at the corporate level.

However, interventions in recent decades have helped lower the incidence of several diseases despite the country's large, frequently mobile population and socio-economic challenges. Increasing globalization, rapid urbanization and a warming climate now add to the complexity of disease control and prevention and could challenge China's capacity to respond to threats of emerging and re-emerging zoonoses. To investigate this notion, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 30 infectious disease experts in four cities in China. The case study diseases under discussion were malaria, dengue fever and haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, all of which may be influenced by changing meteorological conditions. Data were analysed using standard qualitative techniques. The study participants viewed the current disease prevention and control system favourably and were optimistic about China's capacity to manage climate-sensitive diseases in the future. Several recommendations emerged from the data including the need to improve health literacy in the population regarding the transmission of infectious diseases and raising awareness of the health impacts of climate change amongst policymakers and health professionals. Participants thought that research capacity could be strengthened and human resources issues for front-line staff should be addressed. It was considered important that authorities are well prepared in advance for outbreaks such as dengue fever in populous subtropical areas, and a prompt and coordinated response is required when outbreaks occur. Furthermore, health professionals need to remain skilled in the identification of diseases for which incidence is declining, so that re-emerging or emerging trends can be rapidly identified.

Two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries have multiple conditions (eg, diabetes and osteoarthritis) and account for more than 90% of Medicare spending. Patients with MCCs also experience lower quality of life and worse medical and psychiatric outcomes than patients without MCCs. In primary care settings, where MCCs are generally treated, care often focuses on laboratory results and medication management, and not quality of life, due in part to time constraints. eHealth systems, which have been shown to improve multiple outcomes, may be able to fill the gap, supplementing primary care and improving these patients lives. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the effects of ElderTree (ET), an eHealth intervention for older adults with MCCs, on quality of life and related measures. METHODS: In this unblinded study, 346 adults aged 65 years and older with at least 3 of 5 targeted high-risk chronic conditions (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and BMI 30 kg/m2) were recruited from primary care clinics and randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to one of 2 conditions: usual care (UC) plus laptop computer, internet service, and ET or a control consisting of UC plus laptop and internet but no ET. Patients with ET have access for 12 months and will be followed up for an additional 6 months, for a total of 18 months. The primary outcomes of this study are the differences between the 2 groups with regard to measures of quality of life, psychological well-being, and loneliness. The secondary outcomes are between-group differences in laboratory scores, falls, symptom distress, medication adherence, and crisis and long-term health care use. We will also examine the mediators and moderators of the effects of ET. At baseline and months 6, 12, and 18, patients complete written surveys comprising validated scales selected for good psychometric properties with similar populations; laboratory data are collected from eHealth records; health care use and chronic conditions are collected from health records and patient surveys; and ET use data are collected continuously in system logs. We will use general linear models and linear mixed models to evaluate primary and secondary outcomes over time, with treatment condition as a between-subjects factor. Separate analyses will be conducted for outcomes that are noncontinuous or not correlated with other outcomes. RESULTS: Recruitment was conducted from January 2018 to December 2019, and 346 participants were recruited. The intervention period will end in June 2021. CONCLUSIONS: With self-management and motivational strategies, health tracking, educational tools, and peer community and support, ET may help improve outcomes for patients coping with ongoing, complex MCCs.

METHODS: The currently available literature was reviewed for microbiologically confirmed infections by 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 at the time of writing (13 February 2020). A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and Cochrane Library. Search terms included 'novel coronavirus' or '2019-nCoV' or 'COVID-19'. RESULTS: Published cases occurred mostly in males (age range, 8-92 years). Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases [e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis] that were surprisingly underreported. Fever was present in all of the case series available, flanked by cough, dyspnoea, myalgia and fatigue. Multiple bilateral lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV infection, at least in the early phases of the disease.

This includes data obtained from both healthy obese volunteers and obese patients with various CVD conditions enrolled in rivaroxaban clinical trials, along with data obtained from postmarketing real-world evidence studies. Assessment of the clinical pharmacology and population pharmacokinetics in obese individuals revealed no clinically relevant effects of increased weight. Additionally, subgroup analyses from each of the pivotal phase III trials supporting the current approved labeling also demonstrated consistent efficacy and safety results in obese patients. Lastly, these findings are further supported by several recent real-world evidence studies assessing the continued effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban.

While the risk of contamination of food products is possibly due to survival of the virus in the air in food processing operations if preventive measures are not followed, survival of the virus on fresh foods is dependent on the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the specific foods and antimicrobial interventions used during production. Even if the virus remains infective on contaminated foods, maintenance of infectivity after ingestion of food and subsequent invasion of tissue has not been reported. An alternate route of infection from contaminated foods can be during handling of foods and subsequent spread of the virus to other surfaces such as face, nose, leading to infection. However, due to the extensive treatments foods receive during processing, often inhospitable environs of the food products and further food preparation prior to consumption significantly reduce the risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","output":"Coronaviruses - Potential human threat from foodborne transmission?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background & Objective: The Covid-19 pandemic is an unpresented worldwide health emergency that has totally changed how the medical community treat patients with stroke. Deviation from the usual pathways on stroke management has become the collateral damage of this pandemic. This present review summarizes the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on stroke care. Methods: The research question was answered with a systematic literature and results were summarized narratively. A literature search in the databases PubMed, Google Scholar, ProQuest, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, CIHNL, Open Grey, Grey Net and PROSPERO between 2019 to August 2020 was performed. Three authors reviewed the full texts of potentially relevant studies to determine their eligibility for inclusion. Results: Fourteen studies were included in this review. There was a delay in hospital presentation, door-to-needle time and door-to-imaging time in the process flow of stroke management during the pandemic. There was also a decrease in the number of admissions, rate of IV thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy and rehabilitation referrals. Conclusions: The Covid-19 pandemic has totally changed how patients with acute stroke are managed. There is a need to devise ways to circumvent this problem to maximize patient recovery without compromising patient safety.

This activity is being developed as a potential antiviral therapeutic strategy. Studies in vitro, and some in vivo, appear to show the feasibility of using RNAi to treat virus infection. Therapeutic use of RNAi seems to be promising when directed against viruses that cause localized acute infections in accessible target cells. Therapeutic strategies using RNAi against viruses that cause chronic infections, such as HIV, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus, are more difficult to design, but studies have begun to address identifiable problems. Two clinical trials using RNAi have recently been initiatedone phase II trial against respiratory syncytial virus and a phase I trial against HIV. It will be of much interest to see whether nucleic acid therapies can offer another route to treating viral infection.","output":"The potential of RNA interference-based therapies for viral infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a world epidemic disease and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The emergence of divergent variants in the context of a heterogeneous and evolving neutralizing antibody response in host populations might compromise protection afforded by vaccines or prior infection. METHODS: We measured neutralizing antibody titers in 169 longitudinally collected plasma samples using pseudotypes bearing the Wuhan-hu-1 or the Omicron variant or a laboratory-designed neutralization-resistant SARS-CoV-2 spike (PMS20). Plasmas were obtained from convalescents who did or did not subsequently receive an mRNA vaccine, or naive individuals who received 3-doses of mRNA or 1-dose Ad26 vaccines. Samples were collected approximately 1, 5C6 and 12 months after initial vaccination or infection. RESULTS: Like PMS20, the Omicron spike protein was substantially resistant to neutralization compared to Wuhan-hu-1. In convalescent plasma the median deficit in neutralizing activity against PMS20 or Omicron was 30- to 60-fold. Plasmas from recipients of 2 mRNA vaccine doses were 30- to 180- fold less potent against PMS20 and Omicron than Wuhan-hu-1. Notably, previously infected or two-mRNA dose vaccinated individuals who received additional mRNA vaccine dose(s) had 38 to 154-fold and 35 to 214-fold increases in neutralizing activity against Omicron and PMS20 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Omicron exhibits similar distribution of sequence changes and neutralization resistance as does a laboratory-designed neutralization-resistant spike protein, suggesting natural evolutionary pressure to evade the human antibody response. Currently available mRNA vaccine boosters, that may promote antibody affinity maturation, significantly ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers.","output":"Plasma neutralization properties of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has become increasingly available with the introduction of devices that are specifically approved for use during pregnancy. Evidence in the form of randomized-controlled trials and cohort studies continues to build support for the use of CGM during pregnancy to improve measures of maternal glycemia as well as obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Based on data from the CGM in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (CONCEPTT) trial alongside a Swedish cohort study of real-world outcomes of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines now recommend that real-time CGM be offered to all pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. Based on these guidelines, all pregnant individuals in the United Kingdom with type 1 diabetes will receive government-funded real-time CGM for a 12-month duration. These guidelines are a game-changer and will continue to facilitate more widespread access to CGM use in the United Kingdom and beyond.

Poor similarity of the spectrum among inbred baseline mice may limit the ability to discriminate true signals from those involving specific experimental factors. The repertoire similarity of the baseline status lacks intensive measurements. RESULTS: We measured the repertoire similarity of IgH in blood and spleen samples from untreated BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice to investigate the baseline status of the two inbred strains. The antibody pool was stratified by the isotype of IgA, IgG and IgM. Between individuals, the results showed better convergence of CDR3 and clonal lineage profiles in IgM than in IgA and IgG, and better robustness of somatic mutation networks in IgM than in IgA and IgG. It also showed that the CDR3 clonotypes and clonal lineages shared better in the spleen samples than in the blood samples. The animal batch differences were detected in CDR3 evenness, mutated clonotype proportions, and maximal network degrees. A cut-off of 95% identity in the CDR3 nucleotide sequences was suitable for clonal lineage establishment.

Using transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), we investigated the spatiotemporal distribution and pathomorphological features in the CNS following intranasal infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as after prior influenza A virus infection. Apart from Omicron, we found all variants to frequently spread to and within the CNS. Infection was restricted to neurons and appeared to spread from the olfactory bulb mainly in basally oriented regions in the brain and into the spinal cord, independent of ACE2 expression and without evidence of neuronal cell death, axonal damage or demyelination. However, microglial activation, microgliosis and a mild macrophage and T cell dominated inflammatory response was consistently observed, accompanied by apoptotic death of endothelial, microglial and immune cells, without their apparent infection. Microgliosis and immune cell apoptosis indicate a potential role of microglia for pathogenesis and viral effect in COVID-19 and the possible impairment of neurological functions, especially in long COVID. These data may also be informative for the selection of therapeutic candidates and broadly support the investigation of agents with adequate penetration into relevant regions of the CNS.","output":"Neuroinvasion and Neurotropism by SARS-CoV-2 Variants in the K18-hACE2 Mouse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing capacity demands in the access networks require inventive concepts for the transmission and distribution of digital as well as analog signals over the same network.

The present study aimed to explore the prevalence of DEBs in a sample of Italian children and adolescents with T1D and in matched-pair healthy controls during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 138 children and adolescents with T1D (aged 8.01-19.11 years, 65 boys) attending a Southern Italian diabetic service and 276 age- and gender-matched healthy peers voluntarily completed an online survey about eating behaviors (ChEAT and EAT-26), anthropometric characteristics, and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: 8.69% (N = 12) of participants with T1D and 13.4% (N = 37) of controls had ChEAT/EAT-26 scores indicating presence of DEBs, with no differences between patients-whether children (total ChEAT score F(1, 157) = .104, p = .748) or adolescents (total EAT-26 score F(1, 255) = .135, p = .731)-and healthy peers. zBMI values were lower than those measured in the latest diabetes visit (p < .0001), while HbA1c values remained unchanged (p = .110). In both groups, adolescents had lower Oral Control scores than children (T1D: F(1, 138) = 20.411, p < .0001, ?2 = .132, controls: F(1, 276) = 18.271, p < .0001, ?2 = .063); additionally, gender (female) and age were found to be significant predictors of several ChEAT/EAT-26 scores. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study suggested that children and adolescents with T1D did not experience more DEB symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown compared to healthy controls. Results revealed DEBs as more of a female adolescent developmental issue rather than a result of the challenges of living with a chronic illness under quarantine measures. Possible effects of parental pressure on their children's eating behaviors in the context of home confinement and of using a non-diabetes-specific measure to assess DEBs are discussed.","output":"Disordered eating behaviors in youths with type 1 diabetes during COVID-19 lockdown: an exploratory study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At present more than 250 FDA approved chlorine containing drugs were available in the market and many pharmaceutically important drug candidates in pre-clinical trials.

Traditionally, the process of genetic testing resided fully within a medical infrastructure, from identification of appropriate testing candidates to gene selection to risk mitigation recommendations. More recently, decreasing costs, advancing technology, and a growing understanding of therapeutic implications of certain genetic test results have led to more widespread uptake of testing that increasingly involves broad multigene panels. Germline genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility can now be obtained through one of three approaches: through clinical care; a direct-to-consumer (DTC) approach that is entirely consumer-driven; or a hybrid, patient-initiated, provider-mediated model. Increased access to testing has led to extensive dialogue about the best way to conduct testing and act on results. Points of discussion include: selection of appropriate candidates for genetic testing; optimal composition of genes on panels; informed consent; safe return of results; privacy; and legal protections for those found to have relevant pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants.

The rapid development of safe and protective vaccines against this disease is a global priority. CoronaVac is a vaccine prototype based on inactivated SARS-CoV-2, which has shown promising safety and immunogenicity profiles in pre-clinical studies and phase 1/2 trials in China. To this day, four phase 3 clinical trials are ongoing with CoronaVac in Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and Chile. This article reports the safety and immunogenicity results obtained in a subgroup of participants aged 18 years and older enrolled in the phase 3 Clinical Trial held in Chile. Methods: This is a multicenter phase 3 clinical trial. Healthcare workers aged 18 years and older were randomly assigned to receive two doses of CoronaVac or placebo separated by two weeks (0-14). We report preliminary safety results obtained for a subset of 434 participants, and antibody and cell-mediated immunity results obtained in a subset of participants assigned to the immunogenicity arm. The primary and secondary aims of the study include the evaluation of safety parameters and immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2 after immunization, respectively. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04651790). Findings: The recruitment of participants occurred between November 27th, 2020, until January 9th, 2021. 434 participants were enrolled, 397 were 18-59 years old, and 37 were over 60 years old. Of these, 270 were immunized with CoronaVac, and the remaining 164 participants were inoculated with the corresponding placebo. The primary adverse reaction was pain at the injection site, with a higher incidence in the vaccine arm (55.6%) than in the placebo arm (40.0%). Moreover, the incidence of pain at the injection site in the 18-59 years old group was 58.4% as compared to 32.0% in the over 60 years old group. The seroconversion rate for specific anti-S1-RBD IgG was 47.8% for the 18-59 years old group 14 days post immunization (p.i.) and 95.6% 28 and 42 days p.i. For the over 60 years old group, the seroconversion rate was 18.1%, 100%, and 87.5% at 14, 28, and 42 days p.i., respectively. Importantly, we observed a 95.7% seroconversion rate in neutralizing antibodies for the 18-59 years old group 28 and 42 days p.i. The over 60 years old group exhibited seroconversion rates of 90.0% and 100% at 28 and 42 days p.i. Interestingly, we did not observe a significant seroconversion rate of anti-N-SARS-CoV-2 IgG for the 18-59 years old group. For the participants over 60 years old, a modest rate of seroconversion at 42 days p.i. was observed (37.5%). We observed a significant induction of a T cell response characterized by the secretion of IFN-gamma; upon stimulation with Mega Pools of peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2 proteins. No significant differences between the two age groups were observed for cell-mediated immunity. Interpretation: Immunization with CoronaVac in a 0-14 schedule in adults of 18 years and older in the Chilean population is safe and induces specific IgG production against the S1-RBD with neutralizing capacity, as well as the activation of T cells secreting IFN-gamma upon recognition of SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

In the current study we hypothesized that infants born prior to pandemic regulations may demonstrate differences compared to those born during the pandemic. Fecal samples (n=307) were collected from infants (1-19 weeks) in the NICU at The University of Chicago. DNA was extracted for 16S rRNA sequencing, and 4576 taxa were analyzed using R. We performed alpha diversity analysis within the samples and beta diversity between the samples to measure and compare bacterial communities. Alpha diversity did not demonstrate a significant difference between before pandemic and during pandemic groups, while Beta diversity did achieve a significant difference between the two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that in before pandemic and during pandemic groups, post menstrual age (PMA), weeks of life (WOL), as well as the interactions of pandemic grouping by PMA, and PMA by WOL were significant.

Front-line HCWs performed more family isolation than non-front -line (88.9% vs 82.5%, p>0.05) and presumably less family members were infected in the former group (19.4% vs 26.3%, p>0.05). The proportion of HCWs with asymptomatic infection was statistically significantly lower in the front-line group (2.4% vs 19.9%, p=0.05). Conclusion The prevention and control actions implemented were effective in mitigating the COVID-19 outbreak; HCW infections occurred mainly in the early stages. Non-front -line HCWs were at a higher risk, warranting specific attention and interventions targeting this group.","output":"Health Care Workers not in the frontline are more frequently carriers of Coronavirus Disease 2019: The Experience of a Tertiary Portuguese Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, many state governors faced an increasing number of acts of defiance as well as political and legal challenges to their public health emergency orders.

Since December 2019 until now the coronavirus has infected over 131 million people. The mortality rate in the general population varies between 1 to 5%, with a potential of over 30% in patients with neoplasms. Methods: The main objective of the study was to identify some peculiarities of the evolution, complications and treatment of patients with acute leukaemia and COVID-19. The study was retrospective and included 50 patients with acute leukaemia and COVID-19. Results: Recent administration of chemotherapy was identified in 20 patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia and 4 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The newly diagnosed patients or those undergoing intensive chemotherapy, in particular elderly patients, had a severe form of COVID-19 and an unfavourable evolution, and these clinical situations were identified as predictive factors for adverse outcomes. Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia had a shorter survival curve compared to patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia. Pneumonia was present especially in patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia, most patients having over 30% of lung fields affected (55.26%). Patients with an unfavourable outcome had significantly increased median values of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and interleukin6. Conclusions: Patients with acute leukaemia, especially acute myeloblastic leukaemia who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 infection require special attention because they may associate complications and adverse outcomes of COVID-19.

LP infection causes Legionnaires' disease (LD), which is an important but relatively uncommon respiratory infection. Approximately 90% of LD is caused by L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1). Meteorological conditions may affect the infectivity and virulence of Lp1, but the exact relationship between them is still unclear. In this study, we evaluated the virulence of Lp1 by screening of total 156 Lp1 strains isolated from cooling tower water in different region of China by detecting their abilities to activate NF-B signaling pathway in vitro. In addition, we screened the distribution of some selected virulence genes in these strains. The virulence, virulence gene distribution and the meteorological factors were analyzed. We found that both the virulence and the distribution of virulence genes had a certain regional and meteorological correlation. Although loss of several virulence genes showed significant effects on the virulence of Lp1 strains, the distribution of virulence genes had very limited effects on the virulence of Lp1. IMPORTANCE LD is likely to be under-recognized in many countries. Due to the widespread existence of LP in natural and artificial water environments, and to the lack of cross-protection against different strains, LP is a potentially serious threat to human health. Therefore, effective monitoring of the virulence of LP in the water environment is very important to prevent and control the prevalence of LD. Understanding the virulence of LP can not only help us to predict the risk of possible outbreaks in advance, but can also enable more targeted clinical treatment. This study highlights the importance of understanding the epidemiology and ecology of LP isolated from public facilities in terms of public health and biology. Due to the potential for water sources to harbor and disseminate LP, and to the fact that geographical conditions influence the virulence of LP, timely and accurate LP virulence surveillance is urgently needed.","output":"Legionella pneumophila Risk from Cooling Tower Systems in China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strains, JSLS-1/2015 and JS-2/2015, were isolated from piglets with watery diarrhea in South China.

The model can calculate the mean droplet nucleus concentration with very low computing costs. Combining this model with the WellsCRiley equation, we estimate the airborne infection risk when a PAC is located in different positions. The two similarity criteria, B(p)(+) and G(p)(+), are critical for characterizing the effect of the position and airflow rate of PAC on the infection risk. An infection probability of less than 10% requires B(p) (+) to be larger than 144 and G(p) (+) to be larger than 0.001. These criteria imply that locating PAC in the center of the room is optimal under the premise that the airflow rate of PAC is greater than a certain level. The model provides an easy-to-use approach for real-time risk control strategy decisions.

Methods: All the patients over the age of 18 who were obtained the COVID-19 PCR test before the operation or interven-tional procedure between July 1 and October 31, 2020 were included. The patients were divided into two groups according to the periods when the peak was experienced or not. Results: 1070 patients were included in the study. PCR positivity was detected in 55 (5.14%) of the patients. The mean case incidence rate was 0.76% (2/263) in the months when the study was conducted, and there was no COVID-19 peak, and 6.57% (53/807) in the months when the peak was observed. These rates were taken as a reference for the months with and without a peak. The time to reach 67%, which is accepted as the herd immunity limit, was calculated by adding 6.57% to the months corresponding to peak periods with 20-day periods starting from April 1, and the rate of 0.76% to the other months.

Distinguishing between short/medium- and medium/long-term options, the scope is to discuss how issues such energy security, energy storage and energy system resilience should deserve more attention. Today, fuel demand has fallen to unprecedented levels, with jet fuel demand being the most affected one. Oil price is at the lowest values recorded for many years while on 20 April it even reached a negative price in the US for the first time in history. While in the short-term low oil prices would be attractive, the long-term negative consequences could be very relevant, with significant associated costs for the EU economy and Member states (MS) related to the collapse of demand and to the socio-economic impacts. New measures should thus be considered in the post Covid19 strategy. In particular, while in a short- to medium-term view the oil sector will require specific support measures to overcome the economic and physical shock brought in by the pandemic, in a medium to long-term perspective domestic sources such as Renewable and Recycled Carbon Fuels (RRCF) should be regarded as a way to secure energy supply, leading to significant technical and economic advantages. Thus, EU should allocate adequate resources in the post-Covid recovery plans to definitely allow the transition to renewable energy sources and particularly to bio-based economy and stainable transport fuels. Decarbonisation of transport through RRCF and economic recovery do not compete, but rather represent a win-win solution in a well-designed and sustainable implementation strategy, especially when low or zero interest-rate investments are foreseen. The EU should take the opportunity to match the UN SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) and EU Green Deal goals with the need to inject economic and financial resources into the real economy improving the socio-economic conditions of EU populations. Both agroforestry and RRCF industry are ready to produce (biomass) or source (waste) the feedstocks as well as the technologies, systems and components needed by the industry along the whole value chain.

We aimed to define the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms at the time of the epilepsy diagnosis and the factors related to their presence in newly diagnosed adult patients. Methods: One hundred and twelve newly diagnosed patients were assessed, usually in the week after diagnosis. Patients were untreated at this time. We used the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E, cut-off 15) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item scale (GAD-7, cut-off >7). A semi-structured interview was conducted to collect sociodemographic and epilepsy data and patients' psychiatric history. We first compared patients with and without anxiety symptoms, then patients with and without depressive symptoms. Results: According to the GAD-7 scale, the prevalence of anxiety symptoms at the time of diagnosis was 35%. Patients with anxiety symptoms had significantly more psychiatric history (26%, p = 0.001) and more history of psychological trauma (51%, p = 0.003) than patients with no anxiety symptoms. According to the NDDI-E scores, the prevalence of depressive symptoms at the time of the diagnosis was 11%. Patients with depressive symptoms had significantly more psychiatric history (43%, p < 0.001) and more history of psychological trauma (65%, p = 0.007) than patients with no depressive symptoms.

Genomic sequences were determined in duplicate sequencing runs, and the consensus sequence of the inoculum determined by NGS was identical to that previously determined using the Sanger method. However, NGS revealed the fine polymorphic substructure of the viral population, from nucleotide variants present at just below 50% frequency to those present at fractions of 1%.

Boards of Directors are under great pressure to be transparent and accountable. In the same background, given the current socioeconomic context, due to the crisis generated by the new Coronavirus (CoVid-19) pandemic, the banking sector is under analogous levels of scrutiny, subject to a similar regulatory backlash. In this context, banks must not fail to fulfil the expectations of policy makers in particular, and society in general. The Code of Corporate Governance (CCG) issued by the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BSE) aims at creating an internationally attractive capital market in Romania, based on best practices, transparency and trust C pillars that encourage companies to build a strong relationship with their shareholders and other stakeholders, by an effective and transparent communication, as well as openness towards all potential investors. This paper aims to highpoint the degree of compliance of the banks listed on the BSE with the principles and provisions stipulated by the CCG in force. As such, the assessment consisted in measuring the corporate governance quality and effectiveness in the main Romanian banks: Banca Transilvania, BRD, Erste Group and Patria Bank. Evaluating corporate governance eminence is constructed by using the score function method in regards to disclosure and transparency practices, as proposed by BSE. In this respect, an investigation was performed, focusing on the mode in which the principles enforced by the BSE are respected. This goal is important due to the current sensitive socioeconomic environment, which, undoubtedly, makes the corporate governance in the banking sector a controversial subject. In this framework, valuable conclusions were reached, regarding a satisfactory compliance level with the CCG issued by BSE. The research emphasized a high level of adoption of the best practice doctrines. Copyright ? 2020. Delia DELIU.

The modern molecular biology tools provides alternative methods, such as CRISPR-Cas and RNA interference, that can be adapted as antiviral approaches, and contribute to this search. The unique CRISPR-Cas13d system, with the small crRNA guide molecule, mediates a sequence-specific attack on RNA, and can be developed as an anti-coronavirus strategy. We analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 genome to localize the hypothetically best crRNA-annealing sites of 23 nucleotides based on our extensive expertise with sequence-specific antiviral strategies. We considered target sites of which the sequence is well-conserved among SARS-CoV-2 isolates. As we should prepare for a potential future outbreak of related viruses, we screened for targets that are conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. To further broaden the search, we screened for targets that are conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and the more distantly related MERS-CoV, as well as the four other human coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1). Finally, we performed a search for pan-corona target sequences that are conserved among all these coronaviruses, including the new Omicron variant, that are able to replicate in humans.

To characterize postvaccination infections, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LACDPH) used COVID-19 surveillance and California Immunization Registry 2 (CAIR2) data to describe age-adjusted infection and hospitalization rates during May 1-July 25, 2021, by vaccination status. Whole genome sequencing (WGS)-based SARS-CoV-2 lineages and cycle threshold (Ct) values from qualitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for two SARS-CoV-2 gene targets, including the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene region and the open reading frame 1 ab (ORF1ab) polyprotein gene region,* were reported for a convenience sample of specimens. Among 43,127 reported SARS-CoV-2 infections in Los Angeles County residents aged 16 years, 10,895 (25.3%) were in fully vaccinated persons, 1,431 (3.3%) were in partially vaccinated persons, and 30,801 (71.4%) were in unvaccinated persons. Much lower percentages of fully vaccinated persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 were hospitalized (3.2%), were admitted to an intensive care unit (0.5%), and required mechanical ventilation (0.2%) compared with partially vaccinated persons (6.2%, 1.0%, and 0.3%, respectively) and unvaccinated persons (7.6%, 1.5%, and 0.5%, respectively) (p<0.001 for all comparisons). On July 25, the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among unvaccinated persons was 4.9 times and the hospitalization rate was 29.2 times the rates among fully vaccinated persons. During May 1-July 25, the percentages of B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant infections estimated from 6,752 samples with lineage data increased among fully vaccinated persons (from 8.6% to 91.2%), partially vaccinated persons (from 0% to 88.1%), and unvaccinated persons (from 8.2% to 87.1%). In May, there were differences in median Ct values by vaccination status; however, by July, no differences were detected among specimens from fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated, and unvaccinated persons by gene targets. These infection and hospitalization rate data indicate that authorized vaccines were protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 during a period when transmission of the Delta variant was increasing. Efforts to increase COVID-19 vaccination, in coordination with other prevention strategies, are critical to preventing COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infections and Hospitalizations Among Persons Aged 16 Years, by Vaccination Status  Los Angeles County, California, May 1CJuly 25, 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a maternal inheritance of eye disease due to the mitochondrial DNA mtDNA) mutations. We previously discovered a 3866T>C mutation within the gene for the ND1 subunit of complex I as possibly amplifying disease progression for patients bearing the disease-causing 11778G>A mutation, within the gene for the ND4 subunit of Complex I. However, whether and how the ND1 mutation exacerbates the ND4 mutation were unknown. In this report, we showed that four Chinese families bearing both m.3866T>C and m.11778G>A mutations exhibited higher penetrances of LHON than 6 Chinese pedigrees carrying only the m.3866T>C mutation or families harboring only the m.11778G>A mutation. The protein structure analysis revealed that the m.3866T>C (I187T) and m.11778G>A (R340H) mutations destabilized the specific interactions with other residues of ND1 and ND4, thereby altering the structure and function of complex I, respectively. Cellular data obtained using cybrids constructed by transferring mitochondria from the Chinese families into mtDNA-less (ro) cells demonstrated that the mutations perturbed the stability, assembly and activity of complex I, leading to changes in mitochondrial ATP levels and membrane potential, and increasing the production of reactive oxygen species. These mitochondrial dysfunctions promoted the apoptotic sensitivity of cells and decreased mitophagy. Cybrids bearing only m.3866T>C mutation displayed mild mitochondrial dysfunctions while those harboring both m.3866T>C and m.11778G>A mutations exhibited greater mitochondrial dysfunctions. These suggested that the m.3866T>C mutation acted as the synergy with m.11778G>A mutation, aggravating mitochondrial dysfunctions contributing to higher penetrance of LHON in these families carrying both mtDNA mutations.","output":"Complex I mutations synergize to worsen the phenotypic expression of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of dengue virus is a useful target for diagnostics of dengue infection since the protein is abundantly circulating in blood during the acute phase of the disease.

Thus detection of non-structural dengue antigens may be of benefit for an early rapid diagnosis of dengue infection due to its long half life in the blood. Here we describe a simple and efficient method for the expression of NS1 in Escherichia coli, which could potentially be used to develop monoclonal and bispecific antibodies for point of care diagnostics. E. coli codon optimized synthetic full-length NS1 gene of dengue serotype 1 (DEN-1) was successfully cloned and expressed in very high-level as inclusion bodies. The NS1 protein was successfully affinity purified and refolded as a recombinant NS1 (rNS1) protein in E. coli and yield was 230C250 mg/L of bacterial culture. The rNS1 protein was used to immunize mice for hybridoma development. The polyclonal antiserum from animals immunized with this rNS1 protein was found to specifically recognize the rNS1, thus demonstrating the immunogenic nature of the protein.

The research question was, since there are linguistic differences between these language-varieties: would differences be found also on the legilinguistic level? Hebrew and Arabic were studied because of their different status. In Israel, Hebrew is the dominant official language, while Arabic is a minority language. In Egypt, Arabic is the official and dominant language. The material was collected from two news/media channels in each of Modern Hebrew and Arabic in Israel, and two from Egypt. Selected news texts were analyzed and examples of their lexical and syntactic elements are presented.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the perceptions from the stakeholders' point of view (host community, public and private sector) and to identify the impacts generated before and after a health crisis regarding the celebration of a festival. Design/methodology/approach The study offers a holistic insight into impact research by music festivals. The methodology implemented is based on qualitative techniques. By conducting 20 in-depth interviews with essential stakeholders, it is possible to determine their perceptions of the impact of the event and the effects of a health crisis. Findings The results allow detecting a gap between internal and external stakeholders due to poor communication and planning of the event. The results show that a health crisis provokes negative impacts on the economic benefits of events' organisation. However, the cultural city's identity suffers an important damage that it is difficult to overcome. The community and visitors are the stakeholders that suffer a detrimental impact on their experience when attending the festival, considering the security measures. Moreover, results allow us to identify practical implications for event management and planning in a health crisis scenario. Originality/value The most important contribution of this research is the theoretical model proposed to analyse stakeholders' perception of the event celebration in a context of a health crisis. The model also considers different moments of the social exchange. The theoretical approaches considered theory of social exchange (SET) and Visitor, Industry, Community and Environment (VICE) models allow analysing the stakeholder's perception of a case study of a music festival (Vina Rock Festival, Spain).

The role of medical doctors in advising proper supplementation, monitoring and correcting the levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in individuals is of great importance and should be used to help mitigate its common deficits. The aim of this study was to evaluate knowledge, attitudes and practices of Polish physicians regarding vitamin D supplementation in order to identify areas for improvement and determinants for the knowledge gaps. Methods The study group comprised 701 medical doctors aged 32.1  5.3 years on average, mostly women (71.61%). An original survey questionnaire was developed for the purpose of the study. Results The mean vitamin D knowledge score was 6.8  2.3 (in a scale 0C13) and was related to gender (p < 0.001), type of specialization (p = 0.032), D3 supplements use (p < 0.001), recommending supplementation to patients (p = 0.005), to relatives and friends (p < 0.001) and to healthy adults (p < 0.001).

Many progestin metabolites, as the progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone, have GABAA-receptor modulatory effects and are known to affect memory, learning, appetite, and mood. In women, 4 years chronic treatment with MPA doubles the frequency of dementia and in rats, MPA causes cognitive impairment related to the GABAergic system. Activation of the membrane bound GABAA receptor results in a chloride ion flux that can be studied by whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings. The purpose of this study was to clarify the modulatory effects of MPA and specific MPA metabolites, with structures like known GABAA-receptor modulators, on different GABAA-receptor subtypes. An additional aim was to verify the results as steroid effects on GABA response in single cells taken from rat hypothalamus. HEK-293 cell-lines permanently expressing the recombinant human GABAA-receptor subtype 1?2?32L or 5?3?32L or 2?3?32S were created. The MPA metabolites 35-MPA,3?5-MPA and 3?5?-MPA were synthesised and purified for electrophysiological patch-clamp measurements with a Dynaflow system. The effects of MPA and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone were also studied. None of the studied MPA metabolites affected the responses mediated by 1?2?32L or 5?3?32L GABAA receptors. Contrary, MPA clearly acted both as a positive modulator and as a direct activator of the 5?3?32L and 2?3?32S GABAA receptors. However, in concentrations up to 10 M, MPA was inactive at the 1?2?32L GABAA receptor. In the patch-clamp recordings from dissociated cells of the preoptic area in rats, MPA increased the amplitude of responses to GABA. In addition, MPA alone without added GABA, evoked a current response. In conclusion, MPA acts as a positive modulator of specific GABAA receptor subtypes expressed in HEK cells and at native GABA receptors in single cells from the hypothalamic preoptic area.","output":"Medroxyprogesterone acetate positively modulates specific GABAA-receptor subtypes - affecting memory and cognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most representative organisms of the Harbor of Gaeta Gulf in South Italy were analyzed for biofouling by visual census and confirmed later by molecular approach on an artificial Conatex panel dipped 3 m into a eutrophic area during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Blood samples collected after initial PfRAS immunization were analyzed to compare immune responses between protected and non-protected volunteers leveraging integrative analysis of whole blood RNA-seq, high parameter flow cytometry, and single cell CITEseq of PBMCs. This analysis revealed differences in early innate immune responses indicating divergent paths associated with protection. In particular, elevated levels of inflammatory responses early after the initial immunization were detrimental for the development of protective adaptive immunity. Specifically, non-classical monocytes and early type I interferon responses induced within 1 day of PfRAS vaccination correlated with impaired immunity. Non-protected individuals also showed an increase in Th2 polarized T cell responses whereas we observed a trend towards increased Th1 and T-bet+ CD8 T cell responses in protected individuals. Temporal differences in genes associated with natural killer cells suggest an important role in immune regulation by these cells.

RESULTS: A total of 168 articles (n = 292,693) were included in the study, and the meta-analysis showed that the most common neurological manifestations of COVID-19 were myalgia(33%; 95%CI 0.30C0.37; I(2) = 99.17%), smell impairment(33%; 95%CI 0.28C0.38; I(2) = 99.40%), taste dysfunction(33%; 95%CI 0.27C0.39; I(2) = 99.09%), altered mental status(32%; 95%CI 0.22C0.43; I(2) = 99.06%), headache(29%; 95%CI 0.25C0.33; I(2) = 99.42%), encephalopathy(26%; 95%CI 0.16C0.38; I(2) = 99.31%), alteration of consciousness(13%; 95%CI 0.08C0.19; I(2) = 98.10%), stroke(12%; 95%CI 0.08C0.16; I(2) = 98.95%), dizziness(10%; 95%CI 0.08C0.13; I(2) = 96.45%), vision impairment(6%; 95%CI 0.03C0.09; I(2) = 86.82%), intracerebral haemorrhage(5%; 95%CI 0.03C0.09; I(2) = 95.60%), seizure(4%; 95%CI 0.02 -0.05; I(2) = 98.15%), encephalitis(2%; 95%CI 0.01C0.03; I(2) = 90.36%), Guillan-Barr Syndrome (GBS) (1%; 95%CI 0.00C0.03; I(2) = 89.48%). CONCLUSIONS: Neurological symptoms are common and varied in Covid-19 infections, and a growing number of reports suggest that the prevalence of neurological symptoms may be increasing. In the future, the role of COVID-19 neurological symptoms in the progression of COVID-19 should be further studied, and its pathogenesis and assessment methods should be explored, to detect and treat early neurological complications of COVID-19 and reduce mortality.","output":"What can the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 tell us: a meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Factor XI (FXI) inhibition offers the promise of hemostasis-sparing anticoagulation for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic events. Abelacimab (MAA868) is a novel fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the catalytic domain and has dual activity against the inactive zymogen Factor XI and the activated FXI. OBJECTIVES To investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single dose intravenous and multiple dose subcutaneous administration of abelacimab in healthy volunteers and patients with atrial fibrillation, respectively. PATIENTS/METHODS In study ANT-003, healthy volunteers were administered single intravenous doses of abelacimab (30 to 150 mg) or placebo. The ANT-003 study also included a cohort of obese but otherwise healthy subjects. In study ANT-004, patients with atrial fibrillation were administered monthly subcutaneous doses of abelacimab (120 mg and 180 mg), or placebo, for 3 months. Key PK and PD parameters, including activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and free FXI levels, as well as anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were assessed. RESULTS Following intravenous administration of abelacimab, the terminal elimination half-life ranged from 25 to 30 days. One hour after the start of the intravenous infusion greater than 99% reductions in free FXI levels were observed. Following once monthly subcutaneous administration, marked reductions from baseline in free FXI levels were sustained. Parenteral administration of abelacimab demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no clinically relevant bleeding events. CONCLUSIONS Intravenous and multiple subcutaneous dose administration of abelacimab were safe and well tolerated. The safety, PK, and PD data from these studies support the clinical development of abelacimab.","output":"Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Abelacimab (MAA868), a Novel Dual Inhibitor of Factor XI and Factor XIa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses (HPAIV) cause rapid systemic illness and death in susceptible animals, leading to a disease with high morbidity and mortality rates. Although vaccines and drugs are the best solution to prevent this threat, a more effective treatment for H5 strains of influenza has yet to be developed. Therefore, the development of therapeutics/drugs that combat H5N1 influenza virus infection is becoming increasingly important. Lycorine, the major component of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, exhibits better protective effects against A/CK/GD/178/04 (H5N1) (GD178) viruses than the commercial neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor oseltamivir in our prior study. Lycorine demonstrates outstanding antiviral activity because of its inhibitory activity against the export of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) from the nucleus. However, how lycorine affects the proteome of AIV infected cells is unknown. Therefore, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis to identify changes in protein expression in AIV-infected Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells treated with lycorine. Three groups were designed: mock infection group (M), virus infection group (V), and virus infection and lycorine-treated after virus infection group (L). The multiplexed tandem mass tag (TMT) approach was employed to analyze protein level in this study. In total, 5,786 proteins were identified from the three groups of cells by using TMT proteomic analysis. In the V/M group, 1,101 proteins were identified, of which 340 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were determined during HPAIV infection; among the 1,059 proteins identified from the lycorine-treated group, 258 proteins presented significant change. Here, 71 proteins showed significant upregulation or downregulation of expression in the virus-infected/mock and virus-infected/lycorine-treated comparisons, and the proteins in each fraction were functionally classified further. Interestingly, lycorine treatment decreased the levels of the nuclear pore complex protein 93 (Nup93, E2RSV7), which is associated with nuclearCcytoplasmic transport. In addition, Western blot experiments confirmed that the expression of Nup93 was significantly downregulated in lycorine treatment but induced after viral infection. Our results may provide new insights into how lycorine may trap vRNPs in the nucleus and suggest new potential therapeutic targets for influenza virus.","output":"Tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomic analysis of lycorine treatment in highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 has disrupted the lives of billions of persons worldwide.

The purpose of this study is to understand the Risk-of-Bias (RoB) in a non-randomized AI trial for handling ARDS using novel AtheroPoint-AI-Bias (AP(ai)Bias). Our hypothesis for acceptance of a study to be in low RoB must have a mean score of 80% in a study. Using the PRISMA model, 42 best AI studies were analyzed to understand the RoB. Using the AP(ai)Bias paradigm, the top 19 studies were then chosen using the raw-cutoff of 1.9. This was obtained using the intersection of the cumulative plot of mean score vs. study and score distribution. Finally, these studies were benchmarked against ROBINS-I and PROBAST paradigm. Our observation showed that AP(ai)Bias, ROBINS-I, and PROBAST had only 32%, 16%, and 26% studies, respectively in low-moderate RoB (cutoff>2.5), however none of them met the RoB hypothesis. Further, the aiSR analysis recommends six primary and six secondary recommendations for the non-randomized AI for ARDS.

PARTICIPANTS: A purposive sampling of family members of persons with dementia registered in the database and seen within the previous 6 months. RESULTS: Thirty-one caregivers participated. Thematic analysis of the data showed two sets of issues that the caregivers of persons with dementia faced in their experiences during the pandemic. The first set was unique to the caregivers that directly related to their caregiving role, while the second set did not relate directly to their caregiving role. These two sets also appeared to have a two-way interaction influencing each other. These issues generated needs, some of which required immediate support while others required longer-term support. The caregivers suggested several methods, such as use of video-consultations, telephone-based support and clinic-based in-person visits to meet their needs. They also wanted more services postpandemic. CONCLUSION: Caregivers of persons with dementia had multiple needs during the pandemic.

Indeed, many bat species can be defined as synanthropic, i.e., they have a strong ecological association with humans. Bats have been observed using buildings as roosting and foraging sites, temporary shelters, for reproduction and hibernation. A synanthropic lifestyle may result in direct fitness benefits owing to energetic advantages in warmer roosts, which may ultimately lead to more rapid gestation and faster development of juveniles, or by being less exposed to natural predators in urban environments. All these benefits may allow bats to use buildings as stepping stones to exploit habitats otherwise devoid of roosting structures and may even lead to the expansion of geographic ranges. Yet, the coexistence with humans also comes with some risks. Bats may be exposed to chemical pollutants, particularly preservation chemicals used on lumber or during pest control measures. Bats may also be at risk of direct persecution or they may die accidently if trapped within buildings. In general, eviction of bats from buildings should follow the general rule of avoidanceCmitigationCcompensation. When considering conservation measures for synanthropic bats, it is most important to assess the role of the building for different life stages of bats. Construction work at buildings should be conducted in a manner that minimizes disturbance of bats. Artificial roosts can replace lost roosts, yet bats will often not accept alternative roosts. Demographic changes in human populations may lead to the abandonment of buildings, for example, in rural areas and to increased conflicts in urban areas when old buildings are replaced by new buildings or when previously unoccupied space in buildings is renovated. We advocate maintenance and enhancement of roosts for synanthropic bats, in addition to outreach and education campaigns, to improve the tolerance of humans for synanthropic bats.","output":"Bats and Buildings: The Conservation of Synanthropic Bats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dynamics of COVID-19 is investigated with regard to complex contributions of the omitted factors For this purpose, we use a fractional order SEIR model which allows us to calculate the number of infections considering the chaotic contributions into susceptible, exposed, infectious and removed number of individuals We check our model on Wuhan, China-2019 and South Korea underlying the importance of the chaotic contribution, and then we extend it to Italy and the USA Results are of great guiding significance to promote evidence-based decisions and policy","output":"COVID-19 pandemic and chaos theory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fashion industry is looking forward to use artificial intelligence technologies to enhance their processes, services, and applications.

Current prophylactic strategies against COVID-19 utilize mRNA vaccines targeting small fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, but these may not induce robust T cell responses or elicit immunity quickly enough. OBJECTIVE: We sought to adapt an FDA-IND approved mRNA vaccine in GBM against COVID-19 for: 1) activation of near immediate immune responses, 2) targeting of full-length SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, and 3) induction of bidirectional (B and T cell) adaptive immunity. METHODS: We utilized a novel engineering design that layers mRNA into a lipid-nanoparticle (NP) shell (much like an onion); this allows greater packaging of mRNA per particle to quickly boost innate/adaptive immune responses against full-length glioblastoma antigens or SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. RESULTS: In small and large animal models, RNA-NPs safely mimic viremia activating the quiescent immune system in only a few hours for induction of protective immunity against its mRNA payload. RNA-NPs activate dendritic cells (DCs), upregulate critical innate gene signatures, and induce antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity. We found that mice receiving SARS-CoV-2 spike RNA-NPs had more effector T cells after vaccination with significant memory recall expansion after in vitro re-stimulation with overlapping SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide mix. We also found increased release of MIP-1-alpha (i.e. CCL3) previously shown by our group (Mitchell et al. Nature 2015) to be responsible for Th1 mediated memory recall to infectious vaccine antigens in GBM patients. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 RNA-NPs elicit memory recall response after vaccination.

Quarantine, defined as the separation and restriction of movement of healthy people who have potentially been exposed to the disease, remains contentious especially when the risks and benefits are not fully discussed and not effectively communicated to the people by the organizations who impose this public health measure. SUBJECT AND METHODS: A qualitative evidence synthesis was conducted to examine the phenomenon of adherence to quarantine focused on the following questions: What strategies affect adherence to quarantine? What are the barriers and facilitators to quarantine acceptance? What benefits and harms of quarantine have been described or measured? RESULTS: The evidence synthesis produced 18 findings assessed with high confidence. The findings were used to construct a conceptual framework for inter- and within-organization coordination and public communication that includes the following topics for consideration: desired orientation for implementation; population demographics; perceptions of messages; prior acceptance of quarantine; likelihood of impacts of quarantine; perceptions of health infrastructure; and perceptions of policy importance.

Our goal was to evaluate the succinate dehydrogenase and ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity of mitochondrial complex II in the presence of chrysin and chrysinCchitosan nanoparticles. Chrysin chitosan nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized using ultraviolet spectroscopy, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, drug release, and zeta potential. The binding affinity of chrysin to complex II subunits was assessed by molecular docking. The IC(50) values were measured in a suspension of mouse mitochondria, and the inhibitory effect of chrysin and chrysin chitosan nanoparticles on mitochondrial complex  was determined. RESULTS: The free energy of binding between chrysin and complex  subunits A, B, C, and D was ?4.9, ?5, ?8.2, and ?8.4 kcal/mol, respectively. The characteristic peak of chrysin was confirmed at 348 nm. The chrysin chitosan nanoparticles contained characteristic bands of both chrysin and chitosan. The crystalline nature of chrysin chitosan nanoparticles was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction measurements showing the characteristic Bragg peaks of (11.2), (32.2), (19.6), (27.6), and (31.96). Transmission and scanning electron microscopy revealed their spherical shape and an average particle size of 49.7  3.02 nm.

The need for specific treatments to adequately stop the inflammatory response and its sequelae is day by day more urgent and many therapeutic strategies were performed since COVID-19 burst in the last months. Statins were thought to be effective against this novel coronavirus for their anti-inflammatory properties, even if the real effects on COVID patients are still partially unexplored. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 501 adult patients, consecutively admitted to the two COVID-hospitals of Ferrara's territory, and divided them into two groups: ST = patients on statin therapy on admission and NST=patients not on statin therapy on admission. We searched for differences between groups in terms of anamnestic, clinical and laboratory data and then in terms of COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: We found significant differences between groups in terms of age, comorbidities, procalcitonin and CPK serum levels: ST patients were older, more comorbid, with lower procalcitonin and higher CPK serum levels. Male sex was, together with the Charlson Comorbidity Index, an independent predictor of needing intensification of care, while age only was a good predictor of in-hospital and 100-day mortality. Differences were also found in the survival functions between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: After a period of observation of 100 days, ST patients, despite their older age and their greater load of comorbidities, have similar survival functions to NST patients. If adjusted for age and CCI the survival functions of ST group are considerably more favourable than those of the second group.","output":"Role of Statins in Coronavirus-Related Disease (COVID-19): A Retrospective Cohort Study in Northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The annual meeting of the European Astronomical Society took place in Lyon, France, in 2019, but in 2020 it was held online only due the COVID-19 pandemic.

Setting: UK Biobank linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and COVID-19 tests until 14 April 2020. Participants: UK Biobank participants from England, excluding drop-outs and deaths. Main measures: COVID-19 infection based on a positive PCR test. Ethnicity was self-reported and classified using Office of National Statistics groups. Socioeconomic status was based on index of multiple deprivation quintiles. Comorbidities were self-reported and completed from HES. Analyses: Multivariable Poisson analysis to estimate incidence rate ratios of COVID-19 infection according to ethnicity, adjusted for socioeconomic status, alcohol drinking, smoking, body mass index, age, sex, and comorbidity. Results: 415,582 participants were included, with 1,416 tested and 651 positive for COVID-19.

For construction of the predictive model, 80% of cases were randomly separated to training and 20% of unused cases to validation. Several machine learning models were tested in the training data: linear regression with stepwise, rpart, support vector machine with radial kernel, generalised boosting machine and random forest. The models were selected by ten-fold cross-validation and the performances evaluated by the root mean square error. RESULTS: There were 364 indirect calorimetry measurements in 114 patients, mean age of 60.65  16.9 years and 68.4% were males. The average REE was 2081  645 kcal. REE was positively correlated with C-reactive protein, minute volume (MV), expiratory positive airway pressure, serum urea, body mass index and inversely with age. The principal variables included in the selected model were age, body mass index, use of vasopressors, expiratory positive airway pressure, MV, C-reactive protein, temperature and serum urea.

Ultrasound measures of diaphragm thickness or diaphragm dome excursion have been used to aid in predicting extubation success or failure. The aim of this study was to determine if incorporating results of diaphragm ultrasound into usual ICU care would shorten the time to extubation. METHODS: We performed a prospective, randomized, controlled study at three Brown University teaching hospitals. Included subjects underwent block randomization to either usual care (Control) or usual care enhanced with ultrasound measurements of the diaphragm (Intervention). The primary outcome was the time to extubation after ultrasound, and the secondary outcome was the total days on the ventilator. Only intensivists in the Intervention group would have the ultrasound information on the likelihood of successful extubation available to incorporate with traditional clinical and physiologic measures to determine the timing of extubation. RESULTS: A total of 32 subjects were studied; 15 were randomized into the Control group and 17 into the Intervention group. The time from ultrasound to extubation was significantly reduced in the Intervention group compared to the Control group in patients with a ?tdi%  30% (4.8  8.4 vs 35.0  41.0 h, p = 0.04).

In this context, this study aims to analyse nitrate concentrations in a shallow aquifer of Mahdia-Kssour Essef in central-eastern Tunisia, identify the assignable sources, and predict the future levels using artificial neural network (ANN) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. The results showed that nitrate concentrations measured in 21 pumping wells across the plain ranged from 17 to 521 mg L-1. A total of 67% of the monitoring points greatly exceed the standard guideline value of 50 mg L-1. The main relevant anthropogenic and natural factors, such as soil texture, land use, fertilizers application rates, livestock waste disposal, and groundwater table, are positively correlated with groundwater nitrate concentration. The ANN model showed good fitting between measured and simulated results with coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.88, 53.95, and 39.64, respectively. The ARIMA applied on annual average nitrate concentrations from 1998 to 2017 revealed that the best fitted model (p, d, q) is (1, 2, 1). The R2 value is approximately 0.36, and the Theil inequality coefficient and bias proportion values are small and close to zero. These results proved the ARIMA model's adequacy in forecasting annual average nitrate concentrations of 116 mg L-1 in 2025. These findings may be useful in making groundwater management decisions, particularly in rural and semi-arid areas, and the proposed ARIMA model could be used as a managed tool to monitor and reduce the nitrate intrusion into groundwater.","output":"Nitrate concentration analysis and prediction in a shallow aquifer in central-eastern Tunisia using artificial neural network and time series modelling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More walkable neighborhoods are linked to increased physical activity.

All consecutive confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to a single center were selected, including those treated with steroids and an ARDS. Patients were allocated to the HD ( 250 mg/day of methylprednisolone) of corticosteroids or the SD ( 1.5 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone) at discretion of treating physician. Five hundred seventy-three patients were included: 428 (74.7%) men, with a median (IQR) age of 64 (54C73) years. In the HD group, a worse baseline respiratory situation was observed and male gender, older age, and comorbidities were significantly more common. After adjusting by baseline characteristics, HDs were associated with a higher mortality than SD (adjusted OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.59C3.81, p < 0.001) and with an increased risk of needing MV or death (adjusted OR 2.35, p = 0.001).

Phylogenetic and sequence analysis demonstrated that 14 representative PEDV strains from 14 swine farms belonged to the G2 group (G2-a and G2-b subgroups) and displayed a high degree of genetic variation.

Thus far, consideration of the role of asymptomatic infections in emerging disease dynamics have usually avoided considering some important sets of influences.

Epigenetic modifications are likely to be important in both suicidal ideation and behavior. Most of the reviewed studies found significant epigenetic modifications linked with suicidal behavior rather than ideation.

Understanding the structural nature of Kappa and Beta spike (S) proteins and their association with ACE2 is of significant importance. Here we present two cryo-EM structures for each of the Kappa and Beta spikes in the open and open-prone transition states. Compared with wild-type (WT) or G614 spikes, the two variant spikes appear more untwisted/open especially for Beta, and display a considerable population shift towards the open state as well as more pronounced conformational dynamics. Moreover, we capture four conformational states of the S-trimer/ACE2 complex for each of the two variants, revealing an enlarged conformational landscape for the Kappa and Beta S-ACE2 complexes and pronounced population shift towards the three RBDs up conformation. These results implicate that the mutations in Kappa and Beta may modify the kinetics of receptor binding and viral fusion to improve virus fitness. Combined with biochemical analysis, our structural study shows that the two variants are enabled to efficiently interact with ACE2 receptor despite their sensitive ACE2 binding surface is modified to escape recognition by some potent neutralizing MAbs.

However, alternative work arrangements (AWAs) such as telecommuting have long been offered by accounting firms to mitigate work-family conflict and other concerns inherent to the public accounting profession. Prior research has examined attitudes and perceptions about AWAs, but relatively little is known from the AWA adopters themselves and those who work directly with them. Given the heavy reliance on teamwork, multiple supervisors, and multiple clients in public accounting, it is not clear how telecommuting impacts critical relationship dynamics. Accounting students, though experienced with remote learning, can learn from pre-COVID telecommuters insights and experiences. In this paper, we interview telecommuters in public accounting as well as a non-telecommuting teammate (subordinate or superior) to develop rich insights about telecommutings impact from multiple perspectives. Our findings present best practices and challenges regarding telecommuting implementation within a team setting.

Thus, we evaluated the rate and severity of DDI between LPV-r for COVID-19 treatment and concomitant medications. This was a cross-sectional study including all individuals diagnosed of SARS-CoV-2 infection treated with LPV-r and attended at a single center in Southern Spain (March 1st to April 30th, 2020). The frequency [95% confidence interval (95% CI)] of potential and major DDI were calculated. Overall, 469 patients were diagnosed of COVID-19, 125 (27%) of them were prescribed LPV-r. LPV-r had potential DDI with concomitant medications in 97 (78%, 95% CI 69-85%) patients, and in 33 (26%, 95% CI 19-35%) individuals showed major DDI. Twelve (36%) patients with major DDI and 14 (15%) individuals without major DDI died (p = 0.010).

Several countries witnessed rapid transmission of omicron in the past months. This variant can increase the rate of virus transmission, risk of reinfection and enable omicron to continue its spread in the community. There is no evidence that COVID-19 can spread through food, and people can catch up with this virus through food materials. This virus can not survive and multiple on the surfaces of food packaging. The main routes of this virus transmission and spread may be during close contact and directly from an infected person to a healthy person. Touching a contaminated surface and objects such as doorknobs, table surfaces, everyday use equipment, touching screens and shaking hands and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes may also be a source of infection.1 Recent research reported that the COVID-19 virus could survive and remain viable on plastics for up to 72 hours, 4 hours on stainless steel and copper and up to 24 hours on cardboard. Since the food sector has complex processing and manufacturing processes with a series of operational steps, starting from food intake, receiving, preparation, production, processing, packaging, storage and delivery to market and customers. At each stage, food handlers are directly involved, there is a more likelihood of food handlers touching the food or food surfaces directly. In this case, food workers are not following proper food safety control and protective actions, e.g., hand washings, cleaning and disinfection, sanitization, and social distancing. If not vaccinated, it can be a possible source of omicron transmission. To prevent the potential transmission of emerging Omicron SARS-COV-2 Variant of Concern, the food sector should ensure compliance with food safety control measures and prerequisites to safe and protect food workers from omicron variants to mitigate the risks of transmission of the virus by adopting good hygienic practices (GHPs), good manufacturing practices (GMPs), appropriate cleaning and disinfection by approved chemicals and sanitizers to endure the production and consistent stream of safe food. Since all the food workers may well be aware of the precautions measures, it is still needed to refresh their information. The staff working in food premises should be provided with frequent refresher training, proper personal protective equipment (PPEs), and written instructions on how to contain the transmission of Omicron and COVID-19 variants.2 One of the most critical steps to restrict the spread and transmission of the COVID-19 during food service processes is to wash and sanitize frequently. Frequent hand washing should be obligatory for Food workers directly involved in food production and preparation activities. The staff should avoid touching the food contact surfaces of tables, utensils, small wares, cutting boards and knives and surfaces of food menu, kiosks, dispensers, door handles, freezers and cooler handles, tablets, computers and equipment controller surfaces, buttons, and touchpads. There is a possibility that the virus can transfer from unwashed hands to other cleaned and sanitized surfaces during food production, preparations, cooking, storage, serving to customers and then moving to other food staff and eventually to customers. Frequent disinfection and sanitization with approved sanitizer to reduce the microorganisms loads to a safe level determined by food safety authorities and public health codes are crucial to mitigating the risk of virus transmission. Social distancing to keep a space of at least 2 meters during operation hours at food premises to limit the close staff contacts inside food preparation and production areas is critically important to limit the spread.2 It is also recommended by CDC and other food safety authorities. The staff Should avoid unnecessary gatherings and crowds during shift changes, breaks and staff training. The food premises should optim ze the number of food workers to occupy maximum capacity at food premises and ensure fewer food workers are available than normal staff to a smaller amount of COVID-19 transmission risks.3,4 The food facilities should also provide appropriate personnel protective equipments (PPEs) for staff while receiving incoming materials and during deliveries, which can enhance the staff protection from the virus. Finally, the food amenities should look for staff health and monitor the visitors, suppliers, and contractors to recognize any sick person, maximize protection, and report to related health authorities if someone's symptoms are identical to emerging COVID-19 omicron variant concern.

METHODS: Parent satisfaction was longitudinally evaluated through questionnaires. The survey was developed with Google Questionnaire forms and sent via WhatsApp. The questionnaire consisted of 13 items concerning the management of KDTs using telemedicine in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our population of patients has limited financial resources and low levels of education. Given that many families did not have either computers or WIFI, or any other access to information or communication technology, WhatsApp was chosen as a tool as it was available on the cell phones of all families and the professionals. RESULTS: Our survey showed that 96.3% of the parents were satisfied with the management of KDTs through telemedicine. The main benefits observed were the possibility of continuing treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic and the ease of accessing the professional team from the comfort of their home. Overall, 72.2% of the families would recommend using telemedicine for KDTs in any situation regardless of the pandemic. None of the families reported that they would recommend against treatment by telemedicine. The availability of a social support network (parents WhatsApp group) coordinated by professionals from the KDT team was considered to be useful by most respondents (90%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that management of children with DRE on KDTs through telemedicine is feasible, well accepted by the families, and probably as safe as conventional medicine.

Plastinated models provide an authentic learning experience of the human body, but lack necessary labels outlining important structures. Due to the fragile nature of the specimens, we endeavored to solve the challenge of labeling by developing a digitized supplement and archive of plastinated and pathology specimens. An interdisciplinary team of faculty and multimedia designers at NYU School of Medicine designed and developed electronic resources related to the artistic models and plastinated specimens. Over the course of three months, 60 artistic and plastinated models of different sizes were captured from dozens of angles using a digital camera or an Artec Leo Scanner. The numerous image captures of the plastinated specimens were processed in Agisoft Metashape, a stand-alone software product, that performs photogrammetric processing of digital images and generates 3D spatial data. After Agisoft Metashape exported a complex 3D mesh with a high-resolution texture, anatomy faculty added labels to the digitized 3D anatomy specimens using the Sketchfab web platform. The labeled 3D anatomy models were then uploaded into the Living Anatomy site on NYU School of Medicine's learning management system for students to explore before, during, and after their anatomy lab sessions. Quizzes using these models also were created to help students identify the structures and link them to physiology and clinical scenarios. The digitized 3D models allow students to zoom in, rotate and explore the specimens in a more interactive way, thereby enhancing the process of just observing fragile plastination models. When asked, 84% of students reported that the 3D models of plastinated specimens contributed \\"very much so\\" to their learning of anatomical relationships. We will continue to find opportunities for the meaningful integration of these 3D models within the anatomy curriculum as well as into other pre-clerkship and clerkship modules.

Using this matrix, we propose a novel visualization approach consisting of the computation of spectral embeddings, i.e., characteristic domain maps, defined by particle mixture probabilities. These embeddings are scalar fields that give insight into the mixing processes of the flow on different scales.

Recently, a novel host factor for SARS-CoV-2 entry, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) has been identified. These receptors potentiate viral infection in the presence of other host factors like ACE2. Through its C-end rule (CendR) motif exposed following furin processing, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to the CendR pocket of NRP-1 and achieves cell entry through endocytosis. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the NRP-1 receptor interferes with the docking of its endogenous ligand VEGF-A, signaling that would otherwise promote nociception.

A negative control used patients who tested negative for COVID-19 and patients negative for COVID with an influenza diagnosis. Main Outcomes and Measures Cox proportional hazard models estimated the association between a COVID-19 positive test and subsequent psychiatric morbidity (depression, anxiety, psychosis, or self-harm), sleep problems, fatigue or psychotropic prescribing. Models adjusted for comorbidities, ethnicity, smoking and BMI. Results After adjusting for observed confounders, there was an association between testing positive for COVID-19 and almost all markers of psychiatric morbidity, fatigue and sleep problems. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for incident psychiatric morbidity was 1.75 (95% CI 1.56-1.96).

The future of clinical science, as it morphs into translational medicine, is now creating unique possibilities where even the most intractable diseases are now open to being conquered.","output":"Accelerating the transition of clinical science to translational medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, the continuing murder of Black Americans by police officers received widespread media attention and sparked global outrage.

However, most approaches cannot efficiently predict the potency level of candidates after scaffold hopping. Herein, we identified potent PDE5 inhibitors with a novel scaffold via a free energy perturbation (FEP)-guided scaffold-hopping strategy, and FEP shows great advantages to precisely predict the theoretical binding potencies G(FEP) between ligands and their target, which were more consistent with the experimental binding potencies G(EXP) (the mean absolute deviations [Formula: see text] < 2 kcal/mol) than those G(MM-PBSA) or G(MM-GBSA) predicted by the MM-PBSA or MM-GBSA method. Lead L12 had an IC(50) of 8.7 nmol/L and exhibited a different binding pattern in its crystal structure with PDE5 from the famous starting drug tadalafil.

This epidemic, however, had additional challenges to offer in the form of acute shortage of all forms of amphotericin B, posaconazole and isavuconazole. It was, therefore, planned to assess the trends in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antifungal agents, viz itraconazole and terbinafine, and provide a template for personalized therapy to see whether the results could be translated clinically. This is an observational, single-center study. Samples comprising nasal swab, nasal and paranasal sinus tissue, brain tissue, brain abscess and orbital content, derived from 322 patients from northern India with mucormycosis, of whom 215 were male and 107 were female, were used for analysis. Cultures were identified both by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and conventional methods of identification. Antifungal susceptibility was done for amphotericin B, posaconazole, isavuconazole, itraconazole and terbinafine as per Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute M38-A2. The outcome was identification of the species of mucormycosis and susceptibility to itraconazole and terbinafine besides other primary antifungal agents. Patients or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting or in the dissemination plans of our research. Of 322 patients, 203 were culture-positive, of whom 173 were positive by both MALDI-TOF and conventional methods of identification. Final antifungal susceptibility testing was available for 150 patients. The most common Mucorales found to cause this epidemic was Rhizopus oryzae, followed by R. microsporus Amphotericin B, posaconazole and isavuconazole had low MIC values in 98.8% of all Mucorales identified. The MIC of itraconazole was species-dependent. 97.7% of R oryzae had MIC 2 g/mL. However, only 36.5% of R microsporus had MIC 2 g/mL. For terbinafine, 85.2% of R. microsporus had MIC 2 g/mL. We conclude that identification at the species level is required as antifungal susceptibilities seem to be species-dependent. Assessment of the efficacy of itraconazole and terbinafine warrants further studies with clinical assessment and therapeutic drug monitoring as they seem to be potential candidates especially when the primary agents are not available.","output":"Utility of itraconazole and terbinafine in mucormycosis: a proof-of-concept analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) is a tool used to screen for significant fibrosis and portal hypertension. The aim of this retrospective multicentre study was to develop an easy tool using LSM for clinical outcomes in advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) patients. DESIGN: This international multicentre cohort study included a derivation ACLD patient cohort with valid two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) results. Clinical and laboratory parameters at baseline and during follow-up were recorded. LSM by transient elastography (TE) was also recorded if available. The primary outcome was overall mortality. The secondary outcome was the development of first/further decompensation. RESULTS: After screening 2148 patients (16 centres), 1827 patients (55 years, 62.4% men) were included in the 2D-SWE cohort, with median liver SWE (L-SWE) 11.8 kPa and a model for end stage liver disease (MELD) score of 8. Combination of MELD score and L-SWE predict independently of mortality (AUC 0.8). L-SWE cut-off at 20 kPa combined with MELD 10 could stratify the risk of mortality and first/further decompensation in ACLD patients. The 2-year mortality and decompensation rates were 36.9% and 61.8%, respectively, in the 305 (18.3%) high-risk patients (with L-SWE 20 kPa and MELD 10), while in the 944 (56.6%) low-risk patients, these were 1.1% and 3.5%, respectively. Importantly, this M10LS20 algorithm was validated by TE-based LSM and in an additional cohort of 119 patients with valid point shear SWE-LSM. CONCLUSION: The M10LS20 algorithm allows risk stratification of patients with ACLD. Patients with L-SWE 20 kPa and MELD 10 should be followed closely and receive intensified care, while patients with low risk may be managed at longer intervals.","output":"Two-dimensional shear wave elastography predicts survival in advanced chronic liver disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to evaluate the successful handling of COVID-19 in Surakarta city government.

Using wild-type and targeted deletion strains, we measured ATP-dependent peroxisomal octanoate ?-oxidation, intra-peroxisomal ATP levels employing peroxisome-targeted ATP-sensing reporter proteins, and ATP uptake in proteoliposomes prepared from purified peroxisomes. We show that intra-peroxisomal ATP levels are maintained by different peroxisomal membrane proteins each with different modes of action: 1) the previously reported Ant1p protein, which catalyzes the exchange of ATP for AMP or ADP, 2) the ABC transporter protein complex Pxa1p/Pxa2p, which mediates both uni-directional acyl-CoA and ATP uptake, and 3) the mitochondrial Aac2p protein, which catalyzes ATP/ADP exchange and has a dual localization in both mitochondria and peroxisomes.

Reopening schools safely for both the students and the community is now a social and economic priority, but recent research has warned about the importance of the prevention and intensive tracing of infectious cases in schools to reduce the risks of reopening. The nature of school activities C including multiple close interactions with large numbers of people in a limited space C has made it particularly difficult to meet those objectives. We aim to predict the impact of number of students in each class on the network of contacts made in a school setting. The number of close contacts is a well-accepted proxy for both the risks of spreading an infection and the opportunities for effective tracing.Methods: We propose a probabilistic metric to measure the influence of class size policies on the number of close contacts made in a school setting using different assumptions about school population and family situation. Our model uses an estimation of the most likely number of additional classes that would expand the network of contacts through siblings each day by analyzing a tree of conditional probabilities based on the relative weight of attending a class already in the network versus the total number of options. Our modelling contributes by considering the class size effects, not only through contacts in the same classroom but also through siblings in other classrooms and by analyzing the evolution of the network of contacts as a function of time.Findings: Our results show that the number of students in contact at school grows very quickly at first where there are higher class sizes compared to the more steady growth of contacts for smaller class sizes. Employing different scenarios, our results show that the network of contacts grows exponentially as a function of the number of students in the class. Using the example of a school with 600 children, we demonstrate that the number of contacts expands up to six times faster in class sizes of 30 students than in small classes of 10 students. Consequently, the time required for all the 600 students in the school to be in contact varies from 5 days for class sizes of 30 to 28 days for class sizes of 10. The incremental effect of the class size on the number of contacts intensifies when the total number of children in the school is larger. For example, in a school of 960 children, the saturation times are 7 and 44 days for class sizes of 30 and 10, respectively. Additionally, our results also show that siblings may be a relevant and often under analyzed source of indirect contacts in a school.Interpretation: The number of students in contact at school may grow quickly as a consequence of indirect contacts, even when classes are completely isolated during school hours. However, having a low number of students in a class generates a strong exponential reduction in the likely number of days in which the infection spreads in a specific school. Consequently, limiting class sizes may have a strong effect on the opportunities for tracing potential infections in a school and reduce the risks for their communities of keeping the school open.Funding Statement: Spanish Ministry of Industry and Competitiveness (research grant ECO2016-75909) and Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (research grant PID2019-106725GB-I00) for partial funding.Declaration of Interests: J.A.A.C. has received funding from the Spanish Ministry of Industry and Competitiveness (ECO2016- 75909) to analyze how to improve the sustainability of organizations.

The objectives were to study the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and bystander-victim relationship on the willingness of Thai healthcare providers (HCPs) and laypersons to perform CPR and associated factors. Methods: : The cross-sectional online survey was conducted between August to November 2020 in a Thai population. A structured questionnaire was developed and given to volunteers as an online survey. We recorded participant characteristics and willingness to perform compression-only CPR (W-COC) and conventional CPR (W-CC) on family members, acquaintances, and strangers during the pandemic and in a non-pandemic situation and analyzed associated factors. Results: : We included 419 laypersons and 716 HCPs. Lay-participants expressed less W-COC on acquaintances and strangers (risk ratio [RR] 0.74-0.85), but not on family members. By contrast, the HCPs were less W-COC across the board (RR 0.84-0.92). Both groups were less W-CC on all recipients (RR 0.43-0.54). There was no difference in participants W-COC and W-CC on family members and acquaintances, except that HCPs expressed greater W-CC on family members. Participants in all groups were less W-COC and W-CC on strangers. W-COC was correlated with CPR knowledge (Odds ratio [OR] 2.32), self-efficacy (OR 1.96), single marital status (OR 1.91), and being an HCP (OR 2.00). W-CC on family members was related to CPR knowledge (OR 2.16). Conclusion: Participants were less willing during the COVID-19 pandemic on all groups except family members of lay participants.

Accordingly, the ROS and SA contents in WRKY55-overexpression plants are higher than that in the control, while mutants showed a contrast change.

Healthcare personnel (HCP) is facing a consistent risk of hospital-acquired infections, and subsequently higher rates of morbidity and mortality. We proposed a domain knowledge-driven infection risk model to quantify the individual HCP and the population-level healthcare facility risks. For individual-level risk estimation, a time-variant infection risk model is proposed to capture the transmission dynamics of CVDs. At the population-level, the infection risk is estimated using a Bayesian network model constructed from three feature sets including individual-level factors, engineering control factors, and administrative control factors. The sensitivity analyses indicated that the uncertainty in the individual infection risk can be attributed to two variables: the number of close contacts and the viral transmission probability. The model validation was implemented in the transmission probability model, individual level risk model, and population-level risk model using a Coronavirus disease case study. Regarding the first, multivariate logistic regression was applied for a cross-sectional data in the UK with an AIC value of 7317.70 and a 10-fold cross validation accuracy of 78.23%.

Few studies have attempted to calculate years of life lost (YLL) to COVID-19 and compare it with YLL due to other causes in different countries. METHODS: We calculated YLL to COVID-19 from week10 to week52 in 2020 for eight European countries by methods defined by the WHO. We calculated excess YLL by subtracting the average YLL from 2017 to 2019 to the YLL in 2020. Our analysis compared YLL to COVID-19 and the excess YLL of non-COVID-19 causes across countries in Europe. RESULTS: Portugal registered 394,573 cases and 6619 deaths due to COVID-19, accounting for 25,395 YLL in just 10 months. COVID-19 was responsible for 6.7% of all deaths but accounted for only 4.2% of all YLL. We estimate that Portugal experienced an excess of 35,510 YLL (+ 6.2%), of which 72% would have been due to COVID-19 and 28% due to non-COVID-19 causes. Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands experienced excess YLL to non-COVID-19 causes. We also estimated that Portugal experienced an excess of 10,115 YLL due to cancer (3805), cardiovascular diseases (786) and diseases of the respiratory system (525). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had a major impact on mortality rates in Portugal, as well as in other European countries. The relative impact of COVID-19 on the number of deaths has been greater than on the number of YLL, because COVID-19 deaths occur mostly in advanced ages.

RESULT: For all patients, the average titers and positive rates of IgG/IgM within 30 days from symptoms onset reached to the peak and then began continuous decline. The titers and positive rates of IgG/IgM from symptoms 180 to 210 days remained 43.1  27.0 AU/mL/84.3% and 4.4  5.2 AU/mL/12.0%, respectively.

Its tissue tropism and replication in different cell lines are not well understood. OBJECTIVE Compare the growth characteristics of cell lines infected by S-OIV, seasonal influenza A H1N1 (sH1N1) and avian influenza A H5N1 (H5N1) viruses and the effect of temperature on viral replication. STUDY DESIGN Cytopathic effect (CPE), antigen expression by immunofluorescence (IF) and viral load profile by quantitative RT-PCR in 17 cell lines infected by S-OIV, sH1N1 and H5N1 were examined. Comparison of their replication efficiency in chick embryo was performed. The effect of temperature on viral replication in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells was determined by TCID(50) at 33 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 39 degrees C for 5 consecutive days. RESULTS S-OIV replicated in cell lines derived from different tissues or organs and host species with comparable viral load to sH1N1. Among 13 human cell lines tested, Caco-2 has the highest viral load for S-OIV. S-OIV showed a low viral load with no CPE or antigen expression in pig kidney cell PK-15, H5N1 demonstrated the most diverse cell tropism by CPE and antigen expression, and the highest viral replication efficiency in both cell lines and allantoic fluid. All three viruses demonstrated best growth at 37 degrees C in MDCK cells. CONCLUSION Cell line growth characteristics of S-OIV, sH1N1 and H5N1 appear to correlate clinically and pathologically with involved anatomical sites and severity. Low replication of S-OIV in PK-15 suggests that this virus is more adapted to human than swine.","output":"Differential susceptibility of different cell lines to swine-origin influenza A H1N1, seasonal human influenza A H1N1, and avian influenza A H5N1 viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has dramatically affected the entire world.

We aimed to evaluate bacterial bronchial infection as a possible reason for non response to conventional asthma therapy, and to identify and characterise the predominant pathogens involved. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed microbiological and cytological findings in a selected population of young wheezers with symptoms unresponsive to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy, who underwent flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Procedural measures were taken to limit contamination risk and quantitative bacterial culture of BAL fluid (significance cut-off  10(4) colony-forming units/ml) was used. Modern microbiological methods were used for detection of a wide panel of pathogens and for characterisation of the bacterial isolates. RESULTS: 33 children aged between 4 and 38 months, without structural anomalies of the conductive airways were evaluated. Significant bacterial BAL cultures were found in 48,5 % of patients. Haemophilus influenzae was isolated in 30,3 %, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 12,1 % and Moraxella catarrhalis in 12,1 %. All H. influenzae isolates were non-encapsulated strains and definitely distinguished from non-haemolytic H. haemolyticus. Respiratory viruses were detected in 21,9 % of cases with mixed bacterial-viral infection in 12,1 %. Cytology revealed a marked neutrophilic inflammation.

The studies selection process will be reported through the PRISMA Statement diagram model. All studies describing the molecular mechanisms possibly involved in the development of malformations caused by embryonic/fetal ZIKV exposure in animal models with an appropriate control group and methodology will be included (including, for instance, randomized and non-randomized studies). All animals used as experimental models for ZIKV teratogenesis may be included as long as exposure to the virus occurred during the embryonic/fetal period. From the selected studies, data will be extracted using a previously prepared standard form. Bias risk evaluation will be conducted following the SYRCLEs Risk of Bias tool.

In this paper, we extend our previous work by combining classical and deep learning methods in an attempt to improve the localization accuracy using CSI. We then test the generalization aspect of both approaches in different environments by splitting the training and test sets such that their intersection is reduced when compared with uniform random splitting. The deep learning approach is a Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP NN) and the classical machine learning method is based on K-nearest neighbors (KNN). The estimation results of both approaches outperform state-of-the-art performance on the same dataset.

Environmental and lifestyle factors, including diet, have been proposed to play a role in the onset and severity of RA. Dietary manipulation may help to manage the symptoms of RA by lowering inflammation and potentially decreasing pain. Methods: In 40 patients with long-standing RA with stable symptoms and treated with conventional (c-) and biological (b-) disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), the effect of a 3-month diet avoiding meat, gluten, and lactose (and all dairy products; privative diet) was evaluated in comparison with a control balanced diet including those foods. Both diets were designed to reduce weight since all patients were overweight or obese. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the diets, and RA was clinically assessed at Time 0 (T0), through the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), for pain, and the Disease Activity Score of 28 joints (DAS 28) for RA activity. Patients were also administered the Short Form Health survey (SF-36) and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). At T0, a blood sample was collected for laboratory tests and adipokines measurements, and anthropometric measurements were compared. These evaluations were repeated at the end of the 3 months dietary regimens. Results: A significant decrease in VAS and the improvement of the overall state of physical and mental health, assessed through SF-36, was observed in patients assigned to the privative diet. Both dietary regimens resulted in the improvement of quality of life compared to baseline values; however, the change was significant only for the privative diet. With either diet, patients showed significant decreases in body weight and body mass index, with a reduction in waist and hips circumference and lower basal glucose and circulating leptin levels. A privative diet was also able to significantly reduce systolic (p = 0.003) and diastolic (p = 0.025) arterial pressure. The number of circulating leukocytes and neutrophils, and the level of hs-C-Reactive Protein also decreased after 3 months of the meat-, lactose-, and gluten-free diet.

The assay has a high specificity and sensitivity, and robust reproducibility, and its results can be monitored using a real-time PCR machine or visualized via colorimetric change from red to yellow. The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay is 118.6 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA per 25 L reaction. The reaction can be completed within 30 min for real-time fluorescence monitoring, or 40 min for visual detection when the template input is more than 200 copies per 25 L reaction. To evaluate the viability of the assay, a comparison between the RT-LAMP and a commercial RT-qPCR assay was made using 56 clinical samples.

The overall incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 reinfections was 5.99 (95% CI 5.89-6.09) per 1,000 person-months for those who survived the first three months after primary infection. The reinfection risk was estimated as 0.76% at six months, 1.36% at nine months, 4.96% at 12 months, 16.7% at 15 months, and 18.9% at 18 months. Among 34 second reinfections, none resulted in hospitalization or death. Unvaccinated (OR=1.23; 95%CI=1.14-1.33), incompletely (OR=1.33; 95%CI=1.08-1.64) or completely vaccinated (OR=1.50; 95%CI=1.37-1.63), were modestly more likely to be reinfected compared with those who received a third (booster) vaccine dose. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 reinfections were exceptionally uncommon until the end of 2021 but became common with the advent of the Omicron variant. Very few reinfections were severe. A vaccination booster dose may modestly reduce reinfection risk.","output":"Risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 reinfections during 2020-2022 in Vojvodina, Serbia: a population-level study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Why did banks experience massive deposit inflows during the pandemic? We discover that deposit interest rates at bank branches in counties with higher COVID-19 infection rates fell by more than rates at brancheseven branches of the same bankin counties with lower infection rates. Credit drawdowns, national policies, such as the Payment Protection Program, and a flight-to-safety do not account for these cross-branch changes in deposit rates. Evidence suggests that higher local COVID-19 infection rates are associated with households greater anxiety about future job and income losses, anxiety that induces households to reduce spending and increase deposits.","output":"How Did Depositors Respond to COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening and treatment program was conducted in Hungarian prisons on a voluntary basis. After HCV-RNA testing and genotyping for anti-HCV positives, treatments with direct-acting antiviral agents were commenced by hepatologists who visited the institutions monthly. Patients were supervised by the prisons medical staff. Data were retrospectively collected from the Hungarian Hepatitis Treatment Registry, from the Health Registry of Prisons, and from participating hepatologists. Eighty-four percent of Hungarian prisons participated, meaning a total of 5779 individuals (28% of the inmate population) underwent screening. HCV-RNA positivity was confirmed in 317/5779 cases (5.49%); 261/317 (82.3%) started treatment. Ninety-nine percent of them admitted previous intravenous drug use. So far, 220 patients received full treatment and 41 patients are still on treatment. Based on the available end of treatment (EOT) + 24 weeks timepoint data, per protocol sustained virologic response rate was 96.8%. In conclusion, the Hungarian prison screening and treatment program, with the active participation of hepatologists and the prisons medical staff, is a well-functioning model. Through the Hungarian experience, we emphasize that the test-and-treat principle is feasible and effective at micro-eliminating HCV in prisons, where infection rate, as well as history of intravenous drug usage, are high.","output":"Hepatitis C Screening and Treatment Program in Hungarian Prisons in the Era of Direct Acting Antiviral Agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laparoscopic surgery was developed at the end of the 1980s and has been utilized in almost all urologic surgical procedures.

We assessed advance directive completion, healthcare proxy (HCP), and attitudes toward ACP among older adults ages 50+ living with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Internet-based surveys were administered to 100 participants residing in the Coachella Valley, California from April to June 2020. We examined self-reported completion of an advance directive, HCP, and attitudes toward ACP before and after COVID-19. Adjusted regressions were performed on attitudes toward ACP. Results: Participants' mean age was 64.2 years, most were non-Hispanic white (88.0%), men (96.0%), and identified as sexual minorities (96.0%). Many reported having an advance directive (59.6%) or HCP (67.3%). Most (57.6%) believed ACP to be more important now compared to the pre-pandemic era. Having an advance directive was associated with increase in age, higher education, living with other people, never having an AIDS diagnosis, and current undetectable viral load (p < 0.05). Having a HCP was associated with higher education, being married/partnered, and living with other people (p < 0.05). In a logistic regression model adjusted for education and living situation, the belief that ACP was more important during COVID was associated with not having an advance directive (OR: 5.07, 95% CI: 1.78-14.40) and fear of COVID-19 infection (OR: 4.17, 95% CI: 1.61-10.76.)

As oncology practices adapt to a contracted health care system, expertise gained from partnerships in low-resource settings can be used for guidance. This article provides a primer on priority setting in oncology and ethical guidance based on lessons learned from experience with cancer care priority setting in low-resource settings. Observations: Lessons learned from real-world experiences are myriad. First, in the setting of limited resources, a utilitarian approach to maximizing survival benefit should guide decision-making. Second, conflicting principles will often arise among stakeholders and decision makers. Third, fair decision-making procedures should be established to ensure moral legitimacy and accountability. Fourth, proactive safeguards must be implemented to protect vulnerable individuals, or disparities in cancer treatment and outcomes will only widen further. Fifth, communication with patients and families about priority setting decisions should be intentional and standardized. Sixth, moral distress among clinicians must be addressed to avoid burnout during a time when resilience is critical. Conclusions and Relevance: Although the need to triage cancer care may be new to those who underwent training and now practice oncology in high-resource settings, it is familiar for those who practice in low- and middle-income countries. Oncologists in the United States facing unprecedented decisions about prioritization can draw on ethical frameworks and lessons learned from real-world cancer care priority setting in resource-constrained environments.","output":"Applying Lessons Learned From Low-Resource Settings to Prioritize Cancer Care in a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is having an unprecedented and unpredictable impact on the world's economy.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) are missing work days due to illness or high-risk exposure (HRE) to an infected person. To avoid staffing shortages, we implemented a SARS-CoV-2 test-based strategy among asymptomatic HCWs after HRE to facilitate early return to work. METHODS: In July 2020, our institution implemented a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test-based strategy among HCWs within 7 days of HRE. HCWs were defined as any paid or unpaid persons directly or indirectly involved in patient care. HRE was defined as close contact < 6 feet with an infected household member without use of mask and lasting for  15 minutes. Contact with a patient or coworker was not considered high-risk due to universal masking and eye protection use. HCWs underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR testing of a nasopharyngeal swab at least once (1-2 days post-exposure) or twice (5-7 days post-exposure). HCWs with symptoms at baseline were excluded. HCWs who were asymptomatic during evaluation were considered as truly asymptomatic (TA). Saved work-days (SWD) were calculated based on number of days saved due to testing strategy compared to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions recommended 14-day quarantine. HCWs were allowed to return to work within 7 days of HRE if they tested negative, or after completing 10-day isolation period  improvement in symptoms from symptom onset if they tested positive. RESULTS: Between 07/01/2020 to 12/31/2020, 450 unique asymptomatic HCWs underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. Of those, 84% were women and median age was 36 years, 347 tested negative and 103 tested positive. Of those positives, 33% of HCWs tested positive on day 2 after HRE with 141 SWDs (average 2 days/person). Only 37% were TA positives. Of those negatives, 94% were TA SARS-CoV-2 negative with 2620 SWDs (average 7.5 days/person). There were no healthcare outbreaks related to HCWs allowed to return to work following this strategy. [Image: see text] Asymptomatic healthcare workers commonly tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on day 2 from household exposure compared to other days CONCLUSION: Test-based strategy among asymptomatic HCWs with HRE reduced loss of workdays and helped limit staffing shortages. Majority of positive HCWs developed symptoms after positive SARS-CoV-2 testing, which may support allowing most fully vaccinated HCWs with no COVID-like symptoms to continue to work unless symptomatic.

We designed, implemented, and evaluated the following remote care pathway: a personalized web-based support tool, home hearing check, selfCdevice adjustment, and upgrading of sound processors at home rather than in the clinic. The remote care group had a significant increase in empowerment after using the tools, and the patients and clinicians were keen to continue. We would now like to scale up these improvements as an option for >12,000 UK adults using implants; we are commissioning an independent evaluation of this intervention and rollout to establish if it achieves its aims of more empowered and confident patients; more accessible and equitable care; stable hearing; more efficient, person-centered, and scalable service; and more satisfied and engaged patients and clinicians. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the impact and rollout of a person-centered clinical care pathway via telemedicine for adults with cochlear implants in the United Kingdom, using both outcomes and process evaluation. METHODS: This project will scale up and evaluate a person-centered long-term follow-up pathway for adults using cochlear implants through a personalized website, including a home hearing check, uploading photos of cochlear implant site, listening in noise and music practice, ordering of spares, questionnaires, and other resources.

But, for a substantial number of law students, it is. It does not have to be this way.This is not a typical law review article. It cannot afford to be. Most law students begin law school as reasonably happy and well-adjusted people. We must ask, what is it about law school that contributes to the disproportionate decline in student wellness? The answer to that question is complex because many of the very factors that make good lawyers also contribute to their mental health challenges.This paper contains a blueprint, borne out of experience, of how to reimagine legal education with a focus on wellness. This goes beyond a general call to action, but rather presents concrete actions that faculty, law administrators, and students themselves can take to effectively manage the stresses inherent in law school and the legal profession. These changes will be long-term and will profoundly impact the well-being of not only legal practitioners, but the very practice of law itself. There will be resistance, but making this transition is crucial. We know that when law students first enter law school their psychological profile is similar to that of the general public, but their depression rates increase drastically across three years of legal education. Lawyers have the dubious distinction of being the most frequently depressed professionals in the U.S., and the legal profession ranks among the highest in incidence of suicide by occupation.Two recent and major events have exacerbated this already dire landscape of wellness dysfunction: COVID-19 and widespread protests associated with the quest for racial justice. For students who managed their addiction recovery or mental health challenges in part by having the structure and accountability of a classroom setting and nearby counseling services, social distancing threatens those means of coping. Then the killings of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and others ignited a wave protests that likely caused some law students to experience race-based and other types of trauma. The absence of a culture of wellness in law schools may lead law students to endure these added traumas in silence.As other movements have found national and global recognition recently, it is time for a wellness crusade in legal education. Just as movements have galvanized the public to demand action on issues of racial injustice, gender equality, and climate change, so the legal profession must take steps to comprehensively address the wellness crisis spanning the lecture halls to practice. Just as America must be willing to undergo an honest reckoning and radical reforms in order to evolve into a more just and equitable society, law schools and the legal profession must undergo foundational changes in order to graduate healthy and whole students. The reforms outlined in this article not only reimagine the law school experience for thousands of law students, but they would, over time, lead to a qualitative change in the delivery of legal services themselves.

Chloroquine 450 mg BID on day 1 and 450 mg once daily from days 2 to 5 or hydroxychloroquine 400 mg BID on day 1 and 400 mg once daily from days 2 to 5 were administered in the intervention group. Patients were enrolled from April 16 to August 06, 2020, in 6 hospitals in southern Brazil. The primary outcome was the clinical status measured on day 14 after randomization with a 9-point ordinal scale. The main secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality; invasive mechanical ventilation use; the incidence of acute renal dysfunction in 28 days; and the clinical status of patients on days 5, 7, 10 and 28. All patients with a positive RT-PCR result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were analyzed (modified intention to treat (mITT) population). Arrythmias and cardiovascular complications were assessed as safety outcomes. A total of 105 patients were enrolled and followed for 28 days. The trial was stopped before reaching the planned sample size due to harmful effects. Patients in the intervention group had a worse clinical outcome on the 14th day (odds ratio (OR) 2.45 [1.17 to 4.93], p = 0.016) and on the 28th day (OR 2.47 [1.15 to 5.30], p = 0.020).

Methods Observational cohort study of all consecutive patients admitted  48 hours to Hospital Clinic of Barcelona for COVID-19 (1 March C 30 September 2020). Findings A total of 1645 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were assessed over a 7-month period. Overall mortality (30 days) was 9?7% (159 patients), 7?7% in patients hospitalised in regular wards and 16?7 % in patients requiring ICU admission. Overall mortality decreased from 11?6% in the first month to 1?4% in the last month, reflecting a progressive, significant downward trend (p for trend <0?001). Patients age changed over time, peaking in June. Most changes in the use of antivirals and anti-inflammatory treatments were documented. Age (OR 1?1, CI 1?1-1?12), chronic heart disease, (OR 1?7, CI 1?1-2?9), D-dimer>700 ng/mL (OR 2?3, CI 1?3-4?1), ferritin>489 ng/mL (OR 1?9; CI 1?5-3?2), C-RP>7 mg/dL (OR 2?6; CI 1?5-4?6), and shorter duration from symptom onset to hospital admission (OR 1?11; CI 1?04-1?17) were factors associated with 30-day mortality at hospital admission. Conversely, hospital admission in the last months (OR 0?80; CI 0?65-0?98) was significantly associated with lower mortality.

While growing evidence suggests links between periodontitis and various metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes (T2D), non-alcoholic liver disease, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which often coexist in individuals with abdominal obesity, factors linking periodontal inflammation to common metabolic alterations remain to be fully elucidated. More detailed characterization of metabolomic profiles associated with multiple oral and cardiometabolic traits may provide better understanding of the complexity of oral-systemic crosstalk and its underlying mechanism. We performed comprehensive profiling of plasma and salivary metabolomes using untargeted gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to investigate multivariate covariation with clinical markers of oral and systemic health in 31 T2D patients with metabolic comorbidities and 30 control subjects. Orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS) results enabled more accurate characterization of associations among 11 oral and 25 systemic clinical outcomes, and 143 salivary and 78 plasma metabolites. In particular, metabolites that reflect cardiometabolic changes were identified in both plasma and saliva, with plasma and salivary ratios of (mannose + allose):1,5-anhydroglucitol achieving areas under the curve of 0.99 and 0.92, respectively, for T2D diagnosis. Additionally, OPLS analysis of periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA) as the numerical response variable revealed shared and unique responses of metabolomic and clinical markers to PISA between healthy and T2D groups. When combined with linear regression models, we found a significant correlation between PISA and multiple metabolites in both groups, including threonate, cadaverine and hydrocinnamate in saliva, as well as lactate and pentadecanoic acid in plasma, of which plasma lactate showed a predominant trend in the healthy group. Unique metabolites associated with PISA in the T2D group included plasma phosphate and salivary malate, while those in the healthy group included plasma gluconate and salivary adenosine. Remarkably, higher PISA was correlated with altered hepatic lipid metabolism in both groups, including higher levels of triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, leading to increased risk of cardiometabolic disease based on a score summarizing levels of CVD-related biomarkers. These findings revealed the potential utility of saliva for evaluating the risk of metabolic disorders without need for a blood test, and provide evidence that disrupted liver lipid metabolism may underlie the link between periodontitis and cardiometabolic disease.","output":"Saliva and Plasma Reflect Metabolism Altered by Diabetes and Periodontitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed educational trends for all university students, including nursing and midwifery students (NMSs).

The performance of FCV during one-lung ventilation (OLV) under intravascular normo- and hypovolaemia is currently unknown. In this explorative study, we hypothesised that OLV with FCV improves PaO(2) and reduces mechanical power compared to volume-controlled ventilation (VCV). Sixteen juvenile pigs were randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) intravascular normovolaemia (n = 8) and (2) intravascular hypovolaemia (n = 8). To mimic inflammation due to major thoracic surgery, a thoracotomy was performed, and 0.5 g/kg/h lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli continuously administered intravenously. Animals were randomly assigned to OLV with one of two sequences (60 min per mode): (1) VCVCFCV or (2) FCVCVCV. Variables of gas exchange, haemodynamics and respiratory signals were collected 20, 40 and 60 min after initiation of OLV with each mechanical ventilation mode. The distribution of ventilation was determined using electrical impedance tomography (EIT). RESULTS: Oxygenation did not differ significantly between modes (P = 0.881). In the normovolaemia group, the corrected expired minute volume (P = 0.022) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were lower during FCV than VCV. The minute volume (P  0.001), respiratory rate (P  0.001), total PEEP (P  0.001), resistance of the respiratory system (P  0.001), mechanical power (P  0.001) and resistive mechanical power (P  0.001) were lower during FCV than VCV irrespective of the volaemia status. The distribution of ventilation did not differ between both ventilation modes (P = 0.103). CONCLUSIONS: In a model of OLV in normo- and hypovolemic pigs, mechanical power was lower during FCV compared to VCV, without significant differences in oxygenation.

To determine the role of RNA secondary structures within these two host protein binding elements in viral replication, we explored the secondary structure of the 3'-terminal 166 nucleotides of the MHV strain JHM genome using limited RNase digestion assays. Our data indicate that multiple stem-loop and hairpin-loop structures exist within this region. Mutant and wild-type DIssEs were employed to test the function of secondary structure elements in DI RNA replication. Three stem structures were chosen as targets for the introduction of transversion mutations designed to destroy base pairing structures. Mutations predicted to destroy the base pairing of nucleotides 142 to 136 with nucleotides 68 to 74 exhibited a deleterious effect on DIssE replication. Destruction of base pairing between positions 96 to 99 and 116 to 113 also decreased DI RNA replication. Mutations interfering with the pairing of nucleotides 67 to 63 with nucleotides 52 to 56 had only minor effects on DIssE replication. The introduction of second complementary mutations which restored the predicted base pairing of positions 142 to 136 with 68 to 74 and nucleotides 96 to 99 with 116 to 113 largely ameliorated defects in replication ability, restoring DI RNA replication to levels comparable to that of wild-type DIssE RNA, suggesting that these secondary structures are important for efficient MHV replication.

Despite a number of individual transcriptomic studies on these cells, core functional pathways have been difficult to uncover due to the substantial transcriptional overlap of these cells with other effector cell types, as well as transcriptional changes occurring due to disease settings. Developing a core transcriptional module for Tfr cells that integrates multiple cell type comparisons as well as diverse disease settings will allow a more accurate prediction of functional pathways. Researchers studying allergic reactions, immune responses to vaccines, autoimmunity and cancer could use this gene set to better understand the roles of Tfr cells in controlling disease progression. Additional cell types beyond Tfr cells that have similar features of transcriptomic complexity within diverse disease settings may also be studied using similar approaches. High-throughput sequencing technologies allow the generation of large datasets that require specific tools to best interpret the data. The development of a core transcriptional module for Tfr cells will allow investigators to determine if Tfr cells may have functional roles within their biological systems with little knowledge of Tfr biology. With this work, we have addressed the need of core gene modules to define specific subsets of immune cells. Results We introduce an integrated core Tfr cell gene module that can be incorporated into GSEA analysis using various input sizes. The integrated core Tfr gene module was built using transcriptomic studies in Tfr cells from several different tissues, disease settings, and cell type comparisons. Random forest was used to integrate the transcriptomic studies to generate the core gene module. A GSEA gene set was formulated from the integrated core Tfr gene module for incorporation into end-user friendly GSEA. The gene sets are presented along with random genes taken from the GTEX data set and are presented as GMT files. The user can upload the gene set to the GSEA website or any gene set tool which takes GMT files. We also present the full results of the model including p-values calculated by random forest.

Changes in the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting can have major effects on the ability of cells to propagate viruses which use this mechanism. Furthermore, studies of this process can illuminate the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of the normal translation reading frame. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae killer virus system uses programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting to synthesize its gene products. Strains harboring the mof2-1 allele demonstrated a fivefold increase in frameshifting and prevented killer virus propagation. In this report, we present the results of the cloning and characterization of the wild-type MOF2 gene. mof2-1 is a novel allele of SUI1, a gene previously shown to play a role in translation initiation start site selection. Strains harboring the mof2-1 allele demonstrated a mutant start site selection phenotype and increased efficiency of programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting and conferred paromomycin sensitivity. The increased frameshifting observed in vivo was reproduced in extracts prepared from mof2-1 cells. Addition of purified wild-type Mof2p/Sui1p reduced frameshifting efficiencies to wild-type levels. Expression of the human SUI1 homolog in yeast corrects all of the mof2-1 phenotypes, demonstrating that the function of this protein is conserved throughout evolution.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: The retrospective analysis (Level III, Therapeutic Study) included consecutive patients who underwent ACL reconstruction between April 2017 and April 2020 using either a free quadriceps tendon autograft or a hamstring tendon autograft. All patients underwent ACL reconstruction to treat isolated ACL injuries. The Tegner-Lysholm knee scoring system and the modified Cincinnati knee score were used for evaluation before surgery, and at six weeks, six months, and one-year follow-up time. RESULTS: In the present study, 35 people underwent quadriceps (QUADRI) grafts and 35 underwent hamstring (HAM) grafts. The demographic data for the groups were extremely comparable. The mean follow-up length for the HAM group was 11.960.28 months, while the QUADRI group had a mean follow-up period of 11.250.43 months. No significant variations in the Cincinnati score were observed between the two groups during any of the treatment's follow-up periods. Similarly, the Tegner Lysholm Score revealed no statistically significant differences between clinical outcomes in the HAM and QUADRI groups at all follow-up visits, except for the sixth week.

To date, the immune correlates of severe COVID-19 in young children have been poorly characterised. METHODS: We report the kinetics of immune responses in relation to clinical and virological features in an infant with acute severe COVID-19 using high-dimensional flow cytometry and multiplex cytokine analysis. RESULTS: Systemic cellular and cytokine profiling show an initial increase in neutrophils and monocytes with depletion of lymphoid cell populations (particularly CD8 + T and NK cells) and elevated inflammatory cytokines. Expansion of memory CD4 + T (but not CD8 + T) cells occurred over time, with a predominant Th2 bias. Marked activation of T cell populations observed during the acute infection gradually resolved as the child recovered. Substantial in vitro activation of T-cell populations and robust cytokine production, in response to inactivated SARS-CoV-2 stimulation, was observed 3 months after infection indicating durable, long-lived cellular immune memory.

OBJECTIVE We aimed to assess the effect of the Pipeline embolization device (Covidien, Irvine, California, USA) on large and giant intracranial aneurysms with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and then correlate with clinical follow-up. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of aneurysms treated solely with Pipeline without adjunctive therapy. The largest aneurysm diameters were compared with pretreatment and post treatment MRI and correlated with DSA and clinical symptoms. RESULTS Twelve patients harboring large and giant saccular unruptured aneurysms, treated with Pipeline, were included. Mean follow-up times were as follows: MRI 22.8 months (range 1-57), DSA 18.2 months (range 1-33), and clinical 29 months (range 1-48). Ten (83%) of 12 treated aneurysms decreased in size on MRI, which was first seen at an average of 17 months (range 4-57). In 70% of patients the change was noted on MRI 1 year after treatment, at an average of 9.1 months (range 4-12). MRI reduction was more likely in angiographically occluded aneurysms. Five aneurysms with complete occlusion on early angiogram showed size reduction on MRI only at 12 months. Mean aneurysm size reduction was 57% (range 19.6-94.2), which correlated well with improvement of cranial neuropathies in 75% and headaches in 100% of patients. CONCLUSION Most aneurysms treated with Pipeline decreased in size, correlating with clinical improvement. Some aneurysms remained unchanged on MRI until a later time point despite early DSA occlusion. It may be reasonable to eliminate early postprocedural imaging and start follow-up only as late as 1 year after FD treatment in clinically stable, asymptomatic patients.","output":"Long-Term Effect of Flow Diversion on Large and Giant Aneurysms: MRI-DSA Clinical Correlation Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has imperatively shaken the behavior of the global financial markets.

Here we use isogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants to demonstrate that the variant that contains S(D614G) has enhanced binding to the human cell-surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), increased replication in primary human bronchial and nasal airway epithelial cultures as well as in a human ACE2 knock-in mouse model, and markedly increased replication and transmissibility in hamster and ferret models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data show that the D614G substitution in S results in subtle increases in binding and replication in vitro, and provides a real competitive advantage in vivo-particularly during the transmission bottleneck.

INTRODUCTION: Due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus and the serious consequences of the diseases, the organization of healthcare worldwide changed in the first quarter of 2020. We show effects of restriction due to protection against the first (April 2020) wave of coronavirus in our surgery care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare characteristics of general surgical inpatient care in April 2020 and April 2021 with April 2019 by the hospital database. METHOD: We compared general surgical data of April 2021, 2020, and 2019 from the medical informatic system at the General, Vascular and Thoracal Surgery Department of the Bajcsy-Zsilinszky Hospital in Budapest. The data were analyzed with MS Excel and SPSS (version 25) programs. RESULTS: Study inclusion criteria met with 197 cases from April 2019, 77 cases from April 2020, and 95 cases from April 2021. Length of stay at surgical department was average 4.51 days in 2019, 6.31 days in 2020, and 6.29 days in 2021. In 2019, average 2.54 urgent and 6.2 planned operations were done, in 2020 these numbers were average 2 and 1 per day and in 2021, 2.8 urgent and 0.9 planned surgical procedures were performed. The number of co-morbidities per capita in elective cases was 1.69 in 2019, 2.97 in 2020, and 2.74 in 2021. Distribution of coded co-morbidities in the case of patients with urgent surgery was significantly different between the groups, in 2019 it was 2.5, in 2020 3.75, and in 2021 3.25 per capita. Postoperative mortality at the same care of patients after urgent surgery was 11.8% in 2019, 13.33% in 2020, and 15.66% in 2021. CONCLUSION: Due to the government instructions because of COVID-19 pandemic, less elective general surgery procedures were performed in our department. Co-morbidities of patients with urgent surgery significantly increased, probably this is responsible for the increase of postoperative mortality.

Most surgeons would favor a standard anterior hernioplasty to minimize the potential risk of damaging the spermatic cord structures that are always intimately fused to the congenital peritoneal sac. This also means overlooking the potential benefit of alternative posterior techniques such as endoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair that is known to offer faster recovery with reduced risk of developing chronic groin pain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of TEP approach for repair of adult inguinoscrotal hernias associated with completely PPV and to compare those results with a corresponding group of male patients undergoing an identical procedure, but with no demonstrated PPV. METHODS This is a prospective study of consecutive male patients diagnosed with inguinal hernia during a 10-year period and eligible for endoscopic TEP repair. Every recognized completely PPV were systematically divided taking care not to damage the attached cord structures and the proximal end closed with a pre-tied Endoloop of PDS. In both groups, all meshes were secured with fibrin sealant only. Patients were reviewed in clinic 2 and 6 weeks after the operation. Further follow-up was scheduled if deemed necessary. The primary post-operative outcome parameter was spermatic cord injury; secondary outcome parameters included groin pain, surgical complications, and recurrence. RESULTS Nine hundred and thirty-nine hernia repairs were prospectively recorded during this period. All procedures were carried out endoscopically. A total of 41 patients with a median age of 27 years presented with 43 inguinoscrotal hernias (two bilateral) related to the presence of a congenital completely PPV. 72% of them were right-sided. No injury to the cord structures was recorded and only one complication (2.4%) occurred at 1 week post-operatively that was unrelated to the PPV. There was no report of chronic groin or testicular pain, symptomatic seroma formation, or hernia recurrence. By comparison, out of the 608 patients representing the no PPV group, there were 35 complications out of 33 patients (5.4%), one of those requiring subsequent laparoscopic revision. Only one early post-operative recurrence was recorded in this group (0.15%). CONCLUSIONS In the presence of a completely PPV, the recognized benefit of a posterior approach, such as endoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repair, outweighs the theoretical risk of damaging the spermatic cord structures when dissecting and dividing the congenital hernia sac. This technique should be the preferred option among expert laparoscopic surgeons.","output":"Methodical endoscopic repair of congenital indirect inguinoscrotal hernia in adult male patients with completely patent processus vaginalis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The recent COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, has quickly spread throughout the world. In this study, we systematically reviewed the clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched from January 1, 2020, to April 16, 2020. Case reports and case series of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were included. Two reviewers screened 366 studies and 14 studies were included. Four reviewers independently extracted the features from the studies. We used a random-effects model to analyse the incidence (P) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 236 pregnant women with COVID-19. The results were as follows: positive CT findings (71%; 95% CI, 0.49-0.93), caesarean section (65%; 95% CI, 0.42-0.87), fever (51%; 95% CI, 0.35-0.67), lymphopenia (49%; 95% CI, 0.29-0.70), coexisting disorders (33%; 95% CI, 0.21-0.44), cough (31%; 95% CI, 0.23-0.39), fetal distress (29%; 95% CI, 0.08-0.49), preterm labor (23%; 95% CI, 0.14-0.32), and severe case or death (12%; 95% CI, 0.03-0.20). The subgroup analysis showed that compared with non-pregnant patients, pregnant women with COVID-19 had significantly lower incidences of fever (pregnant women, 51%; non-pregnant patients, 91%; P < 0.00001) and cough (pregnant women, 31%; non-pregnant patients, 67%; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidences of fever, cough and positive CT findings in pregnant women with COVID-19 are less than those in the normal population with COVID-19, but the rate of preterm labor is higher among pregnant with COVID-19 than among normal pregnant women.

The groups reported shorter sleep on workdays than during holidays (median difference: SWD group 1.7 h, p<0.001; reference group 1.5 h; p<0.05). The SWD group's self-estimated sleep during holidays increased less above the sleep need (median 0.0 h) than the reference group's sleep (1.0 h, p<0.05). In addition, the SWD group reported good recovery from irregular working hours less often (14%) than the reference group (100%, p<0.001). Although holidays were generally associated with longer sleep estimates than workdays, employees with SWD experienced consistently less efficient recovery than those without SWD.","output":"Do holidays change subjective sleep length or sleep debt in shift work disorder?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health-related behaviors among children and adolescents are likely to be profound and long-lasting. This study aimed to investigate the changes in lifestyle and social support and their associations with negative impacts due to the pandemic. A classroom survey using stratified random sampling and structured questionnaire was conducted among Hong Kong primary and secondary school students. The paper-and-pen survey, administered by well-trained research assistants, was completed by 2863 participants aged 9C17 years old (M = 12.6, SD = 1.3) at a brief school reopening six months after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. About 48% and 37% of the participants stated that they paid increased attention to physical and mental health, respectively. About 20% to 40% stated that they found more support from their friends and family members; only a small percentage reported decreased social support. Around 25% to 50% spent more time to rest, relax, and exercise. The aforementioned changes varied among genders, education groups, and socio-economic status. In general, higher perceived vulnerability, feeling more stressed, apprehensive, and helpless were associated with more reported positive lifestyle changes, including more social/family support, increased mental health awareness, and a positive lifestyle.

A mobile application was built to measure the respiration rate and export the respiration signal to a personal computer. The mobile application acquired thermal video images at a rate of nine frames/second and the OpenCV library was used for localization of the area of interest (nose and mouth). Artificial intelligence regressors were used to predict the inhalation and exhalation air volume. Several regressors were tested and four of them showed excellent performance: random forest, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting, and decision trees. The latter showed the best regression results, with an R-square value of 0.9998 and a mean square error of 0.0023.

People with higher levels of well-being are more resilient after stressful life events or trauma and vice versa. Less is known about the underlying sources of overlap and causality between the constructs. In a sample of 11.304 twins and 2.572 siblings from the Netherlands Twin Register, we investigated the overlap and possible direction of causation between resilience (i.e. the absence of psychiatric symptoms despite negative life events) and well-being (i.e. satisfaction with life) using polygenic scores (PGS), twin-sibling models, and the Mendelian Randomization Direction of Causality (MR-DoC) model. The longitudinal twin-sibling models showed significant phenotypic correlations between resilience and well-being (.41/.51 at time 1 and 2). PGS analyses suggested that genetic factors influencing one trait, also predict the other. Twin-sibling modeling confirmed this genetic correlation (.71) and showed a strong environmental correlation (.93). In line with causality, both genetic (51%) and environmental (49%) factors contributed significantly to the covariance between resilience and well-being. Further causality analyses consistently showed bidirectional causality and the MR-DoC model confirmed these causal effects. Well-being explained 34% (T1) and 46% (T2) of the variance in resilience and resilience explained 44% (T1) and 51% (T2) of the variance in resilience. To conclude, we find evidence for bidirectional causality between well-being and resilience that survives correction for genetic confounding. As resilience and well-being are both negatively related to psychopathology, the mutual effects can have implications for interventions to lower psychopathology vulnerability.","output":"Genetic evidence for bidirectional causal effects between resilience and well-being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 60-year-old man presented to hospital with bilateral lower limb weakness, urinary retention and constipation.

The technological sequence of the medical waste incineration installation and the integrated exhaust gas cleaning system are discussed. The results of studies on the emission of pollutants into the atmosphere during combustion are compared with the number of COVID-19 cases in the same voivodeship to investigate how the coronavirus pandemic affects the amount of medical waste generated, thus the amount of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere.

SOURCES: The main source of data and information for this review was peer-reviewed literature. SYNTHESIS: Feeding a sufficient volume of colostrum during the first hours of life is crucial to calf health and survival; however, less is known about transition milk feeding and the potential benefits of the myriad of bioactive compounds it contains. After feeding colostrum and transition milk, calves are susceptible to diarrhea when moved onto high amounts of milk, and antibiotic use is often necessary to decrease disease. Feeding an elevated plane of milk nutrition results in increased ADG and, in some studies, increased future milk production. Thus, this nutritional strategy is recommended; however, weaning calves from high volumes of milk represents massive changes in the structure and microbiology of the gastrointestinal tract. CONCLUSIONS AND APPLICATIONS: Colostrum and transition milk contain an abundance of bioactive molecules that can positively affect gut development and microbiota. There is significant potential for the use of novel feeding strategies and microbial-based products as alternatives to antibiotics. Calves fed an elevated plane of nutrition in the first month of life have greater productivity and growth. However, weaning should take place later in life. Moreover, applying a proper step-down feeding protocol is recommended, as it allows calves to intake and digest sufficient solid feed for growth and minimize distress at weaning.","output":"Invited Review: Nutritional regulation of gut function in dairy calves: From colostrum to weaning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk stratification in individuals with dysmetabolism is a major unmet need. Genetic predisposition contributes to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We aimed to exploit robust polygenic risk scores (PRS) that can be evaluated in the clinic to gain insight into the causal relationship between NAFLD and HCC, and to improve HCC risk stratification. METHODS: We examined at-risk individuals (NAFLD cohort, n = 2,566; 226 with HCC; and a replication cohort of 427 German patients with NAFLD) and the general population (UK Biobank [UKBB] cohort, n = 364,048; 202 with HCC). Variants in PNPLA3-TM6SF2-GCKR-MBOAT7 were combined in a hepatic fat PRS (PRS-HFC), and then adjusted for HSD17B13 (PRS-5). RESULTS: In the NAFLD cohort, the adjusted impact of genetic risk variants on HCC was proportional to the predisposition to fatty liver (p = 0.002) with some heterogeneity in the effect. PRS predicted HCC more robustly than single variants (p <10(-13)). The association between PRS and HCC was mainly mediated through severe fibrosis, but was independent of fibrosis in clinically relevant subgroups, and was also observed in those without severe fibrosis (p <0.05). In the UKBB cohort, PRS predicted HCC independently of classical risk factors and cirrhosis (p <10(-7)). In the NAFLD cohort, we identified high PRS cut-offs (0.532/0.495 for PRS-HFC/PRS-5) that in the UKBB cohort detected HCC with ~90% specificity but limited sensitivity; PRS predicted HCC both in individuals with (p <10(-5)) and without cirrhosis (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with a causal relationship between hepatic fat and HCC. PRS improved the accuracy of HCC detection and may help stratify HCC risk in individuals with dysmetabolism, including those without severe liver fibrosis. Further studies are needed to validate our findings. LAY SUMMARY: By analyzing variations in genes that contribute to fatty liver disease, we developed two risk scores to help predict liver cancer in individuals with obesity-related metabolic complications. These risk scores can be easily tested in the clinic. We showed that the risk scores helped to identify the risk of liver cancer both in high-risk individuals and in the general population.","output":"Non-invasive stratification of hepatocellular carcinoma risk in non-alcoholic fatty liver using polygenic risk scores"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Social distancing is an effective preventative policy for COVID-19 that is enforced by governments worldwide. However, significant variations are observed in adherence to social distancing across individuals and countries. Due to the lack of treatment, rapid spread, and prevalence of COVID-19, panic and fear associated with the disease causes great stress. Subsequent effects will be a variation around the coping and mitigation strategies for different individuals following different paths to manage the situation. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore how threat and coping appraisal processes work as mechanisms between information and citizens adherence to COVID-19Crelated recommendations (ie, how the information sources and social media influence threat and coping appraisal processes with COVID-19 and how the threat and coping appraisal processes influence adherence to policy guidelines). In addition, this study aims to explore how citizens in three different countries (the United States, Kuwait, and South Korea), randomly sampled, are effectively using the mechanisms. METHODS: Randomly sampled online survey data collected by a global firm in May 2020 from 162 citizens of the United States, 185 of Kuwait, and 71 of South Korea were analyzed, resulting in a total sample size of 418. A seemingly unrelated regression model, controlling for several counterfactuals, was used for analysis. The studys focal estimated effects were compared across the three countries using the weighted distance between the parameter estimates. RESULTS: The seemingly unrelated regression model estimation results suggested that, overall, the intensity of information source use for the COVID-19 pandemic positively influenced the threat appraisal for the disease (P<.001). Furthermore, the intensity of social media use for the COVID-19 pandemic positively influenced the coping appraisal for the disease (P<.001). Higher COVID-19 threat appraisal had a positive effect on social distancing adherence (P<.001). Higher COVID-19 coping appraisal had a positive effect on social distancing adherence (P<.001). Higher intensity of COVID-19 knowledge positively influenced social distancing adherence (P<.001). There were country-level variations. Broadly, we found that the United States had better results than South Korea and Kuwait in leveraging the information to threat and coping appraisal to the adherence process, indicating that individuals in countries like the United States and South Korea may be more pragmatic to appraise the situation before making any decisions. CONCLUSIONS: This studys findings suggest that the mediation of threat and coping strategies are essential, in varying effects, to shape the information and social media strategies for adherence outcomes. Accordingly, coordinating public service announcements along with information source outlets such as mainstream media (eg, TV and newspaper) as well as social media (eg, Facebook and Twitter) to inform citizens and, at the same time, deliver balanced messages about the threat and coping appraisal is critical in implementing a staggered social distancing and sheltering strategy.","output":"Threat, Coping, and Social Distance Adherence During COVID-19: Cross-Continental Comparison Using an Online Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection by SARS-CoV is initiated by specific interactions between the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein and its receptor ACE2.

Objectives . Establish a remote working service for junior doctors unable to attend in person due to Covid-19 restrictions then develop a remote working rota and guideline. . Enable remote staff to contribute to clinical and non-clinical tasks securely. . Conduct a mixed-methods evaluation of remote working by practices and identify facilitators and barriers. Methods A remote working rota allocated shielded and selfisolating staff to contribute to intensive care, postnatal duties, outpatients clinic or community calls. Staff used an electronic patient notes system that was securely accessible from home and communicated using digital technology. A guideline formalised practice. Quantitative and qualitative data was collected as part of a mixed methods evaluation. Quantitative data was collective retrospectively from remote working rotas between March- August 2020 to analyse time worked by staff role. Data was collected prospectively via online questionnaires sent to remote working staff between 28th July -15th August 2020 to record activities undertaken on shift. Qualitative evaluation was conducted using focus group discussions (FGDs) with staff according to whether they were working remotely intermittently or permanently. Thematic analysis of focus groups was undertaken. Results Between 23rd March-15th August 506 hours were WFH over 274 shifts equating to a mean of 119 hrs/week (equivalent to 12 shifts). (66% ST6-8, 25% ST1-3, 8% Advanced Neonatal Nurse Practitioners (ANNPs)). 20 questionnaires were sent with 14 responses (70% response rate) covering 126 hours of WFH activities. The largest proportion of time was spent on audit/management roles, followed by ward-based work. The table reports on thematic analysis of FGDs. Conclusions The remote workforce contributed substantially to the neonatal unit service and was broadly valued with positive impacts on junior doctors' experience. Hierarchy and communication were recognized barriers posing a risk to effective teamwork. Promoting an inclusive handover and utilising digital technology further may mitigate this. Remote working has positive and negative impacts on training and wellbeing.

Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the effect of workplace-based versus online-supervised home-based corrective exercises among office workers with UCS. METHODS AND DESIGN: To this end, 45 subjects within the age range of 30C45 years are randomly assigned to three groups in the present parallel-group, randomized control trial using a pretest-posttest design. These groups include the subjects who receive online-supervised exercise and workplace exercise containing three sessions of intervention for 8 weeks and the control group receives no intervention while performing routine activities. The primary outcome variables are neck-shoulder pain (NSP) and consequent sick leave due to NSP, followed by alignment, workability, and the surface electromyography of upper, middle, and lower trapezius (UT, MT, and LT), sternocleidomastoid (SCM), and serratus anterior (SA) as the secondary variables. DISCUSSION: The present study seeks to assess the effect of workplace versus online-supervised corrective exercise interventions among 45 office workers suffering from UCS. It is expected to improve and reduce the related symptoms including postural malalignment and imbalance muscles after 8 weeks of corrective exercises. If effective, the findings may lead to adherence and work performance among the office workers, and individuals subjected to UCS can use the benefits of an online-supervised intervention. In addition, the findings may be useful in different workplaces as the evidence for employers to benefit from the reduction in the related costs and side effects of work-related neck/shoulder disorders including work disability, productivity loss, time expense, social insurance, work absenteeism, and treatment costs.

In general, conducting HT requires many wells because traditional well monitoring is usually partially open at a specific depth interval or is fully penetrating.

To tackle these issues, a new multi-level monitoring system (MLMS) for the HT survey was developed using the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) technique. This FBG MLMS could collect the depth-discrete groundwater observations from a fully penetrated 2-in well. Three field campaigns were conducted to validate the capability of the FBG MLMS for HT surveys. The results show that the accuracy and stability of this MLMS are reliable and that FBG MLMS is beneficial for conducting an HT survey. Specifically, compared to the traditional monitoring well in an injection event, this FBG MLMS can concurrently cause an increase in the number of cross-hole tests several times and collect many more head observations than the standard methods, resulting in the observed flow fields efficiently reaching ergodic conditions and effectively improving the accuracy of the estimated hydraulic heterogeneity.

Self-report measures investigating symptoms related to Social Media Addiction (SMA), Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD), mentalization capacity, and SI were used. A single mediation analysis with two mediators was carried out to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of mentalization on SI through the mediating role of SMA- and IGD-related symptoms, controlling for potential confounding factors (e.g., socio-demographic and addiction-related variables). The four explored variables were significantly associated with each other (all p < 0.001) across all subjects; the mediational model showed that the total effect of mentalization on SI was significant (B = ?0.821, SE = 0.092 (95% CI: ?1.001; ?0.641)) and that both SMA- (B = ?0.073, SE = 0.034 (95% CI: ?0.145; ?0.008)) and IGD-related symptoms (B = 0.046, SE = 0.027 (95% CI: ?0.107; ?0.001)) were significant mediators of such association.

In the present study, we compared the phenotypes of resident hepatic, splenic or thymic T-cell subpopulations during the acute viral hepatitis induced by HMV3 in susceptible C57BL/6 mice. The number of liver-resident mononuclear cells (MNC) increased during the viral infection, while cellularity decreased. Single positive (SP) CD4+ cells strongly increased in both the liver and thymus, while double positive (DP) (CD4+ CD8+) cells, present in the liver and thymus of mock-infected mice, decreased in C57BL/6 mice during the viral infection. A shift of alpha beta-TCRintermediate T cells toward alpha beta-TCRhigh was evidenced in the liver and thymus of infected mice, but not in the spleen. The few alpha beta-TCRint double negative (DN) (CD4-CD8-) cells also decreased following viral infection. alpha beta-TCRint or high lymphocytes expressing high levels of leucocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1) increased in the liver of MHV3-infected mice. In addition, liver-resident T cells expressed strongly the CD44 (Pgp-1) activation marker, suggesting that they were either activated or antigen experienced during the viral infection.

An analysis of the severity of the course was carried out depending on the comorbid background with the calculation of OR and CI 95%, significant factors influencing the development of a severe course of the disease were identified. Results Of 67567 patients, 22545 had comorbidities. 7025 (31.2%) of them had severe course of illness, 15520 (68.8%) - mild/moderate. 45,022 patients had no comorbidity: severe course was in 2558 (5.7%) patients, mild/moderate C in 42464 (94.3%). Calculating from the total number of patients: comorbidity and severe course was recorded in 10.4%; comorbidity and mild/moderate course - in 23%; severe course without comorbidity was in 3.8%; mild/moderate course without comorbidity was in 62.8%. The comorbidity increased the risk of developing a severe course by 7.514 times, compared with patients without a comorbid background (95% CI: 7.156-7.890). The presence of comorbidities of the respiratory system was detected in 3042 patients (4.5% of the total) and increased the risk of developing a severe course by 1.618 times (95%, CI: 1.478-1.771); cardiovascular system - 12706 (18.8%), risk increased by 5.015 times (95% CI: 4.788-5.253), endocrine - 2314 (3.4%), risk increased by 3.274 times (95%, CI: 2.995-3.579), oncology - 944 (1.4%), risk increased by 4.072 times (95% CI: 3.567-4.648).

However, experimental methods to find protein interactions are inadequate: large scale experiments are noisy, and small scale experiments are slow and expensive. Inspired by the recent successes of deep neural networks, we hypothesize that deep learning methods are well-positioned to aid and augment biological experiments, hoping to help identify more accurate virus-host protein interaction maps. Moreover, computational methods can quickly adapt to predict how virus mutations change protein interactions with the host proteins. We propose DeepVHPPI, a novel deep learning framework combining a self-attention-based transformer architecture and a transfer learning training strategy to predict interactions between human proteins and virus proteins that have novel sequence patterns.

Community pharmacists and drug stores play a significant role in disease management in Bangladesh due to high co-payments. Consequently, a need to review prices and availability in the pandemic. Materials and Methods: Multiple approach involving a review and questionnaire among pharmacies and stores early March to end May 2020. Results and Discussion: 170 pharmacies and drug stores took part, giving a response rate of 63.9%. Encouragingly, no change in utilization of antimalarial medicines in 51.2% of stores despite global endorsements. However, increased utilisation of antibiotics (70.6%), analgesics (97.6%), vitamins (90.6%) and PPE (over 95%). Encouragingly, increases in purchasing of PPE. No increase in prices among 50% of the stores for antimalarials, with a similar situation for antibiotics (65.3%), analgesics (54.7%), and vitamins (51.8%). However, price increases typically for PPE (over 90% of stores). Shortages also seen for medicines and PPE, again greater for PPE. Conclusions: The pandemic has impacted on the supply and prices of medicines and PPE in Bangladesh. Key stakeholder groups can play a role addressing misinformation, with enhanced local production helping address future shortages and prices.","output":"Availability and price changes of potential medicines and equipment for the prevention and treatment of covid-19 among pharmacy and drug stores in bangladesh; findings and implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Before public health emergencies became a major challenge worldwide, the scope of laboratory management was only related to developing, maintaining, improving, and sustaining the quality of accurate laboratory results for improved clinical outcomes. Indeed, quality management is an especially important aspect and has achieved great milestones during the development of clinical laboratories. CURRENT STATUS: However, since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a threat worldwide, previous management mode inside the separate laboratory could not cater to the demand of the COVID-19 public health emergency. Among emerging new issues, the prominent challenges during the period of COVID-19 pandemic are rapid-launched laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) for urgent clinical application, rapid expansion of testing capabilities, laboratory medicine resources, and personnel shortages. These related issues are now impacting on clinical laboratory and need to be effectively addressed. CONCLUSION: Different from traditional views of laboratory medicine management that focus on separate laboratories, present clinical laboratory management must be multidimensional mode which should consider consolidation of the efficient network of regional clinical laboratories and reasonable planning of laboratories resources from the view of overall strategy. Based on relevant research and our experience, in this review, we retrospect the history trajectory of laboratory medicine management, and also, we provide existing and other feasible recommended management strategies for laboratory medicine in future.","output":"COVID-19-another influential event impacts on laboratory medicine management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Probiotics have been shown to be effective against infectious diseases in clinical trials, with either intestinal or extraintestinal health benefits. Even though probiotic effects are strain-specific, some widespread effects include: pathogen inhibition, enhancement of barrier integrity and regulation of immune responses. The mechanisms involved in the health benefits of probiotics are not completely understood, but these effects can be mediated, at least in part, by probiotic-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). However, to date, there are no clinical trials examining probiotic-derived EVs health benefits against infectious diseases. There is still a long way to go to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical practice. This review attempts to summarize the current knowledge about EVs released by probiotic bacteria to understand their possible role in the prevention and/or treatment of infectious diseases. A better understanding of the mechanisms whereby EVs package their cargo and the process involved in communication with host cells (inter-kingdom communication), would allow further advances in this field. In addition, we comment on the potential use and missing knowledge of EVs as therapeutic agents (postbiotics) against infectious diseases. Future research on probiotic-derived EVs is needed to open new avenues for the encapsulation of bioactives inside EVs from GRAS (Generally Regarded as Safe) bacteria.

Given the abrupt change, we aimed to characterize the utilization of social media and virtual open house platforms by integrated vascular surgery residency programs for outreach and networking during the pandemic for the 2021 cycle. METHODS: A list of accredited integrated vascular surgery residency programs was compiled using the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) website provided by the Academic Medical Colleges (AMC). The social media platforms Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook were queried for accounts associated with the training programs or their associated institutional vascular surgery divisions. Each discovered account was surveyed for date of creation as well as posts outlining virtual interactive events such as open houses, meet-and-greets, and virtual sub-internship opportunities. Slopes of the curves representing total account numbers and account numbers on each platform were compared from pre-COVID to current day using linear regression and t-statistics. RESULTS: There were 64 integrated vascular surgery residency programs participating in the 2021 match cycle. 70.3% (N = 45) of programs had a social media presence on at least one of the three platforms. 54.7% (N = 35) of programs had an associated Twitter account. 43.9% (N = 28) of programs had an associated Instagram account. Six (9.4%) programs were found on Facebook. The number of social media accounts significantly increased from March 2020 (37 vs 69, p < .001) to March 2021.

Housing. Insurance. Food. Health Care. Child Care. Employment. Manufacturing. Construction. Supply Chains. You name it. Contracts are implicated everywhere. So, make no mistake, how contract law addresses these ostensibly private contracts will have profound social consequences. If the past really is prologue, then the future is indeed bleak. The empirical study conducted for this Article establishes what the conventional wisdom has claimed for the last 70 years. More specifically, the empirical study here shows that the common laws changed circumstances doctrines [CCDs] (i.e., impossibility, impracticability of performance and frustration of purpose) will generally not excuse a party from performing his contract, regardless of the changed circumstance being alleged. Contrary to all of the CCD literature that addresses this issue, this Article makes the unconventional argument that the CCDs should be more broadly available, meaning they should be more successful in excusing contract performance when triggered by catastrophic circumstances. And, unlike the rest of the field which focuses on the CCDs themselves, this Article argues that to effectively address the allocation of unforeseen risks, in general, and catastrophic risks like a pandemic, in particular, we must reframe the legal approach to contract formation. If contract formation is reframed to more accurately reflect contracting in the real world, and given that the solution to the changed circumstances problem preferred by courts and commentators is an explicit risk allocation term in the parties contract, then the solution proposed in this Article to the risk allocation problem literally suggests itself. A risk allocation clause should be mandated in most contracts as part of contract formation. The type of risk allocation and loss clause and the way the clause would work would depend on whether the contract is co-drafted or adhesive. The inclusion of a risk and loss allocation clause would facilitate transactions and encourage contracting in general by ensuring that contracts remain efficient and predictable. The main difference between the risk and loss allocation clause proposed here and existing contract law, of course, is who ends up bearing all of the risk and loss occasioned by the catastrophic changed circumstance. To be clear, if nothing changes and our approach to contract formation remains the same as it is right now, then all of the risk and all of the attendant loss will generally be left to lie where it falls, namely, on the party trying to get out of the contract because of the changed circumstances;and this will be result regardless of the legal theory used to justify (or demonize) the CCDs or any changes made to the doctrines themselves. But, If we finally acknowledge the public aspects of contracts and contract law, namely, that they do in fact produce social consequences that extend beyond the individual contract and contracting parties, then contracts and contract law may well be part of the solutions to some of the most pressing problems currently confronting American society now and into the future.","output":"If Past is Prologue, Then The Future is Bleak: Contracts, COVID-19 and the Changed Circumstances Doctrines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To estimate population health outcomes with delayed second dose versus standard schedule of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. DESIGN: Simulation agent based modeling study. SETTING: Simulated population based on real world US county. PARTICIPANTS: The simulation included 100 000 agents, with a representative distribution of demographics and occupations. Networks of contacts were established to simulate potentially infectious interactions though occupation, household, and random interactions. INTERVENTIONS: Simulation of standard covid-19 vaccination versus delayed second dose vaccination prioritizing the first dose. The simulation runs were replicated 10 times. Sensitivity analyses included first dose vaccine efficacy of 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% after day 12 post-vaccination; vaccination rate of 0.1%, 0.3%, and 1% of population per day; assuming the vaccine prevents only symptoms but not asymptomatic spread (that is, non-sterilizing vaccine); and an alternative vaccination strategy that implements delayed second dose for people under 65 years of age, but not until all those above this age have been vaccinated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative covid-19 mortality, cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections, and cumulative hospital admissions due to covid-19 over 180 days. RESULTS: Over all simulation replications, the median cumulative mortality per 100 000 for standard dosing versus delayed second dose was 226 v 179, 233 v 207, and 235 v 236 for 90%, 80%, and 70% first dose efficacy, respectively. The delayed second dose strategy was optimal for vaccine efficacies at or above 80% and vaccination rates at or below 0.3% of the population per day, under both sterilizing and non-sterilizing vaccine assumptions, resulting in absolute cumulative mortality reductions between 26 and 47 per 100 000. The delayed second dose strategy for people under 65 performed consistently well under all vaccination rates tested. CONCLUSIONS: A delayed second dose vaccination strategy, at least for people aged under 65, could result in reduced cumulative mortality under certain conditions.","output":"Public health impact of delaying second dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 covid-19 vaccine: simulation agent based modeling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Commercial formulations of 29 commonly used herbal supplements (HS) and grapefruit juice were evaluated for drug interaction potential via quantification of their CYP3A inhibitory potential in two in vitro experimental models of human small intestine, cryopreserved human intestinal mucosa (CHIM) and cryopreserved human enterocytes (CHE). Two CYP3A substrates were used - in the studies with CHIM, CYP3A activity was quantified via LC/MS-MS quantification of midazolam 1'-hydroxylation while in CHE, luciferin IPA metabolism to luciferin was quantified by luminescence. Upon treatment of CHIM with the estimated lumen concentration of the HS upon each oral administration (manufacturers' recommended dosage dissolved in 200 mL of culture medium), >80% CYP3A inhibition was observed for green tea extract, St. John's wort, valerian root, horehound and grapefruit juice. Less than 50% inhibition was observed for fenugreek, aloe vera, guarana, soy isoflavone, maca, echinacea, spirulina, evening primrose, milk thistle, cranberry, red yeast rice, rhodiola, ginkgo biloba, turmeric, curcumin, white kidney bean,, garlic, cinnamon, saw palmetto berries, panax ginseng, black elderberry, wheat grass juice, flaxseed oil, black cohosh, and ginger root. The results were confirmed in a a dose-response study with HS obtained from three suppliers for the four inhibitory HS (green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, valerian root), and three representative non-inhibitory HS (black cohosh, black elderberry, echinacea). Similar results were obtained with the inhibitory HS in CHE.

The main purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview of relevant studies regarding the willingness to work in emergency and disaster situations, describe and classify the most important challenges and solutions, identifying knowledge gaps in the literature which could inform future research. METHODS: In this Systematic Mapping Review required information was searched from PubMed, Scopus, the web of science, Embase databases, and Google scholar search engine in the period 2000C2020. Data were analyzed using a content framework analysis. RESULTS: From 2902 article search results, 26 articles met the inclusion criteria. The studies varied in terms of aim, study design, and detail of reporting. The results showed that nearly three-quarters of studies were conducted in high and middle-income countries. Most of the studies were published in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, the most common types of crises reported in the included studies were emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. The results show that most of the problems were in the dimension of mental and psychological issues, personnel health concerns, and management relationship with personnel. CONCLUSION: This mapping review illustrated a big picture of health workers' resilience in disaster conditions. This review presents an overview of different kinds of strategies that address the challenges. One of the most important challenges in health workforce retention is poor communication between managers and staff. Being away from family, which leads to mental fatigue, puts staff in moral dilemmas. Attracting adequate health professionals, especially volunteers and regulating the shifts of health personnel in crisis time will largely prevent burnout.

The aim of this study is to compare absorbable and nonabsorbable suture materials which had been used for closing the transcolumellar incision, in the aspect of risk of postoperative infection, wound healing, postoperative columellar scar and patient satisfaction. METHOD A prospective, randomized, single-blind study was conducted between May 2017 and February 2018. Sixty-four rhinoplasty patients were randomly assigned to absorbable (n = 32) or nonabsorbable (n = 32) groups. The columellar incision was closed with 7 full-thickness skin sutures. Either nonabsorbable 6/0 polypropylene (Group 1) or absorbable 6/0 polyglytone 6211 (Group 2) sutures were placed at the columellar incisions. Polypropylene sutures were removed at the 7th postoperative day. A Mann-Whitney U test and Monte Carlo were used for statistical comparison. Photographs of the patients at the postoperative third month (Fig. 2) were evaluated and scored in terms of scarring, pigmentation, notching, level differences in the incision area by two different otorhinolaryngologists who did not know the randomization. Suture removing discomfort was assessed with visual analogue scale scores. A satisfaction survey was filled out by all the patients completing their third month after the operation. RESULTS According to the results of both otorhinolaryngologists, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of pigmentation, level difference, notching, overall appearance and total score (p = 0.920, p = 0.498, respectively). The mean score on the Wong-Baker scale was 3.19  1.67 in group 1. In the Satisfaction Survey, the average score of the group 1 was 6.90  3.24, while the mean score of the group 2 was 7.062  2.77.

Objective: this article aimed to investigate the coagulation profile of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted using a retrospective research design. We recruited patients with COVID-19 admitted to a hospital from June 15th to July 7th, 2020. Upon patients entering a blood sample was drawn from each patient for assessing patients coagulation profile (PT, PTT, INR, Platelet count);and a chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan was performed for each patient. The study patients were divided in to sever group (CO-RADS score 5) and non-sever group (CO-RADS score <5). Results: Thirty-six patients (20 males and 16 females) with a mean age of 54.717.5 years were studied. Of them, 11 cases (30.56%) had severe pulmonary involvement. Also, the coagulation profiles were longer in the severe group than non-sever group. As well, the means of platelet count that were 232.440 per microliter in the non-severe group and 289.180 per microliter in the severe and non-sever groups, respectively;but still not statistically significant (p>0.05). The Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) for PT and INR was 0.615 and 0.611, respectively. The AUC for platelet count was 0.680 (95% CI: 0.501 to 0.859) and had an acceptable discriminating power. Conclusions: In this study, we did not find any statistically significant relationship between the results of coagulation tests and the severity of pulmonary involvement according to HRCT scan findings in COVID-19 patients.

Scientific knowledge about the virus is expanding including the thrombosis risk associated with COVID-19 infection. However, this data in end-stage heart failure patients requiring mechanical circulatory support is limited. Thus we examined the incidence of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 infected LVAD patients. Methods We identified durable LVAD patients infected with COVID-19 from January 2020 to July 2021. We examined anticoagulation regimens and laboratory monitoring parameters that were used. Evidence of thromboembolic phenomena including stroke, venous or arterial and pump thrombosis were evaluated by clinical, radiographic and laboratory assessment. Results Of the 146 LVAD patients followed at our institution, 21 (14%) were infected with COVID-19. Median age was 69 years (IQR 58-73), 18 (86%) were men and 12 (57%) had non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. In our cohort, 3 (14%) had HeartWare VAD, 9 (43%) HeartMate 2 LVAD and 9 (43%) HeartMate 3 LVAD. Eighteen (86%) were on warfarin with a median international normalized ratio (INR) of 2 (IQR 1.6-2.9) at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Reasons for holding antithrombotic therapy included a history of gastrointestinal and intracranial hemorrhage. Fourteen (66.7%) patients required admission for COVID-19 infection. Two (14%) were not on anticoagulation and had an INR of 1.1 and 1.6 on admission. Patients on anticoagulation had a median INR of 2.4 (IQR 1.9-2.7) during hospitalization. Notably, there was no clinical, radiographic or laboratory evidence of thrombotic complications, including stroke, pump thrombosis, DVT, or arterial thrombosis. Two (10%) patients died due to septic shock and hypoxic respiratory failure resulting in cardiopulmonary arrest. Conclusion Although COVID-19 is associated with increased thrombogenicity, there was no evidence of thrombosis in our 21 LVAD patients. Regardless of the patients anticoagulation status or INR, patients did not experience thrombotic events despite a theoretically heightened risk during acute COVID-19 infection.","output":"COVID-19 in LVAD Patients Not Associated with Increased Risk of Thrombotic Complications: A Single-Center Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted undergraduate medical education, including preclinical class-based courses, by requiring social distancing and essentially eliminating in-person teaching. The aim of this study was to compare student performance and satisfaction before and after implementation of remote instruction in a first-year introductory pathology course. Assessments (3 quizzes, 1 practical exam, and 1 final) were compared between courses given before (January 2020) and during (January 2021) the COVID-19 pandemic, in terms of mean scores, degree of difficulty, and item discrimination, both overall and across different question types. Students evaluations of the course (Likert scale-based) were also compared between the 2 years. Significantly higher mean scores were observed during remote instruction (compared to the prior, in-person year) on verbatim-repeated questions (94.9  8.8 vs 89.4  12.2; P = .002) and on questions incorporating a gross specimen image (88.4  7.5 vs 84.4  10.3; P = .007). The percentage of questions that were determined to be moderate/hard in degree of difficulty and good/very good in item discrimination remained similar between the 2 time periods. In the practical examination, students performed significantly better during remote instruction on questions without specimen images (96.5  7.0 vs 91.2  15.2; P = .004). Finally, course evaluation metrics improved, with students giving a higher mean rating value in each measured end point of course quality during the year of remote instruction.

Therefore, there is a need of evidence-based recommendations to reduce the risk of infection and also managing MS patients with SARS-CoV-2. Case Description: We present three patients with history of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) on DMTs presenting with worsening MS symptoms likely pseudo exacerbation who were diagnosed with COVID-19. Discussion: An extensive review of 7 articles was performed, in addition to a brief review on DMTs use in MS patients with COVID-19. In our cases, all patients were on DMT and severe course of disease was noted in 2 cases. No fatality was observed. Conclusions: This review provides a base on the clinical characteristics, outcomes and the roles of DMTs in MS patients suffering from n-cov-2. Physicians need to be vigilant about considering COVID-19 infection related relapse in the MS patients, especially in this COVID-19 pandemic era and look for pseudo-exacerbation.

In the present study, we investigated the association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I, which plays a major role in susceptibility to viral infections, and the mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: data of allele frequencies of HLA-A, -B and -C and COVID-19 mortality were obtained for 74 countries from the Allele Frequency Net Database and worldometer.info. Association between allele frequency of each HLA and mortality was assessed by linear regression followed by multivariable regression. Subsequently, association of HLA-C*05 to its receptor KIR2DS4fl, expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, and differential mortality to historic pandemics were analyzed. RESULTS: HLA-A*01, -B*07, -B*08, -B*44 and -C*05 were significantly associated with the risk of deaths (adjusted p = 0.040, 0.00081, 0.047, 0.0022, 0.00032, respectively), but only HLA-C*05 remained statistically significant (p = 0.000027) after multivariable regression. A 1% increase in the allele frequency of HLA-C*05 was associated with an increase of 44 deaths/million. Countries with different mortality could be categorized by the distribution of HLA-C*05 and its receptor KIR2DS4fl, which in combination cause NK cell-induced hyperactive immune response. Countries with similar ethnic and/or geographic background responded in a similar pattern to each pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: we demonstrated that allele frequency of HLA-C*05 and the distribution pattern with its receptor KIR2DS4fl strongly correlated with COVID-19 mortality.

The stability of the BBB structure and function is of great significance for the maintenance of brain homeostasis. When a neurotropic virus invades the CNS via a hematogenous or non-hematogenous route, it may cause structural and functional disorders of the BBB, and also activate the BBB anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory innate immune response. This article focuses on the structural and functional changes that occur in the three main components of the BBB (endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes) in response to infection with neurotropic viruses transmitted by hematogenous routes, and also briefly describes the supportive effect of three cells on the BBB under normal physiological conditions. For example, all three types of cells express several PRRs, which can quickly sense the virus and make corresponding immune responses. The pro-inflammatory immune response will exacerbate the destruction of the BBB, while the anti-inflammatory immune response, based on type I IFN, consolidates the stability of the BBB. Exploring the details of the interaction between the host and the pathogen at the BBB during neurotropic virus infection will help to propose new treatments for viral encephalitis. Enhancing the defense function of the BBB, maintaining the integrity of the BBB, and suppressing the pro-inflammatory immune response of the BBB provide more ideas for limiting the neuroinvasion of neurotropic viruses.

To understand the differences between DC-SIGN and L-SIGN that affect HIV-1 interactions, we developed Raji B cell lines expressing different DC-SIGN/L-SIGN chimeras. Testing of the chimeras demonstrated that replacement of the DC-SIGN carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) with that of L-SIGN was sufficient to impair virus binding and prevent transmission. Conversely, the ability to bind and transmit HIV-1 was conferred to L-SIGN chimeras containing the DC-SIGN CRD. We identified Trp-258 in the DC-SIGN CRD to be essential for HIV-1 transmission. Although introduction of a K270W mutation at the same position in L-SIGN was insufficient for HIV-1 binding, an L-SIGN mutant molecule with K270W and a C-terminal DC-SIGN CRD subdomain transmitted HIV-1.

Insight was fractionated to examine whether altered insight into different neuropsychological/behavioural objects is underpinned by different or compatible neural correlates. 6 databases (Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, BIOSIS and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global) were interrogated between 1980 and August 2019. 15 relevant papers were found out of 660 titles screened. The studies included suggest that different objects of altered insight are associated with distinctive brain areas in FTD. For example, disease unawareness appears to predominantly correlate with right frontal involvement. In contrast, altered insight into social cognition potentially involves, in addition to frontal areas, the temporal gyrus, insula, parahippocampus and amygdala. Impaired insight into memory problems appears to be related to the frontal lobes, postcentral gyrus, parietal cortex and posterior cingulate. These results reflect to a certain extent those observed in other neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and also other brain disorders. Nevertheless, they should be cautiously interpreted due to variability in the methodological aspects used to reach those conclusions.

A major virulence factor during its infection is the enzyme phospholipase C encoded by the plc gene, known as Clostridium perfringens phospholipase C (CpPLC). The present study was designed to understand the role of CpPLC in inducing survival mechanisms and mitochondrial-induced epigenetic changes in a human lymphocyte cell culture model. Following exposure to CpPLC, a significant generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species was observed, which coincided with the changes in the expression of vital components of MAP/ERK/RTK signaling cascade that regulates the downstream cellular functions. These disturbances further led to alterations in the mitochondrial genome and functioning. This was supported by the observed upregulation in the expression of mitochondrial fission genes Drp1, Fis1, and Mff, and mitochondrial fusion genes MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1 following CpPLC exposure. CpPLC exposed cells showed upregulation of OMA1, DELE1, and HRI genes involved in the integrated stress response (ISR), which suggests that it may induce the ISR that provides a pro-survival mechanism to the host cell. CpPLC also initiated immune patho-physiologic mechanisms including mitochondrial-induced epigenetic modifications through a mitochondrial-ROS driven signaling pathway. Interestingly, epigenetic machinery not only play a pivotal role in lymphocyte homeostasis by contributing to cell-fate decisions but thought to be one of the mechanisms by which intracellular pathogens survive within the host cells. Importantly, the impairment of mtDNA repair among the CpPLC exposed cells, induced alterations within mtDNA methylation, and led to the deregulation of MT-CO1, MT-ND6, MT-ATPase 6, and MT-ATPase8 gene expression profiles that are important for mitochondrial bioenergetics and subsequent metabolic pathways. This was further confirmed by the changes in the activity of mitochondrial electron chain complexes (complex I, II, III, IV and V). The altered mtDNA methylation profile was also found to be closely associated with the varied expression of mitomiRs and their targets. CpPLC exposed cells showed up-regulation of miR24 expression and down-regulation of miR34a, miR150, and miR155, while the increased expression of mitomiR target genes i.e. of K-Ras, MYC, EGFR, and NF-k was also observed in these cells.

Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3-4 days, departing from the exponential trend. However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.","output":"COVID-19 and Italy: what next?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Sulu-Sulawesi Sea, with neighboring Indonesian Seas and South China Sea, lies at the center of the world's tropical marine biodiversity. Encircled by 3 populous, developing nations, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia, the Sea and its adjacent coastal and terrestrial ecosystems, supports ca. 33 million people, most with subsistence livelihoods heavily reliant on its renewable natural resources. These resources are being impacted severely by rapid population growth (> 2% yr-1, with expected doubling by 2035) and widespread poverty, coupled with increasing international market demand and rapid technological changes, compounded by inefficiencies in governance and a lack of awareness and/or acceptance of some laws among local populations, particularly in parts of the Philippines and Indonesia.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been especially devastating in aged residential care (ARC) facilities. In March 2020, when the threat became realised in New Zealand, one residential dementia care facility implemented a unique response to the imminent threat of COVID-19. Eight staff members made the decision to live on site during the lockdown, ensuring residents' risk of contracting the virus was significantly reduced as carers would not go outside of the facility. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive inquiry. METHODS: Seven staff who chose to live-in, and the facility manager, participated in semi-structured, face-to-face interviews at the ARC. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using a thematic analysis approach. COREQ guidelines were adhered to in the reporting of this study. RESULTS: An overarching motif which emerged from the findings was the articulation of an 'all in this together' attitude which fostered feelings of camaraderie and collaboration which enhanced the experience for staff individually, and as a group. Themes identified were as follows: (a) A 'safe' but challenging choice, (b) Benefits for the staff and (c) Positive outcomes for the residents. CONCLUSION: This crisis inadvertently brought about an enhanced 'dementia-friendly', person-centred communal environment. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study identified themes that deepen our understanding of caring for vulnerable populations during a pandemic and beyond. Given the success of this 'live-in' innovation, consideration must be given to applying these findings more generally when planning care models for best outcomes for residents receiving rest home level dementia care. How we care for people in disaster situations reflects the heart of the caring workforce, but such innovation may be extended to usual care where indicated.","output":"A unique disaster response in aged residential dementia care: Can the experience inform future care models?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of internet gaming disorders (IGD) is considerably high among youth, especially with the social isolation imposed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. IGD adversely affects mental health, quality of life, and academic performance. The Internet Gaming Disorder Scale (IGDS9-SF) is designed to detect IGD according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. However, inconsistent results are reported on its capacity to diagnose IGD evenly across different cultures. To ensure the suitability of the IGDS9-SF as a global measure of IGD, this study examined the psychometric properties of the IGDS9-SF in a sample of Sri Lankan university students (N = 322, mean age = 17.2  0.6, range = 16C18 years, 56.5% males) and evaluated its measurement invariance across samples from Sri Lanka, Turkey, Australia, and the USA. Among Sri Lankan students, a unidimensional structure expressed good fit, invariance across different groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, and income), adequate criterion validity (strong correlation with motives of internet gaming, daily gaming duration, and sleep quality), and good reliability (alpha = 0.81). Males and online multiplayers expressed higher IGD levels, greater time spent gaming, and more endorsement of gaming motives (e.g., Social and Coping) than females and offline players. Across countries, the IGDS9-SF was invariant at the configural, metric, and scalar levels, although strict invariance was not maintained. The lowest and highest IGD levels were reported among Turkish and American respondents, respectively. In conclusion, the IGDS9-SF can be reliably used to measure IGD among Sri Lankan youth. Because the scale holds scalar invariance across countries, its scores can be used to compare IGD levels in the studied countries.","output":"The Nine-Item Internet Gaming Disorder Scale (IGDS9-SF): Its Psychometric Properties among Sri Lankan Students and Measurement Invariance across Sri Lanka, Turkey, Australia, and the USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE In this study we aimed to compare renal functions in patients who underwent robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) with on-clamp and zero- ischemia techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2009 and 2015, 12 off-clamp and 22 on-clamp RPN procedures were performed on a total of 34 patients in two centers. The main outcome parameters examined were serum creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during preoperative, immediate postoperative periods, and at postoperative 3rd months. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences between on-clamp and zero- ischemia groups regarding age, ASA score, BMI, PADUA and R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry scores, operation time and tumor size (p>0.05). Significant differences were found in the duration of hospital stay (3.80.9 days vs. 3.00.9 days) and amount of blood loss (85.949.6 mL vs. 183.3176.2 mL) between the on-clamp and zero-ischemia groups (p<0.05). Statistically significant differences were found between preoperative and immediate post-operative periods, in terms of eGFR and serum creatinine levels in both groups. Moreover, statistically significant differences were found between preoperative and postoperative 3rd month periods, in the on-clamp group in terms of eGFR and serum creatinine levels. In the zero-ischemia group, the decrease in eGFR and serum creatinine levels at postoperative 3rd month relative to the preoperative period was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION Off-clamp RPN technique is superior, in short-term outcomes involving renal functions, compared to on clamp approach. However, long- term data regarding the renal functions should be evaluated to arrive at a definitive decision.","output":"Impact of robotic partial nephrectomy with and without ischemia on renal functions: experience in 34 cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":".

METHODS: English databases included PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science. Chinese databases involved Wanfang Data, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database and Chinese Biological Medicine Database. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing helmet and face mask NIMV for patients with ARF were searched. Meta-analysis was performed using Review manager 5.1.0. RESULTS: Twelve trials with a total of 569 patients were eligible. Our meta-analysis showed that, comparing with face mask, helmet could significantly decrease the incidences of intolerance [risk ratio (RR) 0.19; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09?0.39], facial skin ulcer (RR 0.19; 95% CI 0.08?0.43) and aerophagia (RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.06?0.37), reduce respiratory rate [mean difference (MD) -3.10; 95% CI -4.85 to -1.34], intubation rate (RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.26?0.59) and hospital mortality (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.39?0.99) in patients with ARF, and improve oxygenation index in patients with hypoxemic ARF (MD 55.23; 95% CI 31.37?79.09). However, subgroupanalysis for hypercapnic ARF revealed that PaCO(2) was significantly reduced in face mask group compared with helmet group (MD 5.34; 95% CI 3.41?7.27). CONCLUSION: NIMV with helmet can improve the patients tolerance, reduce adverse events, increase oxygenation effect, and decrease intubation rate and hospital mortality comparing to face mask. However, the low number of patients from included studies may preclude strong conclusions.

One area of concern is how to assess exercise capacity when a supervised exercise test is not possible. The aim of this review was to examine the relationship between functional exercise tests and recommended exercise tests for cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. METHODS: A rapid narrative review was carried out. Searches were conducted by two of the study authors. The study had the following features. Participants: adults, all with long-term conditions; intervention: any/none; outcome: Duke activity status index (DASI), sit to stand (STS, 30 s, 1 min and 5 repetitions), short physical performance battery (SPPB), 4-metre gait speed (4MGS) or step test (Chester/others) AND directly compared to one of the recommended exercise tests for cardiopulmonary rehabilitation: 6-min walk test (6MWT), incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) or cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) in terms of reporting agreement/correlation; Study design: primary research only, controlled trials or observational studies. RESULTS: Sixteen articles out of 249 screened were included (n=2271 patients). Overall, there were weakCstrong correlations for the included tests with a recommended exercise test (r=0.38C0.85). There were few reported issues with feasibility or safety of the tests. However, all tests were supervised in a clinical setting. The test that had the highest correlation with the field walking test was the 4MGS with the ISWT (r=0.78) and with the 6MWT (r=0.85). DISCUSSION: The 4MGS has the highest correlation with routine measures of exercise tolerance. However, it may be difficult to standardise in a remote assessment or to prescribe exercise from. Clinicians should strive for face-to-face standardised exercise tests where possible to be able to guide exercise prescription.","output":"Which functional outcome measures can we use as a surrogate for exercise capacity during remote cardiopulmonary rehabilitation assessments?

Research indicates that listening to music recruits regions in the brain involved with social interaction and reduces feelings of loneliness. We formed a team of clinicians and clinical musicians to bring music to the bedside, as psychological first aid. Our goal was to reduce feelings of anxiety and isolation in patients admitted to the Northwestern Memorial Hospital's neurosciences unit. Participants were offered 30C40-min live music sessions over FaceTime by a violist in consultation with a music therapist and a certified music practitioner. Music used for the interventions was personalized. Participants were evaluated with the Music Assessment Tool where they indicated their musical preferences and music to which they objected. Following the intervention, participants answered a questionnaire assessing how music impacted their emotional state based on a 1C10 Likert scale. Scores were then averaged across all patients and were calculated as percentages. Eighty-seven sessions were completed during a 3-month period. Despite different degrees of disability, most patients engaged aesthetically with the music. The likelihood to recommend (LTR) for the program was 98%; participants tended to highly agree that the intervention improved their emotional state (92%); that it provided a pleasurable experience (92.4%); and that it reduced their stress and anxiety (89.5%). This pilot project showed that the telemusic intervention was feasible for our neurosciences patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results are consistent with previous in-person hospital-based music interventions and highlight the importance of such programs when in-person interventions are not possible. This pilot project serves as a prelude to further investigate mechanisms by which music interventions can support admitted neurology patients.","output":"Neurology Telemusic Program at the Time of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Turning Hospital Time Into Aesthetic Time During Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND There has been growing interest in the use of hypertonic sodium lactate (HSL) solution following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in humans. However, little is known about the effects of HSL on functional deficits with respect to the hyperosmotic nature of HSL. METHODS We have compared the effects of HSL solution and isotonic saline solution using sensorimotor and cognitive tests for 14 days post-trauma in animals. Thirty minutes after trauma (impact-acceleration model), anesthetized rats were randomly allocated to receive a 2-h infusion of isotonic saline solution (TBI-saline group) or HSL (TBI-HSL group) (n = 10 rats per group). In another series of experiments using a similar protocol, the effects of equiosmolar doses of HSL and hypertonic saline solution (HSS) were compared in TBI rats (n = 10 rats per group). Blood lactate and ion concentrations were measured during the 2-h infusions. RESULTS Compared to the TBI-saline group, the TBI-HSL group had a reduced latency to complete the adhesive removal test: 6 s (5-9) (median [25-75th centiles]) versus 13 s (8-17) on day 7, and 5 s (5-9) versus 11 s (8-26) on day 14 (P < 0.05), respectively, and a shorter delay to complete the radial arm maze test on day 7: 99 s (73-134) versus 176 s (127-300), respectively (P < 0.05). However, no differences were found between the TBI-HSL and TBI-HSS groups in neurocognitive tests performance. Compared to the TBI-saline group, the HSL and HSS groups had higher serum osmolality: 318 mOsm/Kg (315-321) and 315 mOsm/Kg (313-316) versus 307 mOsm/Kg (305-309), respectively (P < 0.05), and the HSL group had a higher serum lactate concentration: 6.4 mmol/L (5.3-7.2) versus 1.5 mmol/L (1.1-1.9) and 1.6 mmol/L (1.5-1.7), respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that improvements in cognitive and sensorimotor tests with HSL infusion post-TBI could be related to elevation of serum osmolality, not to exogenous administration of lactate.","output":"Hypertonic Sodium Lactate to Alleviate Functional Deficits Following Diffuse Traumatic Brain Injury: An Osmotic or a Lactate-Related Effect?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY: Romosozumab is an effective treatment for spine osteoporosis because it reduces the incidence of new fractures and significantly increases the percent change in the spine BMD at 12 months. The percent change in the spine BMD is higher in patients not previously treated with other anti-osteoporosis medications. INTRODUCTION: Romosozumab appeared as a new osteoporosis medication in Japan in 2019. It is an anti-sclerostin antibody, which increases bone formation and suppresses bone resorption. The aim of our study was to elucidate the clinical effects, safety, and predictors of the effects of one-year romosozumab treatment. METHODS: This study was an observational study designed as a preCpost study in 262 patients. Romosozumab (210 mg) was administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks during 12 months. We focused on incidence of new fractures, safety, bone mineral density (BMD) at the spine and total hip, and bone metabolism markers. RESULTS: There were five cases of new fractures during one-year romosozumab treatment. There were no fatal adverse events. Percent changes from baseline in the spine and total hip BMD after 12 months of romosozumab treatment were 10.67% and 2.04%, respectively. Romosozumab had better effects in cases of severe osteoporosis with low spine BMD, high TRACP-5b, and high iP1NP at the start of romosozumab treatment. The percent change in the spine BMD at 12 months was significantly lower in the group transitioning from bisphosphonates than in the group not previously treated with other anti-osteoporosis medications. CONCLUSION: Romosozumab is an effective treatment for spine osteoporosis because it significantly increases the percent change in the spine BMD at 12 months.

This review aims to summarize the current evidence and treatment guidelines for the management of myocarditis in the active population. RECENT FINDINGS: Physical exertion is likely a trigger for dangerous arrythmias and further propagates myocardial damage in athletes with myocarditis. For this reason, abstinence from sports is a critical facet of management in the initial inflammatory period. The use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, specifically late gadolinium enhancement, to guide return to play decisions is becoming more common in clinical practice. SUMMARY: Establishing a stepwise approach for proper diagnosis and risk stratification, with an emphasis on contemporary cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging techniques, in myocarditis is critical. After a diagnosis of myocarditis is made, it is imperative for any athlete or highly active individual to refrain from physical exercise. Additionally, therapy for heart failure should be applied in cases of myocarditis with cardiac dysfunction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 78-question survey was distributed to practicing interventional radiologists and IR trainees. The survey consisted of demographic and practice environment queries. Anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) screener, and coping strategies were assessed using the Brief-Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief-COPE) questionnaire. RESULTS: There were 422 respondents including 333 (78.9%) attending interventional radiologists and 89 (21.1%) interventional radiologists-in-training from 15 counties. Most respondents were from academic medical centers (n = 218; 51.7%). A large majority (n = 391; 92.7%) performed a procedure on a patient with confirmed COVID-19 infection. An N95 mask was the most common (n = 366; 93.6%) safety measure employed. Cancellation or limitation of elective procedures were reported by 276 (65.4%) respondents. Many respondents (n = 177; 41.9%) had self-reported anxiety (GAD-7 score >5) with an overall mean GAD-7 score of 4.64  4.63 (range: 0-21). Factors associated with reporting anxiety included female gender (p = 0.045), increased call coverage (p = 0.048), lack of adequate departmental adjustments (p <0.0001), and lack of adjustments in a timely manner (p <0.0001).

SARS-CoV2 Symptoms: Appetite loss ? fever ? pain ? sore throat Medication:  Clinical Procedure:  Specialty: General and Internal Medicine OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course BACKGROUND: When treating patients with comorbidities who are infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome as a result of SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to offer multidisciplinary treatment that takes into consideration all of the health conditions with which they have been diagnosed. In particular, clinicians should not lose sight of the patient experience, which we can be assessed with the help of patient-reported outcomes (PROs). CASE REPORT: An 84-year-old man infected with SARS-CoV-2 was already suffering from multiple health conditions, including Type 2 diabetes mellitus. He most likely was receiving cortisone therapy and had chronic pain with spondylosis with radiculopathy, bilateral gonarthrosis following total knee replacement, malaise, and fatigue. The patient received acute inpatient care in a hospital that provides complementary medical therapies. We collected clinical and patient-reported data on quality of life, physical functions, the sensation of pain, psychological well-being, and symptoms while taking into account the degree of chronicity of the conditions, the level of the patients pain, and his hospitalization in an isolation ward. We stabilized clinical parameters related to the patients main underlying health conditions (blood glucose and pain levels and oxygen saturation). The PROs we collected demonstrated a significant improvement on discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Applying PROs can be helpful in obtaining a more comprehensive picture of a patient with COVID-19, in which the patient is given a voice, in addition to being assessed by others.

METHOD A retrospective analysis was performed based on four taTME series from 2016 to 2021. Inclusion criteria were patients with rectal cancer in whom a sphincter-saving low anterior resection by taTME was performed. Four different techniques were employed for the anastomosis construction; A) abdominal view, B) transanal view, C) hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis and D) pull-through. Intra and postoperative data was collected and compared. RESULTS A total of 161 patients were included. Tumour height was lower in groups C and D (4 (3-5) vs. 7 (6-8) group A vs. 6 (5-7) group B, p=0.000), requiring a hand-sewn anastomosis. A transanal extraction of the specimen was more commonly performed in groups C and D (over 60% vs. 30% in groups A and B, p=0.000). The rate of temporary stoma was similar between groups A, B and C (ranging from 84 to 98%), but was significantly lower in group D (p=0.000). The overall rate of complications was similar between groups; however, group D had longer LOS (15 days vs. 5-6 in groups A, B and C, p=0.026). CONCLUSION Every type of anastomosis construction after a taTME procedure seems to be safe and feasible and should be chosen based on surgeons experience, tumour height and the length of the rectal cuff after the rectal transection.

Travellers are now likely to adapt their behaviour with a focus on factors that contribute to the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Given the unprecedented spatial and temporal scale of this crisis, these changes in behaviour may even be sustained after the pandemic. To evaluate travellers behaviour in public transport networks during these times and assess how they will respond to future changes in the pandemic, we conduct a stated choice experiment with train travellers in the Netherlands at the end of the first infection wave. We specifically assess behaviour related to three criteria affecting the risk of COVID-19 transmission: (i) crowding, (ii) exposure duration, and (iii) prevalent infection rate. Observed choices are analysed using a latent class choice model which reveals two, nearly equally sized latent traveller segments: COVID Conscious and Infection Indifferent. The former has a significantly higher valuation of crowding, accepting, on average 8.75 minutes extra waiting time (average total travel time in the choice scenarios was about 40 minutes) to reduce one person on-board. Moreover, this class indicates a strong desire to sit without anybody in the neighbouring seat and is quite sensitive to changes in the prevalent infection rate. By contrast, the Infection Indifferent class has a value of crowding (1.04 waiting time minutes/person) that is only slightly higher than pre-pandemic estimates and is relatively unaffected by infection rates. We find that older and female travellers are more likely to be COVD Conscious while those reporting to use the trains more frequently during the pandemic tend to be Infection Indifferent. Further analysis also reveals differences between the two segments in attitudes towards the pandemic and self-reported rule-following behaviour.

Caspases 3, 9 and 12 were activated from 16 h post-infection, but not caspase 8. Indeed, caspase 3 activation during the early stages of the infection appeared to be crucial for efficient virus exit. In addition, the inhibition of membrane blebbing reduced the release of virus particles from the cell. ASFV uses the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a site of replication and this process can trigger ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) of the host cell. In addition to caspase 12 activation, indicators of ER stress include the upregulation of the chaperones calnexin and calreticulin upon virus infection. Moreover, ASFV induces transcription factor 6 signaling pathway of the UPR, but not the protein kinase-like ER kinase or the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 pathways. Thus, the capacity of ASFV to regulate the UPR may prevent early apoptosis and ensure viral replication.","output":"The ATF6 branch of unfolded protein response and apoptosis are activated to promote African swine fever virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early and rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in an infected person is one fundamental part of the strategy against the spread of this virus. As of now, the usual practice is to carry out polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test which provides results in 24-48 hours. Hence, there exists a crucial need for rapid and immediate screening of people suspected to be infected. Presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath can be one such prospect for detection of virus. In this paper, we have designed chromophoric adducts of VOC's in the exhaled breath that can be formed for colorimetric detection of SARS-CoV-2. We noted the bathochromic shift in  (nm) of VOC molecules upon chromophore formation for colorimetric detection. If adapted, this research work will result in low cost solution to the requirement of immediate detection of SARS-CoV-2, hence cost and time of testing will be reduced, compared to PCR and antibodies tests.

Qualitative analysis of COVID cohorts reported community support during COVID as a substantial intervention benefit, which was important at a time when isolation dominated the healthcare professional experience. Total burnout was determined by scores on the subscales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). There were no significant differences in depersonalization (p = 0.3876) and personal accomplishment (p = 0.1519) changes between Pre-COVID and COVID cohorts, however there was a significant difference in emotional exhaustion (p = 0.0315), with COVID cohorts improving more.

Advanced NSCLC patients newly receiving pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy were included. Patients were classified into: (1) the standard-dose group (2 mg/kg), and (2) the low-dose group (<2 mg/kg). We applied inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to compare the overall survival (OS) and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) between the two treatment groups, and to evaluate the minimum clinically effective dose of pembrolizumab.

Therefore, this study assessed the effectiveness of ustekinumab in a large cohort of Italian patients with refractory CD. METHODS: All patients who had started on ustekinumab after failure of or intolerance to antitumour necrosis factor- (TNF-) treatment at five tertiary centres between November 2018 and February 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. The coprimary outcome was corticosteroid-free clinical remission, defined as a HarveyCBradshaw Index (HBI) score of ?4, at weeks 26 and 52. The secondary outcomes were changes in the HBI and C-reactive protein (CRP) values at weeks 8, 26, and 52 from baseline and the normalization of CRP in patients with initially abnormal values. RESULTS: Totally, 140 patients who had previously received at least one anti-TNF- agent were enrolled; 40.0% received two anti-TNF- agents and 20.0% received vedolizumab. At baseline, 108 patients (77.1%) had HBI scores of >4; of these, 56.5% and 58.3% achieved corticosteroid-free clinical remission at weeks 26 and 52, respectively. Significant decreases in HBI and CRP values were observed at weeks 8, 26, and 52 in the entire study cohort (all p < 0.0001). The CRP values were normalized in 34.9%, 37.8%, and 49.3% of the patients by weeks 8, 26, and 52, respectively. The baseline HBI score of ?8 was a negative predictor of corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 52 (odds ratio: 0.21, 95% confidence interval: 0.08C0.56, p = 0.002). The probability of remaining on ustekinumab after 52 weeks was 92.1%. Eleven (7.9%) patients discontinued ustekinumab (three for adverse events).

However, the underlying molecular mechanism of CR is still largely unknown. This study was designed to explore the bioactive components and the mechanism of CR in treating SCI based on a network pharmacology approach and experimental validation. Methods First, the active compounds and related target genes in CR were screened from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database. Subsequently, the corresponding target genes of SCI were collected by the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) and GeneCards database. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database. Furthermore, GO function and KEGG enrichment analysis of the targets were analyzed using DAVID tools. Subsequently, the AutoDock software for molecular docking was adopted to verify the above network pharmacology analysis results between the active components and key targets. Finally, an SCI rat model animal validation experiment was assessed to verify the reliability of the network pharmacology results. Results There were 7 active ingredients identified in CR and 246 SCI-related targets were collected. Then, 4 core nodes (ALB, AKT1, MAPK1, and EGFR) were discerned via construction of a PPI network of 111 common targets. The KEGG enrichment analysis results indicated that the Ras signaling pathway, estrogen signaling pathway, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway were enriched in the development of SCI. The results of molecular docking demonstrated that the effects of CR have a strong affinity with the 4 pivotal targets. Experimental validation in a rat model showed that CR could effectively improve the recovery of motor function and mechanical pain threshold after SCI. Conclusions In summary, it revealed the mechanism of CR treatment for SCI involve active ingredients, targets and signaling pathways, providing a scientific basis for future investigations into the mechanism underlying CR treating for SCI.","output":"The mechanisms of Chuanxiong Rhizoma in treating spinal cord injury based on network pharmacology and experimental verification."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents the new cable delay measurement system (CDMS) designed at Yebes Observatory (IGN, Spain), which is required for the VLBI Global Observing System (VGOS) stations.

As a result, the system detects the changes in the length of that coaxial cable due to temperature variations along the cable run and flexures caused by VGOS radio telescope movements. This CDMS outperforms the previous versions: firstly, it does not require a frequency counter for phase/delay measurements; secondly, it largely reduces the use of digital circuits; hence, reducing digital noise; and thirdly, it has a remotely controlled automatic calibration subsystem. The system was tested in the laboratory and in the radio telescope, and the measurements of both set-ups are shown. These measurements include the total noise, accuracy, hysteresis, and stability. The results in the radio telescope can be correlated with the different factors that affect the cable, such as temperature and flexures. The system allows to achieve an RMS noise of less than 0.5 ps, significantly improving the requirements established in VGOS. The system is currently installed in the Red Atlntica de Estaciones Geodinmicas y Espaciales (RAEGE)Yebes VGOS 13.2 m radio telescope, and will be installed in the Norwegian Mapping Authority (NMA) twin VGOS radio telescopes, in the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute (FGI) VGOS station and in the RAEGE Santa Mara VGOS radio telescope (A?ores, Portugal).","output":"New Cable Delay Measurement System for VGOS Stations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study analyzed the determinants of morbidity, mortality, and case fatality rate (CFR) of the ongoing pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19).

In this study, we performed RNA-chip to identify the microRNA regulation network between MDSCs and Th17 cells. miR-542-5p in humans, as the homologous gene of miR-322-5p in mice was significantly upregulated in the Th17+MDSC group compared to Th17 cells cultured alone and downregulated in the Th17+MDSC+Arg-1 inhibitor group compared to the Th17+MDSC group. We further evaluated the miR-322-5p and Th17/Treg balance in mice and found that the proportions of both Th17 cells and Tregs were elevated and that miR-322-5p overexpression activated the transforming growth factor- pathway. Moreover, although miR-322-5p expression was higher in SLE mice, it decreased after treatment with an Arg-1 inhibitor. The proportion of Th17 cells and Th17/Treg ratio correlated with miR-322-5p levels. In conclusion, MDSC-derived Arg-1 and mmu-miR-322-5p not only promote Th17 cell and Treg differentiation, but also shift the Th17/Treg ratio in SLE.

This pathway regulates the activity of the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC), which is responsible for NaCl reabsorption in the distal nephron. Therefore, mutations in genes encoding proteins that regulate the NCC proteins disrupt ion homeostasis and cause hypertension by increasing NaCl reabsorption. Thiazide diuretics are currently the main treatment option for Gordon's syndrome. However, they have a number of side effects, and chronic usage can lead to compensatory adaptations in the nephron that counteract their action. Therefore, recent research has focused on developing novel inhibitory molecules that inhibit components of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1-NCC pathway, thereby reducing NaCl reabsorption and restoring normal blood pressure. In this review we provide an overview of the currently reported molecular inhibitors of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1-NCC pathway and discuss their potential as treatment options for Gordon's syndrome.","output":"WNK-SPAK/OSR1-NCC kinase signaling pathway as a novel target for the treatment of salt-sensitive hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In the last decade, diabetes management has begun to transition to technology-based care, with young people being the focus of many technological advances. Yet, detailed insights into the experiences of young people and their caregivers of using technology to manage type 1 diabetes mellitus are lacking. OBJECTIVE The objective of our study was to describe the breadth of experiences and perspectives on diabetes technology use among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus and their caregivers. METHODS This systematic literature review used integrated thematic analysis to guide a narrative synthesis of the included studies. We analyzed the perspectives and experiences of young people with type 1 diabetes mellitus and their caregivers reported in qualitative studies, quantitative descriptive studies, and studies with a mixed methods design. RESULTS Seventeen articles met the inclusion criteria, and they included studies on insulin pump, glucose sensors, and remote monitoring systems. The following eight themes were derived from the analysis: (1) expectations of the technology prior to use, (2) perceived impact on sleep and overnight experiences, (3) experiences with alarms, (4) impact on independence and relationships, (5) perceived usage impact on blood glucose control, (6) device design and features, (7) financial cost, and (8) user satisfaction. While many advantages of using diabetes technology were reported, several challenges for its use were also reported, such as cost, the size and visibility of devices, and the intrusiveness of alarms, which drew attention to the fact that the user had type 1 diabetes mellitus. Continued use of diabetes technology was underpinned by its benefits outweighing its challenges, especially among younger people. CONCLUSIONS Diabetes technologies have improved the quality of life of many young people with type 1 diabetes mellitus and their caregivers. Future design needs to consider the impact of these technologies on relationships between young people and their caregivers, and the impact of device features and characteristics such as size, ease of use, and cost.","output":"Experiences of Young People and Their Caregivers of Using Technology to Manage Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: Systematic Literature Review and Narrative Synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The objectives of this presentation are to provide an overview of the current understanding regarding repetitive self-injurious behavior as a symptom of catatonia in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the paradigms and lessons learned, as well as longstanding and novel challenges. Methods: The literature review and direct clinical experience will be discussed. Results: Catatonia is reported to occur in 12% to 20% of youth with ASD, with significant advances in understanding over the past 2 decades. Some youth with ASD experience more expected psychomotor-retarded catatonic symptoms, such as slowness, rigidity, getting stuck, and posturing, speech abnormalities, or frank mutism, which are often coupled with prominent skill regression. This presentation can lead to massive clinical devastation, as is also the case when psychomotor agitation dominates the catatonic picture, often in the form of intractable self-injury devoid of any operant function, unresponsive to any behavioral intervention, and often requiring the most desperate measures of bodily restraint to prevent catastrophic tissue damage. Three current cases will be reviewed describing catatonia in ASD, where life-threatening self-injurious behavior (SIB) dominated the catatonic clinical picture. One youth had experienced prior catatonic episodes resulting in severe malnutrition and bilateral retinal detachment from head-directed SIB before relative stability was achieved with ECT;maintenance ECT remained de rigueur for months as this patients illness course waxed and waned. Another youth spent 9 months restrained in a pediatric unit in a state of chronic agitated catatonia until ECT introduction;despite massive improvement with ECT, this patient exemplified the complexity of such cases in terms of additional behavioral complexities requiring intensive management. A third youth with intractable head-directed SIB experienced prompt relief with ECT introduction;his treatment, however, was inadvertently disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many lessons learned from his brief relapse and subsequent renewed recovery. Conclusions: Recognition of repetitive SIBs devoid of environmental function as part of the catatonic spectrum in ASD is no longer novel. Much continues to be learned, however, about both the acute and long-term management of such patients, with pearls, new challenges, and vistas for improvement.

Developing countries, especially in their rural areas, suffer from a lack of healthcare facilities, poverty and high rate of illiteracy. Motivated by the huge socio-economic gap between the developed and the developing worlds, there have been several studies into the COVID-19 pandemic management in developing countries. However, none of these research works emphasised the health cultural beliefs of any developing economy as a basis for their recommendations. Specifically, this paper discusses the pandemic situation in Nigeria with emphasis on the prevalent health cultural beliefs of the citizens of the country, especially those living in rural communities. This is important because each local community defines a socio-ecological cluster of people who are more tightly knitted together in terms of language, relationship, culture, religion, social amenities, business, leadership and so on. As such, there is a need to prepare the socio-ecological units to be more resistant to the spread of the virus; a weaker social-ecological unit will entail a higher risk of community transmissions. With respect to the peculiarity of each local community, this paper recommends strategies for controlling and managing the pandemic in Nigeria using community informatics or grass-root computing. We argue that community informatics can empower and support policy makers and governments of developing countries such as Nigeria in combating and effectively managing a pandemic.","output":"Community Informatics for Sustainable Management of Pandemics in Developing Countries: A Case Study of COVID-19 in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to define the clinical and serological characteristics of pan-neurofascin antibody-positive patients. METHODS: We tested serum from patients with suspected immune-mediated neuropathies for antibodies directed against nodal/paranodal protein antigens using a live cell-based assay and solid-phase platform. The clinical and serological characteristics of antibody-positive and seronegative patients were then compared. Sera positive for pan-neurofascin were also tested against live myelinated human stem cell-derived sensory neurons for antibody binding. RESULTS: Eight patients with IgG(1)-subclass antibodies directed against both isoforms of the nodal/paranodal cell adhesion molecule neurofascin were identified.

The mosquito species is widely distributed throughout Southeast Asia, Africa and Europe, and thought to be absent in Australia. METHODS: In February and May, 2020 the Medical Entomology unit of the Northern Territory (NT) Top End Health Service collected Cx. tritaeniorhynchus female specimens (n = 19) from the Darwin and Katherine regions. Specimens were preliminarily identified morphologically as the Vishnui subgroup in subgenus Culex. Molecular identification was performed using cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) barcoding, including sequence percentage identity using BLAST and tree-based identification using maximum likelihood analysis in the IQ-TREE software package. Once identified using COI, specimens were reanalysed for diagnostic morphological characters to inform a new taxonomic key to related species from the NT. RESULTS: Sequence percentage analysis of COI revealed that specimens from the NT shared 99.7% nucleotide identity to a haplotype of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus from Dili, Timor-Leste. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the NT specimens formed a monophyletic clade with other Cx. tritaeniorhynchus from Southeast Asia and the Middle East. We provide COI barcodes for most NT species from the Vishnui subgroup to aid future identifications, including the first genetic sequences for Culex (Culex) crinicauda and the undescribed species Culex (Culex) sp. No. 32 of Marks. Useful diagnostic morphological characters were identified and are presented in a taxonomic key to adult females to separate Cx. tritaeniorhynchus from other members of the Vishnui subgroup from the NT. CONCLUSIONS: We report the detection of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus in Australia from the Darwin and Katherine regions of the NT. The vector is likely to be already established in northern Australia, given the wide geographical spread throughout the Top End of the NT. The establishment of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus in Australia is a concern to health officials as the species is an important vector of JEV and is now the sixth species from the subgenus Culex capable of vectoring JEV in Australia. We suggest that the species must now be continuously monitored during routine mosquito surveillance programmes to determine its current geographical spread and prevent the potential transmission of exotic JEV throughout Australia.","output":"Detection of the Japanese encephalitis vector mosquito Culex tritaeniorhynchus in Australia using molecular diagnostics and morphology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the current Covid\\\\19 pandemic, college laboratories are shut down and undergraduate students who need research experience are having a hard time gaining those skills.

Regularity-based Zoning (HuMoRZ) algorithm, to delineate containment zones incorporating mobility regularity The Taipei metropolitan area in Taiwan is used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm The spatial diffusion of an emerging respiratory disease, novel influenza A/H1N1, is simulated for comparing three different quarantine zoning systems: (1) a minimum zoning unit, (2) optimal zoning without considering mobility regularity, and (3) optimal zoning considering mobility regularity Two epidemiological performance indicators are used to compare simulation results: namely, the accumulated infected number (AN) on the 30th day, reflecting the severity of an epidemic, and the critical time (CT), the moment at which half of the population becomes infected, measuring the diffusion speed of an epidemic To measure the variety of different facility types within a containment zone, we further use Shannon's entropy scores, representing a self-contained zone, and the boxplot of all zones' entropy scores, reflecting geospatial homogeneity of life functions across zones Our results suggest that containment zones that incorporate mobility regularity could significantly delay the epidemic peak and critical time and decrease the severity of an epidemic The zoning patterns proposed in our algorithm could also allow for more life functions in a zone and more evenly distributed life resources across zones than those of zones generated by other methods These findings could provide insightful implications for fighting the COVID-19

This study aimed to validate these design rules by applying optimised model salts to unsalted potato crisps at a 30% reduced salt content to produce prototype products. A selection of commercial products were also chosen to represent the salt content and crisp style of the broader market, with the aim to investigate the potential of other salt reduction strategies including; direct salt removal without compensation for loss of salt content and increasing time in mouth, while exploring the impact of consumer mouth behaviour type on consumer product preference. Nine products varying in salt content (6 standard, 1 crinkle-cut, 1 thick-cut batch-fried, 1 baked reconstituted potato) were subject to descriptive sensory analysis with a trained panel (n = 11).

Herein, we present a previous confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection case series including five patients, who underwent either open or transbronchial lung biopsy due to no clinical improvement. DESCRIPTION: Case 1: a 73-year-old male patient initially asymptomatic, with positive RT-PCR after transurethral resection of the prostate. Consulted for dyspnea and room air desaturation after 24 days during postoperative. Chest computed tomography reported findings compatible with organizing pneumonia, then a transbronchial biopsy was performed confirming diagnosis. Case 2: a 48-year-old male patient with COVID-19 pneumonia who required 14 days hospitalization. He was readmitted after 25 days since initial symptoms due to dyspnea and room air desaturation with a chest CT that revealed findings suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, an open lung biopsy was performed with a probable usual interstitial pneumonia pattern report. Case 3: a 86-year-old male patient, with initial mild COVID-19 infection who later progressed to severe pneumonia requiring high levels of supplemental oxygen. At 18 days of admission, due to persistent clinical compromise, a chest CT was performed with findings of organizing pneumonia. Therefore, he was taken to transbronchial lung biopsy that revealed non-specific interstitial pneumonia in the fibrosing phase. Case 4: a 61-year-old male patient with HIV/AIDS infection presented acute respiratory distress syndrome due to severe COVID-19 pneumonia with inability to withdraw invasive mechanical ventilation after one month. An open lung biopsy was performed with histopathology diagnosis of diffuse alveolar damage in the proliferative phase.Case 5: 41-year-old male patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, with persistent use of high levels of supplemental oxygen after 30 days since symptomatic. The chest CT suggested pulmonary fibrosis;therefore, an open lung biopsy was performed and confirmed Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia. DISCUSSION: to date, reports of interstitial lung disease due to COVID-19 refer to imaging findings or post-mortem histopathological studies which have been relatively limited given the strict guidelines and restrictions for performing bronchoscopies and lung surgery during the pandemic. The foregoing highlights the importance of tissue analysis under rigorous safety protocols in order to provide an early detection of interstitial lung involvement secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection and then evaluate a prolonged steroid treatment recommendation.","output":"Histopathogical Lung Patterns of SARS CoV2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"GOAL: To study the effect of the first COVID-19 wave in combination with the lockdown on acute care in the Netherlands DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study RESULTS: The number of ED visits fell by 27% during the lockdown For the specialties of internal medicine and pulmonary medicine, the number of admissions from the ED was the same during the lockdown, but the length of stay was longer For all other specialties, the number of admissions from the ED was lower during the lockdown, but the admission duration was the same Mortality was higher and hospital stay longer for patients admitted to the specialties of internal medicine and pulmonary medicine In all other specialisms studied, there was no higher mortality or longer hospital stay CONCLUSION: From the start of the lockdown, there was a sharp drop in the number of ED visits The number of ED visits recovered slowly after this drop For specialties that did not treat COVID-19 patients, hospital occupation was lower than usual The number of admissions from the ED had decreased for these specialties Based on the outcome measures length of stay and mortality, we were unable to find any indications of health damage as a result of the drop in admissions","output":"[Acute care during the first corona wave.

The 34 lymphoma patients treated during the year prior vaccination with anti-CD20 antibody containing therapy had significantly lower rates of VAHL comparted to all other lymphoma patients (8.8% versus 41.2% in all-PET patients, Pv < 0.01). VAHL rates were 10% in patients with negative serology, 31.3% in patients with low anti-spike titers and 72.2% in patients with high anti-spike titers. The positive predictive values of VAHL were 90% and 93.3% in all-PET and PET-2 patients, respectively. A positive statistically significant correlation was found between VAHL and serology ranks in All-PET patients (r s = 0.530, Pv < 0.001), and stronger correlation was found in PET-2 patients (r s = 0.642, Pv < 0.001). Conclusion: VAHL on [ 18 F]FDG PET-CT of patients with hematologic malignancy may reflect GC B-cell proliferation and an effective humoral response elicited by BNT162b2 vaccine.","output":"Correlation Between BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine-associated Hypermetabolic Lymphadenopathy and Humoral Immunity in Patients With Hematologic Malignancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report provides a visual examination of Covid-19 case and death data.

This is crucial given the lack of gender perspective in measures to handle the pandemic in Indonesia and therefore deepening the existing gender inequality. This situation can be seen in the mitigation of the pandemics impacts, particularly the specific impact of the pandemic on women within the gender cross-sectoral issues (economy, health, and education), and womens participation in the decision-making processes. Datas during the pandemic show that the pandemic has caused serious impacts on women. Therefore, data and gender analysis are needed in order to ensure that measures in handling the pandemic would address the problems that are faced by women and vulnerable groups. This paper will present data from global and national, as well as data from KAPAL Perempuans field experiences in its collaboration with its local partner organizations in six provinces. The paper also draws from documentation from the experiences of other organizations in integrating gender perspective from the past natural disasters mitigations that ever occurred in Yogyakarta, West Sumatra, Palu, and Lombok.

METHODS: Consecutive patients who presented to all five of the emergency rooms of the Reggio Emilia province between February 27 and March 23, 2020, for suspected COVID-19, underwent chest CT, and had a positive swab within 10 days were included in this retrospective study. Age, sex, comorbidities, days from symptom onset, and laboratory data were retrieved from institutional information systems. CT disease extension was visually graded as < 20%, 20C39%, 40C59%, or  60%. The association between clinical and CT variables with death was estimated with univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models; model performance was assessed using k-fold cross-validation for the area under the ROC curve (cvAUC). RESULTS: Of the 866 included patients (median age 59.8, women 39.2%), 93 (10.74%) died. Clinical variables significantly associated with death in multivariable model were age, male sex, HDL cholesterol, dementia, heart failure, vascular diseases, time from symptom onset, neutrophils, LDH, and oxygen saturation level. CT disease extension was also independently associated with death (HR = 7.56, 95% CI = 3.49; 16.38 for  60% extension). cvAUCs were 0.927 (bootstrap bias-corrected 95% CI = 0.899C0.947) for the clinical model and 0.936 (bootstrap bias-corrected 95% CI = 0.912C0.953) when adding CT extension. CONCLUSIONS: A prognostic model based on clinical variables is highly accurate in predicting death in COVID-19 patients. Adding CT disease extension to the model scarcely improves its accuracy. KEY POINTS: ? Early identification of COVID-19 patients at higher risk of disease progression and death is crucial; the role of CT scan in defining prognosis is unclear. ? A clinical model based on age, sex, comorbidities, days from symptom onset, and laboratory results was highly accurate in predicting death in COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency room. ? Disease extension assessed with CT was independently associated with death when added to the model but did not produce a valuable increase in accuracy.

The COVID-19 pandemic interruption allowed additional measurement of the qualitative lived in experiences of this patient group during the pandemic and also their appetite for virtual health. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two patients with knee osteoarthritis were recruited from a combined primary/secondary care waiting list and were allocated to either a six-week intervention group (ARMED) or to the six-week usual care ESCAPE pain group (Enabling Self-management and Coping with Arthritic Pain using Exercise) group. RESULTS: The intervention programme was interrupted after three weeks by COVID-19. Fifteen patients were reassessed after the first stage. The average attendance was 92% with 6 patients attending all sessions, 5 attending 5/6, 1 attending 4/6 and 2 attending 3/6. One subject dropped out and 15/16 patients completed all outcome measurements. All patients completed the KOOS knee score and the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale to evaluate anxiety and depression. There was a statistically significant improvement in pain, activities of daily living, quality of life and mental health and well-being scores from time one to time 2. The mean weight, BMI and waist measurements were reduced also from time one to time 2, but these failed to reach significance. The semi-structured interviews provided rich information on enablers and barriers to coping in lockdown, benefits of the ARMED programme to increasing physical activity and weight management and enablers and barriers to redesigning the programme for online delivery.

Although the disease associated to this virus, named COVID-19, mainly affects the lungs, the infection can spread to extrapulmonary tissues, causing multiorgan involvement in severely ill patients. The broad infective capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is related to the pattern of expression of the viral entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human tissues. As such, the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which explains the clinical phenotype described in the vast majority of infected patients that includes pneumonia and diarrhea. Recently, preoccupation about the potential of the virus to infect the skin has been raised by dermatologists due to the increasing observations of cutaneous manifestations in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although there is little evidence of the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the normal skin, the dermatological findings observed among COVID-19 patients warrants further investigation to delineate the mechanisms of skin affection after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we provide a summary of the dermatological findings observed among patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection based on recent reports. In addition, we analyze possible mechanisms of skin injury in COVID-19 patients and discuss about the risk of individuals with chronic skin conditions for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

RESULTS: The majority of the older adults had no or mild depression, anxiety and stress symptoms in spite of the prolonged confinements, and were slightly satisfied with their lives. However, depression, anxiety, stress and TDAS levels were higher in participants aged 80 years and older. Residents of NHs had higher TDAS, depression and anxiety levels and lower SLS levels than community\\\\dwelling older adults. Participants who were meeting their children and/or grandchildren less than 2 h a week, were found to have significantly lower SLS and higher depression scores.

Emetine had amongst the lowest reported half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) from over 290 agents screened for the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses. While EC50 concentrations of emetine are achievable in the blood, studies show that concentrations of emetine can be almost 300 times higher in the lungs. Furthermore, based on the relative EC50s of emetine towards the coronaviruses compared with Entamoeba histolytica, emetine could be much more effective as an anti-coronavirus agent than it is against amoebiasis. This paper also discusses the known side effects of emetine and related compounds, how those side effects can be managed, and the optimal method of administration for the potential treatment of COVID-19. Given the serious and immediate threat that the COVID-19 coronavirus poses, our long history with emetine and the likely ability of emetine to reach therapeutic concentrations within the lungs, ipecac, emetine, and other analogues should be considered as potential treatment options, especially if in vitro studies confirm viral sensitivity.","output":"Emetine, Ipecac, Ipecac Alkaloids and Analogues as Potential Antiviral Agents for Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aim of the present review is to provide basic knowledge about the treatment of Coronavirus via medicinal plants.

METHODS In a prospective study, patients underwent 24-h pH-impedance monitoring before and 3 months after LSG. Using this technique, belches can be identified. Preoperative and postoperative upper gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed using the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ). RESULTS Fifteen patients (1 M/14 F, mean age 42.2  11.0 years, mean weight 134.5  21.1 kg, mean BMI 46.4  6.0 kg/m(2)) participated in this study.

Various analgesics (including paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories), exercises and acupuncture had not helped. There was no history of recurrent urinary tract infections or symptom correlation with fluid intake, menstruation or bowel habit. No inflammatory features or connective tissue disease symptoms were noted and family history was unremarkable Clinical examination was normal apart from mild tenderness in the lumbar region. Rheumatoid factor was borderline positive (15 iu/mL) with the rest of blood tests normal including renal function, inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), anti CCP and ANA. She had minimal microscopic haematuria without proteinuria. MRI spine in 2015 was normal. In view of her young age and symptoms affecting daily activities, STIR sequence spinal MRI was requested. This excluded any new or old inflammatory changes but incidentally identified a dilated left pelvi-calyceal system. Renal ultrasound confirmed a grossly hydronephrotic left kidney with hydroureter and minimal renal tissue suggesting longstanding obstruction. No calculi were seen. The patient was referred to urologists. Further investigations (including MRI abdomen) confirmed similar findings and a distal ureteric stricture. A MAG 3 renogram showed a normal right kidney but only 12% functioning of the left kidney. Urologists have advised surgery (removal of left kidney and ureter) which may relieve symptoms or a conservative non-surgical approach (continue analgesia, physiotherapy and monitoring). The patient and her family are relieved to have a possible cause identified and are considering the surgical option due to ongoing flank discomfort. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: This was an interesting finding of hydroureter and hydronephrosis causing longstanding back pain presenting to rheumatologists. Until completion of the spondyloarthropathy protocol MRI (STIR images), aetiology had been unclear. Hydronephrosis and hydroureter has no specific age or racial predilection. Signs and symptoms may depend on whether obstruction is acute/chronic. Chronic cases may be asymptomatic or present as a dull discomfort (like this case). Some cases may only present in adulthood with pain precipitated by fluid intake. Blood tests may show impaired kidney function. Post-mortem studies suggest 50% of people have at least one renal abnormality (e.g., renal cysts, duplex ureters) with autopsy series incidence of hydronephrosis reported as 3.1%. Causes include anatomical abnormalities such as vesico-ureteric reflux, urethral strictures (usually present in childhood), calculi, benign prostatic hyperplasia, or intrapelvic neoplasms, pregnancy and infections (e.g., TB). Sudden onset unilateral renomegaly was reported in one case of primary Sjogrens with lymphocytic interstitial nephritis and positive Sjogrens autoantibodies. Our patient has no clinical or serological evidence of connective tissue disease. Minor pelvi-calyceal distension can occur as a normal finding in well-hydrated patients and pregnancy. However, significant hydronephrosis requires assessment to determine cause as it may affect long term renal function. Imaging via computed tomography, ultrasound and urograms can help guide further management. In this case the preceding cause and duration of pathology is unknown. Sterile, giant hydronephrosis treatment options include observation and ureteric stent or nephrostomy in patients unfit for surgery. Nephrectomy is advised for pain and recurrent infection in a non-functioning kidney. Complications may include bowel perforation, vascular injury and urine leakage. Both open and minimally invasive procedures have good reported outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic and exams have affected timing of any elective procedures and the patient understands surgery may or may not offer complete symptom resolution. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: Non-inflammatory causes of back pain should always be considered in cases of persistent back pain, particularly in young people to ascertain if there is a treatable cause. Hydronephrosis cases can be asymptomatic or present with vague, intermittent, non-specific abdominal symptoms with normal physical examination with or without haematuria. This can cause diagnostic uncertainty and delay referral to urology and appropriate renal investigations . Assessment of renal function (including MAG 3 renogram) is important to guide further management. Surgical interventions (pyeloplasty/nephrectomy) may ease symptoms long term but there is no guarantee of a successful outcome and operative risks need to be considered too. Left undiagnosed, potentially this patient could have had further disruption to daily activities and both physical and mental well being.","output":"P13 Finding an answer for an adolescent with back pain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The balancing functions of pro/anti-inflammatory mediators of the complex innate responses have been investigated in a variety of experimental inflammatory settings. Annexin-A1 (AnxA1) is one mediator of endogenous anti-inflammation, affording regulation of leukocyte trafficking and activation in many contexts, yet its role in lung pathologies has been scarcely investigated, despite being highly expressed in lung cells. Here we have applied the bleomycin lung fibrosis model to AnxA1 null mice over a 21-day time-course, to monitor potential impact of this mediator on the control of the inflammatory and fibrotic phases. RESULTS: Analyses in wild-type mice revealed strict spatial and temporal regulation of the Anxa1 gene, e.g. up-regulation in epithelial cells and infiltrated granulocytes at day 7, followed by augmented protein levels in alveolar macrophages by day 21. Absence of AnxA1 caused increases in: i) the degree of inflammation at day 7; and ii) indexes of fibrosis (assessed by deposition of hydroxyproline in the lung) at day 7 and 21. These alterations in AnxA1 null mice were paralleled by augmented TGF-1, IFN- and TNF- generation compared to wild-type mice. Finally, treatment of wild type animals with an AnxA1 peptido-mimetic, given prophylactically (from day 0 to 21) or therapeutically (from day 14 onward), ameliorated both signs of inflammation and fibrosis. CONCLUSION: Collectively these data reveal a pathophysiological relevance for endogenous AnxA1 in lung inflammation and, more importantly, fibrosis, and may open new insights for the pharmacological treatment of lung fibrosis.","output":"Endogenous annexin A1 counter-regulates bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a world health crisis contributing to impact people's fears, anxiety and psychological problems This review study aimed to identify factors with psychological impact and social stigma among people A systematic review searched five electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, CINAHL and ProQuest) for previous studies using a cross-sectional or quasi-experimental design published between March and April 2020 The Centre for Review and Dissemination and the Joanna Briggs Institute Guideline used for assess quality and Prisma checklist for guided this review Title, abstract, full-text and methodology were assessed for the eligibility of the studies Data tabulation and narrative analysis of study findings was performed We found eleven studies which met inclusion criteria in the review Included studies were divided into two broad thematic areas regarding COVID-19: factors related to psychology (n=7) and social stigma (n=3) and 1 study of both The factors contributed in psychology and social stigma studies are mostly quasi-experiment and cross-sectional The average number of participants were more than one thousand overall for every study and discussed psychological impact and social stigma related factors Factors contributing to psychological impact were age, gender, education background, economic, support system, health condition and source information , whilst factors contributing to social stigma were environmental, history of accompanying chronic diseases, discrimination, self-isolation and people's perceptions of the affected area ? 2020 EManuscript Technologies All rights reserved","output":"Risk factors for psychological impact and social stigma among people facing COVID 19: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, a screening tool and an extensive assessment were constructed to measure COVID-19-induced distress.

Materials and Methods: The thorax CT examinations and RT-PCR test results were retrospectively evaluated in 177 children. According to the test results, the patients were divided into two groups as 'COVID-19-positive' and 'COVID-19-negative'. Results: In the COVID-19-positive group, 65.71% of the patients with a family history of COVID-19 (p&lt;0.01). In the same group, 50.00% of patients with normal CT findings were older than 16 years (p&lt;0.01), and single-lobe involvement was more common (54.54%, p&lt;0.01). The most observed CT finding was consolidation with ground-glass opacities (GGO) in both groups. Fibrotic bands (51.46%, p&lt;0.01), reticular pattern (34.95%, p&lt;0.01), atelectasis (9.71%, p&lt;0.01), mosaic perfusion (26.21%, p&lt;0.01), and pleural effusion (19.42%, p&lt;0.01) were mostly seen in the COVID-19-negative group.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from two samples of potential Chinese tourists in the contexts of Italian and Thai food. Data obtained from 264 Chinese respondents for Italian food and 277 Chinese respondents for Thai food were analyzed. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was utilized to test the research model. Findings: The results indicate that, while motivational factors such as cultural experience, novelty and sensory appeal influence potential Chinese tourists' intention to consume Italian food, motivational factors such as cultural experience, health concern, novelty and sensory appeal influence tourists' intention to consume Thai food. The authors found that intention to consume local food positively influences tourists' intention to visit both destinations (Italy and Thailand). Moreover, tourists' risk perceptions of COVID-19 negatively moderate the effect of cultural experience and novelty on the intention to consume Italian food. Regarding the intention to consume Thai food, the authors found that tourists' risk perceptions have a diminishing effect on all motivational factors. Originality/value: This pioneering study examines the role of COVID-19-related risk perception on the relationships among motivation of local food consumption, intention of local food consumption and destination visit intention in the context of two destination countries.

As most studies have investigated bi- or tri-variate models, a multivariate model accounting for simultaneous potential mediations is necessary to have a comprehensive view of the determinants of QOL. We sought to estimate the associations between cognitive reserve, cognition, functioning, insight, depression, schizophrenic symptoms, and QoL in schizophrenia and their potential mediation relationships. METHODS We used structural equation modeling with mediation analyses to test a model based on existing literature in a sample of 776 patients with schizophrenia from the FondaMental Foundation FACE-SZ cohort. RESULTS Our model showed a good fit to the data. We found better functioning to be positively associated with a better QoL, whereas better cognition, better insight, higher levels of depression, and schizophrenic symptoms were associated with a lower QoL in our sample. Cognitive reserve is not directly linked to QoL, but indirectly in a negative manner via cognition. We confirm the negative relationship between cognition and subjective QoL which was previously evidenced by other studies; moreover, this relationship seems to be robust as it survived in our multivariate model. It was not explained by insight as some suggested, thus the mechanism at stake remains to be explained. CONCLUSION The pathways to subjective QoL in schizophrenia are complex and the determinants largely influence each other.

TECHNIQUE The first FEVAR procedure performed at another center implanted a standard Zenith device with 2 fenestrations and 1 scallop for a juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. The diameter of the Crawford type IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm had progressed from 68 to 75 mm within a year after the FEVAR. Since the celiac trunk was already occluded, a 3-fenestration 22-172-mm stent-graft was chosen to extend the existing stent-graft further proximally. A tapered 38/22-179-mm Zenith custom-made device was designed for the thoracic component. The technique addresses several issues that arise during a FEVAR-in-FEVAR case, such as the orientation of the new stent-graft and its fenestrations, the absence of space between the 2 devices for maneuvers, and the difficulty in catheterizing target vessels with existing bridging stents, for which a bailout \\"snare-ride\\" maneuver is described.

In the context of the rapid global dissemination of the Covid-19 pandemic, describing viral infection rates in relation to international air travel early during the pandemic can help inform future public health policy. The objective of this study is to determine whether proximity to an international airport predicted higher infection rates during the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States (US). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the authors examined the incidence of Covid-19 in areas near US international airports in the first weeks after detection of Covid-19 in all 50 states, using publicly available county-level incidence of Covid-19 data. They performed a multiple regression to determine the relative effects of population density and air traffic in the Counties Containing Airports (CCA) and the number of Covid-19 cases, and determined the odds of Covid-19 in CCA compared to the rest of the state. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis revealed that air traffic was significantly correlated with Covid-19 cases during the initial phase of pandemic while population density was not significantly correlated. Three weeks into the pandemic, the pooled odds of Covid-19 cases in CCA was 2.66 (95% CI [2.64, 2.68], p < 0.0001).

Telementorship, mentorship through video conferencing software, presents a unique approach to overcome these challenges. AIMS: This study evaluated whether telementorship through video conference increased access to mentorship encounters and decreased perceived barriers to access, factors that determine likelihood to maintain mentor relationships, and quality of mentorship. METHODS: A year-long randomized, prospective cohort study was conducted in 2016C2017 with pairs of resident mentors from seven different training programs and medical student mentees, randomized to telementorship or in-person mentorship. The number of quarterly encounters was monitored and demographic predictors of meeting were determined. Likert scale survey responses were analyzed with linear regression. RESULTS: Forty-three of 46 (93.5%) volunteer mentor-mentee pairs participated. Telementorship did not alter likelihood of meeting or attitudes toward mentorship barriers (time and distance). Mentee satisfaction increased from 42.5% to 65.4% (P<0.05) throughout the year. Operating room-based practice (P<0.05) and higher postgraduate level (P=0.02) decreased the likelihood of meeting.

The pulmonary infection can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ultimately, death. An excessive innate immune response plays a major role in the development of ARDS in COVID-19 patients. In this scenario, activation of lung epithelia and resident macrophages by the virus results in local cytokine production and recruitment of neutrophils. Activated neutrophils extrude a web of DNA-based cytoplasmic material containing antimicrobials referred to as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).

METHODS: This mini-review summarizes the available evidence regarding the effects of COVID-19, its treatment, and the consequences of the pandemic itself on bone health. Additionally, we review evidence and expert recommendations regarding putative effects of osteoporosis medications on COVID-19 outcomes and vaccine efficacy and summarize recommendations for continuation of osteoporosis treatment during the pandemic. RESULTS: The use of standard screening procedures to assess for osteoporosis and fracture risk declined dramatically early in the pandemic, while rates of fragility fractures were largely unchanged. COVID-19, its treatments, and public health measures to prevent viral spread are each likely to negatively affect bone health. Osteoporosis treatments are not known to increase risk of adverse events from COVID-19, and pre-clinical data suggests possible beneficial effects of some therapies. Vitamin D deficiency is clearly associated with adverse outcomes from COVID-19, but it remains unclear whether vitamin D supplementation may improve outcomes. Osteoporosis treatment should be continued whenever possible, and recommendations for substituting therapies, if required, are available. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has decreased screening and disrupted treatment for osteoporosis. Osteoporosis medications are safe and effective during the pandemic and should be continued whenever possible.

In fact, health policy-makers could manage the problem of the regional spread of an epidemic, by organizing many vaccination campaigns, or by suggesting other defensive strategies such as blocking movement of people coming from borders of regions at high-risk of infection and entering very controlled regions or with insignificant infection rate. Further, we introduce in the discrete SIR systems, two control variables which represent the effectiveness rates of vaccination and travel-blocking operation. We focus in our study to control the outbreaks of an epidemic that affects a hypothetical population belonging to a specific region. Firstly, we analyze the epidemic model when the control strategy is based on the vaccination control only, and secondly, when the travel-blocking control is added. The multi-points boundary value problems, associated to the optimal control problems studied here, are obtained based on a discrete version of Pontryagins maximum principle, and resolved numerically using a progressive-regressive discrete scheme that converges following an appropriate test related to the Forward-Backward Sweep Method on optimal control.","output":"On the analysis of a multi-regions discrete SIR epidemic model: an optimal control approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In social insects, collective choices between food sources are based on self-organized mechanisms where information about resources are locally processed by the foragers. Such a collective decision emerges from the competition between pheromone trails leading to different resources but also between the recruiting stimuli emitted by successful foragers at nest entrances. In this study, we investigated how an additional nest entrance influences the ability of Myrmica rubra ant colonies to exploit two food sources of different quality (1M and 0.1M sucrose solution) and to select the most rewarding one. We found that the mobilisation of workers doubled in two-entrance nests compared to one-entrance nests but that ants were less likely to reach a food source once they exited the nest. Moreover, the collective selection of the most rewarding food source was less marked in two-entrance nests, with foragers distributing themselves evenly between the two feeders. Ultimately, multiple nest entrances reduced the foraging efficiency of ant colonies that consumed significantly less sugar out of the two available resources. Our results highlight that the nest structure, more specifically the number of nest entrances, can impede the ant's ability to process information about environmental opportunities and to select the most rewarding resource. This study opens new insights on how the physical interface between the nest interior and the outside environment can act upon collective decision-making and foraging efficiency in self-organized insect societies.","output":"Foraging through multiple nest holes: An impediment to collective decision-making in ants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"mRNA vaccines have tremendous potential to fight against cancer and viral diseases due to superiorities in safety, efficacy and industrial production. In recent decades, we have witnessed the development of different kinds of mRNAs by sequence optimization to overcome the disadvantage of excessive mRNA immunogenicity, instability and inefficiency. Based on the immunological study, mRNA vaccines are coupled with immunologic adjuvant and various delivery strategies. Except for sequence optimization, the assistance of mRNA-delivering strategies is another method to stabilize mRNAs and improve their efficacy. The understanding of increasing the antigen reactiveness gains insight into mRNA-induced innate immunity and adaptive immunity without antibody-dependent enhancement activity. Therefore, to address the problem, scientists further exploited carrier-based mRNA vaccines (lipid-based delivery, polymer-based delivery, peptide-based delivery, virus-like replicon particle and cationic nanoemulsion), naked mRNA vaccines and dendritic cells-based mRNA vaccines. The article will discuss the molecular biology of mRNA vaccines and underlying anti-virus and anti-tumor mechanisms, with an introduction of their immunological phenomena, delivery strategies, their importance on Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related clinical trials against cancer and viral diseases.

To this end, we develop a novel microcantilever immunosensor using nanobodies (Nbs) as receptors. As the smallest antibody (Ab) entity comprising an intact antigen-binding site, Nbs achieve dense receptor layers and short distances between antigen-binding regions and sensor surfaces, which significantly elevate the generation and transmission of surface stress. Owing to the inherent thiol group at the C-terminus, Nbs are covalently immobilized on microcantilever surfaces in directed orientation via one-step reaction, which further enhances the stress generation. For microcantilever-based nanomechanical sensor, these advantages dramatically increase the sensor sensitivity. Thus, Nb-functionalized microcantilevers can detect picomolar concentrations of tumor markers with three orders of magnitude higher sensitivity, when compared with conventional Ab-functionalized microcantilevers. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates an ultrasensitive, label-free, rapid, and low-cost method for tumor marker detection. Moreover, interestingly, we find Nb inactivation on sensor interfaces when using macromolecule blocking reagents. The adsorption-induced inactivation is presumably caused by the change of interfacial properties, due to binding site occlusion upon complex coimmobilization formations. Our findings are generalized to any coimmobilization methodology for Nbs and, thus, for the construction of high-performance immuno-surfaces.

RECENT FINDINGS SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted efficiently between persons through respiratory droplets and direct and indirect contact. The significance of airborne droplet nuclei in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community setting is less clear. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and live viral particles may also be detected in other bodily fluids. Outbreaks have been reported in families, nursing homes, markets, restaurants, churches, shipping vessels, gyms, and healthcare facilities. Nonpharmaceutical preventive measures at both the community and individual levels are essential for reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

The empirical basis of the study is represented by the statistical data of the healthcare sector of European countries, generalization of the practice of vaccination. In the study, we use international and European regulatory legal acts and documents in the field of human rights, national legislation of foreign countries. CONCLUSION Conclusions: Vaccination represents an important component of the fundamental right to health. International legal acts on the human rights regulation, in particular the right to health, do not provide an unambiguous answer to the question of whether vaccination is the right or responsibility of a person, which has resulted in the existence of a wide range of vaccination policies and models. The existence of a wide range of policies and practices in States Parties to the Convention makes permissible the application of more imperative approaches to immunization, in particular, in cases where voluntary vaccination is not sufficient to ensure the threshold of herd immunity. In most countries, vaccination against COVID-19 is carried out voluntarily, whereas the complication of the epidemiological situation has resulted in following the path of introducing mandatory vaccination in some countries, both with regard to certain population categories (France, Greece, Russia, Ukraine) and the entire population (Tajikistan, Turkmenistan).","output":"VACCINATION IN THE SYSTEM OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS: IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study analyses the composition and evolution of carbon dioxide emissions from the tourism industry in Heilongjiang Province and its 12 regions by the tourism consumption stripping coefficient method and calculates the decoupling relationship between the carbon dioxide emissions and economic growth of tourism from 2010 to 2019.

There is limited literature associated with this topic and we sought to explore the factors that attract generation Z (those born 1995C2010) to a potential career in podiatry. METHOD: A qualitative design framework underpinned by phenomenological principles used four focus groups over a two-year period to generate data from participants at University and in Further Education. Focus group conversations were led by external facilitator, recorded, independently transcribed verbatim and anonymised prior to thematic analysis. This was followed by external, independent verification of themes. RESULTS: Four main themes were determined from the analysis i) a lack of awareness of podiatry; ii) podiatry: accessible course, accessible career; iii) career status; iv) breadth/opportunity of the scope of practice. Both positive and negative experiences were reported and highlighted key gaps in how the attractiveness of a career in podiatry is portrayed.

We assume that with this study, we can identify potential changes in posterior segment structures and posterior segment vascular density of people who received CoronaVac vaccine with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) device. MATERIAL METHOD: Forty healthcare professionals who applied to the Health Sciences University Antalya Training and Research Hospital Ophthalmology Clinic for routine eye control were included in the study. The subjects who do not have any systemic condition and would be administered CoronaVac vaccine were chosen to assess. OCTA images of the patients before and within 1 week after vaccination were captured, then retinal and optic disc vascular values, foveal avascular zone (FAZ), choriocapillary blood flow (CBF), subfoveal choroidal thickness (SCT) and retinal thickness were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Two of the 40 patients had burning and stinging in the eye (5%), two of the 40 patients had redness (5%) and itching (5%) in the eye. 36 patients did not have any ocular symptoms.No statistically significant difference was found in the retinal and optic disc vascular density values, FAZ, CBF, SCT and retinal thickness values of the patients before and after vaccination.

Common triggers that lead to poor asthma control and exacerbations include respiratory viruses, aeroallergens, house dust, molds, and other organic and inorganic substances. Increasingly recognized non-allergen triggers include tobacco smoke, small particulate matter (eg, PM2.5), and volatile organic compounds.

This article will interpret the methods for the guideline development, the recommendations/good practice statements on screening and treatment to prevent cervical cancer (including the age to start/stop screening, screening methods, screening interval, the management of screen-positive women and treatment of the precancerous lesions, etc.) and its impact globally, providing reference for the updates of guideline and policy making on cervical cancer prevention and control in China.","output":"[Interpretation of\\"WHO guideline for screening and treatment of cervical pre-cancer lesions for cervical cancer prevention, second edition\\"]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Elderly people account for more than 9% of the global population, and more than 6% of the Indian population Covid-19 has badly affected the older population, identification of risk factors for severe disease and early intervention results in reduced mortality Older adults may have a varied spectrum of presentation which ranges from mild to severe disease Milder diseases are more in older adults without prior comorbidities whereas severity increases with increase in number of illness Till date there is no definitive treatment and vaccines are also at different stages of trial only preventive methods and early detection of cases are important tools for fighting this pandemic Dedicated centre's for elder care as well as trained geriatricians are very few in India Prevention should be the most important strategy for older adults Follow social distancing and maintain a distance of 1 meter from others even if you are healthy Wash hands repeatedly with soap and water or use hand sanitizer and generous use of masks Older adults should be encouraged to take their regular medication and the baseline disease should be under controlled Frequent teleconsultation from the primary physician should be done repeatedly to identify the symptoms and also control of baseline disease Considering Covid-19 increased mortality and severity in the older population we are providing practical suggestions for family physicians while managing elderly Covid patients","output":"Health care of the elderly during Covid-19 pandemic-All a family physician should know"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The vaccine distribution chains in several low- and middle-income countries are not adequate to facilitate the rapid delivery of high volumes of thermosensitive COVID-19 mRNA vaccines at the required low and ultra-low temperatures. COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are currently distributed along with temperature monitoring devices to track and identify deviations from predefined conditions throughout the distribution chain. These temperature readings can feed into computational models to quantify mRNA vaccine critical quality attributes (CQAs) and the remaining vaccine shelf life more accurately. Here, a kinetic modelling approach is proposed to quantify the stability-related CQAs and the remaining shelf life of mRNA vaccines. The CQA and shelf-life values can be computed based on the conditions under which the vaccines have been distributed from the manufacturing facilities via the distribution network to the vaccination centres. This approach helps to quantify the degree to which temperature excursions impact vaccine quality and can also reduce vaccine wastage. In addition, vaccine stock management can be improved due to the information obtained on the remaining shelf life of mRNA vaccines. This model-based quantification of mRNA vaccine quality and remaining shelf life can improve the deployment of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to low- and middle-income countries.","output":"Stability Modelling of mRNA Vaccine Quality Based on Temperature Monitoring throughout the Distribution Chain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary function testing (PFT) allows for quantitative analysis of lung function.

This epidemic is believed to have disappeared ten years after it started, and it remained from 1916-1927. Since then, only a few sporadic cases have been reported, but previously, they happened in occasional and epidemics forms. Two pioneers in describing the cases were Jean-Ren Cruchet and his collaborators, and Constantin Von Economo. The firsts described diffuse symptomatology, \\"sub-acute encephalomyelitis.\\" However, the reports by the Austrian aristocrat had a localized aspect which was admitted by him as a new disease, \\"Encephalitis lethargica\\" (EL). In his suppositions, based on clinical and anatomopathological material analysis, von Economo found distinct centers for sleep, in the rostral hypothalamus, and wakefulness, posterior hypothalamus. He plays an essential role in new achievements about EL and sleep neurobiology comprehension. These basic structural sleep-arousal regulatory neural systems had a lasting impact on contemporary sleep research, unfolded initially mainly by Frdric Bremer, Giuseppe Moruzzi, and Horace Winchell Magoun, based on a passive theory of sleep induction. The lasts arrived at the conception of \\"diffuse\\" and \\"unspecific\\" ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) of the brain stem.

Intrapulmonary p63(+) progenitor cells, a rare cell type in mice but potentially encompassing more numerous classic basal cells in humans, are activated in such severe injury settings, proliferating and migrating into the injured alveolar parenchyma, providing a short-term emergency benefit. While the fate of these cells is controversial, most studies indicate that they represent a maladaptive repair pathway with a fate restriction toward airway cell types, rarely differentiating into AT2 or AT1 cells.

CD40 is a co-stimulatory molecule present on various immune and non-immune cells in the plaques and is linked to inflammation and plaque instability. We hypothesize that a 89Zr-labeled anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb) tracer has the potential to bind to cells present in atherosclerotic lesions and that CD40 Positron Emission Tomography (PET) can contribute to the detection of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque lesions. To study this, wild-type (WT) and ApoE-/- mice were fed a high cholesterol diet for 14 weeks to develop atherosclerosis. Mice were injected with [89Zr]Zr-anti-CD40 mAb and the aortic uptake was evaluated and quantified using PET/Computed Tomography (CT) imaging. Ex vivo biodistribution was performed post-PET imaging and the uptake in the aorta was assessed with autoradiography and compared with Oil red O staining to determine the tracer potential to detect atherosclerotic plaques. On day 3 and 7 post injection, analysis of [89Zr]Zr-anti-CD40 mAb PET/CT scans showed a more pronounced aortic signal in ApoE-/- compared to WT mice with an increased aorta-to-blood uptake ratio. Autoradiography revealed [89Zr]Zr-anti-CD40 mAb uptake in atherosclerotic plaque areas in ApoE-/- mice, while no signal was found in WT mice. Clear overlap was observed between plaque areas as identified by Oil red O staining and autoradiography signal of [89Zr]Zr-anti-CD40 mAb in ApoE-/- mice. In this proof of concept study, we showed that PET/CT with [89Zr]Zr-anti-CD40 mAb can detect atherosclerotic plaques.

Previous studies indicated that the younger generation stigmatizes the older generation as unworthy during the COVID-19 pandemic (Meisner, 2021). However, there is no study looking at how older adults perceive themselves as threats to society during this time of the pandemic. Thus, our study aimed to understand the varying trend of older adults awareness as a threat to society in association with socio-economic profiles before and during the pandemic. Method: This study included 637 Korean older adults who answered the older generations threats to society from 2018 to 2020. We used Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to categorize participants into different subgroups that shared distinct patterns of threats to society. Multinomial logistic regression examined how the subgroups in threats to society were associated with socio-demographic characteristics in each year. Results: For three waves, three clusters of threats to society (low, mid, and high) were identified. Although the mid-level of threat remained the same (60% of the sample for three years), the high level of threats has been doubled in 2019 (25%) compared to 2018 (11%) and 2020 (13%). Regarding the associated socio-demographic characteristics with threats to society, those who being female in 2018 and younger age in 2020 were more likely to be associated with mid-level of threats to society.

We tested whether a combination of aliskiren and amlodipine is superior to each monotherapy in early control of blood pressure without excess of adverse events, and if initial control by monotherapy impairs subsequent control by combination therapy. METHODS We did a double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, superiority trial at 146 primary and secondary care sites in ten countries, with enrolment from Nov 28, 2008, to July 15, 2009. Patients eligible for enrolment had essential hypertension, were aged 18 years or older, and had systolic blood pressure between 150 and 180 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:2) to treatment with 150 mg aliskiren plus placebo, 5 mg amlodipine plus placebo, or 150 mg aliskiren plus 5 mg amlodipine. Random assignment was through a central interactive voice response system and treatment allocation was masked from the patients. From 16-32 weeks, all patients received combination therapy with 300 mg aliskiren plus 10 mg amlodipine. Our primary endpoints, assessed on an intention-to-treat basis (ie, in patients who received the allocated treatment), were the adjusted mean reduction in systolic blood pressure from baseline over 8 to 24 weeks, and then the final reduction at 24 weeks. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00797862. FINDINGS 318 patients were randomly assigned to aliskiren, 316 to amlodipine, and 620 to aliskiren plus amlodipine. 315 patients initially allocated to aliskiren, 315 allocated to amlodipine, and 617 allocated to aliskiren plus amlodipine were available for analysis. Patients given initial combination therapy had a 65 mm Hg (95% CI 53 to 77) greater reduction in mean systolic blood pressure than the monotherapy groups (p<00001). At 24 weeks, when all patients were on combination treatment, the difference was 14 mm Hg (95% CI -005 to 29; p=0059). Adverse events caused withdrawal of 85 patients (14%) from the initial aliskiren plus amlodipine group, 45 (14%) from the aliskiren group, and 58 (18%) from the amlodipine group. Adverse events were peripheral oedema, hypotension, or orthostatic hypotension.

Being exposed for several working hours per day to infected patients, nurses dealing with COVID-19 face several issues that lead to physical/psychological breakdown. This study focused on burnout and its associated factors in nurses working in an Italian University Hospital during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. We designed a web-based cross-sectional study addressed to nurses working at the University Hospital in Foggia, Italy. The online questionnaire was organized in sections aimed at collecting demographic and occupational variables, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OBI). Two hundred and ninety-three nurses agreed to participate. According to MBI, we reported moderate/high emotional exhaustion in 76.5%, depersonalization in 50.2%, and personal gratification in 54.6% of participants. COVID-19-related burnout measured by OBI resulted medium/high in 89.1% of participants. Among demographic and occupational factors, a multivariate regression analysis identified emotional support, consideration of leaving job, and workload as predictive of burnout in nurses. In conclusion, this study suggests that the improvement of employer and family support to nurses, as well as reduction of workload and job-related stress, would contribute to reducing burnout in nurses during COVID-19 pandemics.","output":"Factors Related to Nurses' Burnout during the First Wave of Coronavirus Disease-19 in a University Hospital in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we present the results of the digital competence assessment survey for language teachers. The survey assessed how language teachers use digital technologies, their attitude towards these technologies, their related skills and competencies, their satisfaction and training needs, and the institutional support they receive. In total, 283 language teachers from 43 countries participated in the survey. The data were collected in 2019. The results indicate that language teachers use various computer-assisted language learning instructional methods. They generally consider that digital technologies are beneficial for the classroom. The lack of training prevents them from using specific technology-based methodologies, in contrast to the lack of technical infrastructure. The majority of the participants are not satisfied with their level of digital language teaching expertise. Two-thirds of those who receive digital competency training at their organizations, report that the training sessions happen irregularly or rarely. At the same time, the majority of the teachers confirm these training to be effective and the skills they received are applied in practice. We discuss the results of the survey in relation to the previous research, policies and practical challenges of the digitalization of language education. The major contribution of the paper is a representation of the teachers perspective on the role of digital technologies in their practice.

However, there are still two unsolved issues hindering the practice. First, collected datasets for model training are often imbalanced, with a considerably smaller proportion of users tested positive, making it harder to learn representative and robust features. Second, deep learning models are generally overconfident in their predictions. Clinically, false predictions aggravate healthcare costs. Estimation of the uncertainty of screening would aid this. To handle these issues, we propose an ensemble framework where multiple deep learning models for sound-based COVID-19 detection are developed from different but balanced subsets from original data. As such, data are utilized more effectively compared to traditional up-sampling and down-sampling approaches: an AUC of 0.74 with a sensitivity of 0.68 and a specificity of 0.69 is achieved. Simultaneously, we estimate uncertainty from the disagreement across multiple models.

Methods: This study enrolled 157 children with severe CAP admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). At ICU admission, the levels of HBP and other biomarkers, including C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin, white blood cells, neutrophil percentage, and D-dimer, were determined. Results: Of the enrolled patients, 106 developed RF (35 with RF at enrollment and 71 with RF after enrollment), while 51 did not developed RF. The number of patients progressing to sepsis in those with or without RF were 34 (21 with severe sepsis) and 14, respectively. The plasma level of HBP at admission was more than eightfold higher than the upper normal value. HBP, IL-6, and D-dimer could significantly predict the development of RF, and a high level of HBP (odds ratio = 1.008, 95% confidence interval: 1.003C1.013) was independently associated with the development of RF in this population. Compared with other biomarkers, HBP was the best indicator of progression to severe sepsis, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85, the best specificity at 96.30%, and a positive predictive value of 92.86% at the optimal cut-off value of 340.29 ng/mL.

This study aimed to examine associations between complement system activity and development of severe acute kidney injury (AKI) among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this multicenter, international study, complement as well as inflammatory and thrombotic parameters were analyzed in COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization at one US and two Hungarian centers. The primary endpoint was development of severe AKI defined by KDIGO stage 2+3 criteria, while the secondary endpoint was need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Complement markers with significant associations with endpoints were then correlated with a panel of inflammatory and thrombotic biomarkers and assessed for independent association with outcome measures using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 131 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (median age 66 [IQR, 54C75] years; 54.2% males) were enrolled, 33 from the US, and 98 from Hungary. There was a greater prevalence of complement over-activation and consumption in those who developed severe AKI and need for RRT during hospitalization. C3a/C3 ratio was increased in groups developing severe AKI (3.29 vs. 1.71; p < 0.001) and requiring RRT (3.42 vs. 1.79; p < 0.001) in each cohort. Decrease in alternative and classical pathway activity, and consumption of C4 below reference range, as well as elevation of complement activation marker C3a above the normal was more common in patients progressing to severe AKI. In the Hungarian cohort, each standard deviation increase in C3a (SD = 210.1) was independently associated with 89.7% increased odds of developing severe AKI (95% CI, 7.6C234.5%). Complement was extensively correlated with an array of inflammatory biomarkers and a prothrombotic state. CONCLUSION: Consumption and dysregulation of complement system is associated with development of severe AKI in COVID-19 patients and could represent a promising therapeutic target for reducing thrombotic microangiopathy in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Complement Levels at Admission Reflecting Progression to Severe Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess impact of personal protective equipment (PPE) on healthcare providers (HCPs) in caring for COVID-19 patients.

Quantifying global migration is, however, challenging because of poor recording, privacy issues and residence status. This is particularly critical for some classes of migrants involved in stigmatised, unregulated or illegal activities. Escorting services or high-end prostitution are well-paid activities that attract workers all around the world. In this paper, we study international migration patterns of sex-workers by using network methods. Using an extensive international online advertisement directory of escorting services and information about individual escorts, we reconstruct a migrant flow network where nodes represent either origin or destination countries. The links represent the direct routes between two countries. The migration network of sex-workers shows different structural patterns than the migration of the general population. The network contains a strong core where mutual migration is often observed between a group of high-income European countries, yet Europe is split into different network communities with specific ties to non-European countries. We find non-reciprocal relations between countries, with some of them mostly offering while others attract workers. The Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDPc) is a good indicator of country attractiveness for incoming workers and service rates but is unrelated to the probability of emigration. The median financial gain of migrating, in comparison to working at the home country, is [Formula: see text] . Only sex-workers coming from [Formula: see text] of the countries have financial gains with migration and average gains decrease with the GDPc of the country of origin.

Animal factors such as the number of immunologically protected individuals influence the number of individuals that a potential pathogen is able to infect, as well as the speed of spread through a population. Pathogens differ in their virulence and contagiousness. In addition, pathogens have various methods of transmission that impact how they interact with a host population. A cattle population's environment includes its housing type, animal density, air quality, and exposure to mud or dust and other health antagonists such as parasites and stress; these environmental factors influence the innate immunity of a herd by their impact on immunosuppression. In addition, a herd's environment also dictates the animal flow or contact and mixing patterns of potentially infectious and susceptible animals. Biosecurity is the attempt to keep infectious agents away from a herd, state, or country, and to control the spread of infectious agents within a herd. Infectious agents (bacteria, viruses, or parasites) alone are seldom able to cause disease in cattle without contributing factors from other infectious agents and/or the cattle's environment. Therefore to develop biosecurity plans for infectious disease in cattle, veterinarians must consider the pathogen, as well as environmental and animal factors.","output":"Epidemiology and disease control in everyday beef practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The End Tuberculosis (TB) Strategy of the World Health Organization highlights the need for patient-centered care and social protection measures that alleviate the financial hardships faced by many TB patients. In China, TB treatments are paid for by earmarked government funds, social health insurance, medical assistance for the poor, and out-of-pocket payments from patients. As part of Phase III of the China-Gates TB project, this paper introduces multi-source financing of TB treatment in the three provinces of China and analyzes the challenges of moving towards universal coverage and its implications of multi-sectoral engagement for TB care. MAIN TEXT: The new financing policies for TB treatment in the three provinces include increased reimbursement for TB outpatient care, linkage of TB treatment with local poverty alleviation programs, and use of local government funds to cover some costs to reduce out-of-pocket expenses. However, there are several challenges in reducing the financial burdens faced by TB patients. First, medical costs must be contained by reducing the profit-maximizing behaviors of hospitals. Second, treatment for TB and multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) is only available at county hospitals and city or provincial hospitals, respectively, and these hospitals have low reimbursement rates and high co-payments. Third, many patients with TB and MDR-TB are at the edge of poverty, and therefore ineligible for medical assistance, which targets extremely poor individuals. In addition, the local governments of less developed provinces often face fiscal difficulties, making it challenging to use of local government funds to provide financial support for TB patients. We suggest that stakeholders at multiple sectors should engage in transparent and responsive communications, coordinate policy developments, and integrate resources to improve the integration of social protection schemes. CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese government is examining the establishment of multi-source financing for TB treatment by mobilization of funds from the government and social protection schemes. These efforts require strengthening the cooperation of multiple sectors and improving the accountability of different government agencies. All key stakeholders must take concrete actions in the near future to assure significant progress toward the goal of alleviating the financial burden faced by TB and MDR-TB patients.

Since time-sensitive thrombolysis is essential for reducing morbidity and mortality in acute stroke, any delays due to the pandemic can have serious consequences. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records for patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke at a comprehensive stroke center in MarchCApril 2020 (the early months of COVID-19) and compared to the same time period in 2019. Stroke metrics such as incidence, time to arrival, and immediate outcomes were assessed. Results: There were 48 acute ischemic strokes (of which 7 were transfers) in MarchCApril 2020 compared to 64 (of which 12 were transfers) in 2019. The average last known well to arrival time (SD) for stroke codes was 1,041 (1682.1) min in 2020 and 554 (604.9) min in 2019. Of the patients presenting directly to the ED with a known last known well time, 27.8% (10/36) presented in the first 4.5 h in 2020, in contrast to 40.5% (15/37) in 2019. Patients who died comprised 10.4% of the stroke cohort in 2020 (5/48) compared to 6.3% in 2019 (4/64). Conclusions: During the first 2 months of COVID-19, there were fewer overall stroke cases who presented to our hospital, and of these cases, there was delayed presentation in comparison to the same time period in 2019.

Co-located (or face-to-face) collaboration (CC) analytics gained momentum with the advent of sensor technology. Most of these works have used the audio modality to detect the quality of CC. The CC quality can be detected from simple indicators of collaboration such as total speaking time or complex indicators like synchrony in the rise and fall of the average pitch. Most studies in the past focused on how group members talk (i.e., spectral, temporal features of audio like pitch) and not what they talk. The what of the conversations is more overt contrary to the how of the conversations. Very few studies studied what group members talk about, and these studies were lab based showing a representative overview of specific words as topic clusters instead of analysing the richness of the content of the conversations by understanding the linkage between these words. To overcome this, we made a starting step in this technical paper based on field trials to prototype a tool to move towards automatic collaboration analytics. We designed a technical setup to collect, process and visualize audio data automatically. The data collection took place while a board game was played among the university staff with pre-assigned roles to create awareness of the connection between learning analytics and learning design. We not only did a word-level analysis of the conversations, but also analysed the richness of these conversations by visualizing the strength of the linkage between these words and phrases interactively. In this visualization, we used a network graph to visualize turn taking exchange between different roles along with the word-level and phrase-level analysis. We also used centrality measures to understand the network graph further based on how much words have hold over the network of words and how influential are certain words. Finally, we found that this approach had certain limitations in terms of automation in speaker diarization (i.e., who spoke when) and text data pre-processing. Therefore, we concluded that even though the technical setup was partially automated, it is a way forward to understand the richness of the conversations between different roles and makes a significant step towards automatic collaboration analytics.","output":"Towards Automatic Collaboration Analytics for Group Speech Data Using Learning Analytics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) including school closures, workplace closures and social distancing policies have been employed worldwide to reduce transmission and prevent local outbreaks. However, transmission and the effectiveness of NPIs depend strongly on age-related factors including heterogeneities in contact patterns and pathophysiology. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study, we develop a branching process model for assessing the risk that an infectious case arriving in a new location will initiate a local outbreak, accounting for the age distribution of the host population. We show that the risk of a local outbreak depends on the age of the index case, and we explore the effects of NPIs targeting individuals of different ages. Social distancing policies that reduce contacts outside of schools and workplaces and target individuals of all ages are predicted to reduce local outbreak risks substantially, whereas school closures have a more limited impact. In the scenarios considered here, when different NPIs are used in combination the risk of local outbreaks can be eliminated. We also show that heightened surveillance of infectious individuals reduces the level of NPIs required to prevent local outbreaks, particularly if enhanced surveillance of symptomatic cases is combined with efforts to find and isolate nonsymptomatic infected individuals. Our results reflect real-world experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which combinations of intense NPIs have reduced transmission and the risk of local outbreaks.

METHODS The study population comprised eligible consecutive patients who underwent TEO(?) under spinal anaesthesia with curative or palliative intent for rectal neoplasms larger than 20 mm in diameter or for recurrent lesions of any size. The primary endpoints were feasibility and safety; secondary endpoints were postoperative pain, as measured on a visual analogue scale, heart rate, systolic and diastolic BP, opioid requested, postoperative nausea or vomiting, and urinary retention. RESULTS The study included 50 patients (median age 70 years; 29 men and 21 women). No intraoperative complications occurred. The median duration of operation was 60 (range 20-165) min.

Yet, there is growing evidence of their specific distress associated with facing multiple abrupt changes and the need for rapid adaptation to a variety of academic, social, and financial challenges. The extent of their exposure to COVID-19 media and the associated media-related stress may further impair students perceived coping. Objective: This study assessed COVID-19-related functional difficulties and perceived coping among higher education students in Israel and explored the moderating role played by media coverage of the pandemic in inducing stress and exacerbating COVID-19-related difficulties in perceived coping among students. Method: Data was collected from 7,446 students from seven academic centres in Israel through online questionnaires about four to six weeks after the outbreak of the pandemic in Israel. Results: The findings showed positive associations between COVID-19-related difficulties, media exposure, media-related stress, and decreased levels of perceived coping with the pandemic. Moreover, media-related stress (but not the level of media exposure) moderated the relationship between COVID-19-related difficulties and perceived coping: the associations were significantly stronger for students reporting high media-related stress in comparison to individuals reporting low media-related stress. Conclusions: These results highlight the specific role of media-related stress and the need to distinguish this risk factor from the global impact of exposure to media coverage. The need for self-monitoring of the subjective level of stress associated with media exposure should be part of the psychoeducation efforts provided by public health authorities for promoting self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 related difficulties and perceived coping among university and college students: the moderating role of media-related exposure and stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Research on patient characteristics of telehealth users is relatively new. More studies are needed to understand the characteristics of telehealth users during disasters. This study attempts to bridge this gap and examines patient characteristics of telehealth users compared with nontelehealth users at the Houston VA Medical Center (VAMC) immediately before and after Hurricane Harvey (2017). Methods: Since use of telehealth services reached its peak and gradually declined within 2 weeks after the landfall, the data analyses focused on 14 days before/14 days after Harvey. Two sets of analyses were conducted using chi-square, t test, and one-way analysis of variance: (1) Patient characteristics of telehealth users were compared with nontelehealth users. (2) Patient characteristics were compared between 3 subgroups of telehealth users. Results: Compared with nontelehealth users, telehealth users were older (mean age: 60.8 vs 58.5 years, P < .001) and had a higher mean Nosos health risk score (1.9 vs 1.4, P < .001). They also had a higher mean number of outpatient visits (28.0 vs 19.8, P < .001), higher emergency room use (37% vs 29%, P < .001), and higher rates of hospitalizations (21% vs 13%, P < .001) during the 12 months before Harvey. When compared to less frequent telehealth users, the most frequent telehealth users were the oldest and most medically complex patients.

We chose to quantify the impact in the radiation oncology department of the largest academic center in the hardest hit city in Canada. With the approval of our ethics review board, data on each patient treated from March 13, 2020 to August 10, 2020 were compared to patients treated during the same period in 2019. We compared the case mix, delay from treatment decision to treatment start, and number of fractions per patient. We reviewed prospectively collected information regarding deviations from our usual practice. During the pandemic the caseload was reduced by 12%; this was more pronounced in prostate and CNS tumors. The average number of fractions per patient was reduced from 12.3 to 10.9. This reduction was most marked in prostate, breast, gastro-intestinal, and palliative cases. When physicians were questioned, they reported that 17% of treatment plans deviated from their usual practice because of the pandemic. The most common deviations were related to changes in department policies (77%) vs. patient-specific deviations (20%) or changes requested by the patient (3%). Rare deviations were due to patients contracting COVID-19 (2 patients). At its worse, the wait list contained 27% of patients who had a delay to radiotherapy of more than 28 days.

While China has been able to rapidly eliminate transmission of SARS-CoV-2, Germany - as well as most of Europe and the Americas - is struggling with high numbers of cases and deaths. Objective: We analyse COVID-19 epidemiology and control strategies in China and in Germany, two countries which have chosen profoundly different approaches to deal with the epidemic. Methods: In this narrative review, we searched the literature from 1 December 2019, to 4 December 2020. Results: China and several neighbours (e.g. Australia, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Thailand) have achieved COVID-19 elimination or sustained low case numbers. This can be attributed to: (1) experience with previous coronavirus outbreaks; (2) classification of SARS-CoV-2 in the highest risk category and consequent early employment of aggressive control measures; (3) mandatory isolation of cases and contacts in institutions; (4) broad employment of modern contact tracking technology; (5) travel restrictions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 re-importation; (6) cohesive communities with varying levels of social control.

Due to assumably high radiation doses of the complete protocol, the aim of this study is to examine radiation exposure and to establish diagnostic reference levels (DRLs). METHODS In this retrospective study, dose data of 921 patients with initial CT imaging for suspected acute stroke and dose monitoring with a DICOM header-based tracking and monitoring software were analyzed. Between June 2017 and January 2020, 1655 CT scans were included, which were performed on three different modern multi-slice CT scanners, including 921 NCCT, 465 CTA, and 269 CTP scans. Radiation exposure was reported for CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose-length product (DLP). DRLs were set at the 75th percentile of dose distribution. RESULTS DRLs were assessed for each step (CTDIvol/DLP): NCCT 33.9 mGy/527.8 mGy cm and CTA 13.7 mGy/478.3 mGy cm. Radiation exposure of CTP was invariable and depended on CT device and its protocol settings with CTDIvol 124.9-258.2 mGy and DLP 1852.6-3044.3 mGy cm. CONCLUSION Performing complementary CT techniques such as CTA and CTP for the assessment of acute stroke increases total radiation exposure.

One of the reasons for the rapid spread is that the virus can be transmitted from infected individuals without symptoms. Revealing the pathological features of early-phase COVID-19 pneumonia is important for understanding of its pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to explore the pulmonary pathology of early-phase COVID-19 pneumonia in a patient with a benign lung lesion. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the pathological changes in lung tissue from a 55-year-old female patient with early-phase SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this case, right lower lobectomy was performed for a benign pulmonary nodule. Detailed clinical, laboratory and radiological data were also examined. This patient was confirmed to have preoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection by the use of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and RNA in-situ hybridisation on surgically removed lung tissues. Histologically, COVID-19 pneumonia was characterised by exudative inflammation. The closer to the visceral pleura, the more severe the exudation of monocytes and lymphocytes. Perivascular inflammatory infiltration, intra-alveolar multinucleated giant cells, pneumocyte hyperplasia and intracytoplasmic viral-like inclusion bodies were seen. However, fibrinous exudate and hyaline membrane formation, which were typical pulmonary features of SARS pneumonia, were not evident in this case. Immunohistochemical staining results showed an abnormal accumulation of CD4+ helper T lymphocytes and CD163+ M2 macrophages in the lung tissue. CONCLUSION: The results highlighted the pulmonary pathological changes of early-phase SARS-CoV-2 infection, and suggested a role of immune dysfunction in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"Pulmonary pathology of early-phase COVID-19 pneumonia in a patient with a benign lung lesion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The importance of daylight in homes is widely understood Site Layout Planning for Daylight and Sunlight: A Guide to Good Practice (BR209), Bracknell: BRE Press, 2011 [Extracted from the article] Copyright of Lighting Research & Technology is the property of Sage Publications, Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Opinion: Daylight in homes must be safeguarded"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enveloped viruses such as SAR-CoV-2 are sensitive to temperature and are destroyed by temperatures tolerable to humans. All mammals use fever to deal with infections and heat has been used throughout human history in the form of hot springs, saunas, hammams, steam-rooms, sweat-lodges, steam inhalations, hot mud and poultices to prevent and treat respiratory infections and enhance health and wellbeing. This paper reviews the evidence for using heat to treat and prevent viral infections and discusses potential cellular, physiological and psychological mechanisms of action. In the initial phase of infection, heat applied to the upper airways can support the immune system's first line of defence by supporting muco-ciliary clearance and inhibiting or deactivating virions in the place where they first lodge. This may be further enhanced by the inhalation of steam containing essential oils with anti-viral, mucolytic and anxiolytic properties. Heat applied to the whole body can further support the immune system's second line of defence by mimicking fever and activating innate and acquired immune defences and building physiological resilience. Heat-based treatments also offer psychological benefits by directing focus on positive action, enhancing relaxation and sleep, inducing 'forced-mindfulness', and invoking the power of positive thinking and remembered wellness. Heat is a cheap, convenient and widely accessible therapeutic modality and while no clinical protocols exist for using heat to treat COVID-19, protocols that draw from traditional practices and consider contraindications, adverse effects and infection control measures could be developed and implemented rapidly and inexpensively on a wide scale.

In newborn calves flavonoids may improve health status, but little is known about the systemically availability of flavonoids in calves to exert biological effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the oral bioavailability of the flavonol quercetin, applied either as quercetin aglycone (QA) or as its glucorhamnoside rutin (RU), in newborn dairy calves. Twenty-one male newborn German Holstein calves were fed equal amounts of colostrum and milk replacer according to body weight. On d 2 and 29 of life, 9 mg of quercetin equivalents/kg of body weight, either fed as QA or as RU, or no quercetin (control group) were fed together with the morning meal. Blood samples were taken before and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after feed intake. Quercetin and quercetin metabolites with an intact flavonol structure (isorhamnetin, tamarixetin, and kaempferol) were analyzed in blood plasma after treatment with glucuronidase or sulfatase by HPLC with fluorescence detection. Maximum individual plasma concentration was depicted from the concentration-time-curve on d 2 and 29, respectively. Additional blood samples were taken to measure basal plasma concentrations of total protein, albumin, urea, and lactate as well as pre- and postprandial plasma concentrations of glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, insulin, and cortisol. Plasma concentrations of quercetin and its metabolites were significantly higher on d 2 than on d 29 of life, and administration of QA resulted in higher plasma concentrations of quercetin and its metabolites than RU. The relative bioavailability of total flavonols (sum of quercetin and its metabolites isorhamnetin, tamarixetin, and kaempferol) from RU was 72.5% on d 2 and 49.6% on d 29 when compared with QA (100%). Calves fed QA reached maximum plasma concentrations of total flavonols much earlier than did RU-fed calves. Plasma metabolites and hormones were barely affected by QA and RU feeding in this experiment. Taken together, orally administrated QA resulted in a greater bioavailability of quercetin than RU on d 2 and 29, respectively, and quercetin bioavailability of quercetin and its metabolites differed markedly between calves aged 2 and 29 d.","output":"Bioavailability of the flavonol quercetin in neonatal calves after oral administration of quercetin aglycone or rutin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The research looks into the authoritarian regime survival strategies in Egypt and Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic Furthermore, it examines how the autocratic rulers in both countries dealt with the securitization dilemma caused by the coronavirus outbreak It applies securitization theory and the concept of selective securitization to argue that although both Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's and Recep Tayyip Erdogan's rule were at some point expected to be shaken by the pandemic, the COVID-19 securitization dilemmas had an important role in helping to prolong the autocratic directions of their respective countries Additionally, the article demonstrates that the securitization of the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt and Turkey follows a certain political pattern where every crisis constitutes an opportunity for expanding the regimes' powers at the expense of citizens' rights","output":"Plagues of Egypt - the COVID-19 crisis and the role of securitization dilemmas in the authoritarian regime survival strategies in Egypt and Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interactive analysis systems provide efficient and accessible means by which users of varying technical experience can comfortably manipulate and analyze data using interactive widgets.

Thus, this study aims to provide epidemiological evidence of the changes in smoking behavior among British smokers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and assess the impact of psychosocial factors on these behaviors. METHODS: A nationwide survey of a representative sample of 4075 UK respondents aged >16 years was conducted between 27 April and 24 May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychosocial and demographic variables between different smoking behavior groups were compared using Pearsons (2) test and Cramers V. RESULTS: Among current smokers (n=329), one-quarter (25.2%, n=86) reported smoking more than usual, 50.9% (n=174) reported smoking the same amount, and 20.2% (n=69) reported smoking less. Significant associations were observed between different smoking behavior groups and psychosocial factors. Pearsons (2) test revealed significant differences between different smoking behavior groups in their concerns about mental health (p<0.001), anxiety (p<0.001) and stress (p<0.001), state of low mood (p=0.012), in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) score (p=0.018) and ranking on the Cantril Ladder scale (p<0.001). Many respondents expressed that the pandemic had a more negative impact on their mental health and the impact was more pronounced among those who smoked more.

ILC2 play a key role in lung homeostasis, repair/remodeling of lung structures following injury, and initiation of inflammation as well as more complex roles during the immune response, including the transition from innate to adaptive immunity. Remarkably, dysregulation of this single population has been linked with chronic lung pathologies, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrotic diseases (IPF). Furthermore, ILC2 have been shown to increase following early-life respiratory viral infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV), that may lead to long-term alterations of the lung environment. The detrimental roles of increased ILC2 following these infections may include pathogenic chronic inflammation and/or alterations of the structural, repair, and even developmental processes of the lung. Respiratory viral infections in older adults and patients with established chronic pulmonary diseases often lead to exacerbated responses, likely due to previous exposures that leave the lung in a dysregulated functional and structural state. This review will focus on the role of ILC2 during respiratory viral exposures and their effects on the induction and regulation of lung pathogenesis. We aim to provide insight into ILC2-driven mechanisms that may enhance lung-associated diseases throughout life.

To pave the way for advanced quantitative assays in the future, it is critical to fully understand these circulating forms. METHODS Plasma samples were collected from 8 heart failure (HF) patients and 2 healthy controls. NT-proBNP and proBNP were purified by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by nano-flow liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry.

RESULTS We detected 16 previously unknown circulating fragments of proBNP peptides (9 of which are located in the N-terminal and 7 in the C-terminal region), revealing a more advanced state of degradation than previously known. Two of these fragments are indicative of either unidentified processing modes or a far-reaching C-terminal degradation (or a combination thereof) of the precursor proBNP.

Cellular X-domain associated macrodomain protein/ADP-ribose-1-monophosphatase (Appr-1-pase) activities are also reported in coronaviruses (CoV), including identification of its homologs in alpha and rubella viruses. The present study investigated the role(s) of X-domain residues in HEV replication cycle. In silico analysis showed a high degree of evolutionary conservation of X-domain (a.a. 785C942) a.a. positions wherein the N-terminus residues Asn806, Asn809, His812, Gly815, Gly816, and Gly817 formed a potential catalytic-site homolog of CoVAppr-1-pase. To experimentally test this prediction, X-domain active-site residues were subjected to mutational analysis using the HEV-SAR55 replicon (pSK-GFP). FACS analysis of mutant RNA transfected S10-3 cells showed that Gly816Ala and Gly817Ala constructs completely abrogated HEV replication, similar to their Gly816Val and Gly817Val counterparts. However, Gly815Ala mutant replicated very poorly in contrast to Gly815Val that completely abolished GFP synthesis. Furthermore, while Asn806Ala mutant retained RNA replication, the Asn809Ala and His812Leu mutants showed non-viability. Notably, in a sequential-nucleotide mutation analysis, the dispensability of X-domain in HEV replication at transcriptional level has already been demonstrated (Parvez, 2013b). Taken together, the present data strongly argue for an essential role of X-domain residues (Asn809, His812, Gly816 and Gly817) at post-translational level, indicating its involvement in viral replication. In conclusion, the speculated regulatory role of ORF1 X-domain in HEV replication cycle critically depends on the Asn, Asn, His, Gly, Gly, Gly segment/secondary structure. Nevertheless, further biochemical or biophysical characterizations of HEV X-domain associated Appr-1-pase activity would only confirm its biological significance in virus or host-pathogenesis.","output":"The hepatitis E virus ORF1 X-domain residues form a putative macrodomain protein/Appr-1-pase catalytic-site, critical for viral RNA replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a comprehensive review of the far-field-based methodology of estimation of the effective properties of multi-phase composites that was pioneered by Maxwell in 1873 in the context of effective electrical conductivity of a particle-reinforced material.

RESULTS Forty-nine patients (11.3%) with a median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 11 presented with ILVO and the remainder presented with CLVO and median NIHSS of 15 (p < 0.001). The median groin puncture-to-reperfusion time was 30 vs. 67 min, respectively (p < 0.001). Successful reperfusion was reached in 47 out of 49 ILVO (95.9%) vs. 298 out of 381 CLVO (78.2%; p < 0.005) with less retrieval maneuvers (1.7  2.2 vs. 3.0  2.5; p < 0.001). The favorable outcome at 90 days was 81% in patients with ILVO vs. 29.1% in CLVO (p < 0.001); respective all-cause mortality rates were 6.4 vs. 28.5% (p < 0.001). Periprocedural complications (6.9%) occurred exclusively in CLVO patients (p < 0.05). ILVO was associated with favorable clinical outcome independent of age and NIHSS in multivariate logistic regression both in the anterior (OR 3.6; 95% CI 1.8-6.9; p < 0.001) and posterior circulation (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.8-6.9; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS AIS due to ILVO is frequent and is associated with a nearly threefold higher chance of favorable clinical outcome at 90 days, independent of age and initial NIHSS compared to CLVO.","output":"Incomplete Large Vessel Occlusions in Mechanical Thrombectomy: An Independent Predictor of Favorable Outcome in Ischemic Stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly from Wuhan (China) across the globe, affecting more than 200 countries by mid-2021, with over 190 M reported cases and around 4 M fatalities. During the first year of the pandemic, affected countries implemented a variety of non-pharmaceutical interventions to control virus transmission. In December 2020, countries started administering several authorised vaccines under a limited supply scenario. In this context, a SEIR-type continuous-time deterministic disease model was developed to explore the effect of vaccination in terms of vaccination rate and efficacy, together with varying non-pharmaceutical protection measures, on disease incidence in the initial phase of vaccination. For this, the model incorporates (i) a protection measure including low (self-protection), medium (mobility limitation), high (closure of indoor facilities) and very high (lockdown) protection levels, (ii) quarantine for confirmed cases, and (iii) vaccination rate and efficacy of four type of vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, Astra Zeneca or Janssen). The model was veri[fi]ed and evaluated using the response timeline and vaccination strategies and rates in the Basque Country (N. Spain). Once the model performance was validated, different initial phase (when 30% of the population is vaccinated) vaccination scenarios were simulated, including (i) a realistic vaccine limited supply scenario, and (ii) four potential full vaccine supply scenarios where a unique vaccine type is administered. The Pfizer scenario resulted in the lowest prevalence of infection and cumulative mortality, particularly for low- and medium-level protection rates. However, regardless of the administered vaccine, a high-level protection scenario is the most effective to control the virus transmission and disease mortality in the studied initial phase of vaccination. The model here, which is based on this example, could be easily applied to other regions or countries, modifying the strategies implemented and initial conditions.","output":"Modelling the effect of the interaction between vaccination and non-pharmaceutical measures on COVID-19 incidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this chapter is to explore the implications of COVID-19 to higher education and how universities and colleges can play a critical role in helping shape new ways for the world by adopting environmental sustainability as its academic mission.

MDs undergo progressive skeletal muscle degeneration causing severe health problems that lead to poor life quality, disability and premature death. There are no available therapies to counteract the causes of these diseases and conventional treatments are administered only to mitigate symptoms. Recent understanding on the pathogenetic mechanisms allowed the development of novel therapeutic strategies based on gene therapy, genome editing CRISPR/Cas9 and drug repurposing approaches. Despite the therapeutic potential of these treatments, once the actives are administered, their instability, susceptibility to degradation and toxicity limit their applications. In this frame, the design of delivery strategies based on nanomedicines holds great promise for MD treatments. This review focuses on nanomedicine approaches able to encapsulate therapeutic agents such as small chemical molecules and oligonucleotides to target the most common MDs such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and the Myotonic Dystrophies.

Thus, a new strategy is needed to ensure all COVID-19 positive cases appropriately followed up , to receive the proper medical and psychological support, and to comply with the isolation guidelines. Here, we describe the characteristics and outcome of COVID-19 patients who were managed at home. In addition, we describe the differences between asymptomatic and those with mild symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is descriptive study of all COVID-19 positive cases who were monitored utilizing the home care concept. RESULTS: During the study period from June 8 to October 18, 2020, there was a total of 5368 COVID-19 patients who were referred to the home isolation/monitoring program. Of those, 2397 (45%) were female and 2971 (55%) were male. Of the total cases, 295 (5%) required hospital admission, 45 (1%) were admitted to zone 2 (an intermediate care facility), and the majority 5028 (94%) were continued in the home monitoring program till recovery. Of the total cases, 3137 (59%) were asymptomatic and the remaining 41% were symptomatic. Asymptomatic patients in comparison to symptomatic patients showed significant differences in relation to mean age (+ SD) of 31.5 (+ 18.6) and 46.45 (+ 17.1), respectively (P < 0.001)), gender, being healthcare workers, and the presence of significant medical conditions. However, a logistic regression analysis showed that only age and the presence of diabetes mellitus were associated with the presence of symptoms. The mean age (SD) of those who required hospital admission was higher than those who were continued in home monitoring or cared for in zone 2.

Methods Virus isolation was performed in Vero CCL81 cells and genomic characterization by next generation sequencing. The pathogenicity of the isolate was assessed in Syrian hamster model and compared with B.1 variant. Results B.1.1.28.2 variant was isolated from nasal/throat swabs of international travelers returned to India from United Kingdom and Brazil. The B.1.1.28.2 variant induced body weight loss, viral replication in the respiratory tract, lung lesions and caused severe lung pathology in infected Syrian hamster model in comparison, with B.1 variant infected hamsters. The sera from B.1.1.28.2 infected hamsters efficiently neutralized the D614G variant virus whereas 6-fold reduction in the neutralization was seen in case of D614G variant infected hamsters sera with the B.1.1.28.2 variant. Conclusions B.1.1.28.2 lineage variant could be successfully isolated and characterization could be performed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who had an isolated lesion on the first positive CT were enrolled in this study. The following parameters were recorded for each lesion: sites, sizes, location (peripheral or central), attenuation (ground-glass opacity or consolidation), and other abnormalities (supply pulmonary artery dilation, air bronchogram, interstitial thickening, etc.). The follow-up CT images were compared with the previous CT scans, and the development of the lesions was evaluated. RESULTS: The lesions tended to be peripheral and subpleural. All the lesions exhibited ground-glass opacity with or without consolidation. A higher proportion of supply pulmonary artery dilation (89.13 % [41/46]) and air bronchogram (69.57 % [32/46]) were found. Other ndings included thickening of the intralobular interstitium and a halo sign of ground glass around a solid nodule. Cavitation, calcication or lymphadelopathy were not observed. The reticular patterns were noted from the 14 days after symptoms onset in 7 of 20 patients (45 %). At 22-31 days, the lesions were completely absorbed only in 2 of 7 patients (28.57 %). CONCLUSION: The typical early CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are ground-glass opacity, and located peripheral or subpleural location, and with supply pulmonary artery dilation.

All patients who underwent elective hip and knee arthroplasty were contacted via telephone or emailed surveys. Two-hundred and thirty-five consecutive patients were screened, and 158 agreed to participate. The average age was 65.9  11.5 years, with 51.0% of patients being female. The percentage of participants who underwent total knee, total hip, and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty was 41.4%, 37.6%, and 21.0%, respectively. Survey components assessed demographic data, level of concern and specific concerns about the pandemic, and factors increasing patient comfort in proceeding with surgery. RESULTS: Older age (P = .029) and female sex (P = .004) independently predicted higher concern on multivariate analysis. Race (P = .343), surgical site (knee vs hip, P = .58), and procedure type (primary vs revision, P = .26) were not significantly related to degree of concern.

Here, the aim is to present simple metrics of such precision shielding of people at high risk of death after infection by SARS-CoV-2; demonstrate how they can estimated; and examine whether precision shielding was successfully achieved in the first COVID-19 wave. The shielding ratio, S, is defined as the ratio of prevalence of infection among people in a high-risk group versus among people in a low-risk group. The contrasted risk groups examined here are according to age (70 vs <70 years), and institutionalised (nursing home) setting. For age-related precision shielding, data were used from large seroprevalence studies with separate prevalence data for elderly versus non-elderly and with at least 1000 assessed people70 years old. For setting-related precision shielding, data were analysed from 10 countries where information was available on numbers of nursing home residents, proportion of nursing home residents among COVID-19 deaths and overall population infection fatality rate (IFR). Across 17 seroprevalence studies, the shielding ratio S for elderly versus non-elderly varied between 0.4 (substantial shielding) and 1.6 (substantial inverse protection, that is, low-risk people being protected more than high-risk people). Five studies in the USA all yielded S=0.4C0.8, consistent with some shielding being achieved, while two studies in China yielded S=1.5C1.6, consistent with inverse protection. Assuming 25% IFR among nursing home residents, S values for nursing home residents ranged from 0.07 to 3.1. The best shielding was seen in South Korea (S=0.07) and modest shielding was achieved in Israel, Slovenia, Germany and Denmark. No shielding was achieved in Hungary and Sweden. In Belgium (S=1.9), the UK (S=2.2) and Spain (S=3.1), nursing home residents were far more frequently infected than the rest of the population. In conclusion, the experience from the first wave of COVID-19 suggests that different locations and settings varied markedly in the extent to which they protected high-risk groups. Both effective precision shielding and detrimental inverse protection can happen in real-life circumstances. COVID-19 interventions should seek to achieve maximal precision shielding.","output":"Precision shielding for COVID-19: metrics of assessment and feasibility of deployment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to hyaluronic acid dermal fillers is between 0.3 and 4.25%, mediated by T-lymphocytes.

Twenty-four field isolates of turkey coronavirus (TCoV) from multiple states in the United States were recovered from 1994 to 2010 to determine the genetic relationships among them. The entire spike (S) gene of each TCoV isolate was amplified and sequenced. Pairwise comparisons were performed using the Clustal W program, revealing 90.0 % to 98.4 % sequence identity in the full-length S protein, 77.6 % to 96.6 % in the amino terminus of the S1 subunit (containing one hypervariable region in S1a), and 92.1 % to 99.3 % in the S2 subunit at the deduced amino acid sequence level. The conserved motifs, including two cleavage recognition sequences of the S protein, two heptad repeats, the transmembrane domain, and the Golgi retention signal were identified in all TCoV isolates. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length S gene was used to distinguish North American TCoV isolates from French TCoV isolates. Among the North American TCoV isolates, three distinct genetic groups with 100 % bootstrap support were observed. North Carolina isolates formed group I, Texas isolates formed group II, and Minnesota isolates formed Group III. The S genes of 24 TCoV isolates from the United States remained conserved because they contained predominantly synonymous substitutions.

METHODS From 1 April 2007 through 31 March 2008, we used a low-cost surveillance strategy to identify new onset of respiratory symptoms in patients hospitalized for >72 h and in health care workers in medicine and pediatric wards at 3 public tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh. RESULTS During 46,273 patient-days of observation, we recorded 136 episodes of hospital-acquired respiratory disease, representing 1.7% of all patient hospital admissions; rates by ward ranged from 0.8 to 15.8 cases per 1000 patient-days at risk. We identified 22 clusters of respiratory disease, 3 of which included both patients and health care workers. Of 226 of heath care workers who worked on our surveillance wards, 61 (27%) experienced a respiratory illness during the study period. The cost of surveillance was US$43 per month per ward plus 30 min per day in data collection. CONCLUSIONS Patients on these study wards frequently experienced hospital-acquired respiratory infections, including 1 in every 20 patients hospitalized for >72 h on 1 ward. The surveillance method was useful in calculating rates of hospital-acquired respiratory illness and could be used to enhance capacity to quickly detect outbreaks of respiratory disease in health care facilities where systems for outbreak detection are currently limited and to test interventions to reduce transmission of respiratory pathogens in resource-poor settings.","output":"Rates of hospital-acquired respiratory illness in Bangladeshi tertiary care hospitals: results from a low-cost pilot surveillance strategy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human skin is a significant barrier for protection against pathogen transmission.

This paper presents a six degrees of freedom descending flight simulation of a tiltrotor aircraft represented by the V-22 Osprey, considering the interaction between fluid and a rigid body. That is, an aircraft affects the surrounding flow field by rotating the rotors, and flies with the generated force as thrust. Similarly, an orientation of the airframe is controlled by aerodynamic force which is generated by manipulating the shape. This numerical analysis is a complicated moving boundary problem involving motion of an air-frame or rotation of rotors. As a numerical approach, the Moving Computational Domain (MCD) method in combination with the multi-axis sliding mesh approach is adopted. In the MCD method, the whole computational domain moves with objects in the domain. At this time, fluid flow around the objects is generated by the movement of the boundaries. In addition, this method removes computational space restrictions, allowing an aircraft to move freely within the computational space regardless of a size of a computational grid. The multi-axis sliding mesh approach allows rotating bodies to be placed in a computational grid. Using the above approach, the flight simulation at two different descent rates is performed to reveal a behavior of a tiltrotor aircraft and a state of the surrounding flow field.","output":"Descending Flight Simulation of Tiltrotor Aircraft at Different Descent Rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) contribute to immune defense, yet it is poorly understood how ILCs develop and are strategically positioned in the lung.

The purpose of this study was to determine how the use of digital teaching resources in gross anatomy education changed from before to during Covid-19. MATERIAL/METHODS: Data were obtained from an IRB-approved survey distributed to professional associations and listservs targeting anatomy educators from June to November 2020. Respondents were asked to select the digital resources they used before and during Covid-19. Data were analyzed during the early and latter parts of the pandemic as May-August (T1) and August-December (T2), as well as overall (T3). T2 data were classified into five categories: 2D illustrations, dissection media, interactive software, in-house, and open access. Total usage for each timepoint, the proportions of digital resources, and the 5 categories before and during Covid-19 were compared using McNemar's test with alpha&lt;5%. Data are presented as percent increase (+value) or decrease (-value). RESULTS: 60 and 208 responses were received for T1 and T2, respectively. The total number of digital resources used for anatomy education increased from before to during COVID-19 as seen in the data analysis from T1 (+47%), T2 (+41%), and T3 (+43%) (P0.003). In T1, the use of BlueLink (+122%) and Complete Anatomy (+140%) software increased (P&lt;0.04), while Acland's Anatomy (+68%), Anatomy.TV (+1300%), Complete Anatomy (+89%), and BlueLink (+148%) increased in T2 (P0.03). During T3, the usage of Acland's Anatomy (+60%), Anatomy.TV (+750%), Complete Anatomy (+102%), BlueLink (+143%), and VisibleBody (+100%) increased (P0.03).

Progress was made to increase coverage globally, but vaccine hesitancy and refusal has threatened to erode said increases. The 5C psychological antecedents of vaccination (5C) model provides a validated measure of vaccine hesitancy or confidence to assess individual thoughts and behaviors behind vaccination. Our purpose was to investigate population-level factors that contributed to high and sustained vaccination coverage via interventions in Zambia, Nepal, and Senegal, and alignment with the 5Cs. Methods: FDGs and KIIs were collected at the national, regional, district, health facility, and community levels. We assessed the demand environment, as relayed by participants, and identified interventions that key informants reported as successful for demand generation, then retroactively aligned the interventions with the 5C constructs. Results: Demand was positively correlated with high confidence and collective responsibility. Psychological constraints sometimes impacted demand. Physical constraints created barriers in some communities, particularly difficult to access (i.e., mountainous). Occasionally, physical constraints did not affect vaccination behavior - parents believed the benefits of vaccination worth pursuing. Factors negatively correlated with demand and intent, complacency and calculation, had limited impact. The most critical interventions were: targeted and tailored health education activities (i.e., media partnerships, school outreach); community engagement; community ownership; and involvement of community (i.e., community health workers, leaders, religious figures). Conclusion: We found similar interventions were used to generate demand, and those strategies aligned with the 5C constructs. Categorizing interventions by drivers of demand may help strategic planning and the division of resources; decision makers may choose to implement our suggested interventions. Assessing the 5Cs allows for decision-makers to operationalize demand generation into concrete interventions and policies, and determine the individual impact of these constructs on the population and focus efforts on interventions tailored to a specific need.","output":"Critical interventions for demand generation in Zambia, Nepal, and Senegal with regards to the 5C psychological antecedents of vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV?2 causes a disease spectrum that includes asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infections with subclinical manifestations but which can nevertheless still be potentially contagious.

The first mechanism is the introduction of user referrals. We compare four scenarios for the uptake of CTAs-(1) the p% of individuals that use the CTA are chosen randomly, (2) a smaller initial set of randomly-chosen users each refer a contact to use the CTA, achieving p% in total, (3) a small initial set of randomly-chosen users each refer around half of their contacts to use the CTA, achieving p% in total, and (4) for comparison, an idealised scenario in which the p% of the population that uses the CTA is the p% with the most contacts. Using agent-based epidemiological models incorporating a geometric space, we find that, even when the uptake percentage p% is small, CTAs are an effective tool for mitigating the spread of the epidemic in all scenarios. Moreover, user referrals significantly improve efficacy. In addition, it turns out that user referrals reduce the quarantine load. The second mechanism for increasing the efficacy of CTAs is tuning the severity of quarantine measures. Our modelling shows that using CTAs with mild quarantine measures is effective in reducing the maximum hospital load and the number of people who become ill, but leads to a relatively high quarantine load, which may cause economic disruption. Fortunately, under stricter quarantine measures, the advantages are maintained but the quarantine load is reduced.

Our aim was to use the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a positive control to assess the ability to quantify behavioral changes in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) from smartphone data. METHODS: Eight participants used the Beiwe smartphone application, which passively measured their location during the COVID-19 outbreak. We used an interrupted time series to quantify the effect of the US state of emergency declaration on daily home time and daily distance traveled. RESULTS: After the state of emergency declaration, median daily home time increased from 19.4 (interquartile range [IQR], 15.4-22.0) hours to 23.7 (IQR, 22.2-24.0) hours and median distance traveled decreased from 42 (IQR, 13-83) km to 3.7 (IQR, 1.5-10.3) km. The participant with the lowest functional ability changed behavior earlier. This participant stayed at home more and traveled less than the participant with highest functional ability, both before and after the state of emergency. DISCUSSION: We provide evidence that smartphone-based digital phenotyping can quantify the behavior of people with ALS. Although participants spent large amounts of time at home at baseline, the COVID-19 state of emergency declaration reduced their mobility further. Given participants' high level of daily home time, it is possible that their exposure to COVID-19 could be less than that of the general population.","output":"Smartphone data during the COVID-19 pandemic can quantify behavioral changes in people with ALS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The respiratory epithelium is lined by a tightly balanced fluid layer that allows normal O(2) and CO(2) exchange and maintains surface tension and host defense. To maintain alveolar fluid homeostasis, both the integrity of the alveolarCcapillary barrier and the expression of epithelial ion channels and pumps are necessary to establish a vectorial ion gradient. However, during pulmonary infection, auto- and/or paracrine-acting mediators induce pathophysiological changes of the alveolarCcapillary barrier, altered expression of epithelial Na,K-ATPase and of epithelial ion channels including epithelial sodium channel and cystic fibrosis membrane conductance regulator, leading to the accumulation of edema and impaired alveolar fluid clearance. These mediators include classical pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-, TNF-, interferons, or IL-1 that are released upon bacterial challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Mycoplasma pneumoniae as well as in viral infection with influenza A virus, pathogenic coronaviruses, or respiratory syncytial virus. Moreover, the pro-apoptotic mediator TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, extracellular nucleotides, or reactive oxygen species impair epithelial ion channel expression and function. Interestingly, during bacterial infection, alterations of ion transport function may serve as an additional feedback loop on the respiratory inflammatory profile, further aggravating disease progression. These changes lead to edema formation and impair edema clearance which results in suboptimal gas exchange causing hypoxemia and hypercapnia.

The emergence of new viral strains, together with vaccination and reinfections, are all contributing to a long-term immunity against the deadly virus that has taken over the world since its introduction to humans in late December 2019. The discovery that more than 95 percent of people who recovered from COVID-19 had long-lasting immunity and that asymptomatic people have a different immune response to SARS-CoV-2 than symptomatic people has shifted attention to how our immune system initiates such diverse responses. These findings have provided reason to believe that SARS-CoV-2 days are numbered. Hundreds of research papers have been published on the causes of long-lasting immune responses and variations in the numbers of different immune cell types in COVID 19 survivors, but the main reason of these differences has still not been adequately identified. In this article, we focus on the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which initiates molecular processes that allow our immune system to generate antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

Early diagnosis of suspected patients will play an essential role in preventing further spread of COVID-19. The aim of this review study was to evaluate saliva specimen in comparison to nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimen in studies selected from various databases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To achieve the objective of this study, a systematic literature search was carried out in four databases, namely PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and LILACS. The keywords COVID-19, Nasopharyngeal Swab, and Saliva were utilized via Boolean operators. RESULTS: 14 articles were included in this review study following the eligibility criteria. Based on data presented in studies used in the meta-analysis, there was no significant difference between both specimen types for detection of COVID-19. Heterogeneity test showed that I(2) value was 5.790% (<20%). The effect size (risk ratio) of the 14 studies was 0.951 (<1). CONCLUSION: With the results revealing no significant difference between the two types of specimen in the diagnosis of COVID-19, the use of saliva specimen is preferable for widespread use because it is easily collected without the need for qualified health workers.

In Mexico, the conditions requiring the declaration of a sanitary emergency were reached by the last week of March 2020, and health authorities limited mobility and imposed social isolation were the main strategies to keep the virus from spreading. Thus, daily living conditions changed drastically in a few days, generating a stressful situation characterized by an almost complete lack of mobility, social isolation, and forced full-time interactions with family members. Soon, complaints of sleep disturbances, anxiety, and symptoms of depression were reported. The present study reports the results of an online survey performed during the first two months of isolation. Questionnaires exploring sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression were sent to people who responded to an open invitation. A total of 1230 participants filled out the sleep questionnaire, 812 responded to the anxiety questionnaire, and 814 responded to the depression questionnaire. Both men and women reported poor sleep quality, but women showed a higher proportion (79%) than men (60%); young women were more likely to be affected by social isolation. Concerning anxiety and depression, both sexes reported high similar symptoms.

Bacteriophages, which are only harmful to specific bacterial strains, have been suggested as a feed additive replacing antibiotics. -mannanase, which degrades mannan, is known to promote nutrient digestibility, animal growth, or both, thus improving feed efficiency. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with bacteriophage and -mannanase on health and growth performance in calves. We assigned 36 pre-weaning male Holstein calves to one of four treatments with a 2  2 factorial arrangement: no supplementation, 0.1% -mannanase, 0.1% bacteriophage, and both 0.1% bacteriophage and 0.1% -mannanase supplementation in a starter on a dry matter basis. Compared to unsupplemented, the bacteriophage supplemented group showed a tendency to improve the survival rate without growth promotion. Supplementation of -mannanase, on the other hand, increased the starter intake and the weekly body weight (BW) gain and tended to increase the final BW. Our study indicated that bacteriophage supplementation has a positive effect on survival rate, while -mannanase supplementation improves growth performance in calves. ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with bacteriophage and -mannanase on health and growth performance in calves. Thirty-six pre-weaning male Holstein calves were randomly allocated to one of four dietary treatments with a 2  2 factorial arrangement: no supplementation, 0.1% -mannanase, 0.1% bacteriophage, and both 0.1% bacteriophage and 0.1% -mannanase supplementation in a starter on a dry matter basis. The experiment lasted from 2 weeks before weaning to 8 weeks after weaning. Twenty-two calves survived to the end of the experiment. No interaction was observed between the two different feed additives. The bacteriophage supplementation tended to increase the odds ratio of survival (p = 0.09). The number of Escherichia coli in feces significantly decreased by bacteriophage supplementation one week after weaning. -mannanase supplementation increased the concentrate intake (p < 0.01) and tended to increase the final BW (p = 0.08). Analysis of repeated measures indicated -mannanase supplementation increased weekly body weight gain (p = 0.018). We conclude that bacteriophage supplementation may have a positive effect on calf survival rate, while -mannanase supplementation may increase the growth rate and starter intake by calves just before and after weaning.","output":"Effects of -Mannanase and Bacteriophage Supplementation on Health and Growth Performance of Holstein Calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Spondyloarthropathies (SpA) represent a heterogeneous group of inflammatory arthritides with autoimmune pathogenesis that can affect both adults and children with peculiar features such as enthesitis, sacroiliac joint, and axial involvement.

EXPERT OPINION Given the challenging classification of JSpA, research in this field has been restricted to single subcategories. Little is known of which patients are more likely to develop axial involvement leading to severe spinal damage. Whether TNF inhibitors are capable to prevent or stop disease progression, once started, is yet to be ascertained with structural damage still a matter for research.

Here, we demonstrate that IFN- or - treatment of keratinocytes substantially decreases human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) infection while robustly inducing IFITM1, 2 and 3 expression. However, IFITM1, 2 and 3 overexpression did not inhibit HPV16 infection; rather, IFITM1 and IFITM3 modestly enhanced HPV16 infection in various cell types including primary keratinocytes. Moreover, IFITM1, 2 and 3 did not inhibit infection by two other DNA viruses, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and adenovirus type 5 (Ad5). Taken together, we reveal that the entry of several DNA viruses, including HPV, HCMV, and Ad5 is not affected by IFITM1, 2 and 3 expression.

FINDINGS: Version 7 (searches up to 25 August 2020) included 233 studies with 32 'good' and 'fair' quality studies included in meta-analyses. Fifty-seven studies (24.5%) reported current, former and never smoking status. Recorded smoking prevalence among people with COVID-19 was generally lower than national prevalence. Current compared with never smokers were at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [relative risk (RR) = 0.74, 95% credible interval (CrI) = 0.58-0.93, &#964; = 0.41].

Online social networks are a valuable form of support for older adults, and usage of online social networks during the pandemic may have expanded. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the association between online social networks and fear of COVID-19 among older adults. A convenience sample (n = 239) of adults 60+ years of age in the U.S. completed a 20-minute, online survey. The independent variable utilized the Lubben Social Network Scale (four items), focusing on online support. The dependent variable was measured by the Fear of COVID-19 scale (eight items). Results of ordinary least squares regression show that increased online social network support was significantly associated with decreased fear of COVID-19 (p < 0.05), while holding constant age, sex, race, marital status, education, whether a respondent lives alone, and self-rated health.

However, such structures lack moisture permeability and breathability leading to an uncomfortable, stuffy wearing experience. Here, we propose a novel medical protective clothing material with a superabsorbent layer to enhance moisture absorption. Poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide)/polyvinyl alcohol superabsorbent fibers (PAAAM/PVA fibers) were prepared via wet spinning. And the superabsorbent composite layer was stacked from PAAAM/PVA fibers, bamboo pulp fibers (BPF) and ethylene-propylene side by side fibers (ESF). The novel disposable medical protective composite fabric was obtained through gluing the superabsorbent layer to the inner surface of strong antistatic polypropylene nonwoven fabric. The resultant composite fabric possesses excellent absorption and retention capacity for sweat, up to 12.3 g/g and 63.8%, and a maximum hygroscopic rate of 1.04 g/h, higher than that of the conventional material (only 0.53 g/h). The moisture permeability of the novel material reached 12,638.5 g/(m(2) d), which was 307.6% of the conventional material. The novel material can effectively reduce the humidity inside the protective clothing and significantly improve the comfort of medical staff.","output":"Superabsorbent Fibers for Comfortable Disposable Medical Protective Clothing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 has been declared a pandemic on March 2020, by the World Health Organization.

In particular, patients with advanced CKD constitute a vulnerable population and a challenge in the prevention and control of the disease. Home-based renal replacement therapies offer opportunity to manage patients remotely, thus reducing the likelihood of infection due to direct human interaction. Patients are seen less frequently, limiting the close interaction between patients and healthcare workers who may contract and spread the disease. On the other hand, while home dialysis is reasonable selection at his time due to the advantage of isolation of patients, measures must be assured to implement the program.

ICPEU is a biennial event held by Department of Regional and Urban Planning C Universitas Brawijaya (Malang, Indonesia) since 2013. The conference series has focused on the discussion of sustainable development since the very beginning, as we truly believe that this topic is very relevant to what we, in the field of planning, face at the moment and in the future. In 2013, we started off the discussion with a big question, can planning theory be applied thoroughly in practice? It was a very memorable discussion as we explored many interdisciplinary problems and solutions in planning. We then developed our topic to sustainable development in 2015 as we considered this as an underlying topic for all relevant problems and solutions. Again, the discussion was remarkable. Papers from different countries participated in the event. In 2017, we started publishing our papers on IOP Proceedings, which is a Scopus-indexed form of publication. And in 2019, we raised the topic of bridging the rural-urban development gap-strengthening sustainability goals. We believe that this event at this moment will be more successful than our predecessors. The 5th ICPEU was held on 19th July 2021 with the topic Rural-Urban Connectivity. This topic addressed a concern about spatial equality and sustainability with particular relevance to the pandemic situation. This year, ICPEU was held in a completely different way due to the pandemic. Covid-19 pandemic and travel restrictions did not demotivate us to strengthen our academic community and organize the conference. The current information technology in the form of video conference (webinar) helped us to tackle the distance obstacle. This virtual platform gave us three benefits i.e., 1) made the overall presentations and discussions more efficient, 2) the technology gave us opportunity to effectively communicate with the keynote speakers as well as made all sessions enjoyable for them, and 3) reached more participants. This year we had in total 250 participants including the presenters We organize the conference in the form of plenary session by presenting eight keynote speakers. They talked about the concept and practices of sustainability in a broad range of disciplines including social capital, disaster management, infrastructure, regional development and public policy. The keynote speakers session was followed by panel sessions. All panel presenters had 15 minutes to share their ideas continued with 5 minutes discussion for each presentation. Regarding the panel session, we have received papers from Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, and also Indonesia, discussing and showcasing multi-level efforts in achieving sustainable development from different perspectives. In short, the response that we received has been overwhelmingly positive. We received a total of 83 extended s for this event, and unfortunately, we can only accept 70 selected ones to be published in our upcoming publications.

Volatile organic compounds produced during respiratory infections can cause specific scent imprints, which can be detected by trained dogs with a high rate of precision. METHODS: Eight detection dogs were trained for 1 week to detect saliva or tracheobronchial secretions of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in a randomised, double-blinded and controlled study. RESULTS: The dogs were able to discriminate between samples of infected (positive) and non-infected (negative) individuals with average diagnostic sensitivity of 82.63% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 82.02-83.24%) and specificity of 96.35% (95% CI: 96.31-96.39%). During the presentation of 1012 randomised samples, the dogs achieved an overall average detection rate of 94% (3.4%) with 157 correct indications of positive, 792 correct rejections of negative, 33 incorrect indications of negative or incorrect rejections of 30 positive sample presentations. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings indicate that trained detection dogs can identify respiratory secretion samples from hospitalised and clinically diseased SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals by discriminating between samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and negative controls. This data may form the basis for the reliable screening method of SARS-CoV-2 infected people.","output":"Scent dog identification of samples from COVID-19 patients - a pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 in China in early 2020 provides a rich data source for exploring the ecological determinants of this new infection, which may be of relevance as the pandemic develops. Objectives: Assessing the spread of the COVID-19 across China, in relation to associations between cases and ecological factors including population density, temperature, solar radiation and precipitation. Methods: Open-access COVID-19 case data include 18,069 geo-located cases in China during January and February 2020, which were mapped onto a 0.25 latitude/longitude grid together with population and weather data (temperature, solar radiation and precipitation). Of 15,539 grid cells, 559 (3.6%) contained at least one case, and these were used to construct a Poisson regression model of cell-weeks. Weather parameters were taken for the preceding week given the established 5C7 day incubation period for COVID-19. The dependent variable in the Poisson model was incident cases per cell-week and exposure was cell population, allowing for clustering of cells over weeks, to give incidence rate ratios. Results: The overall COVID-19 incidence rate in cells with confirmed cases was 0.12 per 1,000. There was a single confirmed case in 113/559 (20.2%) of cells, while two grid cells recorded over 1,000 confirmed cases. Weekly means of maximum daily temperature varied from ?28.0C to 30.1C, minimum daily temperature from ?42.4C to 23.0C, maximum solar radiation from 0.04 to 2.74 MJm(?2) and total precipitation from 0 to 72.6 mm. Adjusted incidence rate ratios suggested brighter, warmer and drier conditions were associated with lower incidence. Conclusion: Though not demonstrating cause and effect, there were appreciable associations between weather and COVID-19 incidence during the epidemic in China. This does not mean the pandemic will go away with summer weather but demonstrates the importance of using weather conditions in understanding and forecasting the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Eco-epidemiological assessment of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, JanuaryCFebruary 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The primary aim was to assess the independent influence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on 30-day mortality for patients with a hip fracture. The secondary aims were to determine whether: 1) there were clinical predictors of COVID-19 status; and 2) whether social lockdown influenced the incidence and epidemiology of hip fractures. METHODS: A national multicentre retrospective study was conducted of all patients presenting to six trauma centres or units with a hip fracture over a 46-day period (23 days pre- and 23 days post-lockdown). Patient demographics, type of residence, place of injury, presentation blood tests, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, time to surgery, operation, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, anaesthetic, length of stay, COVID-19 status, and 30-day mortality were recorded. RESULTS: Of 317 patients with acute hip fracture, 27 (8.5%) had a positive COVID-19 test. Only seven (26%) had suggestive symptoms on admission. COVID-19-positive patients had a significantly lower 30-day survival compared to those without COVID-19 (64.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 45.7 to 83.3 vs 91.7%, 95% CI 88.2 to 94.8; p < 0.001). COVID-19 was independently associated with increased 30-day mortality risk adjusting for: 1) age, sex, type of residence (hazard ratio (HR) 2.93; p = 0.008); 2) Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (HR 3.52; p = 0.001); and 3) ASA (HR 3.45; p = 0.004). Presentation platelet count predicted subsequent COVID-19 status; a value of < 217  109/l was associated with 68% area under the curve (95% CI 58 to 77; p = 0.002) and a sensitivity and specificity of 63%. A similar number of patients presented with hip fracture in the 23 days pre-lockdown (n = 160) and 23 days post-lockdown (n = 157) with no significant (all p &#8805; 0.130) difference in patient demographics, residence, place of injury, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, time to surgery, ASA, or management. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 was independently associated with an increased 30-day mortality rate for patients with a hip fracture. Notably, most patients with hip fracture and COVID-19 lacked suggestive symptoms at presentation. Platelet count was an indicator of risk of COVID-19 infection. These findings have implications for the management of hip fractures, in particular the need for COVID-19 testing.

OBJECTIVES: The present cross-sectional meta-research study aimed to assess the availability of open data and metrics of articles pertaining to the COVID-19 outbreak in five high-impact journals. METHODS: All articles regarding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), published in five high-impact journals (Ann Intern Med, BMJ, JAMA, NEJM and Lancet) until March 14, 2020 were retrieved. Metadata (namely the type of article, number of authors, number of patients, citations, errata, news and social media mentions) were extracted for each article in each journal in a systematic way. Google Scholar and Scopus were used for citations and author metrics respectively, and Altmetrics and PlumX were used for news and social media mentions retrieval. The degree of adherence to the PHEIC open data call was also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 140 articles were published until March 14, 2020, mostly opinion papers. Sixteen errata followed these publications. The number of authors in each article ranged from 1 to 63, whereas the number of patients with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection reached 2645.

While health experts urge citizens to adopt preventative measures such as social distancing and wearing a mask, these recommended behaviors are not always followed by the public. To find a way to promote preventative measures, the present study examined the role of gain-loss framing of COVID-19 related messages on social distancing and mask wearing compliance. Moreover, the study also tested potential moderating effects on framing with three individual characteristics: political ideology, subjective numeracy, and risk attitude. A sample of 375 U.S. adult residents were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Each participant read either a gain or loss-framed message related to practicing protective behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants also completed scales of preventative behaviors, risk attitude, subjective numeracy, political ideology, and other demographic variables. It was found that those who were more liberal, risk-averse and had greater subjective numeracy were more likely to wear a mask and/or follow social distancing. Furthermore, in the presence of demographic and psychological factors, the study found participants in the loss-framed condition than in the gain-framed condition were more likely to adopt both preventative measures, supporting the notion of loss aversion. Additionally, the framing effect was also moderated by political ideology on mask-wearing, with the effect being stronger in liberals than in conservatives. Collectively, the study implies message framing may be a useful means to promote preventative measures in the current pandemic.","output":"The Influence of Gain-Loss Framing and Its Interaction with Political Ideology on Social Distancing and Mask Wearing Compliance During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hunger occurs in all locations around the globe, from developing to developed countries. In fact, there were over 37 million food insecure individuals (those without access to consistent nutritious food) in the United States in 2018, and this number increased in recent years due to the COVID pandemic. In many countries, food banks are used to consolidate food donations from individuals or government agencies and then provide that food to local partner agencies (such as food pantries and soup kitchens), who distribute it to food insecure individuals. As nonprofit humanitarian organizations, food banks strive to achieve geographic equity in their food distribution, so one area (or county) is not favored over others. However, food banks also want to maximize food distribution with their limited budgets. This equitable distribution versus cost balancing act is made even more challenging since food banks experience extreme variability in both the supply (donations) of food and partner agencies' capacity to deliver food to the food insecure. Our paper focuses on how mobile pantry programs, additional food bank storage capacity, and improved partner agency capacity can be utilized to address this supply and distribution capacity variability while considering food expiration times. Mobile pantry programs allow food banks to distribute food directly to the food insecure by sending their own trucks and employees to locations where food is most needed. Although all three of these approaches can be helpful, our results show that mobile pantries are a more effective approach to achieve high equity levels. This is especially true in the case of produce with relatively short expiration times. We also find that utilizing mobile pantry programs can increase equitable partner agency distribution considerably, because even small amounts of mobile pantry distribution in under-served areas allow for more equitable partner agency distribution in areas with available partner agency distribution capacity. Our research is based on data from our partner food bank, but our modeling and extensive sensitivity analysis should be applicable to many food banks with a similar collection and distribution structure.","output":"Achieving equitable food security: How can food bank mobile pantries fill this humanitarian need"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction:Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a critical health issue in the USA. Pennsylvania has the third highest number of drug overdose deaths per year, with the COVID-19 pandemic worsening these trends.

The goal of this study was to investigate how to treat hepatic portal bile duct diseases and perform jejunojejunostomy and cholangiojejunostomy totally laparoscopically. We evaluated the feasibility of TLRCJS in treating biliary tract diseases. METHODS TLRCJS were performed in 103 patients from January 2000 to August 2011. There were 28 cases of recurrent choledocholithiasis combined with stricture of the common bile duct (CBD) after several stone extractions, 3 patients with iatrogenic bile duct injury, 24 patients with choledochal cyst, 36 patients with hepatic portal cholangiocarcinoma, and 12 patients with cancer of the pancreatic head and periampullary cancer. All surgeries were performed through 5 trocars. First, laparoscopic surgery on the CBD was performed according to the original disease. The CBD was opened and stones were extracted in choledocholithiasis patients. In iatrogenic injury patients, strictured CBD was resected and repaired. Dilated CBD or choledochal cyst with tumor was transected. In patients with malignant jaundice, the CBD was opened longitudinally. At the same time, the bile duct was prepared for cholangiojejunostomy. Second, the positions of the laparoscope and surgeons were altered. The jejunal mesentery and jejunum were transected, and side-to-side jejunojejunostomy (JJS) was performed. The laparoscope and surgeon positions were exchanged again; the Rouxen-Y biliary limb was lifted close to the residual bile duct; and side-to-side or end-to-side choledochojejunostomy (CJS) was performed. Finally, an abdominal drainage tube was placed. RESULTS All the surgeries were performed successfully. The diameter of the residual bile duct ranged from 0.4 to 3.2 cm (average, 0.9 cm). Three patients had postoperative bile leakage and were treated from 1 week to approximately 1 month with abdominal drainage. Postoperative intraperitoneal hemorrhage and stress ulcer of the stomach occurred in 2 patients with biliary tract injury combined with obstructive jaundice. One with intraperitoneal hemorrhage was cured by another laparoscopic surgery. The other patient was cured after 2 days of abdominal drainage, antacids, and hemostatic drug therapy. The follow-up duration of 95 patients was 4 to 93 months (average, 48.3 months). The follow-up rate was 92.2% (95/103). Patients with cancer died of metastasis or cachexia during 14-month follow-up with no postoperative complication. Reflux cholangitis occurred in 3 patients 2, 3, and 5 years after the operation, respectively. No anastomotic stricture or other complication was found in other patients during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS TLRCJS is the best and first choice for patients with biliary tract diseases that need biliary-jejunal anastomosis.

It was hypothesized that Fontan patients with fenestrations have better exercise times, higher absolute regional oxygen venous saturations, and smaller arteriovenous differences than Fontan patients without fenestrations. For this study, 50 consecutive Fontan patients and 51 consecutive patients with normal cardiovascular anatomy were recruited. Placement of NIRS probes was performed to obtain regional oxygen saturations from the brain and the kidney. Readings were obtained at 1-min intervals during rest, exercise, and recovery. A standard Bruce protocol was used with a 5-min recovery period. Absolute regional tissue oxygenation values (rSO2) and arterial-venous oxygen saturation differences (AVDO2) calculated as arterial oxygen saturation (SPO2)--rSO2 for normal versus Fontan patients and for fenestrated versus unfenestrated Fontan patients were compared using independent t tests. When normal and Fontan patients were compared, the Fontan patients had a significantly shorter duration of exercise (9.3 vs 13.2 min; p < 0.001). No statistically significant difference in rSO2 change or AVDO2 was evident at the time of peak exercise, at 2 min into the recovery, or at 5 min into the recovery. A small oxygen debt also was paid back to the brain in the Fontan patients after exercise, as evidenced by a narrower AVDO2 than at baseline. The comparison of Fontan patients with and without fenestration showed no statistically significant difference in exercise time, rSO2 change, or AVDO2. The Fontan patients were noted to have shorter exercise times than the normal patients and also appeared to have an alteration in postexertional regional blood flow. However, when the various Fontan subtypes were compared by presence or absence of a fenestration, no significant differences were noted with regard to change in regional oxygen saturation or arteriovenous oxygen saturation. Thus, for patients with Fontan physiology, closure of the fenestration does not seem to have an impact on the dynamics of regional oxygen extraction during exercise or recovery.","output":"Effect of Fontan fenestration on regional venous oxygen saturation during exercise: further insights into Fontan fenestration closure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to tuberculosis (TB) patients\` pulmonary damages, some authors believe that a SARS-CoV-2 coinfection may result in unfavorable outcomes.

The classification algorithm makes use of the training datasets to build a model which can be used for allocating unclassified records to a defined class. In this paper, the coronavirus herd immunity optimizer (CHIO) algorithm is used to boost the efficiency of the probabilistic neural network (PNN) when solving classification problems. First, the PNN produces a random initial solution and submits it to the CHIO, which then attempts to refine the PNN weights. This is accomplished by the management of random phases and the effective identification of a search space that can probably decide the optimal value. The proposed CHIO-PNN approach was applied to 11 benchmark datasets to assess its classification accuracy, and its results were compared with those of the PNN and three methods in the literature, the firefly algorithm, African buffalo algorithm, and -hill climbing. The results showed that the CHIO-PNN achieved an overall classification rate of 90.3% on all datasets, at a faster convergence speed as compared outperforming all the methods in the literature.

Rift Valley fever (RVF), brucellosis and Q fever are three of the top priority diseases in the country but the involvement of camels in the transmission dynamics of these diseases is poorly understood. We analyzed 120 camel serum samples from northern Kenya to establish seropositivity rates of the three pathogens and to characterize the infecting Brucella species using molecular assays. We found seropositivity of 24.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.5C31.8%) for Brucella, 20.8% (95% CI: 13.6C28.1%) and 14.2% (95% CI: 7.9C20.4%) for Coxiella burnetii and Rift valley fever virus respectively.

Few studies so far have examined whether social cognitive ability impacts on PTSD recovery. Here we present a protocol and preliminary data for a study that aims to evaluate whether pre-treatment social cognitive deficits are associated with treatment outcomes following trauma-focused therapy for PTSD. METHOD: The protocol was developed after discussion with Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) groups, and a battery of social cognitive tasks was trialled on 20 participants without PTSD. The final protocol was then developed using information and feedback from these preliminary studies. We aim to recruit 60 individuals who are about to start a trauma-focused therapy for PTSD within the two tertiary PTSD services. Social cognition (measured using a variety of tasks including Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task and the Reflective Functioning Questionnaire) and potential confounders (including severity of trauma history, attachment and verbal IQ) are assessed at baseline, prior to the start of therapy. PTSD symptom severity (measured using the PCL-5) and daily functioning (measured using the WSAS) are assessed pre and post-treatment. The primary aim of the study is to examine whether baseline social cognition is associated with the degree of improvement in the PCL-5. RESULT: So far 29 participants have been recruited and consented. 6 participants have completed follow-up assessments. The study has been adapted for the COVID-19 pandemic so participants can complete the tasks remotely. Preliminary results show a moderate negative correlation between baseline social cognitive abilities and baseline PTSD symptom severity (Spearman's correlation -0.30) and functional abilities (Spearman's correlation -0.42). CONCLUSION: Development of our study in collaboration with PPI and preliminary testing of measures suggests it is likely that it will be feasible for us to conduct this study in this patient group.

Taking Internet-based appointment service (IBAS) as an example, this study aimed to investigate the subjective feelings of older adults and evaluate their user-satisfaction. METHODS: This study was based on data from a questionnaire survey involving 325 outpatients 60 years old in shanghai during the COVID-19 pandemic. The satisfaction of IBAS was evaluated and compared from six domains including convenience, visiting time, correct identification of specialists, on-site assist service, COVID-19 prevention, and privacy protection. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the correlation between satisfaction and social factors. RESULTS: No significant difference between older adults with or without previous experience using IBAS in terms of overall satisfaction. In the domain of operation difficulty (81.9 vs. 97.5%) and precise medicine (88.1 vs. 96.9%), such as correctly identifying the specialist, the satisfaction of previous user group was significantly higher than that of first-time user group. However, there was no significant difference in the remaining four domains between the two groups. Among the first time IBAS users, the satisfaction was higher than the walk-in registration they used before. Logistic regression revealed that some intention to use IBAS-associated social factors such as distance from the hospital, living status, and frequency of hospital visit, were related to the satisfaction of older adults. CONCLUSIONS: Driven by the external pandemic and internal intention, older adults would choose and manage network medical resources with their high satisfaction, which essentially demonstrates not only behavioral adjustment but also inner acceptance in older adults.

On its face, the gig economy represents the height of liberty. Part-time, temporary and platform workers are not tied to any single employer, and can theoretically choose when to work, and whom they want to work for. However, while workers in the gig economy enjoy nominal autonomy, they also lack many protections to which employees are legally entitled. Gig economy workers lack job security and must constantly search for new work. Most gig economy workers do not receive health insurance, pensions, or other benefits from their employers.

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 modulates cellular metabolism and reduces autophagy. Accordingly, compound-driven induction of autophagy limits SARS-CoV-2 propagation. In detail, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells show accumulation of key metabolites, activation of autophagy inhibitors (AKT1, SKP2) and reduction of proteins responsible for autophagy initiation (AMPK, TSC2, ULK1), membrane nucleation, and phagophore formation (BECN1, VPS34, ATG14), as well as autophagosome-lysosome fusion (BECN1, ATG14 oligomers). Consequently, phagophore-incorporated autophagy markers LC3B-II and P62 accumulate, which we confirm in a hamster model and lung samples of COVID-19 patients. Single-nucleus and single-cell sequencing of patient-derived lung and mucosal samples show differential transcriptional regulation of autophagy and immune genes depending on cell type, disease duration, and SARS-CoV-2 replication levels.

Virus enters cell through spike glycoprotein fusion with ACE2 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2) human receptor. Hence, spike glycoprotein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a potential target for diagnostics, vaccines, and antibodies. Also, virus entry can be prevented by blocking ACE2 thus, ACE2 can be considered potential target for therapeutics. As being highly specific, safe and efficacious, peptides hold their place in therapeutics. In present study, we retrieved sequence of 70 peptides from Antiviral Peptide Database (AVPdb), modelled them using 3D structure predicting web tool and docked them with receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein and human host receptor ACE2 using peptide-protein docking. It was observed that peptides have more affinity towards ACE2 in comparison with spike RBD. Interestingly it was noticed that most of the peptides bind to RBM (residue binding motif) which is responsible for ACE2 binding at the interface of RBD while, for ACE2, peptides prefer to bind the core cavity rather than RBD binding interface. To further investigate how peptides at the interface of RBD or ACE2 alter the binding between RBD and ACE2, proteinCprotein docking of RBD and ACE2 with and without peptides was performed.

We estimated the costs of integrating aPS into routine HTS within an ongoing aPS scale-up project in western Kenya. METHODS: We conducted microcosting using the payer perspective in 14 facilities offering aPS. Although aPS was offered to both males and females testing HIV-positive (index clients), we only collected data on female index clients and their male sex partners (MSP). We used activity-based costing to identify key aPS activities, inputs, resources, and estimated financial and economic costs of goods and services. We analyzed costs by start-up (August 2018), and recurrent costs one-year after aPS implementation (Kisumu: August 2019; Homa Bay: January 2020) and conducted time-and-motion observations of aPS activities. We estimated the incremental costs of aPS, average cost per MSP traced, tested, testing HIV-positive, and on antiretroviral therapy, cost shares, and costs disaggregated by facility. RESULTS: Overall, the number of MSPs traced, tested, testing HIV-positive, and on antiretroviral therapy was 1027, 869, 370, and 272 respectively. Average unit costs per MSP traced, tested, testing HIV-positive, and on antiretroviral therapy were $34.54, $42.50, $108.71 and $152.28, respectively, which varied by county and facility client volume. The weighted average incremental cost of integrating aPS was $7,485.97 per facility per year, with recurrent costs accounting for approximately 90% of costs. The largest cost drivers were personnel (49%) and transport (13%). Providers spent approximately 25% of the HTS visit obtaining MSP contact information (HIV-negative clients: 13 out of 54 min; HIV-positive clients: 20 out of 96 min), while the median time spent per MSP traced on phone and in-person was 6 min and 2.5 hours, respectively. CONCLUSION: Average facility costs will increase when integrating aPS to HTS with incremental costs largely driven by personnel and transport. Strategies to efficiently utilize healthcare personnel will be critical for effective, affordable, and sustainable aPS.

Nearly no gonococcal AMR data are available from Central Asia, and no data from Kyrgyzstan has been published. We examined, for the first time, AMR and molecular epidemiology of N. gonorrhoeae isolates cultured in Kyrgyzstan in 2012 and 2017, in order to inform refinements of the Kyrgyz national gonorrhoea management guidelines. METHODS: N. gonorrhoeae isolates cultured in 2012 (n = 84) and 2017 (n = 72) in Kyrgyzstan were examined. MICs of nine antimicrobials were determined using Etest and, where available, clinical breakpoints from the EUCAST were applied. N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) was also performed. RESULTS: The overall resistance levels were high to ciprofloxacin (88.5%), tetracycline (56.9%), benzylpenicillin (39.1%), and kanamycin (4.7%). Resistance to cefixime (0.6%, n = 1 isolate), azithromycin (0.6%, n = 1), and gentamicin (0.6%, n = 1) was rare. No resistance to ceftriaxone or spectinomycin was found. However, the proportion of isolates with decreased susceptibility (MIC = 0.125 mg/L) to ceftriaxone and cefixime was 12.8 and 11.5%, respectively. Gonococcal isolates were assigned 69 sequence types, of which 52 (75.4%) were new. CONCLUSIONS: The gonococcal population in Kyrgyzstan in 2012 and 2017 showed a high genetic diversity. Ceftriaxone, 500C1000 mg, in combination with azithromycin 2 g or doxycycline, particularly when chlamydial infection has not been excluded, should be recommended as empiric first-line treatment. Spectinomycin 2 g could be an alternative treatment, and given with azithromycin 2 g if pharyngeal gonorrhoea has not been excluded. Fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, benzylpenicillin, or tetracyclines should not be used for empiric treatment of gonorrhoea in Kyrgyzstan. Timely updating and high compliance to national gonorrhoea treatment guidelines based on quality-assured AMR data is imperative.

Nurses' knowledge and proper assessment can play a major role in improving deep venous thrombosis prevention care. OBJECTIVE: To assess the knowledge, practice, and associated factors towards deep venous thrombosis prevention among nurses working at Amhara region hospitals. METHODS: Institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among nurses working at Amhara region comprehensive specialized hospitals, Northwest, Ethiopia, from April 1 to 30, 2021. A simple random sampling technique was used to select 423 samples. A structured pretested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Data were entered in epi-info version 7, analyzed using SPSS version 25, and presented by frequencies, percentages, and tables. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was computed, and P value < 0.05 was considered to identify statistically significant factors. RESULT: Good knowledge and practice of nurses towards DVT prevention were 55.6% and 48.8%, respectively. Working at the medical ward [AOR 3.175, 95% CI (1.42, 7.11)], having a BSc degree [AOR = 3.248(1.245, 8.469)], Master's degree [AOR = 3.48, 95% CI (1.22, 9.89)], obtaining a formal training about deep venous thrombosis [AOR = 1.59; 95% CI (1.03, 2.47)], and working experience of 11 years [AOR = 2.11; 95% CI (1.07, 4.16)] were associated with good knowledge of nurses on the prevention of deep venous thrombosis.

This technique has potential advantages in terms of less invasive surgery without the need to create a complicated intraabdominal anastomosis. METHODS From 2008 to 2011, 262 patients with gastric cancer underwent total gastrectomy and reconstruction with a Roux-en-Y anastomosis, and 52 patients underwent LATG with DST. A retrospective analysis then was performed comparing the patients who experienced postoperative stenosis after LATG-DST (positive group) and the patients who did not (negative group). A comparative analysis was performed among patients comparing conventional open total gastrectomy and LATG, and multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate risk factors for the development of anastomotic stenosis. RESULTS A minor leak was found in 1 patient (1.9 %), and 11 patients experienced anastomotic stenosis (21 %) after LATG with DST. Among the patients with anastomotic stenosis, three (3/4, 75 %) anastomoses were performed with the 21-mm end-to-end anastomosis (EEA) stapler, and eight anastomoses were performed (8/47, 17 %) with the 25-mm EEA stapler. The median interval to the diagnosis of anastomotic stenosis was 43 days after surgery. The patients with stenosis needed endoscopic balloon dilation an average of four times, and the rate of perforation after dilation was 13 %. The clinical and operative characteristics did not differ between the two groups. Anastomotic stenosis after open total gastrectomy occurred in two cases (0.98 %). Multivariate analysis showed that the size of the EEA stapler and the use of DST were risk factors for anastomotic stenosis. CONCLUSION Esophagojejunostomy using DST with OrVil is useful in performing a minimally invasive procedure but carries a high risk of anastomotic stenosis.","output":"Stenosis after use of the double-stapling technique for reconstruction after laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that there is seasonal variation in the rates of gestational diabetes (GDM) diagnosed using a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test.

Global movement toward sustainable agriculture urges the development of environmentally friendly tools that can replace traditional pesticides. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are well-known biological control agents against various arthropod pests. The EPNs act together with symbiotic bacteria that produce natural products with insecticidal potential. Novel formulations and application technology allow their application against aerial pests, including those associated with vineyards. This study investigated the viability of four EPN species and their corresponding bacteria derivates (unfiltered ferment, UF, or cell-free supernatant, CFS) against EGVM (larval and pupa instars). The results revealed that all EPN species killed various EGVM larval stages. Killing pupae required a higher number of IJs than controlling larvae. Steinernema carpocapsae registered the most promising results, killing ~50% L1 and >75% L3/L5 in 2 days. The use of the bacterial bioactive compounds achieved similar results, with UF registering higher activity than CFS. Overall, we demonstrated that both EPN and bacterial bioproducts have a great potential to control EGVM in sustainable viticulture. Further research in co-formulation with adjuvants is required to ensure their survival in the aboveground grapevine areas. ABSTRACT: The European grapevine moth (EGVM) Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) is a relevant pest in the Palearctic region vineyards and is present in the Americas. Their management using biological control agents and environmentally friendly biotechnical tools would reduce intensive pesticide use. The entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) in the families Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae are well-known virulent agents against arthropod pests thanks to symbiotic bacteria in the genera Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus (respectively) that produce natural products with insecticidal potential. Novel technological advances allow field applications of EPNs and those bioactive compounds as powerful bio-tools against aerial insect pests. This study aimed to determine the viability of four EPN species (Steinernema feltiae, S. carpocapsae, S. riojaense, and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora) as biological control agents against EGVM larval instars (L1, L3, and L5) and pupae. Additionally, the bioactive compounds from their four symbiotic bacteria (Xenorhabdus bovienii, X. nematophila, X. kozodoii, and Photorhabdus laumondii subsp. laumondii, respectively) were tested as unfiltered ferment (UF) and cell-free supernatant (CFS) against the EGVM larval instars L1 and L3. All of the EPN species showed the capability of killing EGVM during the larval and pupal stages, particularly S. carpocapsae (mortalities of ~50% for L1 and >75% for L3 and L5 in only two days), followed by efficacy by S. feltiae. Similarly, the bacterial bioactive compounds produced higher larval mortality at three days against L1 (>90%) than L3 (~50%), making the application of UF more virulent than the application of CFS. Our findings indicate that both steinernematid species and their symbiotic bacterial bioactive compounds could be considered for a novel agro-technological approach to control L. botrana in vineyards. Further research into co-formulation with adjuvants is required to expand their viability when implemented for aboveground grapevine application.","output":"Exploring the Use of Entomopathogenic Nematodes and the Natural Products Derived from Their Symbiotic Bacteria to Control the Grapevine Moth, Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On January 31, 2020, novel coronavirus (nCoV), a zoonotic virus yet to be identified into the taxonomy, created a powerful ripple through mankind that the World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency.1 This is definitely not the first time that an alarm has been rung by this family of viruses.

Method We performed a systematic review of the literature to quantify the locations of small neurological events identified with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among COVID-19 patients. Neurological events were localised into the Desikan-Killiany grey and white matter atlases. A mathematical network diffusion model was then used to test whether the spatial distribution of neurological events could be explained via a linear spread through the structural connectome of the brain. Findings We identified 35 articles consisting of 123 patients that assessed the spatial distribution of small neurological events among COVID-19 patients.

White matter events were observed within 14 of 42 white matter bundles from the IIT atlas. The highest proportions (26%) of events were observed within the bilateral corticospinal tracts. The splenium and middle of the corpus callosum were affected in 14% and 9% of the cases respectively. Grey matter events were spatially distributed in the 41 brain regions within the Desikan-Killiany atlas. The highest proportions (~10%) of the events were observed in areas including the bilateral superior temporal, precentral, and lateral occipital cortices. Sub-cortical events were most frequently identified in the Pallidum. The application of a mathematical network diffusion model suggested that the spatial pattern of the small neurological events in COVID-19 can be modelled with a linear diffusion of spread from epicentres in the bilateral cerebellum and basal ganglia (Pearsons r=0.41, p<0.001, corrected). Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically characterise the spatial distribution of small neurological events in COVID-19 patients and test whether the spatial distribution of these events can be explained by a linear diffusion spread model. The location of neurological events is consistent with commonly identified neurological symptoms including alterations in conscious state among COVID-19 patients that require brain imaging. Given the prevalence and severity of these manifestations, clinicians should carefully monitor neurological symptoms within COVID-19 patients and their potential long-term sequelae.","output":"Modelling the Anatomical Distribution of Neurological Events in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the continuous development of e-commerce, the logistics industry is thriving, and logistics delays have become an issue that deserves more and more attention.

METHODS: Clinical information and chest CT data of 149 COVID-19 patients between January 9, 2020 and March 15, 2020 and 97 patients with S. pneumoniae pneumonia between January 23, 2011 and March 18, 2020 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively analyzed. In addition, CT features were comparatively analyzed. RESULTS: According to the chest CT images, the probability of lung segmental and lobar pneumonia in S. pneumoniae pneumonia was higher than that in COVID-19(P<0.001); the probabilities of ground-glass opacity (GGO), the crazy paving sign, and abnormally thickened interlobular septa in COVID-19 were higher than those in S. pneumoniae pneumonia(P = 0.005, P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively); and the probabilities of consolidation lesions, bronchial wall thickening, centrilobular nodules, and pleural effusion in S. pneumoniae pneumonia were higher than those in COVID-19 (P<0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.003, P = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: The findings of GGO, the crazy paving sign, and abnormally thickened interlobular septa on chest CT were significantly higher in COVID-19 than S. pneumoniae pneumonia.

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to evaluate the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) as a predictor of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality. METHODS: A single-center retrospective observational study was conducted. Forty adult patients (50% men) with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the ICU were enrolled. The primary endpoint was mortality at day 60. Serum 25(OH)D concentration was measured on the day of admission to the ICU. We used the Mann-Whitney test, Fisher's exact test, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis to assess serum 25(OH)D concentration as a predictor of COVID-19 mortality. RESULTS: All 40 patients had a low median (IQR) serum 25(OH)D concentration at admission [12 (9-15) ng/mL]. The median (IQR) serum 25(OH)D concentration was greater in survivors [13.3 (10.0-17.1) ng/mL, n = 22] than in nonsurvivors [9.6 (7.9-14.2) ng/mL; n = 18], P = 0.044.

The majority of patients do not have a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical sibling donor, and alternative stem cell sources include HLA-matched or mismatched unrelated donors and haploidentical related donors. However, alternative donor HSCT are associated with three major complications i) graft rejection; ii) graft-versus-host disease (GvHD); and iii) delayed immune reconstitution leading to viral infections and relapse. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW Graft rejection and the risk of GvHD can be significantly reduced by using intensive conditioning regimens, including in vivo T cell depletion as well as ex vivo T cell depletion of the graft. However, the benefits of removing alloreactive T cells from the graft are offset by the concomitant removal of T cells with anti-viral or anti-tumor activity as well as the profound delay in endogenous T cell recovery post-transplant. Thus, opportunistic infections, many of which are not amenable to conventional small-molecule therapeutics, are frequent in these patients and are associated with significant morbidity and high mortality rates. This review discusses current cell therapies to prevent or treat viral infections/reactivations post-transplant. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN The reader will gain an understanding of the current state of cell therapy to prevent and treat viral infections post-HSCT, and will be introduced to preclinical studies designed to develop and validate new manufacturing procedures intended to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce associated toxicities.

In this study, publicly available datasets of chest X-ray images have been utilized for training and testing of five pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models namely VGG16, MobileNetV2, Xception, NASNetMobile and InceptionResNetV2. Prior to the training of the selected models, the number of images in COVID-19 category have been increased employing traditional augmentation and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The performance of the five pre-trained CNN models utilizing the images generated with the two strategies have been compared. In the case of models trained using augmented images, Xception (98%) and MobileNetV2 (97.9%) turned out to be the ones with highest validation accuracy. Xception (98.1%) and VGG16 (98.6%) emerged as models with the highest validation accuracy in the models trained with synthetic GAN images. The best performing models have been further deployed in a smartphone and evaluated. The overall results suggest that VGG16 and Xception, trained with the synthetic images created using GAN, performed better compared to models trained with augmented images.

OBJECTIVES To assess the nature of joint problems encountered in a geriatric inpatient population and evaluate the contribution of a rheumatologist. METHODS We reviewed the rheumatology consultation records that were conducted in a geriatric medical center over a 10 year period. RESULTS A total of 474 consultations were held; most of these patients (86%) were hospitalized in the acute geriatric departments, 10% in the rehabilitation ward and 4% in the long-term care wards. Some patients were seen more than once. A rheumatologic joint problem was the main reason for hospitalization in 53% of these patients. Monoarthritis was the most frequent complaint (50%), followed by pauciarticular arthritis (two to five joints) in 30% of patients. Arthrocentesis, diagnostic and therapeutic, was performed in 225 patients, most of them in knee joints (81%). The most frequent diagnosis was osteoarthritis with acute exacerbation (28%), followed by gout (18%), pseudo-gout (9%) and rheumatoid arthritis (9%). In 86 cases (18%) the diagnosis was a non-specific rheumatologic problem: arthralgia, nonspecific generalized pain, or fibromyalgia.

Specifically, patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) generated poor spike-specific antibody and T cell responses after immunization. Methods: Thirty-four CVID convalescent patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection, 38 CVID patients immunized with two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, and 20 SARS-CoV-2 CVID convalescents later and immunized with BNT162b2 were analyzed for the anti-spike IgG production and the generation of spike-specific memory B cells and T cells. Results: Spike-specific IgG was induced more frequently after infection than after vaccination (82% vs. 34%). The antibody response was boosted in convalescents by vaccination. Although immunized patients generated atypical memory B cells possibly by extra-follicular or incomplete germinal center reactions, convalescents responded to infection by generating spike-specific memory B cells that were improved by the subsequent immunization. Poor spike-specific T cell responses were measured independently from the immunological challenge. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection primed a more efficient classical memory B cell response, whereas the BNT162b2 vaccine induced non-canonical B cell responses in CVID. Natural infection responses were boosted by subsequent immunization, suggesting the possibility to further stimulate the immune response by additional vaccine doses in CVID.","output":"B Cell Response Induced by SARS-CoV-2 Infection Is Boosted by the BNT162b2 Vaccine in Primary Antibody Deficiencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the importance of the proper quality of blood products for safe transfusion, conventional methods for preparation and their preservation, they lack significant stability.

METHODS: A retrospective observational case-controlled cohort study was performed between March and September 2020, including adults with COVID-19 in a single-center in Turkey. We categorized patients into age-sex matched three groups, group 1 (n = 48) and group 2 (n = 48) included patients treated with the combination of FPV plus Hydroxychloroquine (HQ) early and late, respectively. Group 3 (n = 48) consisted of patients on HQ monotherapy. In Group 2, if the respiratory or clinic condition had not improved sufficiently, FPV was added on or after day 3. RESULTS: We found that starting FPV early had an impact on PCR negativity and the progression of the disease. 'No progression' was defined as the absence of a new finding in the control radiological examination and the absence of accompanying clinical deterioration. Also, the decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) was greater in Group 1 than Group 3 (p < 0.001).

The proposed algorithm first determine of the existence of a human being in the surveillance scene. Head and shoulder contour will be detected. The face will be clustered to cluster patches. Then determination of presence or absent of human skin will be determined. We proposed a hybrid approach that combines normalized RGB (rgb) and the YCbCr space color. This technique is tested on two datasets; the first one contains 650 images of skin patches. The second dataset contains 800 face images. The algorithm achieves an average detection rate of 97.51% for concealed faces. Also, it achieved a run time comparable with existing state-of-the-art concealed face detection systems that run in real time.","output":"A novel technique for automated concealed face detection in surveillance videos"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women have been classified as at risk for COVID-19 due to previous experience with influenza and other coronaviruses. The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for the complications and death in women of childbearing age and pregnant women with suspected COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted from the beginning of the epidemic in Mexico until May 25, 2020. All women of childbearing age (13-49 years) from the open national COVID-19 database from the Ministry of Health of Mexico were considered for eligibility. SARS-COV-2 infection was confirmed or ruled out by RT-qPCR. We performed a bivariate and multivariable analysis to estimate mortality risk. RESULTS: Ten (2.2%) pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 died. Positive pregnant patients did not have a higher risk of complications (admission to the ICU, pneumonia, or requirement for mechanical ventilation) or death than the controls. In the multivariate analysis, only history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease remained independently associated with death in the positive cohort. Seven (0.6%) pregnant women with a negative test died. In bivariate analysis, pregnant patients with a positive test had a higher risk of death than pregnant patients with a negative test (relative risk (RR) = 3.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.48-10.12), but no higher risk was found than in non-pregnant women with a positive test (RR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.44-1.53), and 60-day mortality did not significantly differ among pregnant patients with or without a positive test (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.12-1.30) or between COVID-19-positive patients who were pregnant or not pregnant (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.35-1.56). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant patients do not have a greater risk of complications or death from COVID-19 than non-pregnant patients. The presence of diabetes mellitus and chronic disease increases the risk of death in women of childbearing age, but not specifically in pregnant patients.","output":"COVID-19 mortality among pregnant women in Mexico: A retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The majority of children with febrile seizures have viral infections and viruses were detected in 22% to 63% of children in published studies.

So far, discussions about the ethics of this technology have focused on privacy concerns, efficacy, and uptake. However, important issues regarding power imbalances and vulnerability also warrant attention. As demonstrated in other forms of digital surveillance, vulnerable subpopulations pay a higher price for surveillance measures. There is reason to worry that some types of COVID-19 technology might lead to the employment of disproportionate profiling, policing, and criminalization of marginalized groups. It is, thus, of crucial importance to interrogate vulnerability in COVID-19 apps and ensure that the development, implementation, and data use of this surveillance technology avoids exacerbating vulnerability and the risk of harm to surveilled subpopulations, while maintaining the benefits of data collection across the whole population.

The aim of this study was to apply a previous published methodology to design food exchange lists to the development of a sports food exchange list, with sport products available in Spain. A cross-sectional study of the nutritional composition of sports foods, regarding macronutrients and energy, was carried out. A total of 322 sports foods from 18 companies were selected, taking into account their interest in sports practice and with nutritional data provided by companies. Sports foods were divided into seven groups: sports drinks; sports gels; sports bars; sports confectionery; protein powders; protein bars; and liquid meals. A sports food composition database based on portion size usually consumed by athletes and/or recommended in commercial packaging was created. Within each sports foods group, different subgroups were defined due to differences in the main and/or secondary macronutrient. The definition of each exchange list with the amounts-in grams-of each sports food within each group and subgroup, was done using statistical criteria such as mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and Z value. Final exchange values for energy and macronutrient have been established for each group and subgroup using a methodology to design food exchange lists previously published by the authors. In addition, those products with high Z values that can provide greater variability in dietary planning were included. The usefulness of sport foods lists as well as the use of an exchange system in the dietary practice of sports nutrition is discussed, and examples of how to use them with athletes are presented. This first sport foods exchange list showed in this study, with commercial sports products available in Spain, can be a novel tool for dietetic practice and also can allow sport nutrition professionals to develop another sport food list using the methodology described in this paper.

Interestingly, emetine exhibited protective efficacy against lethal challenge with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; a chicken coronavirus) in the embryonated chicken egg infection model. Emetine treatment led to a decrease in viral RNA and protein synthesis without affecting other steps of viral life cycle such as attachment, entry and budding. In a chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assay, emetine was shown to disrupt the binding of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA with eIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E, a cellular cap-binding protein required for initiation of protein translation). Further, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies suggested that emetine may bind to the cap-binding pocket of eIF4E, in a similar conformation as m7-GTP binds. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 was shown to exploit ERK/MNK1/eIF4E signalling pathway for its effective replication in the target cells.

METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study utilized a minimally invasive tissue sampling procedure to determine the cause of death among an adult population. Bacterial cultures (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, lung tissue) and antibiotic susceptibility were evaluated, and the results were compared between community and hospital deaths. RESULTS: Of 100 deceased persons studied, 76 (76%) deaths occurred in the community and 24 (24%) in the hospital. At least 1 bacterial agent was cultured from 86 (86%) cases; of these, 74 (86%) had a bacterial disease attributed as the primary cause of death, with pneumonia (35, 47.3%), sepsis (33, 44.6%), and meningitis (3, 4.1%) most common. Of 154 bacterial isolates (76.6% from the community and 23.4% from the hospital) detected from 86 culture-positive cases, 26 (16.8%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR). Klebsiella species were the most common (13 of 26) MDR organisms. The odds of getting an MDR Klebsiella infection was 6-fold higher among hospital deaths compared with community deaths (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37C26.40; P = .017) and almost 23-fold higher (CI, 2.45C213.54; P = .006) among cases with prior antibiotic use compared to those without. CONCLUSIONS: High incidence of serious bacterial infections causing death of adults in the community, with most MDR organisms isolated from hospitalized cases, calls for robust surveillance mechanisms and infection prevention activities at the community level and evidence-driven antibiotic stewardship in healthcare settings.","output":"Burden of Serious Bacterial Infections and Multidrug-Resistant Organisms in an Adult Population of Nepal: A Comparative Analysis of Minimally Invasive Tissue Sampling Informed Mortality Surveillance of Community and Hospital Deaths"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of recently emerged pandemic of COVID-19, we have performed two-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (2D-QSAR) modelling using SARS-CoV-3CLpro enzyme inhibitors for the development of a multiple linear regression (MLR) based model.

Our understanding of the epidemiology, clinical presentation, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 has evolved rapidly as they did with HIV. Epidemiologically, there are similarities between the two viruses including asymptomatic spread, disproportionate impact on persons of color, need for rapid diagnostic testing, and lack of a cure or vaccine. PLWH do not appear generally to have an increased incidence of COVID-19 infection or a more severe course of disease. Clinical trials to identify potential treatment and prevention options for COVID-19 have included antiretrovirals used to treat HIV that have not been efficacious.

The correct diagnosis of viral diseases represents a crucial step towards effective treatments and control. Biosensors have been successfully implemented as accessible and accurate detection tests for some of the most important viruses. While most biosensors are based on physical or chemical interactions of cell-free components, the complexity of living microorganisms holds a poorly explored potential for viral detection in the face of the advances of synthetic biology. Indeed, cell-based biosensors have been praised for their versatility and economic attractiveness, however, yeast platforms for viral disease diagnostics are still limited to indirect antibody recognition. Here we propose a novel strategy for viral detection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which combines the transductive properties of G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) with the Yeast Surface Display (YSD) of specific enzymes enrolled in the viral recognition process. The GPCR/YSD complex might allow for active virus detection through a modulated signal activated by a GPCR agonist, whose concentration correlates to the viral titer. Additionally, we explore this methodology in a case study for the detection of highly pathogenic coronaviruses that share the same cell receptor upon infection (i.e. the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2, ACE2), as a conceptual example of the potential of the GPCR/YSD strategy for the diagnosis of COVID-19.","output":"Exploring G protein-coupled receptors and yeast surface display strategies for viral detection in baker's yeast: SARS-CoV-2 as a case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New screen-printed sensor with a boron-doped diamond working electrode (SP/BDDE) was fabricated using a large-area linear antenna microwave chemical deposition vapor system (LA-MWCVD) with a novel precursor composition.

Machine learning (ML) methods are used in this article to research the systematic recognition of patterns of physiological and subjective stress parameters and to predict stress. The logistics sector serves as a practical application case in which stress factors are often rooted in the activity and work organisation. One design element of the prevention of stress is the work break. ML methods are used to investigate the extent to which stress can be predicted on the basis of physiological and subjective parameters in order to recommend breaks individually. The article presents the interim status of a software solution for dynamic break management for logistics. Practical Relevance: The aim of the software solution Dynamic Break is to preventively prevent stress resulting from mental and physical stress factors in logistics and to keep employees healthy, satisfied, fit for work and productive in the long term. Individualized rest breaks as a design element can support companies in deploying human resources more flexibly in line with the dynamic requirements of logistics.","output":"Einsatz von Maschinellem Lernen fr die Vorhersage von Stress am Beispiel der Logistik"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Theoretical study and software simulation on the sensitivity of silicon nanowires (SiNWs) field effect transistor (FET) sensors in terms of surface-to-volume ratio, depletion ratio, surface state and lattice quality are carried out. Generally, SiNWs-FET sensors with triangular cross-sections are more sensitive than sensors with circular or square cross-sections. Two main reasons are discussed in this article. Firstly, SiNWs-FET sensors with triangular cross-sections have the largest surface-to-volume ratio and depletion ratio which significantly enhance the sensors sensitivity. Secondly, the manufacturing processes of the electron beam lithography (EBL) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods seriously affect the surface state and lattice quality, which eventually influence SiNWs-FET sensors sensitivity. In contrast, wet etching and thermal oxidation (WETO) create fewer surface defects and higher quality lattices. Furthermore, the software simulation confirms that SiNWs-FET sensors with triangular cross-sections have better sensitivity than the other two types of SiNWs-FET sensors under the same conditions, consistent with the theoretical analysis. The article fully proved that SiNWs-FET sensors fabricated by the WETO method produced the best sensitivity and it will be widely used in the future.","output":"A Theoretical and Simulation Analysis of the Sensitivity of SiNWs-FET Sensors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns regarding its psychological effect on university students, especially healthcare students. We aimed at assessing the risk of mental health problems according to the type of university studies, by adjusting for potential confounders. Methods We used data from the COSAMe study, a national cross-sectional survey including 69,054 French university students during the first quarantine. The mental health outcomes evaluated were suicidal thoughts, severe self-reported distress (as assessed by the Impact of Events ScaleCRevised), stress (Perceived Stress Scale), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, State subscale), and depression (Beck Depression Inventory). Multivariable logistic regression analyzes were performed to test the association between the type of university studies (healthcare studies: medical and non-medical, and non-healthcare studies) and poor mental health outcomes, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, precariousness indicators, health-related data, quality of social relationships, and data about media consumption. Results Compared to non-healthcare students (N = 59,404), non-medical healthcare (N = 5,431) and medical students (N = 4,193) showed a lower risk of presenting at least one poor mental health outcome (adjusted OR [95%CI] = 0.86[0.81C0.92] and 0.87[0.81C0.93], respectively). Compared to non-healthcare students, medical students were at lower risk of suicidal thoughts (0.83[0.74C0.93]), severe self-reported distress (0.75[0.69C0.82]) and depression (0.83[0.75C0.92]).

With other pathogens, they cause bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) in ruminants. The aim of the study was the detection and molecular characterisation of BPIV3 and BRSV from nasal swabs and lung samples of cows in and around the Erzurum region of eastern Turkey. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total, 155 samples were collected. Of animals used in the study 92 were males and 63 females. The age of the animals was between 9 months and 5 years, mean 1.4 years. Most males were in the fattening period and being raised in open sheds; females were in the lactating period and kept in free stall barns. All samples were tested for the presence of viral genes using RT-PCR. Gene-specific primers in a molecular method (RT-PCR) identified BRSV (fusion gene) and BPIV3 (matrix gene) strains at the genus level. RESULTS: RNA from BRSV and BPIV3 was detected in two (1.29%) and three (1.93%) samples, respectively, one of each of which was sequenced and the sequences were aligned with reference virus strains. Phylogenetic analyses clustered the strains in genotype C/BPIV3 and subgroup III/BRSV. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that BRSV and BPIV3 contribute to bovine respiratory disease cases in Turkey.

This provides a solid rational founded in implications for population health as to why reducing and preventing mental health problems in children and adolescents deserves attention. Past research has indicated interventions focussed on building resilience through strengthening protective factors may offer the potential to address mental health problems in children and adolescents, and in particular aid in reducing such problems during times of increased risk or adversity. With childhood and adolescence being critical periods of development, there is a need to reflect on the strengths and limitations of resilience-focussed interventions and anticipated future needs of the worlds youth. This conceptual analysis identifies a number of future research directions that may meaningfully add to the evidence base and improve implementation, evaluation, and impact of resilience-focussed interventions. These largely relate to refining the understanding of how resilience protective factors relate to mental health problems in children and adolescents. Important issues and potential opportunities to improve the related research field include improved reporting of intervention content; improved measurement of resilience protective factors in intervention trials; continued reporting and review of evidence of association between protective factors and mental health outcomes; and incorporation of mediation analysis within intervention trials. There is a need for further intervention studies in this space to be conducted as rigorous trials of resilience-focussed approaches based on such evidence of association, with clearly posited mechanisms of change, and inclusive of analysis of differential intervention effects.

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a personalized mHealth-anchored intervention program in improving glycemic control and enhancing care experience in diabetes management. The program was coincidentally implemented during the national-level lockdown for COVID-19 in Singapore, allowing for a timely study of the use of mHealth for chronic disease management. METHODS: Patients with T2DM or prediabetes were enrolled from the Singapore Armed Forces and offered a 3-month intervention program in addition to the usual care they received. The program was standardized to include: (1) in-person initial consultation with a clinical dietitian, (2) in-person review with a diabetes specialist doctor, (3) one Continuous Glucose Monitoring device, (4) access to the mobile app for dietary intake and physical activity tracking, and communication via messaging with the dietitian and doctor, and (5) context-sensitive digital health coaching over the mobile app. Medical support was rendered to the patients on an as-needed basis when they required advice on adjustment of medications. Measurements of weight, height, and glycated hemoglobin A (HbA1c) were conducted at two in-person visits at the start and end of the program. At the end of the program, patients were asked to complete a short acceptability feedback survey to understand the motivation for joining the program, their satisfaction, and suggestions for improvement. RESULTS: Over a four-week recruitment period, 130 individuals were screened and the enrolment target of 30 patients was met. Twenty-one patients completed the program and were included in the final analyses. Nine patients were lost to follow-up and did not have full data available for the final analyses. There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics between patients that were included and excluded from the final analyses. The 21 completers rated a mean of 9.0 out of 10 on the Likert scale for both satisfaction questions. For the Yes-No question on benefit of the program, all of the patients selected \\"Yes\\".

Research into the mechanisms of these conditions has proposed that some of their causes (eg, macular degeneration/glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease) could be symptoms of an underlying common cause. Research into sensory-cognitive aging has provided data that sensory decline may be linked to the progression of dementia through reduced sensory stimulation. While hearing loss rehabilitation may have a beneficial effect on cognitive functioning, there are no data available on whether low vision rehabilitation, specifically for reading, could have a beneficial effect on cognitive health. OBJECTIVE: The research questions are: (1) Does low vision rehabilitation reduce reading effort? (2) If so, does reduced reading effort increase reading activity, and (3) If so, does increased reading activity improve cognitive functioning? The primary objective is to evaluate cognition before, as well as at 6 months and 12 months after, 3 weeks of low vision reading rehabilitation using magnification in individuals with age-related macular degeneration, with or without coexisting hearing impairments. We hypothesize that improvements postrehab will be observed at 6 months and maintained at 12 months for participants with vision loss and less so for those with dual sensory loss. The secondary objective is to correlate participant characteristics with all cognitive outcomes to identify which may play an important role in reading rehabilitation. METHODS: We employ a quasiexperimental approach (nonrandomized, pre-post intervention study). A 3x3 design (3 groups x 3 time points) allows us to examine whether cognitive performance will change before and after 6 months and 12 months of a low vision reading intervention, when comparing 75 low vision and 75 dual sensory impaired (vision & hearing) participants to 75 age-matched healthy controls. The study includes outcome measures of vision (eg, reading acuity and speed), cognition (eg, short-term and long-term memory, processing speed), participant descriptors, demographics, and clinical data (eg, speech perception in noise, mental health). RESULTS: The study has received approval, and recruitment began on April 24, 2019. As of March 4, 2021, 38 low vision and 7 control participants have been enrolled. Lockdown forced a pause in recruitment, which will recommence once the COVID-19 crisis has reached a point where face-to-face data collection with older adults becomes feasible again. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of protective effects caused by reading rehabilitation will have a considerable impact on the vision rehabilitation community and their clients as well as all professionals involved in the care of older adults with or without dementia. If we demonstrate that reading rehabilitation has a beneficial effect on cognition, the demand for rehabilitation services will increase, potentially preventing cognitive decline across groups of older adults at risk of developing macular degeneration.

This article examines how COVID-19 impacted long-term care residents and their family members from the perspective of long-term care facility (LTCF) administrative staff. METHODS: An online survey was sent to Israeli LTCF administrators between mid-July and mid-October 2020, resulting in 52 completed questionnaires. Quantitative analysis involved descriptive statistics using SPSS, with differences compared via t tests, ANOVA, and 2 tests. Qualitative analysis involved thematic analysis of responses to open-ended questions. RESULTS: COVID-19 was reported to have multiple types of negative impact on residents, including direct effects on morbidity and mortality as well as indirect effects manifested as negative reactions to measures aimed at limiting infection, including isolation from relatives, decreased activities for residents, and COVID-19 testing. The impact of isolation on LTCF residents was reported as negative or very negative by over three-quarters of the respondents. Behavioral problems among residents increased in 32% of the facilities.

Emotional intelligence (EI) has a substantial impact on nurses success and performance in the healthcare industry. However, previous research studies report inconsistent findings regarding how different levels of EI affect job performance (JP), particularly during pandemics. The present study contributes to the literature on this contemporary topic by investigating the impact of EI on JP among nurses during COVID-19 crisis management in Saudi Arabia (SA). METHODS: In a convenience sampling, 340 nurses from three tertiary hospitals completed an online survey assessing EI and JP during COVID-19 climax levels in March and April, 2020. Only nurses who had direct contact with patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were eligible. The Wong & Law EI scale (WLEIS) was used in a cross-sectional design to determine participants EI. Empirically, JP was measured by the Individual Work Performance Questionnaire (IWPQ). Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software version 20.0 (IBM Corp). RESULTS: Generally, nurses reported, out of a 5-point Likert scale, moderate to high levels of EI (M = 3.99, SD = 0.434). Nurses in critical care units demonstrated the highest levels of EI, followed by nurses in intensive care, neonatal intensive care, then general nurses. Nurses working in respiratory therapy demonstrated the lowest levels. Across all groups during crisis, nurses reported a significant impact of EI on JP ( = 0.389, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Nurses reported satisfactory levels of EI, and most of their practices were aligned with national standards during COVID-19, but slightly in inverse to EI. However, more research is necessary to understand the greater impact of stressors influencing JP to the extent that levels of EI are no longer satisfactory.","output":"The Impact of Emotional Intelligence on Job Performance During COVID-19 Crisis: A Cross-Sectional Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES Image-guided thermal ablation is used to treat primary and secondary liver cancers. Evaluating completeness of ablation is difficult with standard intraoperative B-mode ultrasound. This study evaluates the ability of B-mode ultrasound (US) and tissue elastography to adequately measure the extent of ablation compared to pathologic assessment. MATERIALS AND METHODS An in vivo porcine model was used to compare B-mode ultrasonography and elastography to pathologic assessment of the microwave ablation zone area. In parallel, intraoperative ablations in patients were used to assess the ability of B-mode US and elastographic measures of tissue strain immediately after ablation to predict ablation size, compared to postprocedural computed tomography (CT). RESULTS In the animal model, ablation zones appeared to decrease in size when monitored with ultrasound over a 10-minute span with both B-mode US and elastography. Both techniques estimated smaller zones than gross pathology, however, the differences did not reach statistical significance. Biopsies from the edges of the ablation zone, as assessed by US, contained viable tissue in 75% of the cases. In the human model, B-mode US and elastography estimated similar ablation sizes; however, they underestimate the final size of the ablation defect as measured on postprocedure CT scan (median area [interquartile range]: CT, 7.3 cm(2) [5.2-9.5] vs. US 3.6 cm(2) [1.7-6.3] and elastography 4.1 cm(2) [1.4-5.1]; P = .005).

Many countries have implemented social distancing as a measure to flatten the curve of the ongoing epidemics. Evaluation of the impact of government-imposed social distancing and of other measures to control further spread of COVID-19 is urgent, especially because of the large societal and economic impact of the former. The aim of this study was to compare the individual and combined effectiveness of self-imposed prevention measures and of short-term government-imposed social distancing in mitigating, delaying, or preventing a COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a deterministic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 in a population stratified by disease status (susceptible, exposed, infectious with mild or severe disease, diagnosed, and recovered) and disease awareness status (aware and unaware) due to the spread of COVID-19. Self-imposed measures were assumed to be taken by disease-aware individuals and included handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing. Government-imposed social distancing reduced the contact rate of individuals irrespective of their disease or awareness status. The model was parameterized using current best estimates of key epidemiological parameters from COVID-19 clinical studies. The model outcomes included the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate, and time until the peak number of diagnoses. For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate and diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. We estimate that a large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term government-imposed social distancing alone is estimated to delay (by at most 7 months for a 3-month intervention) but not to reduce the peak. The delay can be even longer and the height of the peak can be additionally reduced if this intervention is combined with self-imposed measures that are continued after government-imposed social distancing has been lifted. Our analyses are limited in that they do not account for stochasticity, demographics, heterogeneities in contact patterns or mixing, spatial effects, imperfect isolation of individuals with severe disease, and reinfection with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that information dissemination about COVID-19, which causes individual adoption of handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing, can be an effective strategy to mitigate and delay the epidemic. Early initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden. We stress the importance of disease awareness in controlling the ongoing epidemic and recommend that, in addition to policies on social distancing, governments and public health institutions mobilize people to adopt self-imposed measures with proven efficacy in order to successfully tackle COVID-19.","output":"Impact of self-imposed prevention measures and short-term government-imposed social distancing on mitigating and delaying a COVID-19 epidemic: A modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread have created a global health emergency.

Our aim was to analyse whether a move to virtual care is beneficial and sustainable in a rheumatology outpatient setting. Methods Data on volume of unscheduled access to an outpatient rheumatology service and questionnaire feedback responses from patients and rheumatology clinicians on virtual consultations, was analysed. Results During the COVID-19 pandemic period of March - July 2020, our department saw a majority of face to face outpatient rheumatology clinic appointments transferred to virtual (telephone/video) with a significant reduction in the number of scheduled clinics. In addition, the volume of telephone appointments booked online by patients saw a 27.2% rise (n = 2248) compared to March - July 2019 (n = 1767), with a 23.7% increase in telephone helpline calls in the 2020 period (n = 3246) compared to 2019 (n = 2624) and over a 300% increase in email helpline activity. Questionnaire responses were obtained from 382 patients (Table 1). 86% of patients felt they got a lot out of a virtual appointment, but 13% would prefer not to use it again. Of the 16 healthcare providers that responded, 12 (75%) were satisfied with the virtual clinic set up, but only 2/16 (13%) felt the same could be achieved for patients in a virtual setting compared to a face-to-face visit. The lack of clinical examination was a major limitation for clinicians 12/16 (75%) and was similarly identified amongst patient feedback (42/260) (16%). Conclusion Virtual care with the provision for patient-led care allows convenience for the patient with high patient satisfaction, however this is not necessarily an approach that suits all. Clinicians must beware the non-complaining patient, and careful selection of those suitable for virtual care may be needed. Our model of patient led care using telephone appointments booked online by patients coupled with telephone/email helplines is a potential strategy for other centers to develop.

Pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) is a simple and safe treatment for neurogenic dysphagia. It has been shown that PES can restore safe swallowing in orally intubated or tracheotomized ICU patients with neurogenic dysphagia following severe stroke. We report the case of a patient with severe neurogenic post-extubation dysphagia (PED) due to prolonged intubation and severe general muscle weakness related to COVID-19, which was successfully treated using PES. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old Caucasian female patient with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection developed neurogenic dysphagia following prolonged intubation in the ICU. To avoid aerosol-generating procedures, her swallowing function was evaluated non-instrumentally as recommended by recently published international guidelines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her swallowing function was markedly impaired and PES therapy was recommended. PES led to a rapid improvement of the PED, as evaluated by bedside swallowing assessments using the Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS) and Dysphagia Severity Rating Scale (DSRS), and diet screening using the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS). The improved swallowing, as reflected by these measures, allowed this patient to transfer from the ICU to a non-intensive medical department 5 days after completing PES treatment. CONCLUSIONS: PES treatment contributed to the restoration of a safe swallowing function in this critically ill patient with COVID-19 and ICU-acquired swallowing dysfunction. Early clinical bedside swallowing assessment and dysphagia intervention in COVID-19 patients is crucial to optimize their full recovery. PES may contribute to a safe and earlier ICU discharge of patients with ICU-acquired swallowing dysfunction. Earlier ICU discharge and reduced rates of re-intubation following PES can help alleviate some of the pressure on ICU bed capacity, which is critical in times of a health emergency such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Successful treatment of intubation-induced severe neurogenic post-extubation dysphagia using pharyngeal electrical stimulation in a COVID-19 survivor: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contaminated water resources remain a major global concern regarding public health.

Traditional methods, recurring to slow and cumbersome culture-based approaches, have been gradually replaced by molecular methods, capable of faster and more specific screening. These are usually PCR-based methods that may allow for multiple pathogen detection but require dedicated laboratory equipment, hindering the rapid on-site assessment.

Developing an understanding of the consumer uses of topical cannabis is important for clinicians to provide appropriate counseling and inform potential areas of therapeutic development. We are examining the prevalence, purpose of use, and sources of information regarding topical cannabis in the Canadian population, with a focus on dermatologic uses. METHOD A cross-sectional, anonymous electronic, voluntary survey was developed to assess the use of topical cannabis amongst adults in Canada. RESULTS Cannabis was used topically at least once by 24.3% of respondents who started the survey. The commonest form of topical cannabis were creams (26.2%). The most common dermatologic conditions being treated with topical cannabis included atopic dermatitis (25%), acne (19%), and anti-aging (16%); for non-dermatologic conditions, common uses were for joint stiffness or tendonitis (30%) and headaches and migraines (27%). Topical cannabis was reported to be most effective for joint stiffness and tendonitis, general muscular soreness, headaches, eczema, pruritus, acne, and psoriasis. Most respondents obtained and received information about topical cannabis from dispensaries. CONCLUSION Canadians use topical cannabis for a broad range of systemic and dermatologic purposes, most of which have limited evidence.

The primary aim of CEST was to produce and sustain the best available COVID\\\\19 evidence to facilitate decision\\\\making in Saskatchewan, Canada. To achieve this objective, four provincial organizations partnered to establish a single, data\\\\driven system.The CEST partnership was driven by COVID\\\\19 questions from Emergency Operational Committee (EOC) of the Saskatchewan Health Authority. CEST included three processes: (a) clarifying the nature and priority of COVID\\\\19 policy and clinical questions;(b) providing Rapid Reviews (RRR) and Evidence Search Reports (ESR);and (c) seeking the requestors' evaluation of the product. A web\\\\based repository, including a dashboard and database, was designed to house ESRs and RRRs and offered a common platform for clinicians, academics, leaders, and policymakers to find COVID\\\\19 evidence.In CEST's first year, 114 clinical and policy questions have been posed resulting in 135 ESRs and 108 RRRs. While most questions (41.3%) originated with the EOC, several other teams were assembled to address a myriad of questions related to areas such as long\\\\term care, public health and prevention, infectious diseases, personal protective equipment, vulnerable populations, and Indigenous health. Initial challenges were mobilization of diverse partners and teams, remote work, lack of public access, and quality of emerging COVID\\\\19 literature. Current challenges indicate the need for institutional commitment for CEST sustainability. Despite these challenges, the CEST provided the Saskatchewan LHS with a template for successful collaboration.The urgency of COVID\\\\19 pandemic and the implementation of the CEST served to catalyze collaboration between different levels of a Saskatchewan LHS.

Lithium aluminum hydride is used to reduce oxygen containing surface groups to alcohols. The alcohols are then converted to carboxylic acids through a rhodium (II) acetate catalyzed carbene insertion reaction with tert-butyl diazoacetate and subsequent ester cleavage with trifluoroacetic acid.

More than 1 billion people worldwide are vitamin D deficient. If vitamin D deficiency is associated to incidence or severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a global call could be made for vitamin D supplementation to mitigate the pandemic. Objective: to determine if lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are correlated to the risk for COVID-19 and its severity as measured by CT Design: single-center observational study Setting: AZ Delta general hospital Participants: 186 consecutive patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized for COVID-19 from March 1, 2020 to April 7, 2020 Main outcome and measures: comparative analysis of 25(OH)D levels in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at various radiological stages and a season/age/sex-matched diseased control population Results: we report on 186 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients requiring hospitalization for severe COVID-19: 109 males (median age 68 years, IQR 53-79 years) and 77 females (median age 71 years, IQR 65-74 years). At admission patients were screened by CT to determine temporal changes of COVID-19 lung disease and classified as stage 1 (ground glass opacities), 2 (crazy paving pattern) and 3 (consolidation). At intake, 25(OH)D levels were measured and compared to a season-matched population of 2717 diseased controls, consisting of 999 males (median age 69 years, IQR 53-81 years) and 1718 females (median age 68 years, IQR 43-83 years). Male and female COVID-19 patients combined showed lower median 25(OH)D than controls (18.6 ng/mL, IQR 12.6-25.3, versus 21.5 ng/mL, IQR 13.9-30.8; P=0.0016) and a higher fraction of vitamin D deficiency (58.6% versus 45.2%, P=0.0005). A strong sexual dimorphism was found: female patients had comparable vitamin D status as control females. Male COVID-19 patients, however, showed markedly higher percentage of vitamin D deficiency than controls (67.0% versus 49.2%, P=0.0006) and this effect was more pronounced with advanced radiological stage ranging from 55.2% in stage 1 to 74% in stage 3.

Various systems have been developed for diagnosing patient with diseases, but intelligent and feasible solution to explore and monitor the accurate predictive health conditions of affected patients has not been provided yet. In this paper, a new Contactless IoT-enabled cloud-assisted health monitoring system has been designed and developed. The system is made up of unobtrusive sensors, a data acquisition unit, a microcontroller, wi-fi Module, Web server, and Web application or mobile application. It illustrates the design of the system to monitor and detect the severity of the coronavirus in the patients using various unobtrusive sensors to measure disease-specific vital parameters such as heart rate, temperature, oxygen level and pulse rate as main symptoms of the coronavirus are high fever, fatigue, and difficult breathing. Sensor acquired patient data is transformed using the HTTP protocol to cloud server using microcontroller and wi-fi module in real-time. Transformed data of patient condition is processed in the cloud server using data predictive algorithms such as Severity Defined Convolution Neural Network with respect to data collected and severity specific data thresholds and severity class predicted patient information will alarm the healthcare provider on the abnormalities detected in the patient health. A particular model is capable of forecasting the health situation of the patients. Experimental analysis of the proposed architectures finds it effective in monitoring the status of the severity of breathing on the patients.

Many infectious microbial and viral diseases have been shown to respond to A. annua and communities around the world use the plant as a medicinal tea, especially for treating malaria. Aim of the Study SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of Covid-19) globally has infected and killed millions of people. Because of the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of artemisinin that includes blockade of SARS-CoV-1, we queried whether A. annua suppressed SARS-CoV-2. Materials and Methods Using Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells, we measured anti viral activity SARS-CoV-2 activity against fully infectious virusof dried leaf extracts of seven cultivars of A. annua sourced from four continents. IC50s were calculated and defined as (the concentrations that inhibited viral replication by 50%.) and CC50s (the concentrations that kill 50% of cells) were calculated. Results Hot-water leaf extracts based on artemisinin, total flavonoids, or dry leaf mass showed antiviral activity with IC50 values of 0.1-8.7 M, 0.01-0.14 g, and 23.4-57.4 g, respectively. Antiviral efficacy did not correlate with artemisinin or total flavonoid contents of the extracts. One dried leaf sample was >12 years old, yet the hot-water extract was still found to be active. The UK and South African variants, B1.1.7 and B1.351, were similarly inhibited. While all hot water extracts were effective, concentrations of artemisinin and total flavonoids varied by nearly 100-fold in the extracts. Artemisinin alone showed an estimated IC50 of about 70 M, and the clinically used artemisinin derivatives artesunate, artemether, and dihydroartemisinin were ineffective or cytotoxic at elevated micromolar concentrations. In contrast, the antimalarial drug amodiaquine had an IC50 = 5.8 M. Extracts had minimal effects on infection of Vero E6 or Calu-3 cells by a reporter virus pseudotyped by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. There was no cytotoxicity within an order of magnitude above the antiviral IC90 values. Conclusions A. annua extracts inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the active component(s) in the extracts is likely something besides artemisinin or a combination of components that block virus infection at a step downstream of virus entry. Further studies will determine in vivo efficacy to assess whether A. annua might provide a cost-effective therapeutic to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.

As a step towards understanding these interconnections, we pose a simple game-theoretic model of a global pandemic in which individuals can choose where to live, and we investigate the global behavior that may emerge as a result of individuals reacting locally to the competing costs of isolation and infection. We study the game-theoretic equilibria that emerge from this setup when the population is composed of either selfish or altruistic individuals. First, we demonstrate that as is typical in these types of games, selfish equilibria are in general not optimal, but that all stable selfish equilibria are within a constant factor of optimal. Second, there exist infinitely-many stable altruistic equilibria;all but finitely-many of these are worse than the worst selfish equilibrium, and the social cost of altruistic equilibria is unbounded. Our work is in sharp contrast to recent work in network congestion games in which all altruistic equilibria are socially optimal. This suggests that a population without central coordination may react very poorly to a pandemic, and that individual altruism could even exacerbate the problem.","output":"Individual Altruism Cannot Overcome Congestion Effects in a Global Pandemic Game"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AJOL Abstract: After half of a century as a major oil producer, the Nigerian economy is yet to diversify;thus, remains dominated by primary activities. Whereas oil and gas activities directly employ a negligible number of Nigerians, the industry impacts on the overall economy of the country. However, with large resource windfalls, limited technical capacity, and weak check and balances, the scope for inefficiency, corruption, and elite capture of Nigerias oil-driven economy is substantial. Consequently, the arrival of COVID-19 further exposed the fragility of the economy.

The secondary data were derived mainly from journals, books and empirical case studies on the impact of pandemics on global production of petroleum, the Nigerian economy, and the overall social sector. News media analysis, government bulletins, and relevant data from civil society organizations, State Security Forces, and Corporate organizations on the debilitating consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic were also reviewed. The paper revealed that the socio-economic implications of the pandemic derived from fall in global oil price, policy interventions by the government such as bans on certain types of activities, closure of borders, state lockdowns, school closure and social distancing policies, all of which resulted in disruptions felt in all the sectors of the economy and society.

METHODS: IBD patients followed before March 8(th), 2020 were included and divided into 3 groups (Fig.1): group 1, patients on endovenous biologics (EV); group 2, patients on biologics administered subcutaneously (SC); and group 3, patients on conventional treatments (CT) at the start of lockdown. The primary outcome was to assess the occurrence of disease flare in the three groups since only the EV group received face-to-face visits during lockdown. As secondary outcome we assessed the number of control endoscopies performed and the start of new biologic therapies, compared with a reference period in 2019. [Image: see text] RESULTS: A total of 689 patients (CD: 369, UC 320) were included in the study (247 IV, 217 SC and 225 CT, respectively). Telemedicine was more frequently adopted in SC and CS, (p<0.001) both. Treatment delays or transitory stops were more frequent in EV (p<0.001), whereas there was a significantly greater need to change therapy (p= 0.038) and need for steroids (p = 0.008) in the SC group compared with EV (Tab.1). Concerning endoscopies, compared with the reference period in 2019 only 25% of scheduled endoscopies were performed. The only risk factor for disease flare during or shortly after lockdown was belonging to the patient groups subjected to telemedicine (SC and CT groups) (p < 0.001).

Delays are more common in urban-residing patients, although factors specific to surgical delays among rural and urban patients are not well understood. METHODS: We used a 100% sample of fee-for-service Medicare claims during 2007C2014 to identify 238,491 women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer undergoing initial surgery and assessed whether they experienced biopsy-to-surgery intervals > 90 days. We employed multilevel regression to identify associations between delays and patient, regional, and surgeon characteristics, both in combined analyses and stratified by rurality of patient residence. RESULTS: Delays were more prevalent among urban patients (2.5%) than rural patients (1.9%). Rural patients with medium- or high-volume surgeons had lower odds of delay than patients with low-volume surgeons (odds ratio [OR] = 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.58C0.88; OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.61C0.90).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess real-time public awareness and behavioral responses to the COVID-19 epidemic across 12 selected countries. METHODS: Internet surveillance was used to collect real-time data from the general public to assess public awareness and rumors (China: Baidu; worldwide: Google Trends) and behavior responses (China: Ali Index; worldwide: Google Shopping). These indices measured the daily number of searches or purchases and were compared with the numbers of daily COVID-19 cases. The trend comparisons across selected countries were observed from December 1, 2019 (prepandemic baseline) to April 11, 2020 (at least one month after the governments of selected countries took actions for the pandemic). RESULTS: We identified missed windows of opportunity for early epidemic control in 12 countries, when public awareness was very low despite the emerging epidemic. China's epidemic and the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern did not prompt a worldwide public reaction to adopt health-protective measures; instead, most countries and regions only responded to the epidemic after their own case counts increased. Rumors and misinformation led to a surge of sales in herbal remedies in China and antimalarial drugs worldwide, and timely clarification of rumors mitigated the rush to purchase unproven remedies. CONCLUSIONS: Our comparative study highlights the urgent need for international coordination to promote mutual learning about epidemic characteristics and effective control measures as well as to trigger early and timely responses in individual countries.

This study aimed to investigate the variation in radiation therapy fractionation in breast cancer patients in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, and to estimate survival outcome and cost implications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a population-based cohort of patients who received radiation therapy for breast cancer (2009-2013), as captured in the NSW Central Cancer Registry. A logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with fractionation type. Survival outcome was estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Cost per treatment and potential cost saving associated with evidence-based fractionation was estimated. RESULTS: A total of 10,482 patients were available for analysis, divided into 3 cohorts (breast alone: N = 7000; breast + nodes: N = 1119; all chestwall: N = 2363). In multivariable analysis, increasing age, laterality (right), year of treatment (2013), early stage, lower socioeconomic status, and regional area of residence were independent predictors of hypofractionation for breast alone radiation therapy. For the breast + nodes and chest wall cohorts, common factors that predicted the use of hypofractionation were increasing age. In multivariable survival analysis, there was no difference between the fractionation regimens at 5 years. Estimated radiation therapy cost of this cohort approximated $52.1 million, compared with $38.5 million had these patients been treated with evidence-based fractionation. This demonstrated a potential saving of $13.6 million. CONCLUSION: Hypofractionation appears underused for breast radiation therapy in NSW over time.

These changes include the wearing of face masks, social distancing, and testing and self-isolating when unwell. The success of these measures depends on (1) the willingness of individuals to change their behaviour and (2) their commitment and capacity to translate that intention into actions. Consequently, understanding and predicting the willingness of individuals to change their behaviour, and their enthusiasm to act on that willingness, is critical in assessing the likely effectiveness of these measures in slowing the spread of the virus. In this paper we analyse responses to two separate regional surveys about peoples intentions and behaviour with respect to preventing the spread of COVID-19 in New Zealand. While motivations and intentions were largely similar across the regions, there was marked difference in action across the regions, specifically with respect to the frequency of wearing face masks. Our analysis suggests that the translation of intention (preventing the spread of COVID-19) into action (as measured by self-reported frequency of face mask use) was strongly associated with perceptions of the risk of infection (as measured by regional case numbers). The results highlight the importance to policy design of distinguishing the factors that might influence the formation of behavioural intentions from those that might influence the implementation of those intentions.","output":"Motivation, intention and action: wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is one of the most common HIV-related opportunistic infection.

Plastic breaks down into micro/nano particles due to physical or chemical or biological actions into environment. Due to small dimensions, ubiquitous and persistent nature, the plastic particles represent a significant threat to ecosystems and can entry into food chains. Among the plastic polymers used for PPEs, polystyrene is less studied regarding its eco-geno-toxicity. This study aims to investigate acute, chronic and subchronic effects of the microplastic polystyrene beads (PS-MP, size 1.0 m) on three freshwater species, the alga Raphidocelis subcapitata, the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, the crustacean Ceriodaphnia dubia and the benthic ostracod Heterocypris incongruens. Furthermore, the potential genotoxicity and the ROS production due to the PS-MP were also determined in C. dubia. Results revealed that the acute effects occurred at concentrations of PS-MP in the order of dozens of mg/L in B. calyciflorus and C. dubia and hundreds of mg/L in H. incongruens. Regarding long-term toxicity, increasing chronic effects with EC50s in the order of units (C. dubia), hundreds (B. calyciflorus) and thousands (R. subcapitata) of g/L were observed. Both for acute and chronic/sub chronic toxicity, daphnids were more sensitive to polystyrene than ostracods. Moreover, when C. dubia neonates were exposed to the PS-MP, alterations in genetic material as well as the production of ROS occurred, starting from concentrations in the order of units of g/L, probably due to inflammatory responses.

METHOD: Using a standardized questionnaire, we collected information on the travelers demographic characteristics and illness before, during, and after the flight. We also collected data on factors potentially associated with COVID-19 transmission during the flight. RESULTS: A total of 16 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed among all passengers; the overall attack rate was 4.8%. The attack rate among passengers who had departed from Wuhan was significantly higher than that among those who had departed from other places. One passenger without an epidemiological history of exposure before boarding developed COVID-19. During the flight, he was seated near four infected passengers from Wuhan for approximately an hour and did not wear his facemask correctly during the flight.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 40 patients who underwent single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy and 20 patients who underwent hysterectomy via natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. Patients' age, body mass index, history of previous delivery and surgery, total operation time (from skin incision to closure), intraoperative and postoperative complications conversion to another surgical procedure, drop of hemoglobin level, postoperative pain at 1 and 18 h, average hospital stay, and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Hysterectomy via transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery was superior to single-port hysterectomy concerning the length of hospitalization (p < 0.001) and visual analog scale at 1 h (p = 0.024) and 18 h (p < 0.001). In transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic group, postoperative complications were lower than single-port laparoscopy group (p = 0.023). In transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopy, group conversion to a standard vaginal hysterectomy occurred in two cases (10%). Four patients in the single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy group had umbilical herniation, three had port-site infections, and two patients had vaginal cuff hematoma. These patients required rehospitalization. CONCLUSIONS Despite hysterectomy via transvaginal natural orifice transluminal surgery has not yet found its place in routine practice in gynecology departments, it could be a prominent alternative approach to other minimally invasive surgical procedures in selected patients with many advantages including lesser pain and lower complication rates compared with single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy.","output":"Hysterectomy via transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery versus single-port laparoscopy: Comparison of early outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still increasing rapidly, but little is known about the prevalence and characteristics of fatal cases in children in Indonesia.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data collected from the medical records of patients with COVID-19 admitted to Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia from March to October 2020. RESULTS: During the study period, 490 patients were admitted and diagnosed with suspected and probable COVID-19. Of these patients, 50 (10.2%) were confirmed to have COVID-19, and 20 (40%) had a fatal outcome. The fatality rate was higher in patients aged &#8805;10 years, categorized with severe disease upon admission, PaO2/FiO2 ratio &#8804;300 mmHg and chronic underlying diseases. The most common clinical manifestations were generalized symptoms, while acute respiratory distress syndrome (8/20) and septic shock (7/20) were the two most common causes of death.

The impact of neutralising antibody waning rate at the individual patient level on the longevity of immunity remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the peak levels and dynamics of neutralising antibody waning and IgG avidity maturation over time, and correlate this with clinical parameters, cytokines, and T-cell responses. Methods: We did a longitudinal study of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 up to day 180 post-symptom onset by monitoring changes in neutralising antibody levels using a previously validated surrogate virus neutralisation test. Changes in antibody avidities and other immune markers at different convalescent stages were determined and correlated with clinical features. Using a machine learning algorithm, temporal change in neutralising antibody levels was classified into five groups and used to predict the longevity of neutralising antibody-mediated immunity. Findings: We approached 517 patients for participation in the study, of whom 288 consented for outpatient follow-up and collection of serial blood samples. 164 patients were followed up and had adequate blood samples collected for analysis, with a total of 546 serum samples collected, including 128 blood samples taken up to 180 days post-symptom onset. We identified five distinctive patterns of neutralising antibody dynamics as follows: negative, individuals who did not, at our intervals of sampling, develop neutralising antibodies at the 30% inhibition level (19 [12%] of 164 patients); rapid waning, individuals who had varying levels of neutralising antibodies from around 20 days after symptom onset, but seroreverted in less than 180 days (44 [27%] of 164 patients); slow waning, individuals who remained neutralising antibody-positive at 180 days post-symptom onset (52 [29%] of 164 patients); persistent, although with varying peak neutralising antibody levels, these individuals had minimal neutralising antibody decay (52 [32%] of 164 patients); and delayed response, a small group that showed an unexpected increase of neutralising antibodies during late convalescence (at 90 or 180 days after symptom onset; three [2%] of 164 patients). Persistence of neutralising antibodies was associated with disease severity and sustained level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. By contrast, T-cell responses were similar among the different neutralising antibody dynamics groups. On the basis of the different decay dynamics, we established a prediction algorithm that revealed a wide range of neutralising antibody longevity, varying from around 40 days to many decades. Interpretation: Neutralising antibody response dynamics in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 vary greatly, and prediction of immune longevity can only be accurately determined at the individual level. Our findings emphasise the importance of public health and social measures in the ongoing pandemic outbreak response, and might have implications for longevity of immunity after vaccination.

Methods: 206 patients who were hospitalized between 20.03.2020- 05.05.2020 with a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia were analyzed retrospectively. Serum Troponin-I and D-dimer levels were recorded at least 10 days. Results: Average age was higher in mortality group compared to nonmortality group (respectively 67.7914.9, 56.8718.15, p:<0.001). Presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, previous coronary bypass surgery, heart failure, chronic renal failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were statistically significant affecting mortality (respectively p:0.003, p:0.004, p:0.045, p:0.02, p:0.003, p:0.007). First 10 days measurements of Troponin-I and D-dimer values was associated with mortality and intensive care requirement (p<0.001). Both Troponin-I and D-dimer were higher in mortality group compared to the patients requiring intensive care. Troponin- I value on the 7th day 16.05 pg/ml was related with need for intensive care (AUC: 0.896, sensitivity: %78.6, specificity: %78.3, p<0.001). Troponin-I value 30.25 pg/ml on the 9th day was related with mortality (AUC: 0.920, sensitivity: %89.5, specificity: %89.3, p<0.001). D-dimer value 878 hg/ml on the 2nd day was associated with intensive care need (AUC: 0.896, sensitivity: %78.6, specificity %78.3, p<0.001). D-dimer value 1106 hg/ml on the 10th day was associated with mortality (AUC: 0.817, sensitivity: %68.4, specificity: %65.2, p<0.001).

Our findings suggest that disulfiram acts as an allosteric inhibitor of MERS-CoV PL(pro) but as a competitive (or mixed) inhibitor of SARS-CoV PL(pro). The phenomenon of slow-binding inhibition and the irrecoverability of enzyme activity after removing unbound disulfiram indicate covalent inactivation of SARS-CoV PL(pro) by disulfiram, while synergistic inhibition of MERS-CoV PL(pro) by disulfiram and 6-thioguanine or mycophenolic acid implies the potential for combination treatments using these three clinically available drugs.","output":"Disulfiram can inhibit MERS and SARS coronavirus papain-like proteases via different modes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is resulting in ethical decisions regarding resource allocation.

Extensive studies suggested the role of Vitamin D in suppressing cytokine storm in COVID-19 and reducing viral infection; however, the precise molecular mechanism is not clearly known. In this work, bioinformatics and systems biology approaches were used to understand SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine pathways and the potential mechanism of Vitamin D in suppressing cytokine storm and enhancing antiviral response. RESULTS: This study used transcriptome data and identified 108 differentially expressed host genes (DEHGs) in SARS-CoV-2 infected normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells compared to control. Then, the DEHGs was integrated with the human protein-protein interaction data to generate a SARS-CoV-2 induced host gene regulatory network (SiHgrn). Analysis of SiHgrn identified a sub-network Cluster 1 with the highest MCODE score, 31 up-regulated genes, and predominantly associated immune and inflammatory response. Interestingly, the iRegulone tool identified that Cluster 1 is under the regulation of transcription factors STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, POU2F2, and NFkB1, collectively referred to as host response signature network. Functional enrichment analysis with NDEx revealed that the host response signature network is predominantly associated with critical pathways, including cytokines and inflammatory response, non-genomic action of Vitamin D, the human immune response to tuberculosis, and lung fibrosis. Finally, in-depth analysis and literature mining revealed that Vitamin D binds with its receptor and could work through two different pathways: (i) it inhibits the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines through blocking the TNF induced NFkB1 signaling pathway; and (ii) it initiates the expression of interferon-stimulating genes (ISGs) for antiviral defense program through activating the IFN- induced Jak-STAT signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: This comprehensive study identified the pathways associated with cytokine storm in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The proposed underlying mechanism of Vitamin D could be promising in suppressing the cytokine storm and inducing a robust antiviral response in severe COVID-19 patients.

Objective To study the association between use of ACEIs/ARBs with the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 and to study outcome data in subsets of patients taking ACEIs/ARBs who tested positive with severity of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (eg, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and requirement for mechanical ventilation). Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study with overlap propensity score weighting was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio and Florida. All patients tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and April 12, 2020, were included. Exposures History of taking ACEIs or ARBs at the time of COVID-19 testing. Main Outcomes and Measures Results of COVID-19 testing in the entire cohort, number of patients requiring hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and mechanical ventilation among those who tested positive. Results A total of 18 472 patients tested for COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 49 (21) years, 7384 (40%) were male, and 12 725 (69%) were white. Of 18 472 patients who underwent COVID-19 testing, 2285 (12.4%) were taking either ACEIs or ARBs. A positive COVID-19 test result was observed in 1735 of 18 472 patients (9.4%).

We tested three commercial sVNT (a qualitative immunochromatographic test and two quantitative immunoassays named YHLO and TECO) together with a conventional anti-spike IgG assay (bioMerieux) in comparison with an in-house plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) using the original 19A strain and different variants of concern (VOC), on a panel of 306 sera from naturally-infected or vaccinated patients. The qualitative test was rapidly discarded because of poor sensitivity and specificity. Areas under the curve of YHLO and TECO assays were, respectively, 85.83 and 84.07 (p-value >0.05) using a positivity threshold of 20 for PRNT50, and 95.63 and 90.35 (p-value =0.02) using a threshold of 80.

Changes in public behavior were more common during the pandemic to protect against the infection. Suboptimal behavioral practices for a specific disease would increase the susceptibility of the public to infection. This study aimed to determine changes in behaviors of the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online questionnaire survey to determine the extent of public behavioral changes in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected with a self-reported survey, and analysis was conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 26 (SPSS). A chi-square test was performed to determine the association among variables. A P  0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of 348 respondents, 244 (70.1%) were male, and 270 (77.6%) had a university degree. Approximately 48% used social media to seek COVID-19 information, and 36% (n = 124) avoided large gatherings. Approximately one-fourth of the respondents always avoided public transportation, while 65.8% reported avoiding traveling to infected areas. Of the participants, 33% always washed their hands, while 36% always used an alcohol-based sanitizer. There was a significant association between age group and employment status with respect to hand washing frequency (p < 0.05). There was also a significant association between age group (p < 0.0001) and employment status and wearing of face masks (p < 0.048).

We enrolled 5109 patients from 30 institutions (average age 68.7  11.4 years, 52.4% males). We investigated the determinants of the CAVI by separating the patients into three groups: 970 middle-aged (<60 years), 3252 elderly (60-79 years), and 887 very elderly (80 years) patients.

The meaning of \\"fever\\" varies depending on the cutoff temperature used, the type of thermometer, the time of the day, the site of measurements, and the person's gender and race. The absence of a universally accepted definition for fever has been especially problematic during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This investigation determined the extent to which fever is defined in COVID-19 publications, with special attention to those associated with pregnancy. Results Of 53 publications identified in which \\"fever\\" is reported as a manifestation of COVID-19 illness, none described the method used to measure patient's temperatures. Only 10 (19%) publications specified the minimum temperature used to define a fever with values that varied from a 37.3 C (99.1 F) to 38.1 C (100.6 F). Conclusions There is a disturbing lack of precision in defining fever in COVID-19 publications. Given the many factors influencing temperature measurements in humans, there can never be a single, universally accepted temperature cut-off defining a fever. This clinical reality should not prevent precision in reporting fever. To achieve the precision and improve scientific and clinical communication, when fever is reported in clinical investigations, at a minimum the cut-off temperature used in determining the presence of fever, the anatomical site at which temperatures are taken, and the instrument used to measure temperatures should each be described.

This government action combined with the application of social distancing should in principle reduce the frequency of occurrence of ocular injuries. The goal of our work is to try to understand the circumstances of the occurrence of ocular injuries at the IOTA Teaching Hospital during the lock-down period of the COVID-19 health crisis. METHODOLOGY: This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study. The data were collected prospectively. Our study covered the period from March to May 2020. All consenting patients seen at the IOTA Teaching Hospital for ocular trauma regardless of gender, age, circumstances in which the trauma occurred or the nature of the injuries were included by non-probability sampling. Excluded from the study were patients who did not consent or who consulted for a non-traumatic ophthalmologic condition. RESULTS: There were a total of 138 cases, of which 84 were male and 54 female, for a gender ratio of M/F=1.5. Children aged 0 to 5 years represented more than 3/4 (79.14%) of our sample. Trauma occurred in 45.83% of cases during leisure activities and 3.60% of cases involved domestic violence. DISCUSSION: According to the authors, measures aimed at limiting public movement, particularly the curfews introduced by the Malian government to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, may actually result in trauma. CONCLUSION: Raising public awareness of the social and psychological consequences of lock-down through audiovisual means might significantly reduce the frequency of these ocular traumas.","output":"[Eye traumatism during the COVID-19 sanitary crisis at Iota-teaching hospital]./ Traumatismes oculaires pendant la crise sanitaire de COVID-19 au CHU de Iota"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objective: Frontline healthcare workers face unprecedented stress from the current SARS COV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Methods: In this community case report, we describe a well-being support rounding program that was developed to deliver Psychological First Aid (PFA) to frontline healthcare workers in a large urban medical center to maintain their sense of psychological well-being and self-efficacy. A team of clinicians from the department of psychiatry, who were trained on the Johns Hopkins RAPID model (Reflective Listening, Assessment, Prioritization, Intervention, and Disposition) to provide PFA, were deployed throughout the hospital. These clinicians carried out daily well-being rounds from April to June during the peak of the pandemic. Results: Approximately 20% of the frontline staff members were going through an acute crisis and benefited from PFA. Anxiety, anger, exhaustion, economic worry, job insecurity, dehumanized interactions with patients due to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and stress of taking care of sick and dying patients without their families present, were the main themes identified by the staff. The deployed team used active listening, mindfulness, validation, reframing and other cognitive interventions to support staff. Conclusions: Our experience suggests that frontline staff are willing to engage with in-person, on-site support programs.

However, in advanced colorectal cancer, the combination fails to improve survival. As the reason for the lack of activity is unknown, our study aims to determine the effect of bevacizumab on targeting of anti-EGFR and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) antibodies in tumors with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT imaging. Mice with subcutaneous EGFR and IGF-1R-expressing SUM149 xenografts received a single dose of bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) or saline. After 4 days, mice were injected with radiolabeled cetuximab or R1507, an anti-IGF-1R antibody. A control group received a radiolabeled irrelevant IgG (hLL2). Three days later, SPECT/CT images were acquired and mice were dissected to determine the concentration of antibodies in the tissues. Tumors were analyzed immunohistochemically to determine vascular density (CD34), VEGF, EGFR and IGF-1R expression. SPECT/CT imaging revealed that bevacizumab treatment significantly reduced tumor targeting of radiolabeled cetuximab by 40% from 33.1  1.1 %ID/g to 19.8  5.7 %ID/g (p = 0.009) for untreated and bevacizumab-treated tumors, respectively. A similar effect was found for (111) In-R1507: tumor targeting of R1507 decreased by 35%. No significant differences in tumor uptake were observed in mice that received an irrelevant IgG. Uptake in normal organs was not altered by bevacizumab. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that vascular density decreased with 43%, whereas EGFR and IGF-1R expression was unaltered. In conclusion, bevacizumab treatment significantly reduces tumor targeting of anti-EGFR and anti-IGF-1R antibodies.

To contain this virus, researchers are working around the clock for a solution in the form of vaccine. Due to the impact of this pandemic, the economy and healthcare have immensely suffered around the globe. Thus, an efficient vaccine design is the need of the hour. Moreover, to have a generalised vaccine for heterogeneous human population, the virus genomes from different countries should be considered. Thus, in this work, we have performed genome-wide analysis of 10,664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries around the globe in order to identify the potential conserved regions for the development of peptide based synthetic vaccine viz. epitopes with high immunogenic and antigenic scores. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment technique viz. Clustal Omega is used to align the 10,664 SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes. Thereafter, entropy is computed for each genomic coordinate of the aligned genomes. The entropy values are then used to find the conserved regions. These conserved regions are refined based on the criteria that their lengths should be greater than or equal to 60 nt and their corresponding protein sequences are without any stop codons. Furthermore, Nucleotide BLAST is used to verify the specificity of the conserved regions. As a result, we have obtained 17 conserved regions that belong to NSP3, NSP4, NSP6, NSP8, RdRp, Helicase, endoRNAse, 2-O-RMT, Spike glycoprotein, ORF3a protein, Membrane glycoprotein and Nucleocapsid protein. Finally, these conserved regions are used to identify the T-cell and B-cell epitopes with their corresponding immunogenic and antigenic scores. Based on these scores, the most immunogenic and antigenic epitopes are then selected for each of these 17 conserved regions. Hence, we have obtained 30 MHC-I and 24 MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes with 14 and 13 unique HLA alleles and 21 B-cell epitopes for the 17 conserved regions. Moreover, for validating the relevance of these epitopes, the binding conformation of the MHC-I and MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes are shown with respect to HLA alleles. Also, the physico-chemical properties of the epitopes are reported along with Ramchandran plots and Z-Scores and the population coverage is shown as well. Overall, the analysis shows that the identified epitopes can be considered as potential candidates for vaccine design.","output":"Immunogenicity and antigenicity based T-cell and B-cell epitopes identification from conserved regions of 10664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the United States, COVID-19 is a nationally notifiable disease, meaning cases and hospitalizations are reported to the CDC by states. Identifying and reporting every case from every facility in the United States may not be feasible in the long term. Creating sustainable methods for estimating burden of COVID-19 from established sentinel surveillance systems is becoming more important. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to provide a method leveraging surveillance data to create a long-term solution to estimate monthly rates of hospitalizations for COVID-19. METHODS: We estimated monthly hospitalization rates for COVID-19 from May 2020 through April 2021 for the 50 states using surveillance data from COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) and a Bayesian hierarchical model for extrapolation. Hospitalization rates are calculated from patients hospitalized with a lab confirmed SARS-CoV-2 test during or within 14 days before admission. We created a model for six age groups (0-17, 18-49, 50-64, 65-74, 75-84, and 85 years), separately. We identified covariates from multiple data sources that varied by age, state, and/or month, and performed covariate selection for each age group based on two methods, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Spike and Slab selection methods. We validated our method by checking sensitivity of model estimates to covariate selection and model extrapolation as well as comparing our results to external data. RESULTS: We estimated 3,583,100 (90% Credible Interval:3,250,500 - 3,945,400) hospitalizations for a cumulative incidence of 1,093.9 (992.4 - 1,204.6) hospitalizations per 100,000 population with COVID-19 in the United States from May 2020 through April 2021. Cumulative incidence varied from 359 - 1,856 per 100,000 between states. The age group with the highest cumulative incidence was aged 85 years (5,575.6; 5,066.4 - 6,133.7). The monthly hospitalization rate was highest in December (183.7; 154.3 - 217.4). Our monthly estimates by state showed variations in magnitudes of peak rates, number of peaks and timing of peaks between states. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel approach to estimate hospitalizations with COVID-19 has potential to provide sustainable estimates for monitoring COVID-19 burden, as well as a flexible framework leveraging surveillance data.","output":"Estimating COVID-19 Hospitalizations in the United States with Surveillance Data Using a Bayesian Hierarchical Model: A Modeling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 virus can lead to variable clinical outcomes. Approximately 40% of those infected will remain asymptomatic; with a similar percentage developing a mild to moderate illness, essentially localized to the respiratory system. A markedly more severe and extensive illness involving multiple organs occurs in the remaining approximately 20% of those infected. A further intriguing consequence of Covid\\\\19 disease is the continuing illness in about 10% of those with either the mild to moderate or the more severe acute Covid\\\\19 disease. This Long Covid\\\\19 syndrome has many features in common with the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The concept of coinfecting virus pathogens is central to understanding several human diseases. Another useful concept is that of stealth adapted viruses. These viruses differ from the viruses from which they are derived in not typically evoking inflammation. This is because of deletion or mutation of the genes coding for the relatively few virus components that are normally targeted by the cellular immune system. It is a generic process that can potentially apply to all viruses, including the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 virus. Stealth adaptation has occurred with the cytomegaloviruses of rhesus and African green monkeys. Kidney cells from African green monkeys are still being used to produce poliovirus vaccines. DNA sequencing studies on these monkey\\\\derived stealth adapted viruses show that in addition to deletions or mutations of some of the originating virus genes, stealth adaptation can involve the incorporation of additional genetic sequences from cells, other viruses, and bacteria. These renegade sequences become components within the reformed, replicating and infectious stealth adapted viruses. The variable and diverse genetic compositions of different stealth adapted viruses are likely to at least occasionally include some elements that are interactive with genes of the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 virus. This could lead to the potentiation of either or both viruses with added pathogenicity for the infected individual. Moreover, although the residual virus components may not be ordinarily immunogenic, some may become so if the virus levels are greatly increased and/or the immune system is sufficiently stimulated. A strong case can be made for a role of stealth adapted viruses in patients with the Long Covid\\\\19 syndrome. These patients can be divided into those who had similar but milder symptoms prior to Covid\\\\19 and those who had previously been asymptomatic. The former patients were probably infected earlier with a stealth adapted virus, which has now become potentiated through its interaction with the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 virus. The later patients are likely to be newly infected with a stealth adapted SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 virus. The next step in exploring this hypothesis is to culture the blood of patients for evidence of infection with stealth adapted viruses, followed by genetic sequencing of the positive cultures. The testing should include patients who have experienced severe acute Covid\\\\19 illness and patients with the Long Covid\\\\19 syndrome. Identifying severe acute Covid\\\\19 illness as a co\\\\infection and the realization that the Long Covid\\\\19 syndrome is also an infectious and transmissible disease will have important Public Health implications with regards to an expanding spectrum of human illnesses.","output":"Do Stealth Adapted Viruses Predispose to More Severe and Prolonged Covid\\\\19 Illness?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: With the adoption of powerful preventive and therapeutic measures, a large number of patients with COVID-19 have recovered and been discharged from hospitals in Wuhan, China. Prevention of epidemic rebound is a top priority of current works. However, information regarding post-discharge quarantine and surveillance of recovered patients with COVID-19 is scarce. Methods: This study followed up 337 patients with COVID-19 in a Wuhan East-West Lake Fangcang shelter hospital during the post-discharge quarantine. Demographic, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, and chest computed tomography (CT) image, mental state, medication status, and nucleic acid test data were summarized and analyzed. Results: 21/337 (6.2%) patients were SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid re-positive, and 4 /337(1.2%) patients were suspected positive. The median day interval between the discharge to nucleic acid re-positivity was 7.5 days (IQR, 6C13), ranging from 6 to 13 days. Cough/expectoration are the most common symptoms, followed by chest congestion/dyspnea during the 2 weeks post-discharge quarantine. Risk factors of nucleic acid re-positivity including the number of lobes infiltration (odds ratio[OR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09C1.19), distribution (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.13C0.19), CT imaging feature of patchy shadowing accompanying with consolidation (OR, 9.36; 95% CI, 7.84C11.17), respiratory symptoms of cough accompanying with expectoration (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.28C1.52), and chest congestion accompanying by dyspnea (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.28C1.57).

Adult male and female golden Syrian hamsters (8-10 weeks of age) were inoculated intranasally with 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2/USA-WA1/2020 and euthanized at several time points during the acute (i.e., virus actively replicating) and recovery (i.e., after the infectious virus has been cleared) phases of infection. There was no mortality, but infected male hamsters experienced greater morbidity, losing a greater percentage of body mass, developing more extensive pneumonia as noted on chest computed tomography, and recovering more slowly than females. Treatment of male hamsters with estradiol did not alter pulmonary damage. Virus titers in respiratory tissues, including nasal turbinates, trachea, and lungs, and pulmonary cytokine concentrations, including IFN and TNF, were comparable between the sexes. However, during the recovery phase of infection, females mounted two-fold greater IgM, IgG, and IgA responses against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein (S-RBD) in both plasma and respiratory tissues. Female hamsters also had significantly greater IgG antibodies against whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and mutant S-RBDs, as well as virus neutralizing antibodies in plasma. The development of an animal model to study COVID-19 sex differences will allow for a greater mechanistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 associated sex differences seen in the human population. Importance Men experience more severe outcomes from COVID-19 than women. Golden Syrian hamsters were used to explore sex differences in the pathogenesis of a human clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. After inoculation, male hamsters experienced greater sickness, developed more severe lung pathology, and recovered more slowly than females. Sex differences in disease could not be reversed by estradiol treatment in males and were not explained by either virus replication kinetics or the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in the lungs. During the recovery period, antiviral antibody responses in the respiratory tract and plasma, including to newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, were greater in females than male hamsters. Greater lung pathology during the acute phase combined with reduced antiviral antibody responses during the recovery phase of infection in males than females illustrate the utility of golden Syrian hamsters as a model to explore sex differences in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and vaccine-induced immunity and protection.

To ensure patient and staff safety, the hospital rapidly shifted to deliver most of these services via telerehabilitation. The purposes of this study were to (1) describe the rapid implementation of telerehabilitation during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) describe the demographic characteristics of patients who continued in-person services and those who received telerehabilitation, and (3) evaluate the therapists' perceptions of telerehabilitation for physical and occupational therapy. Most of the children (83.4% of n=1352) received telerehabilitation services. A family was more likely to choose to continue in-person visits if their child was <1-year-old, had a diagnosis of torticollis, received serial casting, or was post-surgical.

As hand washing comes down to an individual's behaviour, we aimed to study how individual psychological variables influence hand washing over time during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN Over the course of 20 weeks, participants answered questions about their hand washing behaviour, goal importance, habit strength and self-control. Participants from an experimental and a control condition completed a baseline and final measurement, and the experimental condition was invited to bi-weekly measurements through reminders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Hand washing behaviour over the past 14 days was assessed by self-report at baseline and final measurement, and additionally repeatedly over the course of 20 weeks in the experimental condition. RESULTS Hand washing behaviour decreased over time, but this decrease was buffered by habit strength and goal importance. The decrease was smaller in the experimental condition that received reminders every 2 weeks. CONCLUSION Sending personal reminders on hand washing behaviour contributes to hand washing behaviour. Moreover, taking habit strength and goal importance, and to a lesser extent self-control into account is important when designing interventions to promote hand washing behaviour.","output":"Make it a habit: how habit strength, goal importance and self-control predict hand washing behaviour over time during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alzheimer's disease is singularly tragic in that it may rob patients of much or all of their personal identity.

The result is a cycle of normoxia and hypoxia in which blood oxygen partial pressures can decline to <20C30 mmHg during a dive, a level considered injurious to oxygen-dependent human tissues (i.e., brain, heart). Safeguards in the form of enhanced on-board oxygen stores, selective oxygen transport, and unique tissue buffering capacities enable marine-adapted mammals to maintain physiological homeostasis and energy metabolism even when breathing and pulmonary gas exchange cease. This stands in stark contrast to the vulnerability of oxygen-sensitive tissues in humans that may undergo irreversible damage within minutes of ischemia and tissue hypoxia. Recently, these differences in protection against hypoxic injury have become evident in the systemic, multi-organ physiological failure during COVID-19 infection in humans. Prolonged recoveries in some patients have led to delays in the return to normal exercise levels and cognitive function even months later. Rather than a single solution to this problem, we find that marine mammals rely on a unique, integrative assemblage of protections to avoid the deleterious impacts of hypoxia on tissues. Built across evolutionary time, these solutions provide a natural template for identifying the potential for tissue damage when oxygen is lacking, and for guiding management decisions to support oxygen-deprived tissues in other mammalian species, including humans, challenged by hypoxia.","output":"Physiological resiliency in diving mammals: Insights on hypoxia protection using the Krogh principle to understand COVID-19 symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: An elective is part of the curriculum where students have the flexibility to choose both the study topic and location. International medical electives are a well-established part of curricula at most medical schools in high-income countries. They are highly valued by students and have proven educational benefits, though do come with challenges, such as lack of reciprocity. Low and middle-income countries frequently host students from high-income countries providing learning opportunities, yet also carry the burden of supervision and resource consumption, whilst their students get few elective opportunities. This study explores the value and feasibility of South-South Medical Elective Exchanges (SSMEE), which creates elective opportunities for African medical students in other African countries to create reciprocity within the elective system. METHOD: A qualitative evaluation of the South-South Medical Elective Exchanges was conducted using a case study approach. Four African medical schools, College of Medicine, Malawi; University of Rwanda, Rwanda; University of Witwatersrand, South Africa and Makerere University, Uganda participated in the pilot study in 2017/18. Each institution selected two students to participate in a four-week elective to another participating institute. Participating students completed a pre-elective questionnaire and a post-elective interview exploring expectations, learning outcomes, challenges and how they are applying this learning. Data was analysed thematically. RESULTS: Data presented is from six of the eight participating students. All students found the elective a valuable experience and learning was demonstrated in four key areas: clinical knowledge and skills; attitudes; personal and professional development and global perspectives. For some, it challenged their assumptions of what an elective is because valuable learning can be achieved whilst remaining in Africa. The main challenge found related to funding the elective. CONCLUSIONS: The SSMEE model is feasible and provides valuable learning for participating students and their peers/colleagues. Financing electives remains the biggest challenge. Since this pilot study, SSMEE has become part of a regional elective exchange network in Africa with an additional four institutions in three other countries. As such SSMEE has resulted in increased opportunities for African medical students and better educational outcomes that are likely to have a positive effect on healthcare systems in Africa.","output":"Value and feasibility of South-South Medical Elective Exchanges in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: In December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also known as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), became a global public health crisis. Government officials in the United States subsequently responded by issuing lockdown orders that closed schools, terminated sports, and resulted in many people transitioning to working from home, immediately affecting the ability of athletic trainers (ATs) to practice clinically. OBJECTIVE: To describe the job status, job duties, telemedicine use, and resiliency of ATs during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Mixed-methods survey. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 611 ATs (age = 32  13 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The survey consisted of 6 demographic questions, a job status assessment (3 questions, 1 open-ended prompt), a telemedicine use assessment (5 questions, 2 open-ended prompts), and the 6-item Brief Resilience Scale. Qualitative analyses were completed using Text iQ technology and descriptive statistics, and cross-tabulations were conducted using follow-up &#967;2 comparisons of resiliency with job setting and telemedicine use. RESULTS: Most ATs continued to work in some capacity throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and expressed optimism about the likelihood that their job status and setting would return. However, participants shared financial and mental health concerns because of reduced pay, stress, and uncertainty about the future. We also identified versatility within the profession, as ATs were serving in new roles related to COVID-19 or adopting telemedicine (n = 251, 41.1%). Athletic trainers were implementing all domains of clinical practice using telemedicine, yet most did not consult legal counsel on or have formal training in the delivery method before implementation. Finally, most ATs exhibited normal resilience that was not affected by job setting (&#967;2 = 26.901, P = .68) or the use of virtual health care (&#967;2 = 2.597, P = .27).

RESULTS: In total, 40 patients were included in each group. The median patient age was 53.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] 42-60.5), and the majority of patients required invasive ventilation (69, 86.2%). Plasma was harvested from donors after a median of 37 days (IQR 31-46) from the first positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result and 26 days (IQR 21-32) after documented viral clearance; it was administered after a median of 10 days (IQR 9-10) from the onset of symptoms and 2.5 days (IQR 2-4) from admission to intensive care unit.

The survey assessed patient safety, patient satisfaction with care, perceptions of telehealth-based eye care, and worry about eyesight. Data was analyzed via frequency measures (e.g., means and standard deviations), Chi-square tests, ANOVA, and paired t-tests. Interviews were analyzed using Grounded Theory. RESULTS: 3274 patients were called and 1720 (53%) agreed to participate. In-person participants were significantly older than telephone (p=0.002) and videocall visit (p=0.001) participants. Significantly more white participants had in-person visits than minority participants (p=0.002). In-person visit participants worried about their eyesight more (2.7, SD=1.2) than those who had telephone (2.5, SD 1.3), videocall (2.4, SD=1.1), or deferred visits (2.4, SD=1.2) (p=0.004).

We also found that the viral protein interacting hosts proteins involved in similar pathways like: respiratory failure, lung diseases, asthma, and hypoxia responses etc., suggesting viral proteins might be deregulating the processes related to acute lung injury/breathing complications in COVID-19 patients. Protein-protein interaction networks of these processes and map of gene expression of deregulated genes revealed that several viral proteins can directly or indirectly modulate the host genes/proteins of those lung related processes along with several host transcription factors and miRNAs. Surfactant proteins and their regulators SPD, SPC, TTF1 etc. which maintains the stability of the pulmonary tissue are found to be downregulated through viral NSP5, NSP12 that could lead to deficient gaseous exchange by the surface films. Mitochondrial dysfunction owing to the aberration of NDUFA10, NDUFAF5, SAMM50 etc. by NSP12; abnormal thrombosis in lungs through atypical PLAT, EGR1 functions by viral ORF8, NSP12; dulled hypoxia responses due to unusual shift in HIF-1 downstream signaling might be the causative elements behind the acute lung injury in COVID-19 patients. Our study put forward a distinct mechanism of probable virus induced lung damage apart from cytokine storm and advocate the need of further research for alternate therapy in this direction.","output":"Lung biopsy cells transcriptional landscape from COVID-19 patient stratified lung injury in SARS-CoV-2 infection through impaired pulmonary surfactant metabolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper proposes a strategy to measure economic insecurity in countries in the Global South. It builds a 'Multidimensional Economic Insecurity Index' (MEII) that combines four indicators of economic vulnerability that cause stress and anxiety: unexpected economic shocks, unprotected employment or non-workers in the household, over-indebtedness and asset poverty. The index offers a measure that directly relates economic uncertainty to stress and anxiety due to the lack of protection and buffers to face an unexpected economic shock. The MEII is applied to Chile using Survey of Household Finances (SHF) cross-sectional data (2007, 2011, 2014 and 2017). The results show that (i) about half of the Chilean households experienced, on average, two or more economic vulnerabilities during the last decade with an intensity of 2.3 vulnerabilities, and (ii) economic insecurity affects households on the entire income distribution, even in the highest income deciles groups. By identifying the groups of households most affected by economic insecurity and its trend in recent years, applying the MEII in countries such as Chile provides relevant information to monitor, evaluate and improve social safety nets besides labour market regulations.","output":"A Multidimensional Approach to Measuring Economic Insecurity: The Case of Chile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The existence of a substantial but unclear number of asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 patients worldwide has raised concerns among global public health authorities. In this review, according to the published literature, we provided the evidence that asymptomatic infections can result in person-to-person transmission. Four studies suggested that the virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients for at least two consecutive generations, indicating its strong infectivity. Asymptomatic infection tends to be, but is not only, identified among young people (<20 years old). The majority of asymptomatic patients appear to have a milder clinical course during hospitalization, but the severity of the symptoms of the secondary patients infected by SARS-COV-2 from asymptomatic patients varies with their physical constitution. The proportion of asymptomatic individuals among all confirmed cases widely differed (from 1.95% to 87.9%) according to the study setting and the populations studied. The increasing large-scale tests are expected to give more information about the true number of asymptomatic infections in the population. In China and other countries, various guidelines for management of asymptomatic cases have been issued. Importantly, early detection, early reporting, early isolation and early treatment of asymptomatic patients require the joint efforts of policy makers, clinicians, technicians, epidemiologists, virologists and patients.","output":"COVID-19: Insight into the asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 infection and transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It is currently unknown whether exergaming is efficacious in people with major neurocognitive disorder (MNCD) residing in long-term care facilities. This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) explored the efficacy of a stepping exergame program on gait speed, balance, mobility, reaction time, cognitive and neuropsychiatric outcomes, quality of life, and daily life functioning in people with MNCD residing in long-term care facilities. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to 8 weeks, three times weekly, 15 min of exergaming versus watching preferred music videos. The exergame device consisted of a pressure-sensitive step training platform on which participants performed stepping movements to play the games. The device automatically adapted the training level to the participants capabilities. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), step reaction time test (SRTT), Montral Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), Dementia Quality of Life (DQoL), and Katz Activities of Daily Living (Katz ADL) were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. A Quades non-parametric ANCOVA controlling for baseline values with post hoc Bonferroni correction (p < 0.00625) was used to analyze pre- and post-differences between the groups. Partial eta-squared ((2)p) effect sizes were calculated. RESULTS: Forty-five of 55 randomized inpatients with mild to moderate MNCD (Mini-Mental State Examination score = 17.2  4.5; aged 70C91; 35 women) completed the study. The exergame group (n = 23) demonstrated improvements in gait speed (p < 0.001, (2)(p) = 0.41), total SPPB (p < 0.001, (2)(p) = 0.64), SRTT (p<0.001, (2)(p) = 0.51), MoCA (p<0.001, (2)(p) = 0.38), and reductions in CSDD (p<0.001, (2)(p) = 0.43) compared to the control group (n = 22). There were no differences in NPI (p = 0.165, (2)(p) = 0.05), DQoL (p = 0.012, (2)(p) = 0.16), and ADL (p = 0.008, (2)(p) = 0.16) post-intervention scores between the experimental and control group, albeit DQol and ADL measures showed large effect sizes in the exergame group. The mean attendance rate was 82.9% in the exergame group and 73.7% in the music control group. There were no study-related adverse events reported by the participants, nor observed by the research team.

However, the virome of PEDV infected pigs and its effect on disease severity remains unknown. The advancements of sequencing technology have made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body sites for any host. METHODS: The objective of this study was to characterize the RNA virome in PEDV-positive pigs using the hypothesis-free metagenomics approach based on next-generation sequencing. Specifically, 217 PEDV-positive swine fecal swab samples collected from diarrheic piglets over 17 US states during 2015C2016 were analyzed. RESULTS: A Kraken algorithm-based bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of up to 9 different RNA genera besides PEDV (Alphacoronavirus genus), including Mamastrovirus (52%, 113/217), Enterovirus (39%, 85/217), Sapelovirus (31%, 67/217), Posavirus (30%, 66/217), Kobuvirus (23%, 49/217), Sapovirus (13%, 28/217), Teschovirus (10%, 22/217), Pasivirus (9%, 20/217), and Deltacoronavirus (3%, 6/217).

The results demonstrated that, in most cases, fetishization was understood by TGNB people as a negative experience of sexual objectification, although some individuals experienced fetishization as a positive experience, perceiving the sexual desire of the other person or living it as a kink. Consistent with the integrated theory of dehumanization, the results demonstrated that both sexual objectification and minority stress contributed to participants' understanding of fetishization for TGNB individuals.

Phenylephrine (0.2 mg) was administered to 10 healthy males (24 years (22-27; median with interquartile range)) during 40 HUT with SmO2, O2Hb and Hb determined for the biceps brachii and vastus lateralis muscles. Changes in red cell volume within the thorax and thigh were evaluated by electrical admittance and brachial vein diameter determined by ultrasound. HUT accumulated blood in arms and legs as indicated by reduced thoracic and conversely enhanced thigh electrical admittance. Both over the arm and leg, HUT reduced SmO2 as a consequence of reduced O2Hb and increased Hb (p < .05). After 5 min HUT, phenylephrine increased MAP and total peripheral resistance, and both arm and thigh SmO2 increased due to a decrease in Hb and an increase in O2Hb. The results confirm that SmO2 decreases during HUT and demonstrate venous filling in the limbs. Furthermore, vasoconstriction during HUT is indicated by a decrease in O2Hb.

Here, we first show that rVpr, when incubated with human monocytes or MDMs, caused viral production from latently infected cells, and IL-6 was identified as a responsible factor. The induction of IL-6 by rVpr was dependent on signaling through TLR4 and its adaptor molecule, MyD88. We next provide evidence that rVpr induced the formation of OxPC and that a mAb against OxPC blocked rVpr-induced IL-6 production with the concomitant attenuation of MAPK activation. Moreover, the addition of NAC, a scavenger of ROS, abrogated the rVpr-induced formation of OxPC, the phosphorylation of C/EBP-beta, a substrate of MAPK, and IL-6 production. As rIL-6 reactivated viral replication in latently infected cells, our data indicate that rVpr-induced oxidative stress triggers cell-based innate immune responses and reactivates viral production in latently infected cells via IL-6 production. Our results suggest that Vpr should be monitored based on the viral titer, and they provide the rationale for the development of novel, anti-AIDS therapeutics targeting Vpr.","output":"HIV-1 Vpr induces TLR4/MyD88-mediated IL-6 production and reactivates viral production from latency."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reached the Brazilian Amazon and spread among indigenous populations.

Data on pathophysiology and outcome of patients presenting with ACS is scarce. We did a prospective observational study to study epidemiology and outcomes of Covid-19 patients with ACS. Methods: A total of 654 patients were admitted with Covid-19 at PGIMER, Chandigarh from August 2020 to February 2021, 35 (5.3%) consecutive patients of ACS were enrolled into the study. Acute myocardial infarction was defined as per fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction. Diagnosis of Covid-19 was established using RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swab. Angiographic assessment was done by two interventional cardiologists. Results: Mean age of patients was 59.511.8 years, males comprised majority (80%) of study group. Most common risk factor was hypertension seen in around 70% followed by DM in 57% patients. Most common symptom at presentation was rest angina seen >90% while history of fever was present in only 31.4%. STEMI was most common ACS seen in 45.7% followed by USA in 23% patients. CS was present in 15% patients at presentation while another 5% developed shock in hospital. Oxygen requirement was required in over half the patients while 25% patients succumbed to illness in hospital.Thrombolysis was done in half the patients of STEMI. In view of Covid-19 disease 71.4% required dexamethasone and remdesivir. Coronary angiography was done in around 20% patients, which revealed obstructive CAD in 83% patients with 60% patients having 100% occlusion of IRA. Percutaneous intervention was done in 66% patients. Hypoalbuminemia was commonly seen patients with mean albumin of 3.3 gm/dL. Low T3 syndrome was most common thyroid function abnormality seen in 37.1%.On univariate analysis age, BNP levels and albumin were able to predict 30-day mortality.

With related policy interventions dependent on verifiable evidence, pandemics require governments to not only consider the input of experts but also ensure that science is translated for public understanding. However, misinformation and fake news, including content shared through social media, compromise the efficacy of evidence-based policy interventions and undermine the credibility of scientific expertise with potentially longer-term consequences. We introduce a formal mathematical model to understand factors influencing the behavior of social media users when encountering fake news. The model illustrates that direct efforts by social media platforms and governments, along with informal pressure from social networks, can reduce the likelihood that users who encounter fake news embrace and further circulate it. This study has implications at a practical level for crisis response in politically fractious settings and at a theoretical level for research about post-truth and the construction of fact.","output":"Fighting fake news in the COVID-19 era: policy insights from an equilibrium model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe year 2020 was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic that killed more than one million people.

Data collection was carried out by a clinical psychologist. We studied the acceptability of prophylactic treatment by paramedics, reasons for refusal and factors that may affect this choice.ResultsA total of 161 paramedics agreed to answer our questionnaire. The average age was 37.73 years. The average number of years worked was 14.95 years. There were 85 women (52.8%) and 76 men (47.2%). Only 59 (36.6%) agreed to take prophylactic treatment for COVID-19. The main reason for refusal was fear of side effects 57 (34.7%). Sufficient hindsight was the main factor that could make them change their decisions.

Thus far, numerous approaches have been used to study the development of epidemics, with special attention paid to the identification of crucial elements that can strengthen or weaken the dynamics of the process. The main thread of this research is associated with the use of the ordinary differential equations method. There also exist several approaches based on the analysis of flows in the Cellular Automata (CA) approach. METHODS: In this paper, we propose a new approach to disease-spread modeling. We start by creating a network that reproduces contacts between individuals in a community. This assumption makes the presented model significantly different from the ones currently dominant in the field. It also changes the approach to the act of infection. Usually, some parameters that describe the rate of new infections by taking into account those infected in the previous time slot are considered. With our model, we can individualize this process, considering each contact individually. RESULTS: The typical output from calculations of a similar type are epidemic curves. In our model, except of presenting the average curves, we show the deviations or ranges for particular results obtained in different simulation runs, which usually lead to significantly different results. This observation is the effect of the probabilistic character of the infection process, which can impact, in different runs, individuals with different significance to the community. We can also easily present the effects of different types of intervention. The effects are studied for different methods used to create the graph representing a community, which can correspond to different social bonds. CONCLUSIONS: We see the potential usefulness of the proposition in the detailed study of epidemic development for specific environments and communities. The ease of entering new parameters enables the analysis of several specific scenarios for different contagious diseases.","output":"Viral disease spreading in grouped population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Robust polyclonal humoral immune responses have the potential to generate a diverse set of antibodies to neutralize and eliminate viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and protect against transmission, re-infection and the evolution of variants that evade immunity. CD73 is present on subsets of human B and T cells where it plays a role in lymphocyte activation and migration. CD73 also functions as an ectoenzyme that converts AMP into immunosuppressive adenosine. We have developed a humanized anti-CD73 antibody, mupadolimab (CPI-006), that blocks CD73 enzymatic activity and activates CD73POS B cells, thereby inducing differentiation into plasmablasts, immunoglobulin class switching, and antibody secretion independent of the adenosine modulatory activity. These effects suggest mupadolimab may enhance the magnitude, diversity, and duration of anti-viral responses in patients with COVID-19. This hypothesis was tested in a dose escalation phase 1 trial in 29 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Single doses of 0.3 mg/kg - 5 mg/kg mupadolimab were well tolerated with no drug related adverse events. Doses greater than 0.3 mg/kg resulted in rapid generation of IgG and IgM to SARS-CoV-2 significantly above titers measured in convalescent controls, with elevated IgG titers sustained for more than 6 months beyond presentation of symptoms. Based on these findings, a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in hospitalized patients was initiated. The primary endpoint was proportion of patients alive and free from respiratory failure within 28 days. This trial was discontinued early during the period of waning COVID-19 incidence after enrolling 40 patients. Although underpowered, results from this trial suggest improvement in the primary and key secondary endpoints in patients treated with single doses of 2 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg compared to placebo.

In this paper, impacts on transit operations of the physical distancing measures deployed to slow the spread of the virus are analyzed and recommendations are provided. At first, two social distancing optimization solutions are provided in order to keep riders at a safe distance. The first is a discrete optimization that can be used in buses with fixed seats, while the second is a continuous optimization that can be used to distribute riders on a grid and be applied on a bus or subway platform. Assuming that the ridership will eventually go back to its level before the pandemic, the second objective of this research is to address the transit operation parameters that need to be changed in order to serve the pre-COVID ridership level, while respecting the social distancing measures. An O-D distribution has been developed in this paper for New York City (NYC) subway line 1, based on the 2018 NYC Travel Survey conducted by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Five scenarios of physical distancing are simulated and analyzed in this paper: 3ft, 4ft, 5ft, 5.4ft, and 6ft of separation between passengers. The results show the number of additional trains required to accommodate the hypothetical pre-COVID ridership demand while maintaining social distancing.

To our knowledge, no randomized clinical trials have compared balloon-expandable stent treatment with medical therapy in symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the balloon-expandable stent plus medical therapy vs medical therapy alone in patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis (70%). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS VISSIT (the Vitesse Intracranial Stent Study for Ischemic Stroke Therapy) trial is an international, multicenter, 1:1 randomized, parallel group trial that enrolled patients from 27 sites (January 2009-June 2012) with last follow-up in May 2013. INTERVENTIONS Patients (N = 112) were randomized to receive balloon-expandable stent plus medical therapy (stent group; n = 59) or medical therapy alone (medical group; n = 53). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE a composite of stroke in the same territory within 12 months of randomization or hard transient ischemic attack (TIA) in the same territory day 2 through month 12 postrandomization. A hard TIA was defined as a transient episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain or retinal ischemia lasting at least 10 minutes but resolving within 24 hours. Primary safety measure: a composite of any stroke, death, or intracranial hemorrhage within 30 days of randomization and any hard TIA between days 2 and 30 of randomization. Disability was measured with the modified Rankin Scale and general health status with the EuroQol-5D, both through month 12. RESULTS Enrollment was halted by the sponsor after negative results from another trial prompted an early analysis of outcomes, which suggested futility after 112 patients of a planned sample size of 250 were enrolled. The 30-day primary safety end point occurred in more patients in the stent group (14/58; 24.1% [95% CI, 13.9%-37.2%]) vs the medical group (5/53; 9.4% [95% CI, 3.1%-20.7%]) (P = .05). Intracranial hemorrhage within 30 days occurred in more patients in the stent group (5/58; 8.6% [95% CI, 2.9%-19.0%]) vs none in the medical group (95% CI, 0%-5.5%) (P = .06). The 1-year primary outcome of stroke or hard TIA occurred in more patients in the stent group (21/58; 36.2% [95% CI, 24.0-49.9]) vs the medical group (8/53; 15.1% [95% CI, 6.7-27.6]) (P = .02). Worsening of baseline disability score (modified Rankin Scale) occurred in more patients in the stent group (14/58; 24.1% [95% CI, 13.9%-37.2%]) vs the medical group (6/53; 11.3% [95% CI, 4.3%-23.0%]) (P = .09).The EuroQol-5D showed no difference in any of the 5 dimensions between groups at 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis, the use of a balloon-expandable stent compared with medical therapy resulted in an increased 12-month risk of added stroke or TIA in the same territory, and increased 30-day risk of any stroke or TIA.

Two FCoV-seropositive cats were the source of the infection, and 3 barrier reared cats - initially FCoV-seronegative - were the recipients. The first clinical sign in the recipients appeared 11 days after contact with the source of infection. After 2 years 1 male and 1 female of the recipients started to breed. Their offspring developed clinical signs of disease at an age of 4-5 weeks. A pattern of recurring upper respiratory tract signs and conjunctivitis at intervals of about 4 months was observed in both the recipients and their offspring, while CNS dependent signs and wasting remained or got worse, once developed. Once demonstrated, FCoV antigen persisted in membrana nictitans throughout the investigation, and was found in all cats but 4 (90%). The offspring died during 2 periods, around the first week of life (9/37), and at 3-5 months of age (5/25). For comparison 3 offspring were euthanized at an age of 1 day and 16 offspring at an age of 3-6 months. FCoV antigen was demonstrated in all organs investigated (100%) from offspring dying during the first period, and in 97% from those dying during the second period. For the offspring euthanized during the same 2 periods the corresponding findings were 95% and 85%. Offspring euthanized between 9 and 17 months (4 kittens) had antigen in 67% of all investigated organs.

Considering the rarity of this disease, the management of TETs is still challenging and difficult. In fact, all the worldwide clinical practice guidelines are based on data from retrospective analyses, prospective single arm trials or experts opinions. The results of combined modality therapy (chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy) in thymic malignancies are reasonably good in less advanced cases whereas in case of advanced (unsuitable for surgery) or metastatic disease, a platinum-based chemotherapy is considered standard of care. Unfortunately, chemotherapy in the palliative setting has modest efficacy. Moreover, due to the lack of known oncogenic molecular alterations, no targeted therapy has been shown to be efficient for these tumours. In order to offer the best diagnostic and therapeutic tools, patients with TETs should be managed with a continuous and specific multidisciplinary expertise at any step of the disease, especially in the era of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Current evidences show that cancer patients might have more severe symptoms and poorer outcomes from COVID-19 infection than general population. With the exception of the patients carrying a Goods syndrome, there is no evidence that patients with TETs present a higher risk of infection compared with other cancer patients and their management should be the same.

Within the multiple study models for both the biology and the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the use of stem cells has been proposed because of their ability to increase the immune response and to repair tissue. Therefore, the objective of this review is to evaluate the role of stem cells against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 in order to identify their potential as a study model and as a possible therapeutic source against tissue damage caused by this virus. Therefore, the following research question was established: What is the role of stem cells in the study of SARS-CoV-2 and the treatment of COVID-19? MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search was carried out in the electronic databases of PUBMED, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. The following keywords were used: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, and STEM CELL, plus independent search strategies with the Boolean operators OR and AND. The identified reports were those whose main objective was the study of stem cells in relation to SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. For the development of this study, the following inclusion criteria were taken into account: studies whose main objective was the study of stem cells in relation to SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 and clinical case studies, case reports, clinical trials, pilot studies, in vitro, or in vivo studies. For assessment of the risk of bias for in vitro studies, the SciRAP tool was used. The data collected for each type of study, clinical or in vitro, were analyzed with descriptive statistics using the SPSS V.22 program. RESULTS: Of the total of studies included (n = 39), 22 corresponded to in vitro investigations and 17 to human studies (clinical cases (n = 9), case series (n = 2), pilot clinical trials (n = 5), clinical trials (n = 1)). In vitro studies that induced pluripotent stem cells were the most used (n = 12), and in clinical studies, the umbilical stem cells derived were the most reported (n = 11). The mean age of the study subjects was 58.3 years. After the application of stem cell therapy, the follow-up period was 8 days minimum and 90 days maximum. Discussion. The mechanism by which the virus enters the cell is through protein S, located on the surface of the membrane, by recognizing the ACE2 receptor located on the target cell. The evidence that the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in stem cells indicates that stem cells from bone marrow and amniotic fluid have very little expression. This shows that stem cell has a low risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: The use of stem cells is a highly relevant therapeutic option. It has been shown in both in vitro studies and clinical trials that it counteracts the excessive secretion of cytokines. There are even more studies that focus on long-term follow-up; thus, the potential for major side effects can be analyzed more clearly. Finally, the ethical use of stem cells from fetal or infant origin needs to be regulated. The study was registered in PROSPERO (no. CRD42021229038). The limitations of the study were because of the methodology employed, the sample was not very large, and the follow-up period of the clinical studies was relatively short.","output":"Stem Cells as a Model of Study of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: A Systematic Review of the Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To support the manual contact tracing methods of Covid-19, countries and big companies like Apple and Google are busy developing several contact tracing applications The purpose of digital contact tracing apps is to accelerate existing traditional face to face interview method which can control the pandemic effectively and rapidly A major concern is whether consumers will be willing to download, install, and use the contact tracing applications because of the debate it created about its main attribute like security, privacy concern, system framework, data processing, location measurement In this paper we discuss the contact tracing apps and its different architecture, then we analyze the framework in term of security, privacy concern and privacy policy We reported 47 contact tracing applications which are from 28 countries worldwide, with several others expected to be roll out later We found that 23 percent of contact tracing apps currently implemented do not provide privacy policy in their documentation We believe that these comprehensive evaluation and specific suggestions will lead to creation and implementation of solutions towards Covid-19 and support governments and mobile development industries in creating safe and privacy conserving apps for contact tracing solutions ? 2021 All Rights Reserved","output":"A Study on Contact Tracing Apps for Covid-19: Privacy and Security Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficacy of tocilizumab (TOC), monoclonal antibody against interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients has led to conflicting results.

The electronic health record (EHR) has the ability to use machine learning (ML) to develop predictive models. While an EHR ML model has been developed to predict clinical deterioration, it has yet to be validated for use in trauma. We hypothesized that the Epic Deterioration Index (EDI) would predict mortality and unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admission in trauma patients. METHODS A retrospective analysis of a trauma registry was used to identify patients admitted to a level 1 trauma center for >24 hours from October 2019 to July 2020. We evaluated the performance of the EDI, which is constructed from 125 objective patient measures within the EHR, in predicting mortality and unplanned ICU admissions. We performed a 5 to 1 match on age because it is a major component of EDI, then examined the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and benchmarked it against Injury Severity Score (ISS) and new injury severity score (NISS). RESULTS The study cohort consisted of 1,325 patients admitted with a mean age of 52.5 years and 91% following blunt injury. The in-hospital mortality rate was 2%, and unplanned ICU admission rate was 2.6%. In predicting mortality, the maximum EDI within 24 hours of admission had an AUROC of 0.98 compared with 0.89 of ISS and 0.91 of NISS. For unplanned ICU admission, the EDI slope within 24 hours of ICU admission had a modest performance with an AUROC of 0.66. CONCLUSION Epic Deterioration Index appears to perform strongly in predicting in-patient mortality similarly to ISS and NISS. In addition, it can be used to predict unplanned ICU admissions. This study helps validate the use of this real-time EHR ML-based tool, suggesting that EDI should be incorporated into the daily care of trauma patients.

In addition to the catalytic chromophore, some photolyases bear a secondary chromophore with better light absorption capability than FAD, acting as a light-harvesting chromophore that harvests photons in sunlight efficiently and transfers light energy to the catalytic center, as observed in natural photoreceptor proteins. Inspired by nature, we covalently and site-specifically attached a synthetic chromophore to the surface of photolyase using oligonucleotides containing a modified nucleoside and a cyclobutane-type DNA lesion, and successfully enhanced its enzymatic activity in the light-driven DNA repair.

The following data were extracted: interaction severity (\\"major\\" and \\"contraindicated\\") and interaction effects (pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic). We also sought to identify the therapeutic indication of the antineoplastic drugs involved in the potential drug-drug interactions. RESULTS: A total of 388 \\"major\\" or \\"contraindicated\\" drug-drug interactions were detected. Eight drugs or combinations (baricitinib, lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir, darunavir, azithromycin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and sirolimus) accounted for 91.5% of these interactions. The class of antineoplastic agents with the greatest potential for interaction was tyrosine kinase inhibitors (accounting for 46.4% of all interactions).

Univariate analysis revealed age (odds ratio [OR] = 3.57; 95% CI = 1.80 to 7.06), male (OR = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.07 to 4.13), and comorbidity (OR = 2.00; 95% CI = 1.04 to 3.85) were associated with increased risk of severe events (defined as the individuals being admitted to the intensive care unit, or requiring invasive ventilation, or death). In multivariate analysis, only age greater than 65 years (OR = 3.16; 95% CI = 1.45 to 6.88) and being male (OR = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.07 to 4.87) were associated with increased risk of severe events. CONCLUSION: Our analysis demonstrated that COVID-19 patients with cancer have a higher fatality rate when compared with that of COVID-19 patients without cancer. Age and gender appear to be risk factors associated with a poorer prognosis.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of COVID-19-Infected Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, transnasal humidified rapid-insufflation ventilatory exchange ('THRIVE') has been classified as a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure and is strongly discouraged, despite a lack of conclusive evidence on its safety.

The purpose of this study was to verify the effects of strain due to individual risk factors and social risk factors on suicidality, and the mediating effect of depressive symptoms in relationship between strain related to individual risk factors and social risk factors and suicidality. The data from sociopsychological anxiety survey of Korea society conducted by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs in 2015 were used in verifying the model. We analyzed the data of 7000 adults aged 19 to 79 years using Structural Equation Modeling. Strain due to individual risk factors was positively related to depressive symptoms and suicidality. Interestingly, strain induced by social risk factors was positively associated with depressive symptoms and suicidality. Social support is significantly associated with depressive symptoms and suicidality. Depressive symptoms directly affected suicidality. In addition, strain due to individual risk factors and social risk factors indirectly affected suicidality mediating depressive symptoms.

Pattern-Driven Maintenance (PDM) is a method designed to support the creation of such rules during software maintenance. However, as PDM was recently proposed, few maintainers have reported on its usage. Hence, the challenges and skills needed to apply PDM properly are unknown. Aims: In this paper, we investigate the challenges faced by maintainers on applying PDM for creating custom static analysis rules for defect localization. Method: We conducted an observational study on novice maintainers creating custom static analysis rules by applying PDM. The study was divided into three tasks: (i) identifying a defect pattern, (ii) programming a static analysis rule to locate instances of the pattern, and (iii) verifying the located instances. We analyzed the efficiency and acceptance of maintainers on applying PDM and their comments on task challenges. Results: We observed that previous knowledge on debugging, the subject software, and related technologies influenced the performance of maintainers as well as the time to learn the technology involved in rule programming. Conclusions: The results strengthen our confidence that PDM can help maintainers in producing custom static analysis rules for locating defects. However, a proper selection and training of maintainers is needed to apply PDM effectively. Also, using a higher level of abstraction can ease static analysis rule programming for novice maintainers.","output":"An Empirical Investigation on the Challenges of Creating Custom Static Analysis Rules for Defect Localization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Chiang Rai province in northern Thailand is a site of many people travelling amongnearby countries and areas, including Yunnan province, China In February 2020, there was concernabout the populations vulnerability to coronavirus disease 2019 (?COVID-19)?

Acute respiratory failure is leading cause of death followed by sepsis, cardiac failure and hemorrhage. Since the pathological findings are diverse in COVID-19 and majority of studies in literature were by open autopsy;the present study was done using percutaneous core needle biopsy. Postmortem lung biopsies are rather easy and quick to perform and decrease the infective risk caused by full autopsies. This could be an essential tool for diagnosis, surveillance and research. Aim: To study the pathological features of lung in COVID-19 deceased patients by postmortem. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Dr. Pinnamaneni Siddhartha Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Foundation, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India from October 2020 to November 2020. In present study, postmortem percutaneous core needle biopsies from lung were performed within two hours of death from eight deceased patients who died of COVID-19. Clinical history, inflammatory markers and treatment details were collected from case sheets, biopsy was done, specimen was collected and sent for pathological examination. Data was presented in the descriptive form for each variable. Results: Out of eight cases, five were men and three were women with a mean age of 54.12 years. Majority of patients presented with complaints of shortness of breath and fever. Hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypothyroidism, history of pulmonary tuberculosis were the co-morbidities noticed. Four biopsies presented acute lung injury with hyaline membrane changes, Diffuse Alveolar Damage (DAD) with hyaline membrane was seen in two cases, squamous metaplasia was seen in two cases and acute lung injury with organising pneumonia was seen in two cases. Conclusion: Postmortem lung biopsies are safe, easy to perform and provide insights of possible undergoing pathology of the disease with regard to clinical presentation.","output":"Pathological Features of Lung in COVID-19 Disease Subjects: A Postmortem Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND After ankle and hindfoot fractures, edema has a major impact on the time for surgical intervention and may increase the risk of wound complications and infection postoperatively. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of multilayer compression and intermittent impulse compression therapy in reducing ankle and hindfoot edema compared with the standard treatment with elevation and ice. METHODS This was a randomized, controlled, single-blinded clinical trial using a repeated-measures design. Fifty-eight patients with unilateral fractures of the ankle or hindfoot were randomized into the cold pack (control) group, the bandage group, or the impulse compression group and were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. The primary outcome was the reduction of edema as measured with the figure-of-eight-20 method. RESULTS Preoperatively and postoperatively, there were significant differences in edema reduction between the bandage group and the control group. After two days of intervention, the median preoperative edema reduction in the control group was -2.0 mm (-5%) compared with -11.0 mm (-23%) in the bandage group (p < 0.017), and -0.3 mm (0%) in the impulse compression group (p > 0.017). Postoperatively, after two days, the median edema changes were +3.5 mm (+7%) in the control group compared with -7.3 mm (-22%) in the bandage group (p < 0.017) and +5.0 mm (+46%) in the impulse compression group (p > 0.017). CONCLUSIONS Multilayer compression therapy results in a faster reduction of ankle and hindfoot edema, although with less ankle dorsiflexion on postoperative day three than the control group, and can be recommended as an alternative treatment. Intermittent impulse compression applied without any extra compression by stockinette or bandage and without elevation in off-session periods cannot be recommended as a superior alternative to the treatment with ice.

Recently, Iraq is one of the countries that have immensely suffered from this outbreak. The Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) is also prone to the disease. Until now, more than 23,000 confirmed cases have been recorded in the region. Since the onset of the COVID-19 in Wuhan, based on epidemiological modelling, researchers have used various models to predict the future of the epidemic and the time of peak, yielding diverse numbers in different countries. This study aims to estimate the basic reproductive number [R0] for COVID-19 in KRI, using the standard SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) epidemic model. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and solved numerically by the 4th order Runge-Kutta method. The reproductive numbers R0 was estimated by the method of fitting the curves between the actual daily data and numerical solution by applying the least square method. For the analysis, data were taken for the duration of 165 days, from 1st of March to 12th August 2020, in a population of 5.2 million. It is concluded that the R0 value was fluctuating during the outbreak, with an average of 1.33, predicting that infection cases will reach their maximum value of around 540,000 on the 5th of November 2020. Then, the spread of the disease will die out since the number of susceptible people will decrease to about 3.2 million.

Herein, we sought to characterize and compare bacterial co-infections at admission in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2, influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) positive community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of bacterial co-infections at admission in SARS-CoV-2, influenza or RSV-positive adult patients with CAP admitted to Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, from year 2011 to 2020. The prevalence of bacterial co-infections was investigated and compared between the three virus groups. In each virus group, length of stay, ICU-admission and 30-day mortality was compared in patients with and without bacterial co-infection, adjusting for age, sex and co-morbidities. In the SARS-CoV-2 group, risk factors for bacterial co-infection, were assessed using logistic regression models and creation of two scoring systems based on disease severity, age, co-morbidities and inflammatory markers with assessment of concordance statistics. RESULTS: Compared to influenza and RSV, the bacterial co-infection testing frequency in SARS-CoV-2 was lower for all included test modalities. Four percent [46/1243 (95% CI 3C5)] of all SARS-CoV-2 patients had a bacterial co-infection at admission, whereas the proportion was 27% [209/775 (95% CI 24C30)] and 29% [69/242 (95% CI 23C35)] in influenza and RSV, respectively. S. pneumoniae and S. aureus constituted the most common bacterial findings for all three virus groups. Comparing SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with and without bacterial co-infection at admission, a relevant association could not be demonstrated nor excluded with regards to risk of ICU-admission (aHR 1.53, 95% CI 0.87C2.69) or 30-day mortality (aHR 1.28, 95% CI 0.66C2.46) in adjusted analyses. Bacterial co-infection was associated with increased inflammatory markers, but the diagnostic accuracy was not substantially different in a scoring system based on disease severity, age, co-morbidities and inflammatory parameters [C statistic 0.66 (95% CI 0.59C0.74)], compared to using disease severity, age and co-morbidities only [C statistic 0.63 (95% CI 0.56C0.70)].

The ventilation of four human lungs was simulated using 3D printed parts, a single ventilator, four test-lungs, and standard tubing. Peak pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), total tidal volume, individual tidal volume, total minute volume, and individual tidal volume data were collected. Usage of a 3D printed small size splitter enabled a 26% increase in individual tidal volume compared to standard tubing and a series of two-way splitters. The ventilator was able to supply the required pressure and tidal volume for 24 h. A single ventilator with a four-way splitter can ventilate four patients experiencing respiratory failure for at least 24 h without interruption. The equipment cannot sustain ventilating a fifth patient owing to minute volume limitation.

Psychosocial cancer support services offer support for cancer patients and their relatives. Only a few studies have focused on associations of psychological factors within patient-relative dyads. This study aims to assess associations between the patients or relatives self-efficacy and their levels of distress and anxiety who seek help together at psychosocial cancer support centres. METHODS: Participants were recruited at two psychosocial cancer support centres in a major city in Germany. Patients with cancer and their relatives seeking support together received the questionnaire before their first support session. Self-efficacy was assessed with the Pearlin sense of mastery scale, distress with the distress thermometer and anxiety with the General Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7). For the analysis, the actor-partner interdependence model was applied. RESULTS: The data analysis was based on 41 patient-relative dyads (patients: 39% women, mean age 53.5; relatives: 66% women, mean age 52.16). A significant actor effect from self-efficacy to distress was found for patients (r = -0.47) but not for relatives (r = -0.15). Partner effects from self-efficacy to distress were not significant (r = -0.03, r = -0.001).

However, simple fine-tuning may lead to poor performance due to two issues, firstly the large domain shift present in chest x-ray datasets and secondly the relatively small scale of the COVID-19 chest x-ray dataset.

A simultaneous dramatic increase in IBD drug options has enabled most patients to achieve remission. Nevertheless, worldwide disparities in the approval of IBD drugs, or \\"drug lag\\", remain problematic. Summary Drug lag for major IBD drugs before March 31, 2018 (12 for Crohn's disease [CD] and 13 for ulcerative colitis [UC]) was compared between that of the United States (US), European Union (EU), and Asia (Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines) to assess current trends. In the US, unapproved IBD drugs accounted for 16.7% (2/12) for CD and 23.1% (3/13) for UC; approval lag was 3.8 (0-80.5) months for CD and 3.6 (0-88) months for UC. In the EU, unapproved drugs accounted for 16.7% (2/12) for CD and 15.4% (2/13) for UC; approval lag was 0.03 (0-13.9) months for CD and 0 (0-13.9) months for UC. This demonstrates the short drug lag in both regions, although one drug developed in a joint US/EU clinical trial had around a 350-day approval lag. In Asia, the proportion of unapproved IBD drugs was the lowest in Japan at 33.3% (4/12) for CD and 23.1% (3/13) for UC; South Korea had the shortest lag for CD at 13.2 (0-133.1) months and the Philippines had the shortest lag for UC at 9.9 (0.6-176.2) months, but these countries still had longer lag periods than the West. However, a proportion of unapproved drugs and approval lag has decreased considerably in Asia since the start of the biologics era. Key Messages Despite the recent shortening drug lag between different countries and regions, this study shows that disparities persist.

We showed previously that healthy older humans (>65 years old) have reduced antigen-specific cutaneous immunity to varicella zoster virus (VZV) antigen challenge. This was associated with p38 MAP kinase driven inflammation that was induced by mild tissue injury caused by the injection of the antigen itself. Here we show that non-specific injury induced by injection of air or saline into the skin of older adults recruits CCR2+CD14+ monocytes by CCL2 produced by senescent fibroblasts. These monocytes reduced TRM proliferation via secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Pre-treatment with a p38-MAPK inhibitor (Losmapimod) in older adults in vivo significantly decreased CCL2 expression, recruitment of monocyte into the skin, COX2 expression and PGE2 production. This enhanced the VZV response in the skin. Therefore, local inflammation arising from interaction between senescent cells and monocytes leads to immune decline in the skin during ageing, a process that can be reversed. Summary Inflammation resulting from tissue injury blocks antigen-specific cutaneous immunity during ageing. Monocytes recruited to the skin inhibit TRM function through COX2-derived prostaglandin E2 production.

Notably, such SCC types display molecular similarities, despite their differing etiologies. We leveraged the similarities in transcriptomes between tumors from organ transplant recipients and RDEB-patients, augmented with data from more common head and neck (HN)-SCCs, to identify drugs that can be repurposed to treat these SCCs. The in silico approach used is based on the assumption that SCC-derived transcriptome profiles reflect critical tumor pathways that, if reversed towards healthy tissue, will attenuate the malignant phenotype. We determined tumor-specific signatures based on differentially expressed genes, which were then used to mine drug-perturbation data. By leveraging recent efforts in the systematic profiling and cataloguing of thousands of small molecule compounds, we identified drugs including selumetinib that specifically target key molecules within the MEK signaling cascade, representing candidates with the potential to be effective in the treatment of these rare and aggressive SCCs.","output":"Transcriptome-Guided Drug Repurposing for Aggressive SCCs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of face masks as a means for preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is now a common practice world-wide.

METHODS: : Patients who have a diagnosis of HT among the patients treated for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between 31 March 2020 and 28 May 2020 were included in the study. One hundred and twenty-four patients were divided into two as ACEIs/ARBs group (n = 75) and non-ACEIs/ARBs group (n = 49) according to the anti-HT drug used. The chest CT involvement areas of these two groups were evaluated quantitatively by two observers including all lobes, and total severity score (TSS) was calculated. These TSS values were compared between drug groups and clinical groups. RESULTS: In clinical classification; there were 4 (%3.2) asymptomatic, 5 (4.0%) mild type, 92 (74.1%) common type, 14 (11.3%) severe type, 9 (7.3%) critical type patients.

METHODS: We assessed the clinical and laboratory features of 11 patients in Germany and Austria in whom thrombosis or thrombocytopenia had developed after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19. We used a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect platelet factor 4 (PF4)-heparin antibodies and a modified (PF4-enhanced) platelet-activation test to detect platelet-activating antibodies under various reaction conditions. Included in this testing were samples from patients who had blood samples referred for investigation of vaccine-associated thrombotic events, with 28 testing positive on a screening PF4-heparin immunoassay. RESULTS: Of the 11 original patients, 9 were women, with a median age of 36 years (range, 22 to 49). Beginning 5 to 16 days after vaccination, the patients presented with one or more thrombotic events, with the exception of 1 patient, who presented with fatal intracranial hemorrhage. Of the patients with one or more thrombotic events, 9 had cerebral venous thrombosis, 3 had splanchnic-vein thrombosis, 3 had pulmonary embolism, and 4 had other thromboses; of these patients, 6 died. Five patients had disseminated intravascular coagulation. None of the patients had received heparin before symptom onset. All 28 patients who tested positive for antibodies against PF4-heparin tested positive on the platelet-activation assay in the presence of PF4 independent of heparin. Platelet activation was inhibited by high levels of heparin, Fc receptor-blocking monoclonal antibody, and immune globulin (10 mg per milliliter). Additional studies with PF4 or PF4-heparin affinity purified antibodies in 2 patients confirmed PF4-dependent platelet activation.

Although ribavirin is a well-known antiviral drug against a broad range of both DNA and RNA viruses in vitro, its inhibitory effect and mechanism of action on porcine nidovirus replication remains to be elucidated. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine whether ribavirin suppresses porcine nidovirus infection. Our results demonstrated that ribavirin treatment dose-dependently inhibited the replication of both nidoviruses. The antiviral activity of ribavirin on porcine nidovirus replication was found to be primarily exerted at early times post-infection. Treatment with ribavirin resulted in marked reduction of viral genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis, viral protein expression, and progeny virus production in a dose-dependent manner. Investigations into the mechanism of action of ribavirin against PRRSV and PEDV revealed that the addition of guanosine to the ribavirin treatment significantly reversed the antiviral effects, suggesting that depletion of the intracellular GTP pool by inhibiting IMP dehydrogenase may be essential for ribavirin activity. Further sequencing analysis showed that the mutation frequency in ribavirin-treated cells was similar to that in untreated cells, indicating that ribavirin did not induce error-prone replication.

However, it remains unclear whether the addition of hydrodilatation with corticosteroid provides improvement in pain-free ROM as well as pain relief. OBJECTIVE A review of the literature was conducted to determine whether the combined intervention of hydrodilatation and corticosteroid injection expedites restoration of pain-free ROM compared to a control treatment of corticosteroid injection in patients with adhesive capsulitis. METHODS EMBASE, MEDLINE, and CINAHL were searched from database inception to January 2017. Relevant studies were determined as randomized controlled trials written in English, comparing the outcomes of hydrodilatation and corticosteroid injection to a control group treated with corticosteroid injection alone in patients with adhesive capsulitis. Two independent reviewers assessed manuscripts for study inclusion and extracted data. RESULTS A total of 2276 studies were identified through the search, of which 6 randomized controlled studies (involving 410 shoulders) met criteria for inclusion in this review. Mean age ranged from 51-61 years, with mean symptom duration of 4-9 months. Studies varied significantly regarding the volume of injectate, anatomical injection approach, symptom duration, and the method of glenohumeral capsule distension (capsular rupture versus preservation). Two studies demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvement in the combination group at 3-month follow-up, and one study demonstrated clinically significant improvement only in ROM and/or pain/functional scales, compared to 3 studies demonstrating no benefit when compared to corticosteroid injection alone. CONCLUSION Combining hydrodilatation with corticosteroid injection potentially expedites recovery of pain-free ROM. The greatest benefit is experienced within the first 3 months of intervention. Differences in hydrodilatation techniques, inclusion of capsular preservation, anatomical approach, and length of symptoms may explain the variability in efficacy demonstrated. Further trials using larger sample sizes, better anatomical approaches, image guidance, and hydrodilatation techniques are required to determine the true nature of benefits of hydrodilatation with corticosteroid injection.

All patients were followed from the start of the pandemic until their most recent follow up or death. Baseline comorbidities and immediate outcomes data were obtained from the Society for Thoracic Surgery (STS) Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (ACSD).

Recently, a fatty acid binding site was identified in the spike (Toelzer et al. Science 2020). The presence of linoleic acid at this site modulates binding of the spike to the human ACE2 receptor, stabilizing a locked conformation of the protein. Here, dynamical-nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations reveal that this fatty acid site is coupled to functionally relevant regions of the spike, some of them far from the fatty acid binding pocket. Removal of a ligand from the fatty acid binding site significantly affects the dynamics of distant, functionally important regions of the spike, including the receptor-binding motif, furin cleavage site and fusion-peptide-adjacent regions. The results also show significant differences in behaviour between clinical variants of the spike: e.g. the D614G mutation shows a significantly different conformational response for some structural motifs relevant for binding and fusion. The simulations identify structural networks through which changes at the fatty acid binding site are transmitted within the protein. These communication networks significantly involve positions that are prone to mutation, indicating that observed genetic variation in the spike may alter its response to linoleate binding and associated allosteric communication.","output":"The fatty acid site is coupled to functional motifs in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and modulates spike allosteric behaviour"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) family are proteolytic transmembrane proteases that modulate diverse cell functions and coordinate intercellular communication.

The generalizability of this observation on ACS admissions and possible related causes in countries with low COVID\\\\19 incidence are not known. HYPOTHESIS: ACS admissions were reduced in a country spared by COVID\\\\19. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide study on the incidence rates of ACS\\\\related admissions during a 6\\\\week period of the COVID\\\\19 outbreak and the corresponding control period in 2019 in Greece, a country with strict social measures, low COVID\\\\19 incidence, and no excess in mortality. RESULTS: ACS admissions in the COVID\\\\19 (n = 771) compared with the control (n = 1077) period were reduced overall (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.72, P < .001) and for each ACS type (ST\\\\segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]: IRR: 0.76, P = .001; non\\\\STEMI: IRR: 0.74, P < .001; and unstable angina [UA]: IRR: 0.63, P = .002). The decrease in STEMI admissions was stable throughout the COVID\\\\19 period (temporal correlation; R(2) = 0.11, P = .53), whereas there was a gradual decline in non\\\\STEMI/UA admissions (R(2) = 0.75, P = .026) following the progressively stricter social measures.

The proliferation capability of cells was analyzed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony-forming assays. The matrigel angiogenesis assay was used to assess tube formation in GBM cells. Flow cytometry assays were conducted to evaluate the cell cycle distribution of GBM cells. The migration and invasion assays were assessed by transwell assay. The Western blot assay was employed to quantify the protein expression level in GBM tissues and cells. The targets of circPITX1 and miR-584-5p were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. A xenograft experiment in nude mice was used to assess the functional role of circPITX1 in vivo. CircPITX1 was obviously overexpressed in GBM tissues and cells when compared with negative groups. The functional experiment implied that knockdown of circPITX1 suppressed proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and tumor growth in vivo along with induced cell cycle arrest of GBM cells. Furthermore, miR-584-5p was a target gene of circPITX1, and knockdown of miR-584-5p could abolish circPITX1 silencing-induced effects on GBM cells. KPNB1 was a target gene of miR-584-5p, and functional experiments revealed that overexpression of miR-584-5p repressed proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and cell cycle process in GBM cells by targeting KPNB1.

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was conducted utilizing the population-based OHCA data of South Korea between 2008 and 2018. Adult (>18 years) OHCA patients with a medical cause of cardiac arrest were included and classified into three categories based on the underlying CKD and RRT: (1) non-CKD group; (2) CKD without RRT group; and (3) CKD with RRT group. A total of 13,682 eligible patients were included (non-CKD, 9863; CKD without RRT, 1778; CKD with RRT, 2041). From the three comparison subgroups, data with propensity score matching were extracted. The influence of CKD and RRT on patient outcomes was assessed using propensity score matching and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The primary outcome was survival at hospital discharge and the secondary outcome was a good neurological outcome at hospital discharge. Results: The two CKD groups (CKD without RRT and CKD with RRT) showed no significant difference in survival at hospital discharge compared with the non-CKD group (CKD without RRT vs. non-CKD, p > 0.05; CKD with RRT vs. non-CKD, p > 0.05). The non-CKD group had a higher chance of having good neurological outcomes than the CKD groups (non-CKD vs. CKD without RRT, p < 0.05; non-CKD vs. CKD with RRT, p < 0.05) whereas there was no significant difference between the two CKD groups (CKD without RRT vs. CKD with RRT, p > 0.05).

Intuitively, problems and challenges can be better handled by managing expectations in software teams.

Method: We surveyed 181 professional software developers to understand their expectations from five different stakeholders: (1) organizations, (2) managers, (3) peers, (4) new hires, and (5) government and educational institutions. The five stakeholders are determined by conducting semi-formal interviews of software developers. We ask open-ended survey questions and analyze the responses using open coding. Results: We observed 18 multi-faceted expectations types. While some expectations are more specific to a stakeholder, other expectations are cross-cutting. For example, developers expect work-benefits from their organizations, but expect the adoption of standard software engineering (SE) practices from their organizations, peers, and new hires. Conclusion: Out of the 18 categories, three categories are related to career growth. This observation supports previous research that happiness cannot be assured by simply offering more money or a promotion. Among the most number of responses, we find expectations from educational institutions to offer relevant teaching and from governments to improve job stability, which indicate the increasingly important roles of these organizations to help software developers.

The reasons for this increase have been attributed to constraints on supply caused by pandemic-induced labor shortages, and increased demand for lumber caused by a Covid-19 related boom in domestic real estate and home improvements. In this paper, we examine the effect that these factors might have had on the increase in prices and the related changes in the welfare of U.S. lumber manufacturers and downstream users of lumber. We examine three cases where the demand function shifts outwards: (1) the lumber supply function remains unchanged; (2) the U.S. lumber supply function and that of its trading partners shifts inwards; and (3) U.S. lumber producers restrict output at its pre-Covid level. Overall, we find that U.S. producers gained between $0.7 and $8.0 billion per quarter as a result of the pandemic, while downstream processors gained $639 million. We argue, however, that the ultimate consumer of the downstream products that require lumber as an input (housing construction, furniture) might well be worse off as surplus lost as a result of reduced expenditures on commodities and services restricted by Covid-19 are not quite recovered when spending switches to lumber-related commodities.","output":"COVID-19 impacts on U.S. lumber markets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses of bats and pangolins have been implicated in the origin and evolution of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2.

Herein, we present a promising candidate for the treatment of crystalline silica-induced pulmonary inflammation, using a silicosis mouse model caused by intratracheal instillation based on local administration of -alanine and hydroxyl functionalized C70 fullerene nanoparticles (FNs). The results demonstrate that FNs could significantly alleviate inflammatory cells infiltration, lower the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduce the destruction of lung architecture stimulated by crystalline silica. Further investigations reveal that FNs could effectively inhibit the activation of NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3) inflammasome, and thus prevent the secretion of mature IL-1 and neutrophil influx, deriving from the superior ROS scavenging capability. Importantly, FNs could not cause any obvious toxicity after pulmonary administration.","output":"Fullerene nanoparticles: a promising candidate for the alleviation of silicosis-associated pulmonary inflammation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the clinical success of T cell checkpoint blockade, most cancer patients still fail to have durable responses to immunotherapy.

Using gene expression analysis and immunogenomics, we determined the adaptations associated with this resistance phenotype. Checkpoint resistance coincided with acquisition of a \\"hypermetabolic\\" phenotype characterized by coordinated upregulation of the glycolytic, oxidoreductase, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathways. These resistant tumors flourished under hypoxic conditions whereas metabolically starved T cells lost glycolytic potential, effector function, and the ability to expand in response to immunotherapy. Further, we found that checkpoint resistant versus sensitive tumors could be separated by non-invasive MRI imaging based solely on their metabolic state. In a cohort of melanoma patients resistant to both CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade, we observed upregulation of pathways indicative of a similar hypermetabolic state. Together these data indicated that melanoma can evade T cell checkpoint blockade immunotherapy by adapting a hypermetabolic phenotype.","output":"Melanoma Evolves Complete Immunotherapy Resistance through the Acquisition of a Hypermetabolic Phenotype"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesWe explored whether adapting traditional neuropsychological tests for online administration against the backdrop of COVID-19 was feasible for people with diverse forms of dementia and healthy older controls.

Later, it was shown that reactive nitrogen species could also modify proteins. Some protein oxidative modifications promote loss of protein function, cleavage or aggregation, and some result in proteotoxicity and cellular homeostasis disruption. However, not all oxidative modifications are necessarily associated with damage, as with Met and Cys protein residue oxidation. In these cases, redox state changes can alter protein structure, catalytic function, signaling processes in response to metabolic and/or environmental alterations. This review aims to integrate the present knowledge on redox modifications of proteins with their fate and role in redox signaling and human pathological conditions. CRITICAL ISSUES It is hypothesized that protein oxidation participates in the development and progression of many pathological conditions. However, no quantitative data has been correlated with specific oxidized proteins or the progression or severity of pathological conditions. Hence, the comprehension of the mechanisms underlying these modifications, their importance in human pathologies and, the fate of the modified proteins is of clinical relevance.

The overall approach contributes to decision making and support of the public health system and to the fight against the pandemic.","output":"Flattening the COVID-19 Curve: The\\"Greek\\"case in the Global Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cognitive ergonomics design of patient monitoring may reduce human factor errors in high-stress environments. Eye-tracking is a suitable tool to gain insight into the distribution of visual attention of healthcare professionals with patient monitors, which may facilitate their further development. METHODS: This prospective, exploratory, high-fidelity simulation study compared anesthesia personnels visual attention (fixation count and dwell-time) to 15 areas of interest on the patient monitor during non-critical and critical anesthesia situations. Furthermore, we examined the extent to which participants experience influenced visual attention and which vital signs displayed on the patient monitor received the most visual attention. We used mixed zero-inflated Poisson regression and mixed linear models to analyze the data. RESULTS: Analyzing 23 ten-minute scenarios, we found significantly more fixations to the areas of interest on the patient monitor during critical than non-critical situations (rate ratio of 1.45; 95% CI 1.33 to 1.59; p < 0.001). However, the dwell-time on the areas of interest did not significantly differ between the non-critical and critical situations (coefficient of ? 1.667; 95% CI ? 4.549 to 1.229; p = 0.27). The professional experience did not significantly influence the visual attention (fixation: rate ratio of 0.88; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.43; p = 0.61 and dwell-time: coefficient of 0.889; 95% CI ? 1.465 to 3.229; p = 0.27). Over all situations, anesthesia personnel paid the most attention to the vital signs blood pressure (fixation: mean [SD] of 108 [74.83]; dwell-time: mean [SD] of 27 [15.90] seconds), end-expiratory carbon dioxide (fixation: mean [SD] of 59 [47.39]; dwell-time: mean [SD] of 30 [21.51] seconds), and the electrocardiogram (fixation: mean [SD] of 58 [64.70]; dwell-time: mean [SD] of 15 [14.95] seconds). CONCLUSIONS: Critical anesthesia situations increased anesthesia personnels visual interaction with the patient monitor. Furthermore, we found that their visual attention focused mainly on a few vital signs. To assist clinicians in critical situations, manufacturers should optimize monitors to convey necessary information as easily and quickly as possible and optimize the visibility of less frequently observed but equally critical vital signs, especially when they are in an abnormal range.

Pigs affected by SVV have vesicles in the nose, hooves, and limp and may cause death in some severe cases. Occasionally, SVV has also been detected in mice, houseflies, environmental equipment, and corridors in pig farms. Moreover, it was successfully isolated from mouse tissue samples. In this study, an SVV strain (SVA/GD/China/2018) was isolated from a buffalo with mouth ulcers in the Guangdong province of China using seven mammalian cell lines (including BHK-21, NA, PK-15, ST, Vero, Marc-145, and MDBK). The genome of SVA/GD/China/2018 consists of 7,276 nucleotides. Multiple-sequence alignment showed that SVA/GD/China/2018 shared the highest nucleotide similarity (99.1%) with one wild boar-origin SVV strain (Sichuan HS-01) from the Sichuan province of China. Genetic analysis revealed that SVA/GD/China/2018 clustered with those porcine-origin SVV strains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of SVV infection in buffalo, which might expand the host range of the virus.

Recent work, however, suggests that this might be overrated in standard CNNs. In this paper, we are pushing the envelope and aim to investigate the reliance on spatial information further. We propose to discard spatial information via shuffling locations or average pooling during both training and testing phases to investigate the impact on individual layers. Interestingly, we observe that spatial information can be deleted from later layers with small accuracy drops, which indicates spatial information at later layers is not necessary for good test accuracy. For example, the test accuracy of VGG-16 only drops by 0.03% and 2.66% with spatial information completely removed from the last 30% and 53% layers on CIFAR-100, respectively.

This perception of universities as individualised communities rather than collective communities (Rousseau in Social Currents, 7(5), 395C401, 2020) accentuates the responsibilisation of individuals who are viewed as responsible for solving their own problems (Martinez and Garcia in What is neoliberalism, 2000), including ensuring their own safety (Garland in The British Journal of Criminology, 36(4), 445C471, 1996). Set against this social-political backdrop, this paper, using data from an online survey about students perceptions of on-campus safety at a university in the north of England, shows how some students, particularly women students, view others as dangerous, rather than view them as vulnerable groups who are residing on the margins of an inequitable society. The porous borders of the university campuses amplify some students perceptions of dangerous others and students suggestions for campus security to keep out such others arguably serve to aggravate rather than relieve their perceptions of unsafety. Yet the porous borders of the campuses should be seen as advantageous because an ecological university can connect its students to the wider world to help facilitate care for the other (Barnett in The ecological university, 2018). In doing so, this may enhance students own sense of well-being and safety in the urban environment. This is a timely argument amidst a global pandemic, where the university restricts access to unauthorised others and, in doing so, facilitates the makings of an exclusive community.","output":"The makings of an exclusive community: students perceptions of dangerous others"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientific knowledge has a well-established cycle of generating hypotheses, testing them in experiments with proper discussion, and submitting it to the scientific community analysis through publications.

Thus, health service providers should have access to mental health interventions that can reach more parents than traditional face-to-face interventions. However, despite increasing evidence on the efficacy of internet-based mental health interventions, the pace in transferring such interventions to health care has been slow. One of the major suggested barriers to this may be the health personnels attitudes to perceived usefulness of internet-based interventions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine health professionals perceived usefulness of internet-based mental health interventions and to identify the key areas that they consider new internet-based services to be useful. METHODS: Between May and September 2018, 2884 leaders and practitioners of infant and child health services were recruited to a cross-sectional web-based survey through the following channels: (1) existing email addresses from the Regional Centre for Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Eastern and Southern Norway, course database, (2) an official mailing list to infant and child health services, (3) social media, or (4) other recruitment channels. Respondents filled in background information and were asked to rate the usefulness of internet-based interventions for 12 different infant and child mental health problem areas based on the broad categories from the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC:0-5). Perceived usefulness was assessed with 1 global item: How often do you think internet-based self-help programs can be useful for following infant and child mental health problems in your line of work? The answers were scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (never) to 3 (often). RESULTS: The participants reported that they sometimes or often perceived internet-based interventions as useful for different infant and child mental health problems (scale of 0-3, all means>1.61). Usefulness of internet-based interventions was rated acceptable for sleep problems (mean 2.22), anxiety (mean 2.09), and social withdrawal and shyness (mean 2.07), whereas internet-based interventions were rated as less useful for psychiatric problems such as obsessive behaviors (mean 1.89), developmental disorders (mean 1.91), or trauma (mean 1.61). Further, there were a few but small differences in perceived usefulness between service leaders and practitioners (all effect sizes<0.32, all P<.02) and small-to-moderate differences among daycare centers, well-baby clinics, municipal child welfare services, and child and adolescent mental health clinics (all effect sizes<0.69, all P<.006). CONCLUSIONS: Internet-based interventions for different infant and child mental health problems within services such as daycare centers, well-baby clinics, municipal child welfare services, and child and adolescent mental health clinics are sometimes or often perceived as useful. These encouraging findings can support the continued exploration of internet-based mental health interventions as a way to improve parental support.","output":"Health Personnels Perceived Usefulness of Internet-Based Interventions for Parents of Children Younger Than 5 Years: Cross-Sectional Web-Based Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: This study investigates the association between the treatment with heparin and mortality in patients admitted with Covid-19. Methods: Routinely recorded, clinical data, up to the 24th of April 2020, from the 2075 patients with Covid-19, admitted in 17 hospitals in Spain between the 1st of March and the 20th of April 2020 were used. The following variables were extracted for this study: age, gender, temperature, and saturation of oxygen on admission, treatment with heparin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, steroids, tocilizumab, a combination of lopinavir with ritonavir, and oseltamivir, together with data on mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations. Results: At the time of collecting the data, 301 patients had died, 1447 had been discharged home from the hospitals, 201 were still admitted, and 126 had been transferred to hospitals not included in the study. Median follow up time was 8 (IQR:5-12) days. Heparin had been used in 1734 patients. Heparin was associated with lower mortality when the model was adjusted for age and gender, with OR (95%CI): 0.55 (0.37-0.82) p=0.003. This association remained significant when saturation of oxygen <90%, and temperature >37C were added to de model with OR: 0.54(0.36-0.82) p=0.003, and also when all the other drugs were included as covariates OR: 0.42 (0.26-0.66) p<0.001.

Taking the context of health care, ML took over the control and helping many practitioners for effective decision-making. Practically, this is once again proved by the researchers as they are using the ML algorithms for fast detection of COVID-19 and steps are initiated for the drug discovery of the same. In this chapter, we initially discuss the work happening in COVID-19 using ML algorithms. Then, we summarize the role of ML for analyzing and assessing various chronic diseases. Even though ML algorithms are predicting multidimensional aspects of the target disease, the experts in the field are still hesitating to use those outcomes as they lack in justification. To address this, a separate concept called explainable AI (XAI) is discussed. Data scientists are using ML algorithms to address chronic health issues with less cost and in a more accurate way. The question is, how ML could achieve this? This will be the main motivation for the entire chapter. In a recent report of a Harvard Medical Survey, it said that nearly 5, 000, 000 Indians die every year due to the medical errors (Harvard, 2020). These errors are getting reduced when the same disease is analyzed with ML. There is a famous proverb, Prevention is better than cure. According to World Health Organization, in most of the cases, chronic diseases cannot be prevented. But, the impact of them can be reduced with proper data collection and effective analysis using advanced ML algorithms. For instance, to detect lung cancer, it would cost hundreds of dollars for undergoing diagnosis and medication. Above that, if the disease is detected in the advanced stages then the probability of the cure is also very less. All these negative consequences can be reduced drastically when the usage of ML for health care is further exploited. ?

We hypothesized that inactivation of the 2-O-methyltransferase (2-O-MTase) activity of nsp16 and the endocytosis signal of the spike protein attenuates PEDV yet retains its immunogenicity in pigs. We generated a recombinant PEDV, KDKE(4A), with quadruple alanine substitutions in the catalytic tetrad of the 2-O-MTase using a virulent infectious cDNA clone, icPC22A, as the backbone. Next, we constructed another mutant, KDKE(4A)-SYA, by abolishing the endocytosis signal of the spike protein of KDKE(4A). Compared with icPC22A, the KDKE(4A) and KDKE(4A)-SYA mutants replicated less efficiently in vitro but induced stronger type I and type III interferon responses. The pathogenesis and immunogenicities of the mutants were evaluated in gnotobiotic piglets. The virulence of KDKE(4A)-SYA and KDKE(4A) was significantly reduced compared with that of icPC22A. Mortality rates were 100%, 17%, and 0% in the icPC22A-, KDKE(4A)-, and KDKE(4A)-SYA-inoculated groups, respectively. At 21 days postinoculation (dpi), all surviving pigs were challenged orally with a high dose of icPC22A. The KDKE(4A)-SYA- and KDKE(4A)-inoculated pigs were protected from the challenge, because no KDKE(4A)-SYA- and one KDKE(4A)-inoculated pig developed diarrhea whereas all the pigs in the mock-inoculated group had severe diarrhea, and 33% of them died. Furthermore, we serially passaged the KDKE(4A)-SYA mutant in pigs three times and did not find any reversion of the introduced mutations. The data suggest that KDKE(4A)-SYA may be a PEDV vaccine candidate. IMPORTANCE PEDV is the most economically important porcine enteric viral pathogen and has caused immense economic losses in the pork industries in many countries. Effective and safe vaccines are desperately required but still not available. 2-O-MTase (nsp16) is highly conserved among coronaviruses (CoVs), and the inactivation of nsp16 in live attenuated vaccines has been attempted for several betacoronaviruses. We show that inactivation of both 2-O-MTase and the endocytosis signal of the spike protein is an approach to designing a promising live attenuated vaccine for PEDV. The in vivo passaging data also validated the stability of the KDKE(4A)-SYA mutant. KDKE(4A)-SYA warrants further evaluation in sows and their piglets and may be used as a platform for further optimization. Our findings further confirmed that nsp16 can be a universal target for CoV vaccine development and will aid in the development of vaccines against other emerging CoVs.","output":"Engineering a Live Attenuated Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Vaccine Candidate via Inactivation of the Viral 2'-O-Methyltransferase and the Endocytosis Signal of the Spike Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In view of the possible disruptions in the manufacturing and supply of health products following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Tunisian medicines regulatory authority was mobilized to guarantee patient safety.

Joint efforts for effective surveillance of COVID-19 require immediate transmission of reliable data. In this regard, a standardized and interoperable reporting framework is essential in a consistent and timely manner. Thus, this research aimed at to determine data requirements towards interoperability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional and descriptive study, a combination of literature study and expert consensus approach was used to design COVID-19 Minimum Data Set (MDS). A MDS checklist was extracted and validated. The definitive data elements of the MDS were determined by applying the Delphi technique. Then, the existing messaging and data standard templates (Health Level Seven-Clinical Document Architecture [HL7-CDA] and SNOMED-CT) were used to design the surveillance interoperable framework. RESULTS: The proposed MDS was divided into administrative and clinical sections with three and eight data classes and 29 and 40 data fields, respectively. Then, for each data field, structured data values along with SNOMED-CT codes were defined and structured according HL7-CDA standard. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The absence of effective and integrated system for COVID-19 surveillance can delay critical public health measures, leading to increased disease prevalence and mortality. The heterogeneity of reporting templates and lack of uniform data sets hamper the optimal information exchange among multiple systems. Thus, developing a unified and interoperable reporting framework is more effective to prompt reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) surveillance system: Development of COVID-19 minimum data set and interoperable reporting framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we introduce an interactive telecommunication system that supports video/audio signal acquisition, data processing, transmission, and 3D animation for post stroke rehabilitation.

Nanomedicine is an emerging class of therapeutics in which a drug is packaged into a nanoparticle that promotes uptake of the drug at a tumor site, shielding it from uptake by peripheral organs and enabling the safe delivery of chemotherapeutics that have poor aqueous solubility, short plasma half-life, narrow therapeutic window, and toxic side effects. Despite the advantages of nanomedicines for cancer, there remains significant challenges to improve uptake at the tumor and prevent premature clearance from the body. In this review, we summarize the effects of first-pass metabolism on a nanoparticles journey to a tumor and outline future steps that we believe will improve the efficacy of cancer nanomedicines. ABSTRACT: Nanomedicines represent the cutting edge of todays cancer therapeutics. Seminal research decades ago has begun to pay dividends in the clinic, allowing for the delivery of cancer drugs with enhanced systemic circulation while also minimizing off-target toxicity. Despite the advantages of delivering cancer drugs using nanoparticles, micelles, or other nanostructures, only a small fraction of the injected dose reaches the tumor, creating a narrow therapeutic window for an otherwise potent drug. First-pass metabolism of nanoparticles by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) has been identified as a major culprit for the depletion of nanoparticles in circulation before they reach the tumor site. To overcome this, new strategies, materials, and functionalization with stealth polymers have been developed to improve nanoparticle circulation and uptake at the tumor site. This review summarizes the strategies undertaken to evade RES uptake of nanomedicines and improve the passive and active targeting of nanoparticle drugs to solid tumors. We also outline the limitations of current strategies and the future directions we believe will be explored to yield significant benefits to patients and make nanomedicine a promising treatment modality for cancer.","output":"A Nanoparticles Journey to the Tumor: Strategies to Overcome First-Pass Metabolism and Their Limitations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic in China in December 2019, information and discussions about COVID-19 have spread rapidly on the internet and have quickly become the focus of worldwide attention, especially on social media. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to events related to COVID-19 in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. METHODS: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST Content Mining System version 6.0 was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content. RESULTS: The study has four main findings. First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage were slightly different. Third, the emotional tendency of the public toward the COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics changed from negative to neutral, with negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. Fourth, we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories: the situation of the new cases of COVID-19 and its impact, frontline reporting of the epidemic and the measures of prevention and control, expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection, medical services on the frontline of the epidemic, and focus on the worldwide epidemic and the search for suspected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that social media (eg, Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention toward public health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention.

Health authorities recommend influenza (flu) vaccinations in a number of categories at risk of serious medical complications, including: people aged &#8805;65 years, or patients with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), renal failure, cancer, immunodeficiencies, chronic hepatopathies, and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. The seasonal flu peak certainly preceded that of the pandemic; however, it would seem clear that the two viruses have been simultaneously circulating in Italy for a while. Hence, after the peak of seasonal flu, influenza-like illness-related (ILI) deaths started to grow again. While some of the excess mortality reported in the ILI group may be attributable to COVID-19, a question arises: do we have to consider this observation as a result of a random sequence of events or a potential relationship between the two viruses play a role?

It would be of great relevance to identify people at very high risk of mortality as a result of an overlapping or combination of risk factors that were separately reported in patients who died from COVID-19 or influenza. A description of the subgroup of people at higher risk of mortality will be crucial for prioritizing and implementing future public health prevention and treatment programs.","output":"Simultaneous circulation of COVID-19 and flu in Italy: Potential combined effects on the risk of death?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In studying the causes of human gastroenteritis, electron microscopy and related techniques have led to the identification of new viral agents that had previously escaped detection by routine cell culture procedures.

Here we report a virus enzyme assay as an alternative to these methods for detection of acute viral infection. In this method, we used a luciferin derivative as the substrate for detection of the enzyme activity of influenza viral neuraminidase as a means for diagnosis of influenza. The resulting commercial test, the qFLU Dx Test, uses a different supply chain that does not compete with those for the current tests. The assay reagents were formulated as a master mix that accommodated both the neuraminidase and luciferase reactions, thereby enabling rapid and prolonged production of stable light signal in the presence of influenza virus in the sample. The assay was evaluated using depository throat swab specimens. As expected, the assay exhibited similar detection rates for all influenza types and subtypes except for A(H7N9), which exhibited lower detection rate due to lower viral titer in the specimens. When throat swab specimens were diluted with the sample buffer of the test kit and tested with the qFLU Dx Test. The sensitivity and specificity were 82.41% (95% confidence interval: 79.66C85.84%) and 95.39% (95% confidence interval: 94.32C96.46%), respectively, for these diluted specimens in comparison to a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay.

The first and largest COVID-19 outbreak in Romania was recorded in Suceava, N/E region of the country, and originated at the Suceava regional county hospital. Following sheltering-in-place measures, infection rates decreased, only to rise again after relaxation of measures. This study describes the incursion of SARS-CoV-2 in Suceava and other parts of Romania and analyzes the mutations and their association with clinical manifestation of the disease during the period of COVID-19 outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis indicated multiple sites of origin for SARS-CoV-2 strains in Suceava, specifically from Spain, Italy and Russia, but also other strains related to those from Czech Republic, Belgium and France. Most Suceava samples contained mutations common to European lineages, such as A20268G, however aproximately 10% of samples were missing such mutations, indicating a possible different origin. While overall genome regions ORF1ab, S and ORF7 were subject to most mutations, several recurring mutations such as C27707T were identified, and these were mainly present in severe forms of the disease. Non-synonymous mutations, such as C3225A (Thr987Asn in NSP3a domain), associated with changes in a protein responsible for decreasing viral tethering in human host were also present. Patients with diabetes and hypertension exhibited eight and three time,s respectively, higher odds ratios of acquiring severe forms of the disease and these were mainly related to C27707T mutation. These results will aid in tracing virus movement throughout Romania and identification of infectivity, virulence and pathogenicity.","output":"Analysis of genome characteristics and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 strains in North-East of Romania during the first COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 patients are generally asymptomatic during initial SARS-CoV-2 replication, but may suffer severe immunopathology after the virus has receded and blood monocytes have infiltrated the airways. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with severe COVID-19, lung-infiltrating monocytes expressed high mRNA levels encoding inflammatory mediators, including CXCL8 and IL-1?, and contained SARS-CoV-2 transcripts. To study this process in more depth, we developed a novel organotypic model whereby primary human blood monocytes are transmigrated across a differentiated human lung epithelium infected by SARSCoV-2. Infiltrating monocytes acquired SARS-CoV-2 from the epithelium and upregulated expression and secretion of inflammatory mediators including CXCL8 and IL-1?, mirroring in vivo data. The JAK1/2 inhibitor baricitinib gained emergency use authorization by the FDA for the treatment of COVID-19 originally in combination with the antiviral remdesivir, and recently as a stand-alone treatment. To explore the mechanisms by which baricitinib alone or in combination with remdesivir may result in more favorable disease outcomes, we leveraged this model to characterize viral burden, gene expression and inflammatory mediator secretion by lung epithelial cells and infiltrating monocytes. As expected, remdesivir decreased viral burden in both the epithelium and monocytes, while baricitinib enhanced antiviral signaling and decreased specific inflammatory mediators in monocytes. Combined use of baricitinib and remdesivir enhanced the rate of virus clearance from SARS-CoV-2-positive monocytes. Taken together, baricitinib enhances the antiviral state of monocytes infiltrating the COVID-19 lung, while decreasing the expression of inflammatory mediators, thus limiting the likelihood of a cytokine storm and ensuing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).Funding: This study was supported by NSF EAGER award 2032273 (to RT, RFS and KZ) and Woodruff Health Science Center COVID-19 CURE award (to RT, RFS, KZ, MB and VS).

We aimed to systematically evaluate the risk of COVID-19 infection and the risk of severe COVID-19 disease associated with previous exposure to (ACEi) and/or ARB). Methods MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection were searched in June 2020 for controlled studies. Eligible studies were included and random-effects meta-analyses were performed. The estimates were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Heterogeneity was assessed with I2 test. The confidence in the pooled evidence was appraised using the GRADE framework. Results Twenty-seven studies were included in the review. ACEi/ARB exposure did not increase the risk of having a positive test for COVID-19 infection (OR 0.99, 95%CI 0.89-1.11; I2=36%; 5 studies, GRADE confidence moderate). The exposure to ACEi/ARB did not increase the risk of all-cause mortality among patients with COVID-19 (OR 0.91, 95%CI 0.74-1.11; I2=20%; 17 studies; GRADE confidence low) nor severe/critical COVID-19 disease (OR 0.90, 95%CI 0.74-1.11; I2=55%; 17 studies; GRADE confidence very low). Exploratory analyses in studies enrolling hypertensive patients showed a association of ACEi/ARB with a significant decrease of mortality risk. Conclusions ACEi/ARB exposure does not seem to increase the risk of having the SARS-CoV-2 infection or developing severe stages of the disease including mortality. The potential benefits observed in mortality of hypertensive patients reassure safety, but robust studies are required to increase the confidence in the results.","output":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers and the risk of COVID-19 infection or severe disease: Systematic Review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of sudden cardiac death which can be prevented by early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). International bodies recommend that basic life support (BLS) skills be taught in schools in order to increase the rate of bystander CPR and reduce mortality from OHCA. We are not aware of any BLS education program for non-healthcare students in Nigeria. This study was to assess the awareness and attitude to acquiring BLS skills among university students. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among final year university undergraduates using a questionnaire that assessed students' sociodemographic characteristics, awareness of CPR, previous experiences, and attitude to basic life support (BLS). Counts and proportions were compared for the demographic characteristics using Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: Four hundred and seventy-five students from 15 faculties participated in this study, median age was 22.8 years (interquartile range: 21.2C24.5 years). Majority (82.5%) have heard of CPR, 29.7% have undergone CPR training; 77.3% of those who had been trained were confident that they could perform CPR. Previous CPR training was significantly associated with faculty, year of study and age. Eighty-nine (18.7%) students have witnessed someone die from a trauma. Four hundred and fifty (94.7%) respondents would like to get BLS training, 440 (92.6%) think that CPR training should be included in the school curriculum. CONCLUSION: There is good awareness and positive attitude to the acquisition and practice of cardiopulmonary resuscitation among university students in Nigeria.

Samples experiencing covariate shift but not semantic shift are either excluded from the test set or treated as OOD, which contradicts the primary goal in machine learning -- being able to generalize beyond the training distribution. In this paper, we take into account both shift types and introduce full-spectrum OOD (FS-OOD) detection, a more realistic problem setting that considers both detecting semantic shift and being tolerant to covariate shift; and designs three benchmarks. These new benchmarks have a more fine-grained categorization of distributions (i.e., training ID, covariate-shifted ID, near-OOD, and far-OOD) for the purpose of more comprehensively evaluating the pros and cons of algorithms. To address the FS-OOD detection problem, we propose SEM, a simple feature-based semantics score function. SEM is mainly composed of two probability measures: one is based on high-level features containing both semantic and non-semantic information, while the other is based on low-level feature statistics only capturing non-semantic image styles. With a simple combination, the non-semantic part is cancelled out, which leaves only semantic information in SEM that can better handle FS-OOD detection. Extensive experiments on the three new benchmarks show that SEM significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

During the initial UK lockdown, the 'household' and 'home' were deployed in public rhetoric as default spaces of care and security in the face of widespread isolation and uncertainty. However, emergent proximities created by bringing people together in the assumed safety of home also deepened existing inequalities and vulnerabilities. Using anthropological theory, third sector evidence, and ethnographic interview data we explore this process.

The long-term consequences of COVID-19 are not fully understood and there is no clear consensus on the definition of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). The reported prevalence of PASC widely varies from 10% up to 87%. The purpose of this study is to assess PASC in cancer patients following acute COVID-19 recovery. Methods We assessed cancer patients at MD Anderson Cancer Center who were diagnosed with COVID-19 disease between March 1, 2020 and Sept 1, 2020. Using patient questionnaires and medical chart reviews we followed these patients from March 2020 till May 2021. Patient questionnaires were sent out remotely daily for 14 days after COVID-19 diagnosis then weekly for 3 months, and then monthly thereafter. Chart reviews were conducted for each patient hospital re-admission and emergency department visit. These admissions were classified as either COVID-19 related or non-related. The persistence or emergence of new COVID19-related symptoms were captured at each COVID-19 related admission. Results We included 312 cancer patients with a median age of 57 years (18-86). The majority of patients had solid tumors (75%). Of the 312 patients, 188 (60%) reported long COVID-19 symptoms with a median duration of 7 months and up to 14 months after COVID-19 diagnosis. The most common symptoms reported included fatigue (82%), sleep disturbances (78%), myalgias (67%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (61%), followed by headache, altered smell or taste, dyspnea (47%) and cough (46%). A higher number of females reported a persistence of symptoms compared to males (63% vs 37%;p=0.036).

Innovation in learning, research, and community service without mobility from home is needed to overcome the impact of Covid-19. Methods of internet-based learning, research, and community service must be established during the pandemic to generate a reliable yet efficient blended program that can accommodate their outcomes. This paper will generally look at the initiative and strategy taken by UGM in planning and developing a sustainable research-based learning and community services. It is based on integrated research-based learning and community service, which integrates former individual education, research, and community service programs. The policy of considering COVID-19 as an emergency at UGM has eliminated teaching and learning activities on campus and replaced them with online learning activities from home. The application of the Three-Centra Education concept, which consists of families, schools, and communities, is truly relevant for developing research-based learning and service programs. Besides, academic and non-academic atmospheres to support integrated education, research, and community service processes in universities in the current era must be developed under millennial students style. The millennial approach's adjustment is possible by developing tutoring systems through student-centered learning with the edutainment process that triggers the learning system to be more enjoyable, but the quality is still maintained. This quality of online learning during an emergency in UGM has been improved based on conducted surveys indicating that the advantages of online lectures, according to students, are its flexibility and relaxation;no preparation needed to visit campus;more courageous to ask questions during lecture;most materials are well documented for rereading;time and cost-efficient. Meanwhile, online learning disadvantages covered the fact that the lectures confused with online assignments that caused an excessive workload;the lecturers need to be more interactive and communicative;the schedule should not be frequently changed until later evening, and decrease concentration ability among students. University leaders, the academic community, including alumni, have been building solidarity, compassion, and empathy through food assistance, credit, academic fee reduction, non-bureaucratic procedures for students affected by COVID-19.

The anthrax attack coincided with the first report in 2002 of the de novo synthesis in the test tube of a pathogenic human virus, poliovirus, that was equally shocking because it indicated that dangerous infectious agents could be produced in laboratories outside of government control.

The reason older patients and males show increased risk of severe disease and death remains uncertain. Sex hormones, such as estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone, might be implicated in the age-dependent and sex-specific severity of COVID-19. High testosterone levels could upregulate transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), facilitating the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Data from patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen-deprivation therapy seem to confirm this hypothesis. Clinical studies on TMPRSS2 inhibitors, such as camostat, nafamostat, and bromhexine, are ongoing. Antiandrogens, such as bicalutamide and enzalutamide, are also under investigation. Conversely, other studies suggest that the immune modulating properties of androgens could protect from the unfavorable cytokine storm, and that low testosterone levels might be associated with a worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Some evidence also supports the notion that estrogens and progesterone might exert a protective effect on females, through direct antiviral activity or immune-mediated mechanisms, thus explaining the higher COVID-19 severity in post-menopausal women.

The primary outcomes were 90-day modified Rankin Scale, mortality, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS A total of 281 patients from 18 centers were enrolled. GA was used in 69.8% (196/281) of patients. Baseline demographic and procedural factors were comparable between the LA and GA groups, except the former demonstrated longer time-to-groin puncture (395.4254 versus 337.4208 min; P=0.04), lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS; 16.25.8 versus 18.86.9; P=0.002), lower balloon-guide catheter usage (22.4% versus 49.2%; P=0.0001), and longer fluoroscopy times (39.533 versus 2822.8 min; P=0.008). Recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b; 72.94% versus 73.6%; P=0.9) and rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (7.1% versus 11.2%; P=0.4) were similar but modified Rankin Scale 2 was achieved in more LA patients, 52.6% versus 35.6% (odds ratio, 1.4 [1.1-1.8]; P=0.01). In multivariate analysis, hypertension, NIHSS, unsuccessful revascularization, and GA use (odds ratio, 3.3 [1.6-7.1]; P=0.001) were associated with death.

Strategies to maintain social connections have been proposed. It is unclear if the reported experiences of social isolation and loneliness are comparable for older immigrants and if the proposed strategies are relevant to this vulnerable population. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap. Design/methodology/approach This scoping review addressed two questions: What evidence exists on the experience of social isolation and loneliness in older immigrants? What strategies can be beneficial to keep older immigrants socially connected during the COVID-19 pandemic? The search for relevant articles was done in several databases covering the scientific and gray literature, using keywords that reflect the diversity of terminology referring to the main concepts (isolation and loneliness) and target population (older immigrants). Discussion papers and research studies were reviewed, and the main points or findings were documented on data ion forms and summarized in a table. The information in the table was compared and contrasted to identify common themes. Findings Only six articles (four discussion papers and two studies) met the scoping review's eligibility criteria. Concerns about interruptions of older immigrants' social connection during the pandemic were partially corroborated with the studies' results. Most participants shifted the medium of their contacts from in-person to telephone or social media, and perceived no change in the experience of loneliness. Those with high levels of loneliness reported heightened anxiety and depression. The proposed strategies entailed the use of technology to connect with others and to deliver services, outdoor group activities within the constraints of containment measures and provision of culturally tailored social programs or services. Research limitations/implications The acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategies should be examined to determine the best practices aimed to promote social connection among older immigrants within and outside the context of the pandemic. Originality/value The scoping review identified strategies that can be used to address social isolation and loneliness among older immigrants during the pandemic.","output":"Social isolation and loneliness in older immigrants during COVID-19: a scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The discovery of different antimicrobial agents has revolutionized the treatment against a variety of infections for many decades, but the emergence of antimicrobial resistance require rigorous measures, even amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This retrospective study aimed to examine the consumption of antibiotics in patients with COVID-19 admitted into the five hospitals in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. We collected data on the consumption of antibiotics, classified using the World Health Organization (WHO) AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve), within two monthsAugust and September, 2020, and the corresponding months in 2019. Consumption of antibiotics was presented as daily define dose (er 100 occupied bed-days. Eight different classes of antibiotics were prescribed to patients with COVID-19 without culture tests being performed, with the prescribing of antibiotics of the Watch category was especially prevalent.

Furthermore, over the past 10 years, we have not reduced the difference between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. Therefore, the extension of healthy life expectancy and the development of a healthy society are the most urgent issues. In terms of medical care, the changing times have inevitably led to changes in disease structures and medical demands; therefore, the medical delivery system has had to be changed to meet these demands. As dementia rapidly increases, it is important to address \\"frailty,\\" a condition in which people become more vulnerable to environmental factors as they age, and there is a need to provide services to older people, particularly the old-old, that emphasize quality of life in addition to medical care. To realize a super-aged society that will remain vigorous and vibrant for many years, we need to rethink the future of Japanese medicine and healthcare, and the state of society. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROBLEMS Disparity between healthy life expectancy and average life expectancy in the realization of a healthy society It is a challenge to build a society with a long and healthy life expectancy through comprehensive prevention and management of lifestyle-related diseases, as well as the elucidation of the factors that explain sex differences in healthy life expectancy, based on the recognition that lifestyle-related diseases in midlife are risk factors for frailty and dementia in old age. Challenges in medical care for building a super-aged and healthy society The challenges include promoting clinical guidelines suitable for older people, including lifestyle-related disease management, promoting comprehensive research on aging (basic research, clinical research and community collaboration research), and embodying a paradigm shift from \\"cure-seeking medical care\\" to \\"cure- and support-seeking medical care.\\" Furthermore, the key to the future of integrated community care is the development of a comprehensive medical care system for older people in each region and the development of the next generation of medical personnel. Dissemination of frailty prevention measures in a super-aged society The concept of frailty encompasses the meaning of multifacetedness and reversibility; therefore, a comprehensive approach is required, including the renewal of conventional prevention activities in each region, such as the nutritional status of older people, physical activity including exercise, and various opportunities for social participation and participation conditions. Challenges of an unstable diet and undernutrition in older people According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of Japan, energy and protein intakes are low in Japanese people aged 75 years; particularly in people aged 80 years, low and insufficient intake of nutrients are prominent. Undernutrition in older people is increasing and is more pronounced in women. There are multiple factors behind this, including social factors, such as living alone, eating alone, poverty and other social factors, as well as problems with access to food security. Pharmacotherapy for older people: measures against polypharmacy In addition to the problems of adverse drug events, drug interactions, duplication of effects and the presence of drugs that \\"require particularly careful administration,\\" it is also necessary to take measures against polypharmacy in older people, as well as medical economic issues, such as high drug costs and large amounts of remaining drugs. Barriers to this measure include multiple medical institution visits for each disease, lack of coordination between professions, and lack of understanding by patients and families. Role of local communities in a healthy society The decline in the working-age population is also a major challenge; however, we need to make a shift to use this declining birthrate and aging population as an opportunity rather than a crisis. As we look ahead to the coming of the 100-year age of life, we rethink the creation of a comprehensive society and community, and aim to create an age-free society where everyone can play an active role and live in peace, regardless of age. CONTENTS OF THE PROPOSAL In this report, we have put together a vision for the future of an aging Japanese society from a broader perspective of how the environment and local communities should be, rather than simply from the perspective of individual health. We aim to convey this proposal to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, the Cabinet Office, and various professional organizations. The paradigm shift from \\"cure-seeking medical care\\" to \\"cure- and support-seeking medical care\\" should be promoted for the development of a healthy society While further promoting pre-emptive medical care in the medical care for older people, the development of multidisciplinary medical guidelines appropriate for older people should be promoted at the same time. In addition, we should promote basic aging research, clinical research (including the long-term care field) and transitional research that cover regional areas. Furthermore, while promoting the paradigm shift from \\"cure-seeking medical care\\" to \\"cure- and support-seeking medical care,\\" the development of various comprehensive medical treatment systems for older people and the strengthening of integrated community care systems should be promoted. Development of the next generation of medical personnel to comprehensively deal with geriatric care, including training geriatric specialists, should be promoted As the number of older people with multimorbidities and frailty rapidly increases in the future, we should promote the development of the next generation of medical personnel who can comprehensively handle medical care for older people, including training leading geriatricians in cooperation with multiple professions in the integrated community care system to provide sufficient medical care. Countermeasures for frailty in older people should be promoted from medical and community planning perspectives To address frailty, which requires comprehensive evaluation and intervention, the three pillars of frailty prevention (nutrition, exercise and social participation) should be incorporated and addressed as part of community development within each municipality, taking into account local characteristics. In particular, it is necessary to revise the way of thinking about nutrition management in older people and the guidelines of the societies in the field. In addition, it is important to strengthen industry-academia-government-private partnerships in each region, taking into account not only medical issues, but also social factors, and encourage the development of momentum in the entire region regarding measures against undernutrition in older people. Polypharmacy measures should be promoted in pharmacotherapy for older people It is necessary to promote cooperation between physicians and pharmacists, establish other multiprofessional cooperation systems, and develop medical and long-term care insurance systems to support this. It is also essential to change the public's mindset, and awareness-raising activities at all levels are required, including the enhancement of educational materials for medical caregivers and the general public. In addition, the economic impact of healthcare using big data should be timely clarified. Innovation in medical and urban planning perspectives should be promoted In the future, it will be necessary to modify and update multidisciplinary approaches such as social participation (e.g. participation in a salon) with a view to innovation in both medical care and community development, especially on the idea of a symbiotic community. In addition, industry-academia-government-private partnership is necessary, including all aforementioned, such as places where people can play an active role in the rest of their lives (such as employment), promotion of human connections, promotion of technology to support older people and support for daily life.

We describe the technique of single incision laparoscopic splenectomy for hypersplenism in a 5-year-old boy with spherocytosis. CASE REPORT The patient required blood transfusions for anemia secondary to hypersplenism. His spleen measured 9.8 cm in cranio-caudal length on ultrasound. SILS splenectomy was performed through a 2-cm umbilical incision by using 3 ports. The splenic attachments were taken down using an electrosurgical sealing and cutting device, and the hilum was transected with an endosurgical stapler. The spleen was placed in an endosurgical bag, morcellated, and removed from the abdomen via the umbilical incision without complications. Operative time was 84 minutes; blood loss was minimal. CONCLUSION SILS splenectomy is feasible in pediatric patients. More experience is needed to assess advantages and disadvantages compared with the standard laparoscopic approach.","output":"Single incision laparoscopic splenectomy in a 5-year-old with hereditary spherocytosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Nanoparticles (NPs) are small entities that consist of a hydroxyapatite core, which can bind ions, proteins, and other organic molecules from the surrounding environment. These small conglomerations can influence environmental calcium levels and have the potential to modulate calcium homeostasis in vivo. Nanoparticles have been associated with various calcium-mediated disease processes, such as atherosclerosis and kidney stone formation. We hypothesized that nanoparticles could have an effect on other calcium-regulated processes, such as wound healing. In the present study, we synthesized pH-sensitive calcium-based nanoparticles and investigated their ability to enhance cutaneous wound repair. METHODS Different populations of nanoparticles were synthesized on collagen-coated plates under various growth conditions. Bilateral dorsal cutaneous wounds were made on 8-week-old female Balb/c mice. Nanoparticles were then either administered intravenously or applied topically to the wound bed. The rate of wound closure was quantified. Intravenously injected nanoparticles were tracked using a FLAG detection system. The effect of nanoparticles on fibroblast contraction and proliferation was assessed. RESULTS A population of pH-sensitive calcium-based nanoparticles was identified. When intravenously administered, these nanoparticles acutely increased the rate of wound healing. Intravenously administered nanoparticles were localized to the wound site, as evidenced by FLAG staining. Nanoparticles increased fibroblast calcium uptake in vitro and caused contracture of a fibroblast populated collagen lattice in a dose-dependent manner. Nanoparticles also increased the rate of fibroblast proliferation. CONCLUSION Intravenously administered, calcium-based nanoparticles can acutely decrease open wound size via contracture. We hypothesize that their contraction effect is mediated by the release of ionized calcium into the wound bed, which occurs when the pH-sensitive nanoparticles disintegrate in the acidic wound microenvironment. This is the first study to demonstrate that calcium-based nanoparticles can have a therapeutic benefit, which has important implications for the treatment of wounds.","output":"Calcium-based nanoparticles accelerate skin wound healing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hollow structures have been shown to be fruitful in addressing the cycling-stability problem of high-capacity electrode materials.

First of all, the risk of receiving poor medical care due to the double stigma of being affected by a mental disorder and Covid infection, in addition to the many other additional barriers, including poverty, marginal housing, and food insecurity. Moreover, in some countries, in a situation where demands for intensive care exceeded the treatment facilities available, the tragical ethical dilemma regarding the choice of people to be saved was resolved with the option in favor of healthier and/or younger people who have more chances of recovery, thus excluding, among others, aged people with severe mental disorders such as dementias. In other countries, ethical concerns emerged related to the enhanced risk of involuntary hospital admission of individuals with severe mental illness mainly due the high likelihood of these patients violating physical-distancing and other safety rules. Social distancing measures have determined, among others, relevant obstacles for direct access to psychiatric care services, with the consequent adoption of the so called telepsychiatry of tele mental health by mental health services, a measure which unfortunately has cut off a large amount of patients who have not been able to benefit from these innovative methods of care both because of barriers posed by their own serious mental conditions, and by the impossibility of having the necessary technology.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","output":"Ethical issues under the pressure of COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: There is an urgent public need to readdress the school closure strategies.

DESIGN: Ecological analysis of COVID-19-related mortality rates occurring by 24 April 2020 and ethnic composition of the population. Account is taken of age, population density, area deprivation and pollution. SETTING: Local authorities in England. RESULTS: For every 1% rise in proportion of the population who are ethnic minority, COVID-19-related deaths increased by 512, 95% CI (400 to 624), per million. This rise is present for each ethnic minority category examined, including the white minority group. The size of this increase is a little reduced in an adjusted model to 442, 95% CI (224 to 660), suggesting that some of the association results from ethnic minority people living in more densely populated, more polluted and more deprived areas.This estimate suggests that the average England COVID-19-related death rate would rise by 25% in a local authority with two times the average number of ethnic minority people. CONCLUSIONS: We find clear evidence that rates of COVID-19-related mortality within a local authority increases as the proportion of the population who are ethnic minority increases. We suggest that this is a consequence of social and economic inequalities driven by entrenched structural and institutional racism and racial discrimination.

We sought to provide direct proof of the global population's altered use of Wikipedia medical knowledge resulting from the new COVID-19 pandemic and related global restrictions. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify temporal search trends and quantify changes in access to Wikipedia Medicine Project articles that were related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of medical articles across nine language versions of Wikipedia and country-specific statistics for registered COVID-19 deaths. The observed patterns were compared to a forecast model of Wikipedia use, which was trained on data from 2015 to 2019. The model comprehensively analyzed specific articles and similarities between access count data from before (ie, several years prior) and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wikipedia articles that were linked to those directly associated with the pandemic were evaluated in terms of degrees of separation and analyzed to identify similarities in access counts. We assessed the correlation between article access counts and the number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases and deaths to identify factors that drove interest in these articles and shifts in public interest during the subsequent phases of the pandemic. RESULTS: We observed a significant (P<.001) increase in the number of entries on Wikipedia medical articles during the pandemic period. The increased interest in COVID-19-related articles temporally correlated with the number of global COVID-19 deaths and consistently correlated with the number of region-specific COVID-19 deaths. Articles with low degrees of separation were significantly similar (P<.001) in terms of access patterns that were indicative of information-seeking patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of Wikipedia medical article popularity could be a viable method for epidemiologic surveillance, as it provides important information about the reasons behind public attention and factors that sustain public interest in the long term.

Since then, there was an increase in the number of firearm purchases. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the incidence of gunshot wounds (GSWs) to the head and neck increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study reviewed patients in the Trauma Registry at Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) in Atlanta, GA. Patients were included if they: 1) sustained GSW to head and neck, 2) activated the Trauma Registry, and 3) were treated at GMH. Patients were stratified according to date of injury into 1 distinct time period: 1) March 13 to August 13, 2019 (i.e., before the COVID-19 pandemic, BC19) or 2) March 13 to August 13, 2020 (i.e., during initial 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, C19) (Figure 1). March 13 was chosen because COVID-19 was announced as a national emergency on that date. The research team collected patient demographics, distressed communities index (DCI), social history, and etiology of GSW. Details regarding extent of GSW injury (i.e., isolated soft tissue, bony, other locations of injuries) were recorded. Injury severity was described using the following variables: status of patient and Glasgow Coma scale (GCS) on arrival to GMH, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in Emergency Department (ED), diagnosis of shock on admission, disposition from ED, ICU length of stay (LOS), total days on mechanical ventilator (MV), hospital LOS, and hospital discharge status. Descriptive statistics were performed. Univariate and bivariate analysis were performed. The Chi-squared test was used for categorical variables. Statistical significance was P < .05. Results During the study period, 948 patients sustained GSW. Of them, 215 patients had GSWs to head and neck. The BC19 group had 96 patients (78 males) with a mean age of 31.5 years old (range 7-82). The C19 group had 119 patients (101 males) with an average age 32.7 years (range 14-82). Overall, there was a 10.4% increase in incidence of GSW to head and neck during C-19 (Figure 2). The data showed that alcohol abuse was associated with an increase in GSW to the head and neck (P < .0001). The mean DCI for C19 group was lower than BC19 by 8%, meaning that the distress to the population was decreased. GSW to base of skull occurred 34.5% more often during C19 (P = .002), and intracranial injuries occurred 26% more often during BC19 (P = .03). In the BC19 group, 85.4% of the patients arrived alive to GMH, compared to 16% in C19 group. Patients had shock on admission (BC-19; n = 22, 22.9 %, C-19; n = 24, 20.2%). Researchers found that the status on arrival to ED (i.e., alive) was statistically significant (P < .0001). Outcomes data Researchers found a 10.4% increase in the incidence of GSWs to the head and neck during C-19. Specifically, the peak incidence occurred during May, June, and July, with 25 cases per month (Figure 2). The peak in incidence was parallel with the shelter-in-place order in the state of GA that was issued on April 3, 2020. The finding is consistent with previous studies that showed an increase in gun violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion In conclusion, understanding the underlying causes for the increase in GSW to the head and neck during the COVID-19 pandemic is imperative for implementing gun violence prevention programs.

Methods We searched online databases (CINAHL, Embase?, ERIC, MEDLINE?, ProQuest, PubMed? and Web of ScienceTM) for articles published between January 2000 and May 2018. Eligible studies evaluated the delivery of school-based eye-care programmes, reporting results in terms of spectacle compliance rates, quality of screening or attitude changes. We considered studies to be ineligible if no follow-up data were reported. Two authors screened titles, abstracts and full-text articles, and we extracted data from eligible full-text articles using the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality rights-based conceptual framework. Findings Of 24 559 publications screened, 48 articles from 13 countries met the inclusion criteria. Factors involved in the successful provision of school-based eye-care interventions included communication between health services and schools, the willingness of schools to schedule sufficient time, and the support of principals, staff and parents. Several studies found that where the numbers of eye-care specialists are insufficient, training teachers in vision screening enables the provision of a good-quality and cost-effective service. As well as the cost of spectacles, barriers to seeking eye-care included poor literacy, misconceptions and lack of eye health knowledge among parents. Conclusion The provision of school-based eye-care programmes has great potential to reduce ocular morbidity and developmental delays caused by childhood vision impairment and blindness.

For example, platelets can act as circulating sentinels by expressing Toll-like receptors (TLR) that bind pathogens and this allows platelets to effectively kill them or present them to cells of the immune system. Furthermore, activated platelets secrete and express many pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules that attract and capture circulating leukocytes and direct them to inflamed tissues. In addition, platelets can directly influence adaptive immune responses via secretion of, for example, CD40 and CD40L molecules. Platelets are also the source of most of the microvesicles in the circulation and these miniscule elements further enhance the platelets ability to communicate with the immune system. More recently, it has been demonstrated that platelets and their parent cells, the MK, can also uptake, process and present both foreign and self-antigens to CD8+ T-cells conferring on them the ability to directly alter adaptive immune responses.

This study aims to investigate whether ACEI/ARB aggravates liver injury and the association of inflammatory cytokines and antiviral drugs with liver dysfunction in patients with hypertension and COVID-19.Method: This retrospective study included 127 hypertensive patients with long-term use or nonuse of ACEI/ARBs hospitalized for COVID-19 from January 30 to April 7, 2020, in Tongji hospital of Wuhan, China. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected.Results: Of the 127 patients with COVID-19 and hypertension, 43 taking long-term of ACEI/ARBs and 84 without using ACEI/ARBs. Abnormal liver function was observed in part of ACEI/ARB and non-ACEI/ARB users but without significant differences between these two groups. Serum inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF&#945;, as well as inflammation-related markers, ferritin, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein, were significantly elevated in patients with liver dysfunction. IL-6 level was positively correlated with liver function tests on admission and highly consistent with the changes of abnormal ALT, AST, and GGT during hospitalization, but the correlations of other inflammatory cytokines were low. There was no significant association between the use of antiviral drugs and liver dysfunction in these patients.Conclusion: The elevation of inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, but not ACEI/ARB and antiviral drugs, is closely associated with liver dysfunction in patients with hypertension and COVID-19.","output":"Association of ACEI/ARB, inflammatory cytokines, and antiviral drugs with liver dysfunction in patients with hypertension and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disinfection of sewage sludge has become a hot focus due to the outbreak of COVID-19, which belongs to one aspect of sludge harmless treatment. However, the threat of sludge to the environment is not only caused by harmful microbes. It is necessary to explore energy recovery and resource utilization of sludge treatment that is based on harmlessness, volume reduction and stabilization. Various advanced technologies were integrated to build an advanced anaerobic digestion system in Beijing urban area, which has achieved a good sludge treatment effect in the past three years since its construction and operation. Thermal hydrolysis can effectively inactivate harmful microorganisms, the hygienic properties of advanced anaerobic digestion products can meet the standard, and its heavy metals contents are significantly lower than the related standard limit, which have changed to more stable forms. The unit treatment capacity of digester increased to 3.6 times that of conventional anaerobic digestion due to the modification effect of thermal hydrolysis on sludge properties, saving about 68% investment in digester construction. The degradation rate of organics increased from 40% to 52%, indicating that the stability of the digestion products was further improved, the residual solids were further reduced with the volume reduction rate of sludge increased from 28% to 66%. The biogas production rate was greatly increased with the improvement of organic conversion efficiency. Even operated below capacity, the advanced anaerobic digestion system still had the capacity to output 4 08910~4 kWh power under the condition that deducting the heat and power consumption of the system itself from the energy recovered. The treatment and disposal process of sludge were successfully connected by the resource utilization of advanced anaerobic digestion products.

Eight were connected to ECMO, whereas seven animals were not. In addition, six animals received sham treatment with saline. Four human patients with ECMO and ARDS were also monitored. In the pigs, as lung injury ensued, the PFR dramatically increased and a particular spike followed the establishment of ECMO in the LPS\\\\treated animals. PFR remained elevated in all animals with no signs of lung recovery. In the human patients, in the two that recovered, PFR decreased. In the two whose lung function deteriorated while on ECMO, there was increased PFR with no sign of recovery in lung function.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to explore the acceptability of different infectious disease control measures, and examine how respondents trade off between economic and health outcomes. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was developed, with attributes covering: control restrictions, duration of restrictions, tracking, number of infections and of deaths, unemployment, government expenditure and additional personal tax. A representative sample of Australians (n = 1046) completed the survey, which included eight choice tasks. Data were analysed using mixed logit regression to identify heterogeneity and latent class models to examine heterogeneity. RESULTS: In general, respondents had strong preferences for policies that avoided high infection-related deaths, although lower unemployment and government expenditure were also considered important. Respondents preferred a shorter duration for restrictions, but their preferences did not vary significantly for the differing levels of control measures. In terms of tracking, respondents preferred mobile phone tracking or bracelets when compared to no tracking. Significant differences in preferences was identified, with two distinct classes: Class 1 (57%) preferred the economy to remain open with some control measures, whereas Class 2 (43%), had stronger preferences for policies that reduced avoidable deaths.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients who presented to a virtual urgent care platform over 1 month during the COVID-19 pandemic surge. We described scaling our telemedicine urgent care capacity, described patient clinical characteristics, assessed for emergency department (ED) referrals, and analyzed postvisit surveys. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 17,730 patients were seen via virtual urgent care; 454 (2.56%) were referred to an ED. The most frequent diagnoses were COVID-19 related or upper respiratory symptoms. Geospatial analysis indicated a wide catchment area. There were 251 providers onboarded to the platform; at peak, 62 providers supplied 364 h of coverage in 1 day. The average patient satisfaction score was 4.4/5.

The cumulative incidence in China by 24 January was estimated at 6924 cases (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4885, 9211) and 19,289 cases (95% CI: 10,901, 30,158), respectively. The latest estimated values of the cCFR were 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5%, 7.5%) for Scenario 1 and 8.4% (95% CI: 5.3%, 12.3%) for Scenario 2. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.2) and 3.2 (95% CI: 2.7, 3.7) for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on these results, we argued that the current COVID-19 epidemic has a substantial potential for causing a pandemic. The proposed approach provides insights in early risk assessment using publicly available data.","output":"Real-Time Estimation of the Risk of Death from Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection: Inference Using Exported Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article identifies tensions between the human rights central to a return to classroom-based education during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The quarantine period during corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak might affect the quality of life leading thousands of individuals to diminish the daily caloric expenditure and mobility, leading to a sedentary behavior and increase the number of health disorders. Exercising is used as a non-pharmacological treatment in many chronic diseases. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms of physical exercise in COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. We also point links between exercise, mental, and cardiovascular health. The infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 affects host cells binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. If there is not enough oxygen supply the lungs and other tissues, such as the heart or brain, are affected. SARS-CoV-2 enhances ACE2 leading to inflammation and neuronal death with possible development of mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Physical exercise also enhances the ACE2 expression. Conversely, the activation of ACE2/Ang 1-7/Mas axis by physical exercise induces an antiinflammatory and antifibrotic effect. Physical exercise has beneficial effects on mental health enhancing IGF-1, PI3K, BDNF, ERK, and reducing GSK3 levels. In addition, physical exercise enhances the activity of PGC-1/ FNDC5/Irisin pathway leading to neuronal survival and the maintenance of a good mental health. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to elevation of ACE2 levels through pathological mechanisms that lead to neurological and cardiovascular complications, while the physiological response of ACE2 to physical exercise improves cardiovascular and mental health.","output":"Physical exercise effects on the brain during COVID-19 pandemic: links between mental and cardiovascular health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Starting from the N-terminus of archaeal and bacterial B-family DNA polymerases, three domains include the N-terminal, exonuclease, and polymerase domains. The N-terminal domain of the archaeal B-family DNA polymerase has a conserved deoxyuracil-binding pocket for specially binding the deoxyuracil base on DNA. The exonuclease domain is responsible for removing the mismatched base pair. The polymerase domain is the core functional domain and takes a highly conserved structure composed of fingers, palm and thumb subdomains. Previous studies have demonstrated that the thumb subdomain mainly functions as a DNA-binding element and has coordination with the exonuclease domain and palm subdomain. To further elucidate the possible functions of the thumb subdomain of archaeal B-family DNA polymerases, the thumb subdomain of Pyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase was mutated, and the effects on three activities were characterized. Our results demonstrate that the thumb subdomain participates in the three activities of archaeal B-family DNA polymerases as a common structural element. Both the N-terminal deoxyuracil-binding pocket and thumb subdomain are critical for deoxyuracil binding. Moreover, the thumb subdomain assists DNA polymerization and hydrolysis reactions, but it does not contribute to the fidelity of DNA polymerization.","output":"The thumb subdomain of Pyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase is responsible for deoxyuracil binding, hydrolysis and polymerization of nucleotides."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to present reflections on cooking skills in times of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic The current period of uncertainty and isolation heightens food insecurity issues, influencing food choice, purchase, and preparation Social media and networks are sources of entertainment and learning, with vast resources for cooking skills, which can stimulate home cooking and strengthen family ties Research has evidenced the positive relationship between cooking and diet quality, an important factor for groups at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19 For some individuals, cooking may be a strategy to reduce anxiety and stress associated with the pandemic However, the Brazilian reality is marked by inequalities in income and access to food Thus, more vulnerable populations may not have the same relationship with cooking Public policies should focus on food and nutrition programs and actions for the development of cooking skills as a means to promote healthy eating and encourage self-care","output":"Cooking skills during the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since early March 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic across the United Kingdom has led to a range of social distancing policies, which have resulted in reduced mobility across different regions Crowd level data on mobile phone usage can be used as a proxy for actual population mobility patterns and provide a way of quantifying the impact of social distancing measures on changes in mobility Methods: Here, we use two mobile phone-based datasets (anonymised and aggregated crowd level data from O2 and from the Facebook apon mobile phones) to assess changes in average mobility, both overall and broken down into high and low population density areas, and changes in the distribution of journey lengths Results: We show that there was a substantial overall reduction in mobility, with the most rapid decline on the 24th March 2020, the day after the Prime Ministera?s announcement of an enforced lockdown The reduction in mobility was highly synchronized across the UK Although mobility has remained low since 26th March 2020, we detect a gradual increase since that time We also show that the two different datasets produce similar trends, albeit with some location-specific differences We see slightly larger reductions in average mobility in high-density areas than in low-density areas, with greater variation in mobility in the high-density areas: some high-density areas eliminated almost all mobility Conclusions: These analyses form a baseline from which to observe changes in behaviour in the UK as social distancing is eased and inform policy towards the future control of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK","output":"Anonymised and aggregated crowd level mobility data from mobile phones suggests that initial compliance with COVID-19 social distancing interventions was high and geographically consistent across the UK [version 1;peer review: awaiting peer review]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated workflow changes, such as deployment on pediatric faculty burnout in an early epicenter of the pandemic. We hypothesized burnout would increase during the COVID-19 surge. METHODS: We conducted serial cross-sectional surveys of pediatric faculty at an academic, tertiary-care children's hospital that experienced a COVID-19 surge in the Northeastern United States. Surveys were administered pre-surge (February 2020), during the surge (April 2020), and postsurge (September 2020). The primary outcome was burnout prevalence. We also measured areas of worklife scores. We compared responses between all 3 survey periods. Continuous variables were analyzed by using Student's t or Mann-Whitney tests, and categorical variables were analyzed by using 2 or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. RESULTS: Our response rate was 89 of 223 (40%) presurge, 100 of 267 (37%) during the surge, and 113 of 275 (41%) postsurge.

Interactive music provides one of the most effective psychosocial interventions for people with dementia; it can allay agitation and promote wellbeing. Since COVID-19 has halted the delivery of in-person musical activities, it is important for the welfare of people with dementia and their carers to investigate what alternatives to live music making exist, how these alternatives are delivered and how their accessibility can be expanded. This community case study examines recent practice in online music-making in response to COVID-19 restrictions for people with dementia and their supporters, focusing on a UK context. It documents current opportunities for digital music making, and assesses the barriers and facilitators to their delivery and accessibility. Online searches of video streaming sites and social media documented what music activities were available. Expert practitioners and providers collaborated on this study and supplied input about the sessions they had been delivering, the technological challenges and solutions they had found, and the responses of the participants. Recommendations for best practice were developed and refined in consultation with these collaborators. Over 50 examples of online music activities were identified. In addition to the challenges of digital inclusion and accessibility for some older people, delivering live music online has unique challenges due to audio latency and sound quality. It is necessary to adapt the session to the technology's limitations rather than expect to overcome these challenges. The recommendations highlight the importance of accessibility, digital safety and wellbeing of participants. They also suggest ways to optimize the quality of their musical experience.

Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with an increased risk of mental health problems as well as individual responses to stress. Studies have discussed the relationship between low serum vitamin D concentrations and depressive symptoms, suggesting that maintaining adequate concentrations of serum vitamin D seems to have a protective effect against it. Vitamin D was found to contribute to improved serotonergic neurotransmission in the experimental model of depression by regulating serotonin metabolism. The signaling of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the active form of vitamin D, through vitamin D receptor (VDR) induces the expression of the gene of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), influences the expression of serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) as well as the levels of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), the enzyme responsible for serotonin catabolism. Vitamin D also presents a relevant link with chronobiological interplay, which could influence the development of depressive symptoms when unbalance between light-dark cycles occurs. In this Perspective, we discussed the significant role of vitamin D in the elevation of stress-related depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.

These differences raise the question whether nations with lower incidence share any medical commonalities that could be used to not only explain that lower incidence, but that could also provide guidance for potential treatments elsewhere. Such treatment would be particularly valuable if it could be used as a prophylactic against COVID-19 transmission, thereby effectively slowing spread of the disease while we await the wide availability of safe and effective vaccines. Here, we show that countries with routine mass drug administration of prophylactic chemotherapy including Ivermectin have significantly lower incidences of COVID-19. Prophylactic use of Ivermectin against parasitic infections is most common in Africa and we hence show that the reported correlation is highly significant both when compared among African nations as well as in a worldwide context. We surmise that this may be connected to Ivermectin's ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication which likely leads to lower infection rates. However, other pathways must exist to explain persistence of such inhibitory effect after serum levels of Ivermectin have declined. It is suggested that Ivermectin be evaluated for potential off-label prophylactic use in certain cases to help bridge the time until a safe and effective vaccine becomes available.","output":"A COVID-19 Prophylaxis?

PAH has high mortality, and risk assessment is critical for proper management. Whether the right ventricle to pulmonary artery (RV-PA) coupling accurately assesses risk status and predicts prognosis in patients with SSc-associated PAH has not been investigated. METHODS: Between March 2010 and July 2018, 60 consecutive patients with SSc-associated PAH diagnosed by right heart catheterization were enrolled prospectively, and the mean follow-up period was 52.9  27.0 months. The RV-PA coupling was assessed by the ratio of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) which was obtained by transthoracic echocardiography. The simplified risk stratification strategy was applied to assess the risk level of participants, and the endpoint was a composite of all-cause death and clinical worsening. RESULTS: The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the ability to determine high-risk patients identified the optimal cut-off value of the TAPSE/PASP ratio as 0.194 mm/mmHg, and the ratio appeared to be a reliable indicator in the stratification of patients with high risk (area under the curve = 0.878, ROC P-value = 0.003), which showed the highest positive likelihood ratio (LR) (5.4) and the lowest negative LR (0) among a series of echocardiographic parameters. The TAPSE/PASP ratio was an independent predictive factor (HR = 0.01, 95% CI: 0.00C0.77, P = 0.037) for the composite endpoint, and patients with a TAPSE/PASP ratio >0.194 had a better overall survival for both the composite endpoint (log-rank (2) = 5.961, P = 0.015) and all-cause mortality (log-rank (2) = 8.004, P = 0.005) compared to the patients with a TAPSE/PASP  0.194. CONCLUSION: RV-PA coupling assessed by the TAPSE/PASP ratio provides added value as a straightforward and non-invasive approach for predicting risk stratification of patients with SSc-associated PAH.

We aimed to investigate whether risks of hospital admission and death, overall and by specific cause, are raised following discharge from a COVID-19 hospitalisation. METHODS AND FINDINGS: With the approval of NHS-England, we conducted a cohort study, using linked primary care and hospital data in OpenSAFELY to compare risks of hospital admission and death, overall and by specific cause, between people discharged from COVID-19 hospitalisation (February to December 2020) and surviving at least 1 week, and (i) demographically matched controls from the 2019 general population; and (ii) people discharged from influenza hospitalisation in 2017 to 2019. We used Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, smoking status, deprivation, and comorbidities considered potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes. We included 24,673 postdischarge COVID-19 patients, 123,362 general population controls, and 16,058 influenza controls, followed for 315 days. COVID-19 patients had median age of 66 years, 13,733 (56%) were male, and 19,061 (77%) were of white ethnicity. Overall risk of hospitalisation or death (30,968 events) was higher in the COVID-19 group than general population controls (fully adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.22, 2.14 to 2.30, p < 0.001) but slightly lower than the influenza group (aHR 0.95, 0.91 to 0.98, p = 0.004). All-cause mortality (7,439 events) was highest in the COVID-19 group (aHR 4.82, 4.48 to 5.19 versus general population controls [p < 0.001] and 1.74, 1.61 to 1.88 versus influenza controls [p < 0.001]). Risks for cause-specific outcomes were higher in COVID-19 survivors than in general population controls and largely similar or lower in COVID-19 compared with influenza patients. However, COVID-19 patients were more likely than influenza patients to be readmitted or die due to their initial infection or other lower respiratory tract infection (aHR 1.37, 1.22 to 1.54, p < 0.001) and to experience mental health or cognitive-related admission or death (aHR 1.37, 1.02 to 1.84, p = 0.039); in particular, COVID-19 survivors with preexisting dementia had higher risk of dementia hospitalisation or death (age- and sex-adjusted HR 2.47, 1.37 to 4.44, p = 0.002). Limitations of our study were that reasons for hospitalisation or death may have been misclassified in some cases due to inconsistent use of codes, and we did not have data to distinguish COVID-19 variants. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that people discharged from a COVID-19 hospital admission had markedly higher risks for rehospitalisation and death than the general population, suggesting a substantial extra burden on healthcare. Most risks were similar to those observed after influenza hospitalisations, but COVID-19 patients had higher risks of all-cause mortality, readmission or death due to the initial infection, and dementia death, highlighting the importance of postdischarge monitoring.","output":"Overall and cause-specific hospitalisation and death after COVID-19 hospitalisation in England: A cohort study using linked primary care, secondary care, and death registration data in the OpenSAFELY platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), adolescents in 70 countries have suffered the COVID-19 pandemic and flood disasters simultaneously. Although antecedent cyberbullying variables have attracted significant research attention, the effects of psychological distress and the potential mechanisms of cyberbullying among adolescents under multiple disasters remains unclear. Based on social-ecological system theory, this study examines the moderating effects of parentCchild relationships and the negotiable fate on the relationship between psychological distress and cyberbullying. A total of 1204 middle school students (52.4% boys) who suffered from floods and the COVID-19 pandemic from Zhengzhou City, China, are the participants. The results reveal that psychological distress was positively related to adolescent cyberbullying during a disaster. ParentCchild relationships and negotiable fate significantly moderate the relationship between psychological distress and cyberbullying.

Building upon this premise, examination was conducted on the domains of social determinants of health, specifically the social and community context per Healthy People 2030 objectives. These mechanisms of social interaction, in the form of group activities, community engagement, and virtual interactions via email or text message, were assessed using hierarchical regression analysis to find out their association with wellbeing, depression symptoms, and cognition of older adults. The data included a total of 4623 sample of older adults from the National Health and Aging Trend Study (NHATS) Round 8. The results showed that social support explained a 40.3% unique variance on wellbeing. The use of text message and email had a moderating effect on community engagement and self-reported depression level in older adults. Findings suggest that community programs, shared group activities, or technology training workshops can improve social interaction and support cognition and reduce depression in older adults. Directions for future research include examining human behaviors and perceptions and increasing technology training sessions to promote independence of older adults and increase their social connections.

A rapid etiological diagnosis is critical for optimizing the antibiotic use. Owing to the variety of possible pathogens and the time needed for bacterial cultures or usual polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, timely and precise diagnosis is a huge challenge. Several new rapid multiplex assays have been developed in the last decade to resolve these issues. This review aims to provide an overview of recent evidence on improvements and limitations of new rapid molecular assays for pneumonia. RECENT FINDINGS Several rapid multiplex-PCR assays are commercially available for upper or lower respiratory tract samples, allowing detection of a wide range of respiratory viruses, bacteria, and, in some cases, of several antibiotic resistance genes. Clinical evaluations demonstrated their good correlation with gold-standard assays but their lack of exhaustiveness, especially for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Studies that evaluated their potential benefits on antibiotic use suffered from important weaknesses with conflicting and limited results. SUMMARY New molecular assays may enable improvements in patient management and antibiotic use. Available studies highlight several benefits and the strong interrelations needed between microbiologists and physicians for their implementation and interpretation according to the clinical and epidemiological context.","output":"Molecular diagnostic methods for pneumonia: how can they be applied in practice?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Family caregivers of community-dwelling older adults have faced unprecedented caregiving challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Examining the accumulated impact on family caregivers can help health and aging service providers design resources and supports that are resilient to emergency situations, and reduce negative psychological and physical consequences and risk of abuse within caregiving dyads. Data was collected as part of a pilot intervention in which Care Coaches provided telephonic coaching sessions to family caregivers of older adults. We examined Care Coach observations documented after coaching sessions with 24 family caregivers between March 2020 and February 2021. Two coders employed thematic analysis to generate codes and themes. The sample was 70% female, 80% were the spouse or significant other of their care receiver, the mean age was 61, and 53% were Non-Hispanic White. Themes and sub-themes included: (1) increased caregiver burden and diminished care networks due to fear of exposure to or contraction of COVID-19, (2) barriers to accessing in-home personal assistance services and home-delivered meals despite intervention efforts, and (3) the exacerbation of caregiver social isolation due to COVID-19 lockdown policies. Findings highlight the ways in which COVID-19 has amplified caregiver burden through the breakdown of formal and informal support systems. Potential adaptations of community-based services for older adults and their caregivers include remote service liaisons and need assessment of caregiver dyads to assure access to home-based personal assistance services and nutrition support for those at greatest risk of negative consequences during emergency service lapses.","output":"Caregiving and COVID-19: Perspectives from a Care Coach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Interstitial Cystitis (IC) is a chronic and rare disease, more frequent in women.

Mortality rates reported between 13 to over 30% in SOT recipients. SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 vaccination may help reduce the morbidity and mortality of COVID\\\\19 among SOT. There is paucity of literature of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination efficacy in lung transplantation recipients . The purpose of the study was 1) to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 vaccination efficacy & safety in lung transplantation recipients and 2) to assess the need for 3rd booster dose. Methods A retrospective study (from Jan 2021 till Oct 2021) of lung transplantation recipients receiving 2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination available in India i.e. ChAdOx1 nCoV- 19 Corona Virus Vaccine (Recombinant) or Whole-Virion Inactivated Vero Cell vaccine, was done to evaluate vaccination efficacy and safety. SARS-CoV-2 spike COVID antibodies levels were checked 4 weeks after 2nd dose of vaccination. Local and Systemic reactions to vaccination were noted Results 11 Bilateral lung transplantation recipients and 4 Combined Heart-Lung transplantation recipients received SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Out of 15 recipients, 11 recipients received ChAdOx1 nCoV- 19 Corona Virus Vaccine (Recombinant) and 4 recipients received Whole-Virion Inactivated Vero Cell vaccine. 12 recipients developed mild pain at vaccination site, 2 recipients developed local tenderness and 1 recipient developed redness at vaccination site as part of local reaction . 5 recipients developed fever, 5 recipients experienced fatigue/bodypain, 2 recipients had vomiting, 2 recipients experienced headache & 1 recipient developed abdominal pain as part of systemic reactions. 8 (53.3%) out of 15 recipients developed significant SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies level demonstrating vaccination efficacy. 7 (46.6%) recipients demonstrated lower SARS-CoV-2 antibodies titre (Less than cut off values) indicating no significant vaccination efficacy. 1 recipient developed vaccine breakthrough mild infection after 2nd dose.

This study aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on EC educators wellbeing and educator-child relationships, as growing evidence shows the influence of these factors on childrens developmental outcomes. In July 2020, members of a Research Network of EC Professionalswho previously identified educator wellbeing as a priority issuewere invited to participate in an online survey. The survey included two published, validated scales: the Early Childhood Professional Wellbeing scale (ECPW) and the StudentCTeacher Relationship Scale (modified).

Two hundred and thirty-two EC educators from across Australia completed the survey, mostly from Victoria where lockdowns were most severe. Linear regression analysis demonstrated stronger professional wellbeing was associated with less conflict in educator-child relationships and lower risk of staff turnover. This was more likely to be experienced by senior or more experienced staff. Although a negative impact of COVID-19 was reported, ECPW scores were relatively high, and organizational structures supporting professional wellbeing were most strongly associated with lower risk of turnover (r = 0.63, p < 0.001).

Peripheral arterial disease and high blood pressure are conditions that identify individuals at high cardiovascular disease risk, likely to benefit from cardiovascular risk management. Both conditions remain considerably underdiagnosed and untreated. The National Health Service abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening programmes represent an opportunity to screen for these conditions with potentially minimal additional effort or cost. We explored AAA screening programme staff views on the proposed introduction of such additional screening within AAA screening. METHODS: Nine focus groups and seven follow-on interviews were undertaken with 38 AAA screening staff. Our study methods were oriented broadly towards a grounded theory methodology, and data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: (i) Perceptions of patient experience and health-related outcomes, (ii) Opportunities and challenges for programme staff, and (iii) Maintaining and improving programme standards. Staff talked about the high uptake of AAA screening, staff experience and skills in their role, and the programmes high quality standards as both opportunities and potential challenges linked to the proposed additions to AAA screening. While positive about the potential to improve patients health outcomes, participants had questions about the practicalities of incorporating additional procedures within their time- and resource-constrained context, and how this may reconfigure work processes, roles and relationships. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed additions to the programme require taking staffs views into account.

Methods: In this 12-month randomized, controlled, prospective trial, 26 participants (44 eyes) completed the study. Patients were randomly allocated to the IFN-2a or CsA groups. All patients in both groups received a standardized prednisone burst and tapering schedule as per protocol. The primary outcome measures were response rate, complete remission rate, and tolerance rate. The secondary outcome measures included time to achieve complete remission, the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and Beh?ets disease ocular attack score 24 (BOS24). T-tests and non-parametric tests were used to compare quantitative variables, and chi-square tests were performed to compare qualitative variables. Results: The response and complete remission rates were 85.7% (12/14 patients) and 50.0% (7/14 patients) in the IFN-2a group, compared with 66.7% (8/12 patients) and 25.0% (3/12 patients) in the CsA group, respectively (p > 0.05). Complete remission was achieved at 3.3 and 7.0 months after initiation of IFN-2a and CsA (p = 0.023). LogMAR BCVA significantly improved 1 month after IFN-2a initiation (23 eyes) (p = 0.002), and this beneficial effect remained statistically significant during the entire follow-up period (p < 0.05); however, this improvement was not observed in the CsA group (21 eyes). At the endpoint, LogMAR BCVA in the IFN-2a group was significantly better (0.22 vs. 0.31, p = 0.031) with a higher improvement rate (60.9 vs. 47.6%, p > 0.05). Moreover, compared to the CsA group, more eyes in the IFN-2a group had a lower BOS24 score (87.0 vs. 57.1%, p = 0.042). None of the patients had any side effects that influenced the medication adherence. Conclusion: Compared to CsA plus corticosteroid, IFN-2a plus corticosteroid appears to induce a better treatment response, a significantly greater improvement in visual acuity, and more stable remission of intraocular inflammation in a 12-month study period.","output":"Comparison of the Safety and Efficacy of Interferon Alpha-2a and Cyclosporine-A When Combined With Glucocorticoid in the Treatment of Refractory Beh?ets Uveitis: A Randomized Controlled Prospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No studies have measured the periodontal inflamed surface area in people with dementia, although periodontal disease is a major health issue in this group.

METHODS Baseline ischemic core and hypoperfusion volumes were assessed prior to randomized treatment with intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) alone versus IV tPA + endovascular therapy (Solitaire stent-retriever) using RAPID automated postprocessing software. Reperfusion was assessed with angiographic Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scores at the end of the procedure (endovascular group) and Tmax > 6-second volumes at 27 hours (both groups). Infarct volume was assessed at 27 hours on noncontrast CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS A total of 151 patients with baseline imaging with CT perfusion (79%) or multimodal MRI (21%) were included. The median baseline ischemic core volume was 6 ml (interquartile range= 0-16). Ischemic core volumes correlated with 27-hour infarct volumes in patients who achieved reperfusion (r = 0.58, p < 0.0001). In patients who did not reperfuse (<10% reperfusion), baseline Tmax > 6-second lesion volumes correlated with 27-hour infarct volume (r = 0.78, p = 0.005). In target mismatch patients, the union of baseline core and early follow-up Tmax > 6-second volume (ie, predicted infarct volume) correlated with the 27-hour infarct volume (r = 0.73, p < 0.0001); the median absolute difference between the observed and predicted volume was 13 ml.

Clinical data of HCoV patients were compared with those infected by rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 5131 hospitalizations for respiratory causes in children. A total of 3901 cases (75.9%) had a positive viral identification and 205 cases (4.1%) were positive for HCoV. Only 41 cases (20%) of HCoV infection were detected as single infections. Episodes of recurrent wheezing were the most common diagnosis, and 112 children (54%) had hypoxia. Clinical data in HCoV cases were similar to those associated with rhinovirus; however, patients with HCoV were younger.

PD patients older than 70 years of age, those with advanced Parkinson's disease, those with reductions in their medications, and non\\\\Hispanics (largely comprised of Black/African\\\\ Americans) had a statistically significant higher mortality rate, if infected. CONCLUSIONS: PD did not increase mortality rates from SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection when age was controlled. However, certain unalterable factors (advanced disease and age greater than 70 years) and alterable ones (reductions in PD medications) placed PD patients at increased risk for mortality. Also several socioeconomic factors contributed to mortality, for example, non\\\\Hispanic patients with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection fared worse, likely driven by poorer outcomes in the Black/African\\\\American cohort.","output":"Outcome of Hospitalized Parkinson's Disease Patients with and without COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Current management of fibrous dysplasia (FD) involving the paranasal sinuses and the adjacent skull base is currently controversial. This study aims to present our experience in the management strategy of FD that involves the paranasal sinuses and the adjacent skull base. METHODS: Twenty three patients from 2006 to 2019 with monostotic fibrous dysplasia (MFD), polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (PFD), or McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) involving the paranasal sinuses and the adjacent skull base were retrospectively reviewed. This study series was divided into 3 groups based on management strategies: the observation group, the surgery group, and the optic nerve decompression group. RESULTS: The observation group included 9 patients with asymptomatic MFD with stable condition during the follow-up period of 15 to 164 months. The surgery group included 10 symptomatic patients with MFD who had personalized endoscopic endonasal surgery. The symptoms of the patients were relieved after surgery. The optic nerve decompression group included 4 patients with visual loss, who underwent endonasal endoscopic optic nerve decompression (EOND) with the aid of image-guided navigation. Their vision improved after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical observation and periodic computed tomography (CT) scan are adopted for asymptomatic patients. Surgery is indicated in symptomatic patients. Optic nerve decompression is recommended as soon as possible if the patient has visual loss, whereas prophylactic decompression is not recommended if the optic nerve is encroached by FD without visual loss. Navigation plays an important role in endoscopic surgery involving the paranasal sinuses and the adjacent skull base, especially in FD resection and optic nerve decompression.","output":"Management Strategies of Fibrous Dysplasia Involving the Paranasal Sinus and the Adjacent Skull Base"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tested in vitro on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, grapefruit IntegroPectin is a powerful protective, antioxidant and antiproliferative agent.

This study included patients with coronavirus disease-2019, who were hospitalized between February 9, 2020, and March 30, 2020. Univariate Cox regression analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO) were used to select variables. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was applied to identify independent risk factors in coronavirus disease-2019. A total of 1135 patients were analyzed during the study period. A total of 35 variables were considered to be risk factors after the univariate regression analysis of the clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters (p < .05), and LASSO regression analysis screened out seven risk factors for further study. The six independent risk factors revealed by multivariate Cox regression were myoglobin (HR, 5.353; 95% CI, 2.633-10.882; p < .001), C-reactive protein (HR, 2.063; 95% CI, 1.036-4.109; p = .039), neutrophil count (HR, 2.015; 95% CI, 1.154-3.518; p = .014), interleukin 6 (Il-6; HR, 9.753; 95% CI, 2.952-32.218; p < .001), age (HR, 2.016; 95% CI, 1.077-3.773; p = .028), and international normalized ratio (HR, 2.595; 95% CI, 1.412-4.769; p = .002). Our results suggested that inflammation-associated factors were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality in coronavirus disease-2019 patients. C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, and interleukin 6 were independent factors for predicting in-hospital mortality and had a better independent predictive ability.

Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (Project ECHO?) is an established hub-and-spoke tele-education model aimed at building capacity and expertise in primary care providers. Our qualitative study explored how learning experiences within an ECHO mental health care program supported provider learning and ability to solve complex clinical problems. METHODS: We sampled ECHO sessions across a 34-week cycle and analyzed audio transcribed data. Two individuals coded participant interactions during 2-hour recorded sessions using an iterative, constant comparative methodology. RESULTS: The authors identified four key mechanisms of learning in ECHO: (1) fostering participants' productive struggle with cases, (2) development of an integrated understanding, (3) collaborative reformulation of cases, and (4) generation of conceptual solutions based on a new understanding. Throughout the ECHO sessions, learning was observed to be multidirectional from both the hub-to-spoke and between spoke sites. DISCUSSION: Despite the widespread implementation of Project ECHO and other virtual learning models, a paucity of research has focused on mechanisms of virtual learning within these models. Our study demonstrated a bidirectional exchange of knowledge between hub specialist teams and primary care provider spokes that aligned with the development of adaptive expertise through specific learning experiences in Project ECHO. Moreover, the ECHO structure may further support the development of adaptive expertise to better prepare participants to address patients' complex mental health needs.","output":"Building Mental Health Capacity: Exploring the Role of Adaptive Expertise in the ECHO Virtual Learning Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Ebola virus (EBOV) genome encodes a partly conserved 40-residue nonstructural polypeptide, called the delta peptide, that is produced in abundance during Ebola virus disease (EVD). The function of the delta peptide is unknown, but sequence analysis has suggested that delta peptide could be a viroporin, belonging to a diverse family of membrane-permeabilizing small polypeptides involved in replication and pathogenesis of numerous viruses. Full-length and conserved C-terminal delta peptide fragments permeabilize the plasma membranes of nucleated cells of rodent, dog, monkey, and human origin; increase ion permeability across confluent cell monolayers; and permeabilize synthetic lipid bilayers. Permeabilization activity is completely dependent on the disulfide bond between the two conserved cysteines. The conserved C-terminal portion of the peptide is biochemically stable in human serum, and most serum-stable fragments have full activity. Taken together, the evidence strongly suggests that Ebola virus delta peptide is a viroporin and that it may be a novel, targetable aspect of Ebola virus disease pathology.IMPORTANCE During the unparalleled West African outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) that began in late 2013, the lack of effective countermeasures resulted in chains of serial infection and a high mortality rate among infected patients. A better understanding of disease pathology is desperately needed to develop better countermeasures. We show here that the Ebola virus delta peptide, a conserved nonstructural protein produced in large quantities by infected cells, has the characteristics of a viroporin.

The aim of the study was to evaluate perioperative complications and the safety of STB in a tertiary care university hospital setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intra- and postoperative complications were retrospectively recorded and associations based on the evaluation of clinical and laboratory parameters were studied using regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 562 patients were included. Early tracheotomy shortened ventilation time after tracheotomy (ventilation before STB &#8804; 5 days: mean 9.2  9.1 days; ventilation before STB &#8805; 6 days: mean 11.5  10.5 days, p = 0.0001). Overall complications were found in 30/562 cases (5.3%), major complications in 12/562 cases (2.1%). Significant risk factors for overall tracheotomy related complications were higher body mass index (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.07, p = 0.02), lower CRP (OR 0.99, CI 0.99-1.00, p = 0.03), higher INR (OR 5.67, CI 1.27-25.34, p = 0.02), longer duration of operation (OR 1.03, CI 1.00-1.06, p = 0.04) and tracheotomy during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support (OR 6.26, CI 1.21-32.44, p = 0.03).

We surveyed the primary wildlife biologist tasked with wild turkey management for each state and provincial jurisdiction with a huntable wild turkey population to determine turkey hunter and hunting dynamics before and during the spring 2020 turkey season. Biologists in 47 states responded to the survey. Results varied among states but hunting license sales, the number of hunters afield, harvest, total hunter\\\\days afield, and the number of days individual hunters were afield were greater in 2020 than the mean from the previous 3 years (2017C2019) in many states.

Therefore, it is critical to predict the susceptibility of cancer patients for SARS-CoV-2 and evaluate the correlation between disease outcomes and the expression of CTSL in malignant cancer tissues. In the current study, we analyzed CTSL expression, mutation rate, survival and COVID-19 disease outcomes in cancer and normal tissues, using online databases. We also performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) to test CTSL expression and western blot to monitor its regulation by cordycepin (CD), and N6, N6-dimethyladenosine (m(6)(2)A), respectively. We found that CTSL is conserved across different species, and highly expressed in both normal and cancer tissues from human, as compared to ACE2 or other proteinases/proteases. Additionally, the expression of CTSL protein was the highest in the lung tissue. We show that the mRNA expression of CTSL is 66.4-fold higher in normal lungs and 54.8-fold higher in cancer tissues, as compared to ACE2 mRNA expression in the respective tissues. Compared to other proteases/proteinases/convertases such as TMPRSS2 and FURIN, the expression of CTSL was higher in both normal lungs and lung cancer samples. All these data indicate that CTSL might play an important role in COVID-19 pathogenesis in normal and cancer tissues of the lungs. Additionally, the CTSL-002 isoform containing both the inhibitor_I29 and Peptidase_C1 domains was highly prevalent in all cancers, suggesting its potential role in tumor progression and SARS-CoV-2 entry in multiple types of cancers. Further analysis of the expression of CTSL mutant showed a correlation with FURIN and TMPRSS2, suggesting a potential role of CTSL mutations in modulating SARS-CoV-2 entry in cancers. Moreover, high expression of CTSL significantly correlated with a short overall survival (OS) in lung cancer and glioma. Thus, CTSL might play a major role in the susceptibility of lung cancer and glioma patients to SARS-CoV-2 uptake and COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, CD or m(6)(2)A inhibited CTSL expression in the cancer cell lines A549, MDA-MB-231, and/or PC3 in a dose dependent manner. In conclusion, we show that CTSL is highly expressed in normal tissues and increased in most cancers, and CD or m(6)(2)A could inhibit its expression, suggesting the therapeutic potential of targeting CTSL for cancer and COVID-19 treatment.","output":"COVID-19 receptor and malignant cancers: Association of CTSL expression with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Older adults are at greater risk of experiencing negative physical and psychological impacts of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Since DNA methylation has been implicated in the regulation of viral infections and the immune system, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify candidate loci regulated by this epigenetic mark that could be involved in the onset of COVID-19 in patients without comorbidities. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 407 confirmed COVID-19 patients &#8804; 61 years of age and without comorbidities, 194 (47.7%) of whom had mild symptomatology that did not involve hospitalization and 213 (52.3%) had a severe clinical course that required respiratory support. The set of cases was divided into discovery (n = 207) and validation (n = 200) cohorts, balanced for age and sex of individuals. We analysed the DNA methylation status of 850,000 CpG sites in these patients. FINDINGS: The DNA methylation status of 44 CpG sites was associated with the clinical severity of COVID-19. Of these loci, 23 (52.3%) were located in 20 annotated coding genes. These genes, such as the inflammasome component Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) and the Major Histocompatibility Complex, class I C (HLA-C) candidates, were mainly involved in the response of interferon to viral infection. We used the EWAS-identified sites to establish a DNA methylation signature (EPICOVID) that is associated with the severity of the disease. INTERPRETATION: We identified DNA methylation sites as epigenetic susceptibility loci for respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS The research was structured as a retrospective case-control study of subjects found to be driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol and/or other psychoactive substances who were examined for driver's license regranting. Alcohol and/or drug use was assessed by comparing cases examined in the period from May to August 2020 (immediately after the lockdown in Italy) to control subjects examined in the same period in 2019. DUI subjects were examined by an integrated approach, descriptive analyses were conducted, and significance was determined by chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests. Variables linked to the pandemic outbreak and resulting lockdown were investigated as predictive factors in determining unfitness to drive. RESULTS Cases (281) were significantly different from controls (261) concerning the judgment of unfitness to drive (p<.001) and had more subjects with chronic excessive alcohol use and/or illicit substance use. The two groups were rather homogeneous concerning the other variables, except for a difference in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of DUI (p = .027). No statistical association was found between the investigated variables linked to the lockdown and the judgment of unfitness to drive. CONCLUSIONS Chronic excessive alcohol consumption and illicit substance use were more frequently observed in cases, which suggests a possible correlation between the pandemic/lockdown restrictions and an increase in psychoactive substance misuse.

OBJECTIVE We have developed a protocol for a systematic review to evaluate available evidence of the efficacy and safety of drug combinations for chronic pelvic pain. METHODS This systematic review will involve a detailed search of randomized controlled trials investigating drug combinations to treat chronic pelvic pain in adults. The databases searched will include the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE from their inception until the date the searches are run to identify relevant studies. The primary outcome will be pain relief measured using validated scoring tools. Secondary outcomes, where reported, will include the following: adverse events, serious adverse events, sexual function, quality of life, and depression and anxiety. Methodological quality of each included study will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. RESULTS The systematic review defined by this protocol is expected to synthesize available good quality evidence on combination drug therapy in chronic pelvic pain, which may help guide future research and treatment choices for patients and their health care providers.

To answer these questions, we sequenced 260 Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica isolates sampled between 2002 and 2020 from wildlife across Germany, using short-read whole genome sequencing. We found, consistent with previous findings, that some Salmonella sequence types are associated with certain animal species, such as S. Choleraesuis ST145 with wild boar and S.

Depending on the mechanism of action, individual disease-modifying treatments carry different risks. As a result, patients require an individualised approach to initiating and continuing new treatments. This problem became very important during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of drugs with different mechanisms of action on the immune system, the impact of therapy on susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infections and the course of COVID-19 should be considered. Based on the risk/benefit analysis for the patient, individual therapies have been assigned recommendations: 1) low-risk therapies (glatiramer acetate, interferons, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide) - discontinuation of therapy and delay of treatment initiation is not recommended;2) moderate-risk therapies (fingolimod, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, cladribine) - require caution, individual risk/benefit assessment, risk analysis of multiple sclerosis symptom exacerbation after drug discontinuation;3) high-risk therapies (alemtuzumab, mitoxantrone, haematopoietic stem cells transplantation) - treatment initiation is not recommended, administration of subsequent doses requires extreme caution.

Stage 1 allows a quick decentralized readout for early isolation of presymptomatic or asymptomatic patients. It gives results within 1 to 2 hours, using either fluorescence detection or a lateral flow readout, while simultaneously incorporating sample-specific barcodes. The same reaction products from potentially hundreds of thousands of samples can then be pooled and used in a highly multiplexed sequencingCbased assay in stage 2. This second stage confirms the near-patient testing results and facilitates centralized data collection. The 95% limit of detection is <50 copies of viral RNA per reaction.

A significant percentage of infections in children are asymptomatic or mild and can go unnoticed. This study aims to describe the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of children with rheumatic diseases and assess possible risk factors. Methods: : A cross-sectional study was performed in a pediatric rheumatology unit from a reference hospital in Madrid, from September 2020 to February 2021. Serology of SARS-CoV-2 was performed at the same time as their routine laboratory tests, and a specific questionnaire was completed by parents. Demographics, treatment and disease activity from laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were compared to the data of patients without laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Findings: A total of 105 children were included. SARS-CoV-2 infection was demonstrated in 27 patients (25.7%): 6 PCR and 21 positive IgG serology. The mean age was 11.8 years , and the majority of the patients were females (72.4%). Most of the children were diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (70.3%;19/27), followed by PFAPA (11.1%;3/27). Immunosuppresive treatment was given in 88% of cases (24/27). Overall, 44.4% (12/27) of infected patients were asymptomatic. Three patients required hospital admission because of COVID-19, however none of them required oxygen supplementation. A total of 66.7% (18/27) of patients did not require any treatment or medical assistance. The seroprevalence in our cohort was 20% in contrast to the 7.7% population seroprevalence observed during the same study period in Spanish children. SARS-CoV-2 confirmed children with positive IgG or PCR were less frequently in remission (52% vs 72%;p 0.014). Moderate disease activity and treatment with oral corticosteroids were associated with higher risk for COVID-19 (OR 5.05;CI 95%: 1.56 - 16.3 and OR 4.2;CI 95%: 1.26 - 13.9 respectively). Conclusions: In a cohort of pediatric patients with rheumatic disease and immunosuppressive therapy, moderate disease activity and oral corticosteroids were associated with COVID-19 positive patients. Seroprevalence was significantly higher compared to the same age healthy population.

Moreover, all SARS CoV-2 types of vaccines, depending on the spike protein immunogenicity, especially the conventional inactivated ones might increase the likelihood of COVID-19 severity upon re-infection through antibody dependent enhancement which might reason for the recently described abundance of hospital admissions within seven days of vaccination and might also reason for some of the serious adverse effects encountered with administration of convalescent plasma to COVID-19 patients as well as they might share in development of some lethal SARS CoV-2 variants. Importantly, we suggest that SARS CoV-2 mass vaccination campaigns were the worst ever decision made and that making these COVID-19 vaccines compulsory or administering them to children or pregnant participants might be considered as a crime against humanity to the extent that no prior companies- governmental agreements would ever secure impunity.

METHODS 59 critically ill patients with ARDS caused by SARS between March and July 2003 were studied prospectively and followed up for 1 year. Thirty-six underwent pulmonary function testing and a 6-minute walk test, and 35 underwent HRQoL evaluation by Short Form-36 questionnaire at 3, 6, and 12 months after illness onset. RESULTS Mean age was 47 (SD, 15.7) years. Median APACHE II score was 10 (interquartile range [IQR], 7-12). Only 47% required invasive mechanical ventilation. Median admission and worst PaO2/FIO2 ratio were 142 (IQR, 94-177) mmHg and 86 (IQR, 66-122) mmHg, respectively. Median stay in ICU and hospital were 9 (IQR, 5-20) and 31 (IQR, 20-54) days, respectively. Mortality was 24% at hospital discharge and at 1 year. Mean lung volumes and spirometric measurements were nearly normal by 6 months. Except for diffusion capacity adjusted for haemoglobin concentration (DLCO) measured at 12 months, there was no significant difference in pulmonary function measurement between those who had mechanical ventilation and those who did not. The 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) improved from 3 to 6 months, with no further significant change. Younger patients had near normal HRQoL by 6 months. Those aged over 40 years had impaired HRQoL at multiple domains even at 12 months. At 12 months, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, forced vital capacity and 6MWD correlated significantly with multiple SF-36 domain scores. DLCO correlated significantly only with domain scores reflecting physical function. CONCLUSIONS The mortality of SARS-related ARDS is similar to the mortality of ARDS from other causes. A substantial number of patients with SARS-related ARDS survived without receiving mechanical ventilation.

This is the first study that attempts to examine the nexus between the confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, meteorological factors, and the air pollutant namely PM2.5 in six South Asian countries, from 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2020, using the advanced econometric techniques that are robust to heterogeneity across nations. Our findings confirm (1) a strong cross-sectional dependence and significant correlation between COVID-19 cases, deaths, meteorological factors, and air pollutant; (2) long-term relationship between all the meteorological variables, air pollutant, and COVID-19 death cases; (3) temperature, air pressure, and humidity exhibit a significant impact on the COVID-19 confirmed cases, while COVID-19 confirmed cases and air pollutant PM2.5 have a statistically significant impact on the COVID-19 death cases. In this way, the conclusion that high temperature and high humidity increase the transmission of the COVID-19 infections can also be applied to the regions with greater transmission rates, where the minimum temperature is mostly over 21 C and humidity ranges around 80% for months. From the findings, it is evident that majority of the meteorological factors and air pollutant PM2.5 exhibit significant negative and positive effects on the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and death cases in the six countries under study. Air pollutant PM 2.5 provides more particle surface for the virus to stick and get transported longer distances. Hence, higher particulate pollution levels in the air increase COVID-19 transmission in these six South Asian countries.

We analyzed demographic characteristics and assessed depression, anxiety, and stress levels in 241 people using convenience sampling and the DASS-21 questionnaire. All statistical analyses were performed using R. Results The study population included 241 community-dwelling participants, of whom 145 were women and 96 were males. The mean age was 49.16  8.01 years. Approximately two-thirds of participants (n = 158) reported no history of comorbid illness. The mean scores of depression and stress were at a \\"severe\\" level, while anxiety levels were at an \\"extremely severe\\" level. The prevalence of severe and extremely severe depression readings was 51.45 and 38.17%, respectively. In the anxiety subscale, the prevalence of severe and extremely severe depression was 95.90 and 4.1%, and in the stress subscale the prevalence was 48.97 and 4.98%, respectively. Conclusion In this study, people reported experiencing severe and extremely severe psychological distress.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the durability and antiviral activity of a copper film deployed for 90 days in two high touch locations within an active metropolitan bus and railcar. The antiviral efficacy of this copper film after being deployed in transit vehicles for 90 days (deployed copper film) was then compared to new (unused) copper film to determine if frequent touches and cleaning protocols could decrease the efficacy of the copper films. Deployed copper film, new copper film, and aluminum foil (positive control) coupons were inoculated with ~1  106 MS2 virus particles, allowed a contact time of either 5- or 10-minutes, and analyzed for residual viral infectiousness. On both new and deployed copper films, MS2 was completely inactivated ( 5 log reduction) at both time points. These results suggest that the copper film may provide the durability demanded by high touch public spaces while maintaining the antiviral activity necessary to reduce exposure risk and viral transmission via surfaces in public transportation settings.","output":"Inactivation of MS2 bacteriophage on copper film deployed in high touch areas of a public transport system."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Los pacientes con COVID-19 presentan una evolucin muy variable: desde pacientes con sntomas leves de corta duracin a pacientes con enfermedad grave que desarrollan un sndrome de distrs respiratorio agudo, con ingresos prolongados en unidades de crticos.

COVID-19 also presents with multiple ancillary systemic diseases and often involves cardiovascular, inflammatory, and/or neurological complications. Pathological viral genomes consisting of ssvRNA, like cellular messenger RNA (mRNA), are susceptible to attack, destruction, neutralization, and/or modulation by naturally occurring small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) within the host cell, some of which are known as microRNAs (miRNAs). This paper proposes that the actions of the 2650 known human miRNAs and other sncRNAs form the basis for an under-recognized and unappreciated innate-immune regulator of ssvRNA viral genome activities and have implications for the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 invasion, infection, and replication. Recent research indicates that both miRNA and mRNA abundance, speciation, and complexity varies widely amongst human individuals, and this may: (i) In part explain the variability in the innate-immune immunological and pathophysiological response of different human individuals to the initiation and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple tissue types;and (ii) further support our understanding of human biochemical and genetic individuality and the variable resistance of individuals to ssvRNA-mediated viral infection and disease.

Without triage, there is a risk that patients will be admitted to the ICU in the sequence that they present, disadvantaging those who either present later or have poorer access to healthcare. Moreover, if the patients with the best prognosis are not allocated life support, there is the possibility that overall mortality will increase. Before formulating criteria, principles such as maximizing lives saved and fairness ought to have been agreed upon to guide decision-making. The triage process is subdivided into three parts, i.e., having explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria for ICU admission, prioritization of patients for allocation to available beds, and periodic reassessment of all patients already admitted to the ICU. Multi-dimensional criteria offer more holistic prognostication than only using age cutoffs. Appointed triage officers should also be enabled to make data-driven decisions. However, the process does not merely end with an allocation decision being made. Any decision has to be sensitively and transparently communicated to the patient and family. With infection control measures, there are challenges in managing communication and the psychosocial distress of dying alone. Therefore, explicit video call protocols and social services expertise will be necessary to mitigate these challenges. Besides symptom management and psychosocial management, supportive care teams play an integral role in coordination of complex cases.

Also, given the potential protective effects of pausing (temporarily or permanently discontinuing) smoking or vaping, we evaluated its predictors. We hypothesized that generalized anxiety and moving home would increase the odds of pausing. We also explored effects of COVID-related news exposure and seeking on tobacco use. We re-contacted young adults two years after they completed a study on alcohol and marijuana co-use. A subset (N = 83; 26.6% of the 312 respondents) were enrolled in college and reported use of cigarettes (n = 35) and/or e-cigarettes (n = 69) in the week prior to their campus closing (PC). Paired sample t-tests compared smoking and vaping frequency and quantity PC to past-week use since closing (SC). Multivariate logistic regression models were fit to examine predictors of pausing. Both smoking and vaping frequency decreased from PC to SC; however, decreased frequency did not correspond to reduced quantity. Twenty-four participants (28.9%) paused past-week use SC.

We aim to (1) assess the impact of a conversation-based decision aid (Option Grid) containing cost information about slow-growing prostate cancer management options, combined with urologic surgeon training, on the frequency and quality of patient-urologic surgeon cost conversations, and (2) examine the impact of the decision aid and surgeon training on decision quality. METHODS: We will conduct a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial in outpatient urology practices affiliated with a large academic medical center in the USA. We will randomize five urologic surgeons to four intervention sequences and enroll their patients with a first-time diagnosis of slow-growing prostate cancer independently at each period. Primary outcomes include frequency of cost conversations, initiator of cost conversations, and whether or not a referral is made to address costs. These outcomes will be collected by patient report (post-visit survey) and by observation (audio-recorded clinic visits) with consent. Other outcomes include the following: patient-reported decisional conflict post-visit and at 3-month follow-up, decision regret at 3-month follow-up, shared decision-making post-visit, communication post-visit, and financial toxicity post-visit and at 3-month follow-up; clinician-reported attitudes about shared decision-making before and after the study, and feasibility of sustained intervention use. We will use hierarchical regression analysis to assess patient-level outcomes, including urologic surgeon as a random effect to account for clustering of patient participants.

First, by taking symptom classifications and hierarchical treatments of patients into account, a modified SEIR model is established. Then, the proposed differential equations model is solved by using Runge-Kutta methods, and the parameters herein are estimated by least square principle based on the data released by the National Health Commission. Simulation results of the model show that the introduction of symptom classifications in the SEIR model can not only improve the fitting accuracy, but also precisely describe the evolution rules and mutual transfer rules of patients with different symptoms. The model can provide theoretical support for decision-making of the corresponding government departments, especially for the construction of mobile cabin hospitals and the reasonable preparation of important epidemic prevention resources. ? 2021 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.","output":"Epidemic Dynamics Analysis of COVID-19 Using a Modified SEIR Model with Symptom Classifications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article discusses the potential ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic on waste and wastewater services, focusing on critical points where alternative operating procedures or additional mitigation measures may be advisable Key concerns are (i) the long half-life of the virus on materials such as waste containers, bags, and in wastewater, and (ii) possible transmission via contaminated waste surfaces and aerosols from wastewater systems There are opportunities to further the science of wastewater-based epidemiology by monitoring viral RNA in wastewater to assess disease prevalence and spread in defined populations, which may prove beneficial for informing COVID-19 related public health policy","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic: considerations for the waste and wastewater services sector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For a searchable version of these abstracts, please visit www.acrabstracts.org.","output":"ACR Convergence 2020 Abstract Supplement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outbreaks of hemorrhagic syndrome-like disease with high mortality rates have frequently occurred in Pelodiscus sinensis farms.

However, little work has been done to examine neurobiological aspects of forgiveness as they relate to clinical symptoms. In order to better understand the neural mechanisms supporting the protective role of forgiveness in adolescents, the current study examined the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), which comprises the majority of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and is associated with cognitive regulation, and its relationship to forgiveness and clinical symptoms in a sample of healthy adolescents. In this cross-sectional study (n = 64), larger MFG volume was significantly associated with higher self-reported dispositional forgiveness scores and lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Forgiveness mediated the relationship between MFG volume and both depressive and anxiety symptom levels. The mediating role of forgiveness in the relationship between MFG volume and clinical symptoms suggests that one way that cognitive regulation strategies supported by this brain region may improve adolescent mental health is via increasing a capacity for forgiveness. The present study highlights the relevance of forgiveness to neurobiology and their relevance to emotional health in adolescents.

At week 6 after SAON induction, proximal femurs were dissected for micro-computed tomography (CT)-based trabecular architecture with finite element analysis (FEA), CT-based angiography, and histological analysis. Histological evaluation revealed that VEGF enhanced destructive repair, whereas anti-VEGF prevented destructive repair and Src siRNA and Src siRNA+VEGF prevented destructive repair and enhanced reparative osteogenesis. Findings of angiography and histomorphometry were consistent with those determined by DCE MRI.

This study compares control measures instituted on-board two ships with similar outbreaks and recommends a standardized evidence-based outbreak response against them. METHODS: This is a descriptive study, showing comparative analysis of control measures instituted on-board two ships, a cruise ship in case of COVID-19 and a warship in case of H1N1 influenza, with novel viral respiratory disease outbreak, at different span of time. Data of the date of onset, clinical details, laboratory results, history of travel, history of contact with positive case and control measures initiated were collected, analysed and compared.

METHODS From April 4 to July 3, 2020, in a single university hospital in Denmark, all parturient women and their partners were invited to participate in the study, along with their newborns. Participating women and partners had a pharyngeal swab and a blood sample taken at admission; immediately after delivery, a blood sample was drawn from the umbilical cord. The swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction, and the blood samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Full medical history and obstetric and neonatal information were available. RESULTS A total of 1,313 parturient women (72.5.% of all women admitted for delivery at the hospital in the study period), 1,188 partners, and 1,206 newborns participated in the study. The adjusted serologic prevalence was 2.6% in women and 3.5% in partners. Seventeen newborns had SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, and none had immunoglobulin M antibodies. No associations between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and obstetric or neonatal complications were found (eg, preterm birth, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, Apgar score, low birth weight, umbilical arterial pH, need for continuous positive airway pressure, or neonatal admission), but statistical power to detect such differences was low.

Most comments were on destinations in Europe (37%), Africa (21%), Southeast Asia (12%) and the Middle East (11%). Eight personas were identified: middle-class family woman, young woman travelling with partner, female globe-trotter, upper-class active man, single male traveller, retired traveller, young backpacker, and visiting friends and relatives. Purpose of travel was leisure in 82C94% of profiles, except the visiting friends and relatives persona. Malaria and rabies were the most commented diseases with 12.7 k and 6.6 k comments, respectively. The middle-class family woman and the upper-class active man personas were the most active in online conversations regarding endemic disease and vaccine-related topics, representing 40% and 19% of comments, respectively. Vaccination rates were 54%C71% across the traveller personas in the online survey. Reasons for vaccination reluctance included perception of low risk to disease exposure (21%), price (14%), fear of side effects (12%) and number of vaccines (11%). CONCLUSIONS: The information collated on German traveller personas and behaviours toward vaccinations should help guide counselling by healthcare professionals.","output":"Using social media listening and data mining to understand travellers perspectives on travel disease risks and vaccine-related attitudes and behaviours"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A major part of the balance sheets of the largest US banks consists of credit card portfolios. Hence, managing the charge-off rates is a vital task for the profitability of the credit card industry. Different macroeconomic conditions affect individuals' behavior in paying down their debts. In this paper, we propose an expert system for loss forecasting in the credit card industry using macroeconomic indicators. We select the indicators based on a thorough review of the literature and experts' opinions covering all aspects of the economy, consumer, business, and government sectors. The state of the art machine learning models are used to develop the proposed expert system framework. We develop two versions of the forecasting expert system, which utilize different approaches to select between the lags added to each indicator. Among 19 macroeconomic indicators that were used as the input, six were used in the model with optimal lags, and seven indicators were selected by the model using all lags. The features that were selected by each of these models covered all three sectors of the economy. Using the charge-off data for the top 100 US banks ranked by assets from the first quarter of 1985 to the second quarter of 2019, we achieve mean squared error values of 1.15E-03 and 1.04E-03 using the model with optimal lags and the model with all lags, respectively. The proposed expert system gives a holistic view of the economy to the practitioners in the credit card industry and helps them to see the impact of different macroeconomic conditions on their future loss.","output":"Loss Rate Forecasting Framework Based on Macroeconomic Changes: Application to US Credit Card Industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Like other RNA viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replicates in host cells, continuously modulating the molecular environment It encodes 28 multifunctional proteins that induce an imbalance in the metabolic and proteostatic homeostasis in infected cells Recently, proteomic approaches have allowed the evaluation of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cells Here, we discuss the current use of proteomics in three major application areas: (i) virus-protein interactomics, (ii) differential proteotyping to map the virus-induced changes in different cell types, and (iii) diagnostic methods for coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) Since the nasal cavity is one of the entry sites for SARS-CoV-2, we will also discuss the potential application of olfactory proteomics to provide novel insights into the olfactory dysfunction triggered by SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19","output":"Proteomics Insights Into the Molecular Basis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: What We Can Learn From the Human Olfactory Axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Italy was the first European country to implement a national lockdown because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Worldwide, this pandemic had a huge impact on the mental health of people in many countries causing similar reaction in terms of emotions and concerns at the population level. Our study investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being in a cohort of Italian university students. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in the period immediately after the first lockdown through the administration of a questionnaire on the personal websites of students attending their undergraduate courses at the Universit Cattolica del Sacro Cuore. We used the Patient-Health-Engagement-Scale, Self-Rating-Anxiety-Scale, and Self-Rating-Depression-Scale to assess engagement, anxiety symptoms, and depression symptoms of our sample. RESULTS: The sample size was 501 subjects, of which 35.33% were classified as anxious and 72.93% as depressed. Over 90% of respondents had good understanding of the preventive measures despite over 70% suffered from the impossibility of physically seeing friends and partners. Around 55% of students would have been willing to contribute much more to face the pandemic. An increase in the occurrences of anxiety was associated with being female, being student of the Rome campus, suffering from the impossibility of attending university, being distant from colleagues, and being unable of physically seeing one's partner. Performing physical activity reduced this likelihood. CONCLUSIONS: University students are at risk of psychological distress in the case of traumatic events. The evolution of the pandemic is uncertain and may have long-term effects on mental health. Therefore, it is crucial to study the most effective interventions to identify vulnerable subgroups and to plan for acute and long-term psychological services to control and reduce the burden of psychological problems.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being of students in an Italian university: a web-based cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a very heterogeneous disease.

The key might lie in the pathogenesis of the anemia itself. Cancer-related anemia (CRA) is characterized by a decreased circulating serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation despite ample iron stores, pointing to a more complex problem related to iron homeostatic regulation and additional factors such as chronic inflammatory status. This review explores our current understanding of iron homeostasis in cancer, shedding light on the modulatory role of hepcidin in intestinal iron absorption, iron recycling, mobilization from liver deposits, and inducible regulators by infections and inflammation. The underlying relationship between CRA and systemic low-grade inflammation will be discussed, and an integrated multitarget approach based on nutrition and exercise to improve iron utilization by reducing low-grade inflammation, modulating the immune response, and supporting antioxidant mechanisms will also be proposed.

METHODS: Participants completed an anonymous online survey, shared via social media and targeting children and adolescents aged 1-18 years, subdivided into age groups: 1-3, 4-5, 6-12, and 13-18 years. Caregivers completed a modified version of the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC), along with demographic information. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 4314 subjects: 2217 males (50.4%) and 2097 females (49.6%). Age group distribution was: 1-3 years 1263 (29.3%), 4-5 years 893 (20.7%), 6-12 years 1848 (42.8%) and 13-18 years 310 (7.2%). We found a significant delay in bedtime and risetime in all age groups. School-age children and adolescents experienced the most significant delay: weekday bedtime &#8805;23 was reported by 28.4% of 6- to 12-year-old children during lockdown vs. 0.9% before and by 63.5% vs. 12.3% of 13- to 18-year-old adolescents. Risetime was also delayed with most subjects waking up after 8 in all age groups and sleep duration increased in all groups but not in the younger group. The screen time (excluding online lessons) boosted during the lockdown, mainly in older children but also in younger children. Sleep disorders increased in all groups but not in adolescents. Younger groups had an increased prevalence of difficulty falling asleep, anxiety at bedtime, night awakenings, nightmares and sleep terrors.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this evaluation was to provide insights into user experiences and challenges, measure the impact of the course in terms of knowledge gained, and anticipate potential interest in future online vaccination courses. METHODS: The primary source of data was the anonymized information on course participants, enrollment, completion, and scores from the OpenWHO platforms statistical data and metric reporting system. Data from the OpenWHO platform were analyzed from the opening of the courses in mid-December 2020 to mid-April 2021. In addition, a learner feedback survey was sent by email to all course participants to complete within a 3-week period (March 19 to April 9, 2021). The survey was designed to determine the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the training packages and to understand barriers to access. RESULTS: During the study period, 53,593 learners enrolled in the course. Of them, 30,034 (56.0%) completed the course, which is substantially higher than the industry benchmark of 5%-10% for a massive open online course (MOOC). Overall, learners averaged 76.5% on the prequiz compared to 85% on the postquiz, resulting in an increase in average score of 9%. A total of 2019 learners from the course participated in the survey.

This study analysed suspected suicide rates in 2020 relative to 2015C19 to assess any early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Queensland, Australia. METHODS: We analysed data from the interim Queensland Suicide Register (iQSR), a state-wide real-time suicide surveillance system, using an interrupted time-series design. The data source for the iQSR is the Form 1 police report of a death to a coroner. Two QSR staff independently classed the probability of a death by suicide as possible, probable, or beyond reasonable doubt. The analysis included the probable or beyond reasonable doubt categories as suspected suicides. The primary outcome was the monthly suspected suicide rate. We applied Poisson and negative binomial regressions to assess whether Queensland's Public Health Emergency Declaration on Jan 29, 2020, affected suspected suicides from Feb 1 to Aug 31, 2020. Secondary outcomes included absolute or relative changes in police-reported motives of recent unemployment, financial problems, domestic violence, and relationship breakdown. FINDINGS: 3793 suspected suicides were recorded with an unadjusted monthly rate of 1485 deaths per 100 000 people (from Jan 1, 2015, to Jan 31, 2020) before the declaration, and 443 suspected suicides were recorded with an unadjusted monthly rate of 1407 deaths per 100 000 people (Feb 1, 2020, onwards) after the declaration. An interrupted time-series Poisson regression model unadjusted (rate ratio [RR] 094, 95% CI 082C106) and adjusted for overdispersion, seasonality, and pre-exposure trends (RR 102, 95% CI 083C125) indicated no evidence of a change in suspected suicide rates. We found no absolute or relative increases in the motives for suspected suicides, including recent unemployment, financial problems, relationship breakdown, or domestic violence from February to August, 2020, compared with the pre-exposure period. INTERPRETATION: There does not yet appear to be an overall change in the suspected suicide rate in the 7 months since Queensland declared a public health emergency. Despite this, COVID-19 has contributed to some suspected suicides in Queensland. Ongoing community spread and increasing death rates of COVID-19, and its impact on national economies and mental health, reinforces the need for governments to maintain the monitoring and reporting of suicide mortality in real time.

The main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) are attractive drug targets among coronaviruses due to their essential role in processing the polyproteins translated from the viral RNA. In the present work, we virtually screened 688 naphthoquinoidal compounds and derivatives against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. Twenty-four derivatives were selected and evaluated in biochemical assays against Mpro using a novel fluorogenic substrate. In parallel, these compounds were also assayed with SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. Four compounds inhibited Mpro with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values between 0.41 {micro}M and 66 {micro}M. In addition, eight compounds inhibited PLpro with IC50 ranging from 1.7 {micro}M to 46 {micro}M. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest stable binding modes for Mpro inhibitors with frequent interactions with residues in the S1 and S2 pockets of the active site. For two PLpro inhibitors, interactions occur in the S3 and S4 pockets.

For the past 5 years, TRAILS (Transforming Research into Action to Improve the Lives of Students) has been working throughout the state to increase utilization of evidence-based mental health practices among K-12 school mental health professionals (SMHPs). By leveraging SMHPs who are widely accessible to students, TRAILS seeks to improve youth access to effective mental health care and reduce current mental health inequities. In March 2020, TRAILS responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by developing a group manual designed to be delivered virtually by SMHPs to help students develop effective coping skills to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. TRAILS focuses on promoting use of CBT and mindfulness, as these skills are ideally suited for school-based delivery, and thus the new manual, Coping with COVID-19 (CC-19), was grounded in these modalities.

However, due to the organization of societies and disciplines, and the sectoral allocation of resources, the development of transdisciplinary approaches requires effort and perseverance. Therefore, there is a need to provide evidence on the added value of OH for governments, researchers, funding bodies, and stakeholders. This paper outlines a conceptual framework of what OH approaches can encompass and the added values they can provide. The framework was developed during a workshop conducted by the Network for Evaluation of One Health, an Action funded by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology. By systematically describing the various aspects of OH, we provide the basis for measuring and monitoring the integration of disciplines, sectors, and stakeholders in health initiatives. The framework identifies the social, economic, and environmental drivers leading to integrated approaches to health and illustrates how these evoke characteristic OH operations, i.e., thinking, planning, and working, and require supporting infrastructures to allow learning, sharing, and systemic organization. It also describes the OH outcomes (i.e., sustainability, health and welfare, interspecies equity and stewardship, effectiveness, and efficiency), which are not possible to obtain through sectoral approaches alone, and their alignment with aspects of sustainable development based on society, environment, and economy.","output":"A Blueprint to Evaluate One Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite its overwhelming clinical importance, the SARS-CoV-2 gene set remains unresolved, hindering dissection of COVID-19 biology Here, we use comparative genomics to provide a high-confidence protein-coding gene set, characterize protein-level and nucleotide-level evolutionary constraint, and prioritize functional mutations from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic We select 44 complete Sarbecovirus genomes at evolutionary distances ideally-suited for protein-coding and non-coding element identification, create whole-genome alignments, and quantify protein-coding evolutionary signatures and overlapping constraint We find strong protein-coding signatures for all named genes and for 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, and also ORF3c, a novel alternate-frame gene By contrast, ORF10, and overlapping-ORFs 9c, 3b, and 3d lack protein-coding signatures or convincing experimental evidence and are not protein-coding Furthermore, we show no other protein-coding genes remain to be discovered Cross-strain and within-strain evolutionary pressures largely agree at the gene, amino-acid, and nucleotide levels, with some notable exceptions, including fewer-than-expected mutations in nsp3 and Spike subunit S1, and more-than-expected mutations in Nucleocapsid The latter also shows a cluster of amino-acid-changing variants in otherwise-conserved residues in a predicted B-cell epitope, which may indicate positive selection for immune avoidance Several Spike-protein mutations, including D614G, which has been associated with increased transmission, disrupt otherwise-perfectly-conserved amino acids, and could be novel adaptations to human hosts The resulting high-confidence gene set and evolutionary-history annotations provide valuable resources and insights on COVID-19 biology, mutations, and evolution","output":"SARS-CoV-2 gene content and COVID-19 mutation impact by comparing 44 Sarbecovirus genomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore the Diversity Projects Build Back Better report, which considers leadership practice while maintaining the fight for equality through and beyond COVID-19, through the lens of ambidextrous leadership Design/methodology/approachThe authors succinctly present findings from the Build Back Better report that explores an industry response of investment and savings practitioners to managing diversity and inclusion through and beyond COVID-19 Ambidextrous leadership is applied to the discussion to offer greater theoretical discussion and practical consideration for HR leaders and their strategic approaches to the subject at hand FindingsThe Build Back Better report offers numerous recommendations for leadership practice within these unprecedented times An ambidextrous leadership approach can assist in supporting many of the recommendations, as they are complex and potentially paradoxical Originality/valueThe Build Back Better report offers a practitioners immediate response to supporting business leaders shape their strategies as national lockdown periods ease while also ensuring the fight for equality is not lost within the COVID-19 crisis","output":"Maintaining the fight for equality through and beyond COVID-19: a focus on the build back better report and ambidextrous leadership"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Key Takeaways: [1] The $600 bonus benefit has made not working more lucrative than working for 70 percent of the unemployed, making it hard for businesses to get their employees back [2] Extending this weekly benefit would hurt the recovery by reducing employment and output [3] Policymakers should provide targeted unemployment support through a partial federal match and support job flexibility and work opportunities COVID-19 (Disease);Disaster recovery;Unemployment","output":"Tackling COVID-19 Unemployment: Work Opportunities and Targeted Support Beat Windfall Bonuses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Available evidence on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the days after the spring daylight saving time (DST) transition suggests either a modest increase or no risk increase.

STUDY DESIGN We conducted a qualitative study with semi-structured telephone interviews with individuals who completed a medication abortion by mail through the TelAbortion study. We asked participants how they learned about telemedicine abortion, reasons for choosing it, what their alternative would have been, and about their experience. We transcribed, coded, and performed qualitative content analysis of the interviews and are presenting a subset of themes related to access to care when the restrictions on clinic dispensing of mifepristone are removed. RESULTS We interviewed 45 people from January to July 2020. Direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion was more convenient and accessible than in-clinic abortion care when considering the burdens of travel, clinic availability, logistics, and cost that were associated with in-clinic abortion. Stigma led to a prioritization of privacy, and by going to a clinic, participants feared a loss of privacy whereas obtaining a medication abortion by mail made it easier to maintain confidentiality. Faced with these barriers, 13% of participants stated they would have continued their pregnancy if TelAbortion had not been an option. Participants found direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion to be acceptable and recommended it to others. Benefits of telemedicine were amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concerns around infection exposure with in-clinic care. CONCLUSION Going to a clinic was a burden for participants, to the point where some would not have otherwise been able to get an abortion. Medication abortion by mail with telemedicine counseling was a highly acceptable alternative. IMPLICATIONS Medication abortion by mail can increase access to abortion with the added benefits of increased perceived privacy and decreased logistical burdens. Removing the in-person dispensing requirement for mifepristone would allow direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion to be implemented outside of a research setting without compromising the patient experience.","output":"\\"It was close enough, but it wasn't close enough\\": a qualitative exploration of the impact of direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion on access to abortion care."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Identification of healthy people at high risk for severe COVID-19 is a global health priority. We investigated whether blood biomarkers measured by high-throughput metabolomics could be predictive of severe pneumonia and COVID-19 hospitalisation years after the blood sampling. Methods: Nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics was used to quantify a comprehensive biomarker profile in 105,146 plasma samples collected in the UK Biobank during 2007-2010 (age range 39-70). The biomarkers were tested for association with severe pneumonia (2507 cases, defined as diagnosis in hospital or death record occurring during a median of 8.1-year follow-up) and with severe COVID-19 (195 cases, defined as diagnosis in hospital between mid-March to mid-June 2020). A multi-biomarker score was derived for prediction of severe pneumonia based on half of the study population and validated in the other half. We explored how this biomarker score relates to the risk of severe COVID-19. Findings: The biomarker associations with risk of severe COVID-19 followed an overall pattern similar to associations with risk of severe pneumonia (correlation 0.83). The multi-biomarker score, comprised of 25 blood biomarkers including inflammatory proteins, fatty acids, amino acids and advanced lipid measures, was strongly associated with risk of severe pneumonia (odds ratio 1.67 per standard deviation [95% confidence interval 1.59-1.76]; 3.8-fold risk increase for individuals in upper vs lower quintile). The multi-biomarker score was also associated with risk of severe COVID-19 (odds ratio 1.33 [1.17-1.53]; 2.5-fold risk for upper vs lower quintile) and remained significant when adjusting for body mass index, smoking, and existing respiratory and cardiometabolic diseases. Mimicking the decade lag from blood sampling to COVID-19, severe pneumonia events occurring after 7-11 years associated with the multi-biomarker score to a similar magnitude (odds ratio 1.43 [1.29-1.59]; 2.6-fold risk for upper vs lower quintile) as for severe COVID-19. However, the short-term risk of severe pneumonia events associated to the multi-biomarker score at even 3 times higher magnitude (odds ratio 2.21 [1.95-2.50]; 8.0-fold risk for upper vs lower quintile in analysis of the first 2 years after blood sampling). Interpretation: In decade-old blood samples from the UK Biobank, a biomarker score measured by high-throughput metabolomics is indicative of the risk for severe COVID-19. The molecular signature of biomarker changes reflective of risk for severe COVID-19 is similar to that for severe pneumonia, in particular when accounting for the time lag to the COVID-19 pandemic. The even stronger association of the biomarker score with 2-year risk for severe pneumonia lends support to promising screening possibilities for identifying people at high risk for severe COVID-19.","output":"Blood biomarker score identifies individuals at high risk for severe COVID-19 a decade prior to diagnosis: metabolic profiling of 105,000 adults in the UK Biobank"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the world and changed our lifestyle in many aspects.

We sought to identify how the lockdown affected the glycemic control of adult patients with T2DM within a specific region of New York Design & Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from patients with regular outpatient visits within an integrated-delivery health system in South Bronx, New York who had A1C levels measured within 6 months prior to the initiation of lockdown (Mar '20) and a repeat A1C within 3 months after the first phase of reopening in New York (June '20). Analysis of comparison between pre- and post-lockdown HbA1c values was performed using paired samples T-test. Results: A total of 2489 adult patients with an established diagnosis of T2DM and A1C levels available during the study period were identified. 632 patients were excluded due to pregnancy, prediabetes, new-onset diabetes, residency in long-term care facility or hospital admission during the study period. Age range was 18 to 95 years with a mean age of 61. 58% of the patients were female and 41% male.

The toxic effects of 4-NP have been studied in many animal models, but there is still limited knowledge about the dose-dependent damage caused by 4-NP exposure in juvenile Clarias gariepinus. A healthy juvenile C. gariepinus was categorized into four groups (n = 3/group; three replicates in each group). The first group was the control, and the other three groups were subjected to 4-NP concentrations as 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/L for 15 days; they were left for a recovery period of another 15 days. The reproductive hormones of C. gariepinus exposed to 4-NP for 15 days exhibited significant variations between the treatment groups and the control (P < 0.05), which were evident in E2 and T-values, whereas FSH, LH, total protein, and lipid peroxidation values showed non-significant differences among all groups at P < 0.05. Such a situation referred to the fact that the 15-day recovery period was insufficient to remove the impacts of 4-NP doses in concern. The trend of dose-dependent increase/decrease was recorded for T, E2, FSH, and LH. The histopathological alterations of 4-NP treated in gonad tissues were recorded in juvenile C. gariepinus, reflecting their sensitivity to 4-NP estrogenic-like effects. Overall, our results investigate that recovery has improved the reproductive toxicity caused by 4-NP in juvenile C. garepinus. Significant variations between the treated groups and the control group (P < 0.05) were evident in hematological parameters except for hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). The parameters exhibiting significance decreased with such increased doses [red blood cells (RBCs), hematocrit (Hct), and white blood cells (WBCs)]. Similar patterns of significant variations toward the increase or decrease were recorded following the 15-day recovery period.

The primary aims of this study were to examine the relationship of physical therapy visit frequency and duration in the hospital with patients' mobility status at discharge and probability of discharging home. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with COVID-19 admitted to any of eleven hospitals in one health system. The primary outcome was mobility status at discharge, measured using the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care 6-Clicks basic mobility (6-Clicks mobility) and the Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility (JH-HLM) scales. Discharge to home vs. to a facility was a secondary outcome. Associations between these outcomes and physical therapy visit frequency or mean duration were tested using multiple linear or modified Poisson regression. Potential moderation of these relationships by particular patient characteristics was examined using interaction terms in subsequent regression models. RESULTS: For the 312 patients included, increased physical therapy visit frequency was associated with higher 6-Clicks mobility (b = 3.63; 95% CI = 1.54-5.71) and JH-HLM scores (b = 1.15; 95% CI = 0.37-1.93) at hospital discharge and with increased probability of discharging home (adjusted relative risk = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.25-2.63). Longer mean visit duration was also associated with improved mobility at discharge and the probability of discharging home, though the effects were less pronounced. Few moderation effects were observed. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 demonstrated improved mobility at hospital discharge and higher probability of discharging home with increased frequency and longer mean duration of physical therapy visits. These associations were not generally moderated by patient characteristics. IMPACT: Physical therapy should be an integral component of care for patients hospitalized due to COVID-19.

We couple population density to ground-level pollutant concentrations to derive population-weighted exposure metrics that quantify the pollutant levels experienced by the average resident in each country. Our analyses demonstrate that most residents in 171 countries experience pollutant levels exceeding international health guidelines. In addition, we find a negative correlation between temporal trends in ozone and nitrogen oxide concentrations, whichwhen qualitatively interpreted with a simple atmospheric chemistry box modelcan help describe the apparent tradeoff between the mitigation of these two pollutants on local scales.

Despite the limited evidence, the pilot results from included studies support the feasibility and acceptability of telehealth and mobile technologies in cardio-oncology rehabilitation. This new area suggests that telehealth interventions are feasible and induce physiological and psychological benefits for cancer patients and survivors. There is an assumption that telehealth interventions and exercise may be an effective future alternative approach in supportive cancer care.","output":"Cardio-Oncology Rehabilitation and Telehealth: Rationale for Future Integration in Supportive Care of Cancer Survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Secondary infection in COVID-19 has been associated with adverse outcomes and high mortality The prevalence of secondary infection in COVID-19 and optimal antimicrobial strategies remain unclear Methods Retrospective case-note review of patients with COVID-19 admitted to our institution's high dependency unit (HDU) from March to June 2020 Patients were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 or had classical CT appearances and a compatible clinical presentation for COVID-19 Microbiological tests, antimicrobial prescriptions and clinical outcomes were recorded Results 84 patients were identified Median age was 68 5 years and 29/84 (34 5%) were female Respiratory support included HFNO (n=39), CPAP (n=56), non-invasive ventilation (n=3) and invasive ventilation (n=14) Overall mortality was 36/84 (42 9%) 6/84 patients (7 1%) had evidence of secondary infection (&gt;105 CFUs on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL);positive sputum culture or positive blood culture excluding skin contaminants) 28/84 (33 3%) had a respiratory sample sent: BAL n=10;sputum culture n=2;Legionella antigen n=15;throat swab multiplex PCR n=3;Biofire respiratory viral panel n=7 BAL was positive in 3/10 cases (Enterococcus faecium;Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli;Pseudomonas aeruginosa) One sputum culture was positive for M abscessus 71/84 (84 5%) had blood cultures 8 (11 2%) were positive, of which 6 were considered skin contaminants and not deemed true secondary infection (coagulase negative Staphylococci n=5;Lysinibacillus sp n=1;Proteus mirabilis n=1;Staphylococcus epidermidis and Serratia marcescens n=1) All 84 patients received antimicrobials 32 (38 1%) received a macrolide, predominantly azithromycin Macrolide usage was not associated with mortality or admission length, but was associated with increased intubation rate (28 1% vs 9 6%, p=0 027) Initial antibiotic treatment was monotherapy in 45 (53 6%) cases and dual therapy in 39 (46 4%) Initial treatment with two antibiotics versus monotherapy was not associated with mortality but was associated with increased intubation rate (25 6% vs 8 9%, p=0 040) and increased mean admission length (16 5 vs 11 6 days, p= 036) Discussion Robust evidence of secondary infection in patients with COVID-19 was uncommon in our cohort Increased intubation rates in patients prescribed a macrolide and those initially prescribed dual antibiotic therapy is likely to reflect more severe disease There is considerable potential for enhanced antimicrobial stewardship in further waves of COVID-19","output":"Secondary infection rates and antibiotic prescribing in a COVID-19 hdu population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis is key to improve cancer outcomes, and most cancers are diagnosed in primary care after initial symptomatic presentation. Emerging evidence suggests an increase in avoidable cancer deaths owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. AIM: To understand GPs' views on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical assessment of possible cancer. DESIGN & SETTING: GPs were purposively sampled based on age, sex, and years of experience. Interviews were conducted via Zoom or Microsoft Teams in August and September 2020. Transcribed recordings were analysed inductively using thematic analysis. The Model of Pathways to Treatment guided the analysis. METHOD: A qualitative semi-structured interview study with GPs from the East of England. RESULTS: Three themes were identified across 23 interviews on GP views on the impact of: (1) patient help-seeking on symptoms at presentation; (2) remote consultations on managing patients with possible cancer symptoms; and (3) the COVID-19 pandemic on triaging and referring patients with possible cancer. There were positive changes to practice, but concerns were raised about the adequacy of remote consultations for assessing symptoms. Some GPs reported delayed cancer diagnoses, and uncertainty about how to manage backlog in referrals. CONCLUSION: This study provides new evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on assessing symptomatic patients. Recommendations are made to inform safe and effective primary care clinical practice. Urgent action is needed to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and ensure appropriate symptomatic assessment now and in the future.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer assessment in primary care: a qualitative study of GP views"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the SIR epidemic model with infections carried by k particles making independent random walks on a random regular graph.

In the supercritical regime, for a constant C determined by the parameters of the model, Ck get infected with probability C, and O(ln k) get infected with probability (1 ? C). Finally, there is a regime in which all k particles are infected. Furthermore, the edge weights give information about when a particle becomes infected.

The K40/09 strain was selected during successive serial passages in specific-pathogen free (SPF) embryonated eggs at sub-optimal higher temperature (56 C). Unlike the parental strain, the attenuated strain, designated K40/09 HP50, was found to be safe in 1-day-old SPF chicks, which showed neither mortality nor signs of morbidity, and rarely induced ciliostasis or histological changes in the trachea and kidney after intraocular and fine-spray administration. K40/09 HP50 provided almost complete protection against two distinct subgroups of a nephropathogenic strain (KM91-like and QX-like subgroup) and elicited the production of high titers of neutralizing antibody (neutralization index of 3.6). We conclude that the K40/09 HP50 vaccine virus is rapidly attenuated by heat adaptation and exhibits the desired level of attenuation, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy required for a live attenuated vaccine. These results indicate that the K40/09 vaccine could be helpful for the reduction of economic losses caused by recently emergent nephropathogenic IBV infection in many countries.","output":"Successful cross-protective efficacy induced by heat-adapted live attenuated nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus derived from a natural recombinant strain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background: Feelings of isolation, insecurity, and instability triggered by COVID 19 could have a long-term impact on the mental health status of individuals. This study examined the prevalence and factors associated with the mental health symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress during the COVID 19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Methods: From 1st to 30th April 2020, we used a validated self-administered questionnaire to conduct a cross sectional study on 10,609 participants through an online survey platform. We assessed mental health status using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The total depression, anxiety, and stress subscale scores were divided into normal, mild, moderate, severe, and multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associated factors. Results: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 15%, 34%, and 15% for mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 59% for severe anxiety symptoms, 14% for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 14% for mild anxiety symptoms while, the prevalence for stress levels were 16% for severe stress level, 22% for moderate stress level and 13% for mild stress level. Multivariate analyses revealed that the most consistent factors associated with mild, moderate, and severe of the three mental health subscales (depression, anxiety, and stress) were respondents who lived in Dhaka and Rangpur division, females, those who self quarantined in the previous 7 days before the survey and those respondents who experienced chills, breathing difficulty, dizziness, and sore throat. Conclusion: Our results showed that about 64%, 87%, and 61% experienced depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and levels of stress, respectively. In Bangladesh, there is a need for better mental health support for females especially those that lived in Dhaka and Rangpur division and experienced chills, breathing difficulty, dizziness, and sore throat during COVID 19 and other future pandemics.","output":"Prevalence and Factors associated with Mental health impact of COVID-19 Pandemic in Bangladesh: A survey-based cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance first identified during pregnancy Delays in diagnosis and challenges in management can lead to serious adverse outcomes for the mother and child As rates of GDM diagnosis increase worldwide, health systems and maternity services have become increasingly strained, especially with new restrictions around in-person care due to the current COVID-19 pandemic Mobile health (mHealth) has increasingly shown promise for management of chronic disease, driven by smartphone adoption and increased internet connectivity The aim of this work was to evaluate the adoption and multidisciplinary care coordination of an mHealth platform called MheartTHer in a cohort of women with first-time diagnosis of GDM Methods: The mHealth platform for GDM management was developed incorporating a smartphone application, clinician portal, and secure cloud data storage Forty participants with a first-time diagnosis of GDM were recruited to use the app during their pregnancy User attitudes from clinicians and women were captured through post-hoc surveys, and app-usage metrics Results: Clinicians and women indicated satisfaction and ease of use of the mHealth platform, with some technological challenges around wireless connectivity Blood glucose reviews and antenatal contact were higher with use of the MheartTHer app compared with a matched historical sample Conclusion: The MheartTHer mHealth platform is a new comprehensive tool for health care of women with GDM, and may provide an effective new avenue to enhance multidisciplinary care in the face of COVID-19 disruptions and challenges to traditional care pathways","output":"MheartTHer, an mHealth System to Support Women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: Feasibility and Acceptability Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CASE: A 65-year-old man experienced backache, and 9 days later, he developed cellulitis in his left foot.

In addition, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China have the potential to provide evidence to support other metropolitan areas and large cities outside China with their emerging cases. We used data reported from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020, to fit a model of infection, estimate the likely number of infections in four high-risk metropolitan areas based on the number of cases reported, and increase the understanding of the COVID-19 spread pattern. Considering the effect of the official quarantine regulations and travel restrictions for China, which began January 23~24, 2020, we used the daily travel intensity index from the Baidu Maps app to roughly simulate the level of restrictions and estimate the proportion of the quarantined population. A group of SEIR model statistical parameters were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and fitting on the basis of reported data. As a result, we estimated that the basic reproductive number, R0, was 2.91 in Beijing, 2.78 in Shanghai, 2.02 in Guangzhou, and 1.75 in Shenzhen based on the data from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020. In addition, we inferred the prediction results and compared the results of different levels of parameters. For example, in Beijing, the predicted peak number of cases was 467 with a peak time of March 01, 2020; however, if the city were to implement different levels (strict, moderate, or weak) of travel restrictions or regulation measures, the estimation results showed that the transmission dynamics would change and that the peak number of cases would differ by between 54% and 209%. We concluded that public health interventions would reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19 and that more rigorous control and prevention measures would effectively contain its further spread, and awareness of prevention should be enhanced when businesses and social activities return to normal before the end of the epidemic. Further, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China offer the potential to provide evidence supporting other metropolitan areas and big cities with their emerging cases outside China.","output":"Evaluation of the Secondary Transmission Pattern and Epidemic Prediction of COVID-19 in the Four Metropolitan Areas of China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of ordinary COVID-19 when admitted, to describe how these patients were treated and risk factors for in-hospital progression.

METHODS: A retrospective, mixed-methods analysis of a Family Liaison Team (FLT) formed by redeployed clinicians during the first surge of the 2020 COVID 19 pandemic. RESULTS: The FLT was constituted predominantly of non-ICU consultants (30/39, 77%). Following two 1-hourly webinars around basic communication skills, the FLT facilitated over 12,000 video and telephone calls with 172 patients family and friends (PFF). The majority of the PFF interviewed were mostly, very or extremely satisfied by the frequency, ease, understanding, honesty, completeness and consistency of the information provided. Approximately 5% of the interviewees, reported to be slightly or very dissatisfied in one or more of the following 3 categories: frequency, consistency and ease of getting the information. The thematic analysis identified 3 themes: 1) being there/ for the patient; 2) breakdown in communication; 3) disbelief at the speed of deterioration. In 14.9% of cases there was documented discrepancy between the information transmitted by the CC team and that by the FLT, particularly around the severity of the patient's illness and their imminent death. CONCLUSIONS: The formation of a dedicated FLT was feasible and associated with increased levels of satisfaction by the PFF.

The aim of this study was to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19 using epidemiological contact tracing data, and to explore whether there were different incubation periods among different age gr1oups. METHODS: We collected contact tracing data in a municipality in Hubei province during the full outbreak period of COVID-19. The exposure periods were inferred from the history of travel in Wuhan and/or history of exposure to confirmed cases. The incubation periods were estimated using parametric accelerated failure time models accounting for interval censoring of exposures. RESULTS: The incubation period of COVID-19 follows a Weibull distribution and has a median of 5.8 days with a bootstrap 95% CI: 5.4C6.7 days. Of the symptomatic cases, 95% showed symptoms by 14.3 days (95% CI: 13.0C15.7), and 99% showed symptoms by 18.7 days (95% CI: 16.7C20.9). The incubation periods were not found significantly different between male and female. Elderly cases had significant longer incubation periods than young age cases (HR 1.49 with 95% CI: 1.09C2.05).

Asymmetries in angle and speed when changing direction off the operated and nonoperated limbs after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction may therefore influence the interpretation of interlimb differences in joint-level biomechanical parameters. The authors hypothesized that athletes would reduce center-of-mass heading angle deflection and body rotation during the change-of-direction stance phase when cutting from the operated limb, and would compensate for this by orienting their center-of-mass trajectory more toward the new intended direction of travel prior to touchdown. A total of 144 male athletes 8 to 10 months after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction performed a maximum-effort sidestep cutting maneuver while kinematic, kinetic, and ground reaction force data were recorded. Peak ground reaction force and knee joint moments were lower when cutting from the operated limb.

Between-limb differences in body orientation and horizontal velocity at touchdown were also observed.

The approaches are: (1) Sequential approach C comparing pre-lockdown and lockdown periods 2020;(2) Parallel approach C comparing 2019 and 2020 for the equivalent time of the lockdown period;and (3) Machine learning modelling approach C predicting pollution levels for the lockdown period using business as usual (BAU) scenario and comparing with the observations. The parallel and machine learning approaches resulted in relative higher reductions and both showed strong correlation (0.97) and less error with each other. The sequential approach showed less reduction in NO and NOx, showed positive gain in PM10 and NO2 at most of the sites and demonstrated weak correlation with the other two approaches, and is not recommended for such analysis. Overall, the sequential approach showed ?14, +4, ?32, and + 56% change, the parallel approach showed ?46, ?43, ?43 and + 7% change, and the machine learning approach showed ?47, ?44, ?38 and + 5% change in NOx, NO2, NO and PM10 concentrations, respectively. The pollution roses demonstrated that the UK received easterly polluted winds from the central and eastern Europe, promoting secondary particulates and O3 formation during the lockdown. Changes in pollutant concentrations vary both in space and time according to the approach used, environment type of the monitoring site and the data type (e.g., deweathered vs. raw data).

The main objective was to analyze the reasons for not cancelling surgeries and the postoperative course of operated patients. The secondary objective was to assess the situation of postponed patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single-center observational study carried out during the COVID-19 period in France included 124 patients scheduled for surgery during the period March 21-May 20, 2020. The number and nature of operations, both performed and postponed, were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 54.0% patients were operated on during the COVID period and 46.0% were postponed. Operations were maintained in urgent or semi-urgent cases. The operated patients did not show any signs of infection during their hospital stay. A total of 29.8% of postponed patients were lost to follow-up and 49.1% were rescheduled. CONCLUSION: The application of national and international recommendations minimized the risk of loss of chance for operated patients without increasing the risk of contamination. The postponement of canceled operations resulted in considerable loss to follow-up. Intensified follow-up is necessary for these patients.","output":"Surgery under COVID: An observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the prevalence of signs of severity identified in the Thai population with malaria could aid clinical management and disease control efforts, decrease mortality, and promote malaria elimination in Thailand. This systematic review aimed to collate the evidence regarding signs of severity identified in the Thai population with malaria. MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for potentially relevant studies. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. The pooled prevalence of signs of severity among patients with severe malaria and the pooled proportion of each sign of severity among all signs of severity were estimated using random-effects models. Heterogeneity among included studies was assessed using Cochrans Q test. A subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate whether differences in pooled estimates between different study sites. Publication bias was assessed by visualizing funnel plot asymmetry and using Eggers test. Among 741 studies identified by literature searching, 12 studies of a total of 2900 patients with severe malaria, in 7 Thai hospitals, met the eligibility criteria. Results of meta-analyses showed that the signs of the severity of malaria with the highest prevalence in Thailand were jaundice (54%), hyperparasitemia (47%), impaired consciousness/coma (21%), acidosis (18%), renal impairment (13%), shock (10%), convulsions (9%), severe anemia (8%), pulmonary edema/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (8%), hypoglycemia (4%), and bleeding/disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (2%). The signs of the severity of malaria that made up the highest proportion of all signs of severity identified in the Thai population with malaria were hyperparasitemia (33%), jaundice (33%), impaired consciousness/coma (12%), acidosis (9%), renal impairment (7%), severe anemia (6%), convulsions (5%), shock (5%), pulmonary edema/ARDS (3%), bleeding/DIC (1%), and hypoglycemia (1%). The present study revealed the prevalence of signs of severity identified in the Thai population with malaria.

Galectin-3 was implicated in innate immunological response to infections and in chronic fibrosis. The aim of our preliminary study was the assessment of the diagnostic utility of serum galectin-3 in patients with COVID-19. The prospective observational study included adult patients admitted with active COVID-19 and treated in tertiary hospital between June and July 2020. The diagnosis was confirmed by the quantitative detection of nucleic acid of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in nasopharyngeal swabs. Galectin-3 was measured by enzyme immunoassay in serum samples obtained during the first five days of hospital stay. We included 70 patients aged 25 to 73 years; 90% had at least one comorbidity. During the hospital stay, 32.9% were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and 12.9% required treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU). Serum galectin-3 was significantly increased in patients who developed pneumonia, particularly those who required ICU admission. Positive correlations were found between galectin-3 and inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, ferritin, pentraxin-3), a marker of endothelial injury (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1), and a range of tissue injury markers. Serum galectin-3 enabled the diagnosis of pneumonia with moderate diagnostic accuracy and the need for ICU treatment with high diagnostic accuracy.

In parallel, the widespread application of social isolation initiatives in most countries raises the potential for significant mental health consequences and psychosocial impacts. This has major implications for cardiovascular health care professionals and the management of their patients. CHALLENGES: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated physical isolation practices are likely to result in a range of mental health and psychosocial challenges. In addition to an increasing incidence of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and post-traumatic stress, the pandemic may also witness an increase in substance abuse, domestic violence and relationship discord. The consequences of these complications will be further magnified, when considering their potential effect on cardiovascular disease and its management.

The data collection process was completed in 32 days between March 20 and April 20, 2020. Smart-PLS software was used for data analysis. Findings - According to the study results, the level of concern tourists have about the COVID-19 outbreak directly affected their intention to travel and indirectly affected their intention to visit destinations. Research limitations/implications - According to the results of the study, people's anxiety levels about COVID-19 will negatively affect their travel behavior after the pandemic. Such results suggest that when potential travelers' pandemic-induced anxiety levels increase, their travel intention after the pandemic will decrease. In addition, there is a positive relationship between people's intention to travel and post-COVID-19 touristic visit intentions. Therefore, as people's travel intentions increase, so do their destination visit intentions. Another important theoretical implication of this research is that people's pandemic-induced anxiety levels have been shown to negatively affect their destination visit intention through the mediating variable of travel intention. Practical implications - A multidimensional and stakeholder engagement process needs to be followed to decrease the influences of the pandemic on destinations. Destination management organizations (DMOs) can take an active role in crisis periods to encourage stakeholder participation while attracting tourism demand in the post-COVID-19 era.

In the present study, 1,042 natural products from commercially available sources were chosen to establish a screening library, and docking-based high-throughput screening was performed to discover potential METTL3 inhibitors. The selected compounds were then further validated by an in vitro methyltransferase inhibition assay in which m(6)A content was determined by LC-MS/MS. A cellular assay of the inhibition of m(6)A methylation was performed to determine the METTL3 inhibitory activity of the selected compound. CCK-8 assay was applied to evaluate the effects of the selected compound on tumor cell viability. Additionally, binding mode analysis, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and binding free energy analysis were performed to study the process and characteristics of inhibitor binding. Finally, quercetin was identified as a METTL3 inhibitor with an IC(50) value of 2.73 M. The cellular assay of m(6)A methylation inhibition showed that quercetin decreased m(6)A level in a dose-dependent manner in MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells.

Public health surveillance is one of the cornerstones of public health practice, and it empowers decision makers to lead and manage public health crises and programs more effectively by providing timely and useful evidence. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for a study that aims to identify, track, and monitor trends in the population in Saudi Arabia at risk of major depressive disorders and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study utilizes continuous, cross-sectional, national-level mental health screening via computer-assisted phone interviews, conducted in four waves on a monthly basis (between May and August 2020). Arabic-speaking adults, aged 18 years, and living in Saudi Arabia were recruited via a random phone list. This surveillance system used the proportional quota sampling technique to achieve an equal distribution of participants, stratified by age and gender, and region, within and across the 13 administrative regions of Saudi Arabia. A sample size of 4056 participants per wave was calculated to achieve enough power to detect changes in mental health status. The questionnaire includes the Arabic version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to measure depressive symptoms and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to measure anxiety. In addition, it will collect data on sociodemographic variables and potential risk factors. RESULTS: Study recruitment began in May 2020. The data analysis was completed in October 2020, and the final report is expected to be published by the end of December 2020.

The metabolic balance of certain hormones and electrolytes is necessary for proper cardiac function. In children, various biochemical conditions may cause calcium depletion during heart surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of calcium gluconate administration during cardiopulmonary bypass on hemodynamic variables and clinical outcomes in infants undergoing open-heart surgery. This study was conducted at Rajaie Cardiovascular Medical and Research Center in 2021 using a controlled randomized clinical trial. A total of 60 patients with open-heart surgery weighing up to 10 kg were included in the study. The first group received an intravenous injection of calcium gluconate 20 min after opening the aortic clamp, and the second group was monitored as a control group. Data collection tools included checklists containing demographics, surgical information, and intensive care unit measures. RESULTS: The Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test showed that the frequency distribution of gender, blood group, Rhesus factor (RH), and clinical diagnosis in the two groups of intervention and control was not statistically significant (p < 0.05).

For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, many countries have implemented two non-pharmaceutical interventions: suppression like immediate lockdowns in cities at epicentre of outbreak; or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both interventions have apparent pros and cons; the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is limited. We aimed to conduct a feasibility study for robustly estimating the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, peaks and lengths of COVID-19 breakouts by taking multiple pharmaceutical interventions in London and the UK, accounting for reduction of healthcare demand. Methods: We developed a model to attempt to infer the impact of mitigation, suppression and multiple rolling interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and the UK. Our model assumed that each intervention has equivalent effect on the reproduction number R across countries and over time; where its intensity was presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals; early immediate intensive intervention led to increased health need and social anxiety. We considered two important features: direct link between Exposed and Recovered population, and practical healthcare demand by separation of infections into mild and critical cases. Our model was fitted and calibrated with data on cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei to estimate how suppression intervention impacted on the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths over time during January 2020, and April 2020. We combined the calibrated model with data on the cases of COVID-19 in London, the UK (non-London) and the UK during February 2020 and March 2020 to estimate the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, and healthcare demand by using multiple interventions. Findings: We estimated given that multiple interventions with an intensity range from 3 to 15, one optimal strategy was to take suppression with intensity 3 in London from 23rd March for 100 days, and 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in non-London regions. In this scenario, the total infections and deaths in the UK were limited to 2.43 million and 33.8 thousand; the peak time of healthcare demand was due to the 65th day (April 11th), where it needs hospital beds for 25.3 thousand severe and critical cases. If we took a simultaneous 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in all regions of the UK, the total infections and deaths increased slightly to 2.69 million and 37 thousand; the peak time of healthcare kept the same at the 65th day, where it needs equivalent hospital beds for severe and critical cases of 25.3 thousand. But if we released high band of rolling intervention intensity to 6 or 8 and simultaneously implemented them in all regions of the UK, the COVID-19 outbreak would not end in 1 year and distribute a multi-modal mode, where the total infections and deaths in the UK possibly reached to 16.2 million and 257 thousand.","output":"Feasibility of Controlling COVID-19 Outbreaks in the UK by Rolling Interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Thyroid autoimmunity has been reported to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination recently. We report a series of patients who presented with new onset or relapse of Graves disease related hyperthyroidism shortly after receiving the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine at a single tertiary institution in Singapore. METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe 12 patients who developed hyperthyroidism within a relatively short interval (median onset of 17 (range: 5 - 63) days) after receiving the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The majority were females (11/12) with median age of 35.5 (range: 22-74) years. Six patients had new onset hyperthyroidism, while the other six had relapse of previously well-controlled Graves disease. TSH Receptor antibody concentrations ranged from 2.4-32 IU/L. Majority of the patients were able to go for the second dose of the vaccine without any further exacerbations. Literature review revealed 21 other similar cases reported from across the world. CONCLUSION: Our case series provide insight into the characteristics of individuals in whom Graves disease was triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Clinicians need to be vigilant of precipitation or exacerbation of autoimmune thyroid disorders in predisposed individuals after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Further epidemiological and mechanistic studies are required to elucidate the possible associations between the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the development of thyroid autoimmunity.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccination and Graves Disease: a report of 12 cases and review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Declaration de liens d'interets: Les auteurs declarent ne pas avoir de liens d'interets Copyright ? 2020","output":"Reevaluation a distance de la symptomatologie des patients atteints de forme legere a moderee de COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microbial activity can enhance the sequestration of phosphorus (P) in sediments, but little is known about the mechanisms behind it. In this study, sediment cores were sampled from the most eutrophic Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu, and three treatments were set up in a laboratory incubation experiment, involving (a) the non-treated sediment cores, (b) inoculation, and (c) sterilization. The dissolved and labile iron (Fe) and P were obtained by high-resolution dialysis and the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique, respectively. AgI-based DGT was used for measuring the 2D distribution of labile sulfide. The bacterial community was investigated using a scanning electron microscope and 16S rRNA high throughput sequencing technique. The results showed that sterilization reduced the capacity of sediment to immobilize P, and that the critical sediment depth layer for microbial P sequestration was 0-10 mm. In addition, sterilization or inoculation significantly changes the structure of bacterial communities. Fe or S oxidation under micro-aerobic or anaerobic conditions played an important role in bacterial retention of P in the sediments. Nitrate-reducing coupling Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria (Acidovorax) in the inoculated sediment and electrogenic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (Candidatus Electronema) in the non-treated sediment were identified as the key bacterial genera responsible for the retention of P in sediments. This implies that bacterial communities could quickly establish the ability for negative feedback regulation by inoculation once the function and structure of indigenous sediment bacteria are seriously impaired, although this needs further validation in the field.","output":"Enhancing the retention of phosphorus through bacterial oxidation of iron or sulfide in the eutrophic sediments of Lake Taihu"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the vector of healthcare development is aimed at minimizing contacts among citizens, which is especially important for cancer patients, given the immunosuppression caused by cytostatics. The objective of the review is to present the development prospects of hospital-substituting technologies for drug antitumor treatment. Two main components are considered that allow effective and safe infusion of anticancer drugs in a day hospital: central venous access devices and infusion pumps, various types of these devices, their safety and experience of use today are described.

The covid-19 cases are, however, not evenly distributed across the countries; a few countries, particularly high-income countries have been hit harder than the countries of weak economic condition. The reasons for such an asymmetrical distribution are not clearly understood yet. In the present work, we have examined the unevenness of global distribution of Covid-19 incidences till 18th June 2021 in terms of the economic condition of countries. Subsequently, we have tried to identify the main underlying factors behind unequal Covid-19 cases. Our analysis suggests that the degree of Isolation, the diffusion of coronavirus (interconnectivity), and the percentage of elderly people in the population are the main causes of the different unequal spread of Covid-19 cases in different countries.

We adhered to the methodology for trustworthy clinical practice guidelines and followed a strict conflict of interest policy. We convened panelists through teleconferences and web-based discussions. Guideline experts from the guidelines in intensive care, development, and evaluation Group provided methodological support. Two content experts provided input and shared their expertise with the panel but did not participate in drafting the final recommendations. We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to assess the certainty of evidence and grade recommendations and suggestions. We used the evidence to decision framework to generate recommendations. The panel provided input on guideline implementation and monitoring, and suggested future research priorities. The overall certainty in the evidence was low. The ICM-RPG panel issued one recommendation and two suggestions regarding the use of NMBAs in adults with ARDS.

To date, the impact of NLRX1 on PRRSV infection remains unclear. In this study, we found that PRRSV infection promoted the expression of NLRX1 gene. In turn, ectopic expression of NLRX1 inhibited PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells, whereas knockdown of NLRX1 enhanced PRRSV propagation in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Mechanistically, NLRX1 was revealed to impair intracellular viral subgenomic RNAs accumulation. Finally, Mutagenic analyses indicated that the LRR (leucine-rich repeats) domain of NLRX1 interacted with PRRSV Nonstructural Protein 9 (Nsp9) RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase) domain and was necessary for antiviral activity.

In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the demographic characteristics and clinical findings of mild and moderate COVID-19 and to determine the risk factors for the development of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients admitted to the pandemic outpatient clinic of a university hospital. A total of 414 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were included. Of these, 220 (53.1%) were male, the mean age was 38.3  12.7. Median duration of hospital admission from the onset of symptoms was three days (0-11). Of the confirmed COVID-19 cases, 154 (37.2%) had a history of family contact and the most common symptoms were weakness (68.4%), myalgia (61.8%), headache (56.5%), loss of smell (45.2%), loss of taste (43.2%) and anorexia (42.8%). Among females, weakness (p= 0.016), headache (p= 0.008), sore throat (p= 0.032), nausea (p= 0.003), anorexia (p= 0.045), loss of taste (p= 0.005) and loss of smell (p<0.001) were more common. Loss of taste (47.6% vs. 25%, p<0.001) and loss of smell (50% vs. 26.3%, p<0.001) were more common in patients with under the age of 50 and cough (43.4% vs. 29.3%, p= 0.003) was more common in patients with above the age of 40. Among 46 (11.1%) patients with asymptomatic COVID-19, there was no significant difference (p= 0.500) between the genders.

One of the major consequences has been the development of proximity tourism in outdoor spaces less conducive to the spread of the virus. From a study preceding this pandemic, this article seeks to better understand the experiences lived by domestic tourists when they visited protected natural parks in their country. Beyond the health risks, it analyses the dimensions and the influences of experiences lived in these parks by French domestic tourists (n = 500) using Pine and Gilmore's 4Es model (1999). From a literature on the tourism experiences for domestic tourists adapted to natural parks and a critical review on the use and validation of Oh et al.'s scale (2007) in tourism, a structural equation model and a nested SEM show the positive relationship between three dimensions of the 4Es on the arousal and memory outcomes. Theoretically and methodologically speaking, this study extends the 4Es model in the direction of low arousal and mundane experiences for domestic tourists in protected natural parks, and questions Oh, Fiore, and Jeoung (2007) scale through the number of items, the use of EFA and the removal of the aesthetics dimension.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) with functional activity against coronavirus could be a considerable solution, yet there is no research for identifying anti-coronavirus (anti-CoV) peptides with the computational approach. In this study, we first investigated the physiochemical and compositional properties of the collected anti-CoV peptides by comparing against three other negative sets: antivirus peptides without anti-CoV function (antivirus), regular AMP without antivirus functions (non-AVP) and peptides without antimicrobial functions (non-AMP). Then, we established classifiers for identifying anti-CoV peptides between different negative sets based on random forest. Imbalanced learning strategies were adopted due to the severe class-imbalance within the datasets. The geometric mean of the sensitivity and specificity (GMean) under the identification from antivirus, non-AVP and non-AMP reaches 83.07%, 85.51% and 98.82%, respectively. Then, to pursue identifying anti-CoV peptides from broad-spectrum peptides, we designed a double-stages classifier based on the collected datasets. In the first stage, the classifier characterizes AMPs from regular peptides. It achieves an area under the receiver operating curve (AUCROC) value of 97.31%. The second stage is to identify the anti-CoV peptides between the combined negatives of other AMPs. Here, the GMean of evaluation on the independent test set is 79.42%.

This prospective longitudinal study investigated the factors that predict psychological resilience in adults undergoing genetic testing for HCRC. METHODS -: A longitudinal study was carried out from April 2003 to August 2006 on Hong Kong Chinese HCRC family members who were recruited and offered genetic testing by the Hereditary Gastrointestinal Cancer Registry to determine psychological outcomes after genetic testing. Self-completed questionnaires were administered immediately before (pre-disclosure baseline) and 2 weeks, 4 months and 1 year after result disclosure. Using validated psychological inventories, the cognitive style of hope was measured at baseline, and the psychological distress of depression and anxiety was measured at all time points. RESULTS -: Of the 76 participating subjects, 71 individuals (43 men and 28 women; mean age 38.9  9.2 years) from nine FAP and 24 HNPCC families completed the study, including 39 mutated gene carriers. Four patterns of outcome trajectories were created using established norms for the specified outcome measures of depression and anxiety. These included chronic dysfunction (13% and 8.7%), recovery (0% and 4.3%), delayed dysfunction (13% and 15.9%) and resilience (76.8% and 66.7%). Two logistic regression analyses were conducted using hope at baseline to predict resilience, with depression and anxiety employed as outcome indicators. Because of the small number of participants, the chronic dysfunction and delayed dysfunction groups were combined into a non-resilient group for comparison with the resilient group in all subsequent analysis. Because of low frequencies, participants exhibiting a recovery trajectory (n = 3 for anxiety and n = 0 for depression) were excluded from further analysis. Both regression equations were significant. Baseline hope was a significant predictor of a resilience outcome trajectory for depression (B = -0.24, p < 0.01 for depression); and anxiety (B = -0.11, p = 0.05 for anxiety).

It is now clear that the COVID-19 associated death and disease burden in minority and low socioeconomic communities is disproportionate to their numbers in the general population. In addition to the disproportionate acute impact of the COVID-19 on vulnerable communities, the long-term impact may be lost ground with respect to cancer prevention due to disruption, distrust and misinformation. Little is known about how the pandemic has impacted young adults and whether this has influenced behaviors that are key to cancer prevention. Methods: In May, 2021, we conducted a Qualtrics survey assessing all aspects of COVID-19 impact, with extensive SDOH measures, including everyday racism and medical mistrust, cancer prevention and screening, access to health care, and intentions regarding future vaccination uptake, adherence to COVID-19 preventive practices, lifestyle behaviors associated with cancer prevention, and cancer screening. Participants (n=232) are 18-25 year olds with a permanent address in Connecticut. We used social networks and social media to recruit participants. Analysis includes descriptive and multivariate adjusted logistic regression findings predicting maintenance of healthy lifestyle (primary cancer prevention) and cancer screening and associations with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Results: In this sample of young adults, the average age was 21.2 (range 18-25), with 52% reporting their race/ethnicity as Hispanic/Latinx (33%) or African American/Black (19%);53.3% were female, 46.2% were male, and .4% reported other. Descriptive data demonstrate high levels of SDOH and the impact of COVID-19 on many aspects of life for this study population. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was relatively low at 12.2%, with 57% of GENZ participants reporting that they had already vaccinated. We present predictors of healthy lifestyle behaviors and intention to adhere to cancer screening guidelines going forward and the relationship to history of and intent to vaccinate against COVID-19. Conclusion: The unique challenges of young adults during COVID-19 are not well documented. Findings will inform community level interventions in the event of continued COVID-19 (or similar) public health challenges, while identifying opportunities to advance cancer prevention long-term for these young adults.","output":"COVID-19 and social determinants of health (SDOH): Impact on cancer prevention in GENZ population (Ages 18-25)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Expansion microscopy enables conventional diffraction limit microscopy to achieve super-resolution imaging.

Research on the active site of the molecule has led to development of effective inhibitors like oseltamivir, zanamivir etc, but the high rate of mutation and interspecies reassortment in viral sequences and the recent reports of oseltamivir resistant strains underlines the importance of determining additional target sites for developing future antiviral compounds. In a recent computational study of 173 H5N1 NA gene sequences we had identified a 50-base highly conserved region in 3'-terminal end of the NA gene. RESULTS: We extend the graphical and numerical analyses to a larger number of H5N1 NA sequences (514) and H1N1 swine flu sequences (425) accessed from GenBank. We use a 2D graphical representation model for the gene sequences and a Graphical Sliding Window Method (GSWM) for protein sequences scanning the sequences as a block of 16 amino acids at a time. Using a protein sequence descriptor defined in our model, the protein sliding scan method allowed us to compare the different strains for block level variability, which showed significant statistical correlation to average solvent accessibility of the residue blocks; single amino acid position variability results in no correlation, indicating the impact of stretch variability in chemical environment. Close to the C-terminal end the GSWM showed less descriptor-variability with increased average solvent accessibility (ASA) that is also supported by conserved predicted secondary structure of 3' terminal RNA and visual evidence from 3D crystallographic structure. CONCLUSION: The identified terminal segment, strongly conserved in both RNA and protein sequences, is especially significant as it is surface exposed and structural chemistry reveals the probable role of this stretch in tetrameric stabilization. It could also participate in other biological processes associated with conserved surface residues. A RNA double hairpin secondary structure found in this segment in a majority of the H5N1 strains also supports this observation. In this paper we propose this conserved region as a probable site for designing inhibitors for broad-spectrum pandemic control of flu viruses with similar NA structure.","output":"Computational analysis and determination of a highly conserved surface exposed segment in H5N1 avian flu and H1N1 swine flu neuraminidase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recognition of viral glycans by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in innate immunity contributes to antiviral immune responses.

The ability of CLRs to elicit and shape adaptive immunity plays a critical role in the inhibition of viral spread within the host. However, certain viruses exploit CLRs for viral entry into host cells to avoid immune recognition.

The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data were analyzed between the two surgeries, regarding perioperative bleeding, the total number of dissected mediastinal lymph nodes, operative time, number of lymph nodes in the left para-recurrent laryngeal nerve (para-RLN) or the right para-RLN, time in the intensive care unit (ICU), postoperative pain score, the length of postoperative stay (LOPS), PO2/fraction of inspired oxygen (PO2/FiO2), pulmonary infection, and lymphatic metastasis. Results: The operations were successfully performed in all 80 patients. The results showed that patients who underwent transcervical and transhiatal esophagectomy had shorter operations than those with transthoracic esophagectomy (200 minutes vs 235 minutes, Kruskal-Wallis test [Z] = -3.700, P < 0.001). The number of dissected mediastinal lymph nodes in the left para-RLN in the observation group was higher than in the control group (25.0% vs 2.5%, Z = 2.568, P = 0.010).

The most common manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (coronavirus disease 2019 - COVID-19) is viral pneumonia with varying degrees of respiratory compromise and up to 40% of hospitalized patients might develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. Several clinical trials evaluated the role of corticosteroids in non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome with conflicting results. We designed a trial to evaluate the effectiveness of early intravenous dexamethasone administration on the number of days alive and free of mechanical ventilation within 28 days after randomization in adult patients with moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to confirmed or probable COVID-19. METHODS: This is a pragmatic, prospective, randomized, stratified, multicenter, open-label, controlled trial including 350 patients with early-onset (less than 48 hours before randomization) moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, defined by the Berlin criteria, due to COVID-19. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated to either standard treatment plus dexamethasone (Intervention Group) or standard treatment without dexamethasone (Control Group). Patients in the intervention group will receive dexamethasone 20mg intravenous once daily for 5 days, followed by dexamethasone 10mg IV once daily for additional 5 days or until intensive care unit discharge, whichever occurs first. The primary outcome is ventilator-free days within 28 days after randomization, defined as days alive and free from invasive mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality rates at day 28, evaluation of the clinical status at day 15 assessed with a 6-level ordinal scale, mechanical ventilation duration from randomization to day 28, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score evaluation at 48 hours, 72 hours and 7 days and intensive care unit -free days within 28.","output":"COVID-19-associated ARDS treated with DEXamethasone (CoDEX): study design and rationale for a randomized trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chinese caregivers' intentions to allow their children to be vaccinated against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unknown.

We assessed intention rates and correlates of caregivers' intentions to vaccinate children against COVID-19, using descriptive analyses and a multiple logistic regression analysis, respectively. In the study sample, about 84.0% of caregivers intended to get their children vaccinated for COVID-19 if the vaccine was available. In particular, 92.2% of caregivers who were willing to be vaccinated themselves for COVID-19 intended to have their children vaccinated, yet among caregivers who were unwilling (or uncertain) whether to be vaccinated, only 41.1% intended to have their children vaccinated. Older age, lower education level, and perceived safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine were associated with increased odds of caregivers intending to have their children vaccinated. Of the six provinces included in the study, residence in a province other than Hubei increased the likelihood that caregivers would choose not to have their children vaccinated. We found a relatively high vaccination rate (84.0%) among caregivers by using a cross-sectional sample in China.

One of these is concern regarding the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors. Dysfunction of the RAS has been observed in COVID-19 patients, but whether RAS inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs), are associated with improved or worse clinical outcomes, remains unclear. RAS inhibitors are currently widely used in the treatment of hypertension. Emerging data suggest an increased association and a heightened mortality in patients of COVID-19 with co-morbidities such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes mellitus, particularly in the elderly. Therefore, several recently published research papers have focused on the management of hypertension during the COVID-19 pandemic, as this co-morbidity was found to be the most common in patients with coronavirus infections. SARS-CoV-2 viral surface protein is known to attach angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) on the cell membrane to facilitate viral entry into the cytoplasm. While the SARS-CoV-2 viral load remains the highest in upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients, it has also been reported in multiple sites in COVID-19, and patients not infrequently require the Intensive Care Units (ICU) admission. However, despite the theoretical concerns of possible increased ACE2 expression by RAS blockade, there is no evidence that RAS inhibitors are harmful during COVID-19 infection, and indeed they have been shown to be beneficial in some animal studies. In this review we summarise the pathophysiology of the interaction between RAS, ACEIs/ARBs inhibitors and COVID-19, and conclude, on the basis of current data, that RAS blockade should be maintained during the current coronavirus pandemic.","output":"Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in management of hypertension during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper reviews the progress and effectiveness of Programs to Control Vehicle Emissions (PCVEs), comparing the experiences in the United States (US), European Union (EU), China, and Brazil.

METHODS: The extent of PAS involvement in the eyes of patients with angle closure was assessed by indentation gonioscopy, and the part of non-PAS and PAS were assigned into two groups (NPAS and PAS). Anterior chamber angles were then imaged by AS-OCT with light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation directly into the pupils, leading to pupillary constriction and increasing anterior chamber angle width. Parameters including the angle opening distance at 750 m anterior to the scleral spur (AOD750) and trabecular-iris space area at 750 m anterior to the scleral spur (TISA750) were then obtained. The differences before and after LED irradiation of AOD750 and TISA750 were calculated and used to generate a PAS model based on binary logistic regression. Validation data were then tested. RESULTS: A total of 258 AS-OCT images in 14 eyes were assigned to the modeling data, and 120 were assigned to the validation data. There were no differences in AOD750 and TISA750 in the dark between NPAS and PAS (PAOD750 = 0.258, PTISA750 = 0.486), whereas after LED light exposure, TISA750light was larger in NPAS than in PAS (P = 0.047). The light-dark differences of both parameters showed significant differences between the two groups (PAOD750dif = 0.019, PTISA750dif < 0.001).

With the emerging global coronavirus disease (CoVID19) pandemic due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, early reports suggested that smell and taste dysfunction were clinical features of CoVID19. Our study aimed to investigate the prevalence of smell and taste disturbances in a cohort of CoVID19 positive patients who were isolated at home and being medically managed through telephone consultation. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted at St. James's Hospital Dublin, an urban 850 bed tertiary referral centre. 46 out of 50 CoVID19 positive patients, managed through a telephone clinic from the hospital infectious disease department, were assessed for olfactory and gustatory function loss. Results: The median age of participants was 36.5 years (interquartile range (IQR) 27 - 48) and 19 (41%) were male. The majority (31; 67%) never smoked and 17 (37%) reported co-morbidities. Approximately half of patients reported some degree of smell (22; 48%) or taste (25; 54%) function loss. 13 patients (28%) reported a complete loss of sense of smell, 8 (17%) reported a complete loss of sense of taste and 7 (15%) reported simultaneous total loss of both. The median age of patients with any degree of smell disturbance was significantly lower than patients without (median 30.5 years (IQR 24 C 43.25) versus 41 years (IQR 28.25 C 52.75), p = 0.025).

All current healthcare reforms favour the reinforcement of primary care. More information on enhancing the role of GPs in mental health would benefit policymakers, especially as regards SMD patients, where little research has been published as yet. This article assesses variables associated with GPs taking on SMD patients. METHODS The study, encompassing multiple sites, is based on a sample of 398 GPs, representative of the GP population in the Canadian province of Quebec. GPs were asked to answer a 143-item questionnaire on their socio-demographic and clinical practice profiles, patient characteristics, perceived inter-professional relationships and quality of care. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS Our data highlighted that GPs currently followed up only a minority of SMD patients on a continuous basis and far fewer for both physical and mental health problems. A linear regression model that accounts for 43% of the variance was generated. The best variables associated positively with GPs taking on SMD patients were: frequency of referrals for joint follow-up with other resources, and involvement in post-hospitalization follow-up. Conversely, lack of expertise in mental health (related in our model to frequency of mental disorder patient transfer due to insufficient mental health training) is associated with a lower incidence of GPs taking on patients. CONCLUSION As advocated in current healthcare reforms, our study confirms the need to promote greater GP involvement in integrated care models and enhance their training in mental health--thereby helping to reverse the trend among GPs of transferring SMD patients to specialized care. Patients with stable SMDs ought to have the same care access as the general population.","output":"Variables associated with general practitioners taking on serious mental disorder patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To describe the experience with CytoSorb treatment in patients with refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Many researchers carried out clinical epidemiological studies on patients with COVID-19 previously, but risk factors for patients with different levels of severity are still unclear. METHODS: 562 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 12 hospitals in China were included in this retrospective study. Related clinical information, therapies, and imaging data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between patients with severe and non-severe status. We explored the risk factors associated with different severity of COVID-19 patients by logistic regression methods. RESULTS: Based on the guideline we cited, 509 patients were classified as non-severe and 53 were severe. The age range of whom was 5C87 years, with a median age of 47 (IQR 35.0C57.0). And the elderly patients (older than 60 years old) in non-severe group were more likely to suffer from fever and asthma, accompanied by higher level of D-dimer, red blood cell distribution width and low-density lipoprotein. Furthermore, we found that the liver and kidney function of male patients was worse than that of female patients in both severe and non-severe groups with different age levels, while the severe females had faster ESR and lower inflammatory markers. Of major laboratory markers in non-severe cases, baseline albumin and the lymphocyte percentage were higher, while the white blood cell and the neutrophil count were lower. In addition, severe patients were more likely to be accompanied by an increase in cystatin C, mean hemoglobin level and a decrease in oxygen saturation. Besides that, advanced age and indicators such as count of white blood cell, glucose were proved to be the most common risk factors preventing COVID-19 patients from aggravating. CONCLUSION: The potential risk factors found in our study have shown great significance to prevent COVID-19 patients from aggravating and turning to critical cases during treatment. Meanwhile, focusing on gender and age factors in groups with different severity of COVID-19, and paying more attention to specific clinical symptoms and characteristics, could improve efficacy of personalized intervention to treat COVID-19 effectively.","output":"Clinical features and risk factors for severe inpatients with COVID-19: A retrospective study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The interferon pathway, a key antiviral defense mechanism, is being considered as a therapeutic target in COVID\\\\19.

These studies suggest that grants today go beyond the domain of traditional social policies and government bureaucracy and point to a new future in view of the scarcity of work. This future has become even closer with the pandemic of COVID-19, and with governments, non-governmental entities and the political left reaffirming the importance of a basic universal income. Considering these discussions, my article focuses on an income transfer program in South Africa after the Apartheid period, placing an ethnographic account in relation to the design of a progressive policy of social grants. I present a longer history of salaried work in relation to rural African households and show how the emancipatory promises of cash transfer projects were read as a risk to local traditions and morals. In addition to this reduction in political hopes invested in transfers, I examine the temporal aspect of cash transfers, as well as the possible futures they evoke. By considering the futures that grants enable, I conclude by suggesting that it is premature to affirm that they have overcome wage work and its attendant sociality. ? 2021, UNIV SAOPAULO.

A feature representation algorithm is proposed in this paper to identify the pathogenicity phenotype of influenza B virus. METHODS: The dataset included all 11 influenza virus proteins encoded in eight genome segments of 1724 strains. Two types of features were hierarchically used to build the prediction model. Amino acid features were directly delivered from 67 feature descriptors and input into the random forest classifier to output informative features about the class label and probabilistic prediction. The sequential forward search strategy was used to optimize the informative features. The final features for each strain had low dimensions and included knowledge from different perspectives, which were used to build the machine learning model for pathogenicity identification. RESULTS: The 40 signature positions were achieved by entropy screening. Mutations at position 135 of the hemagglutinin protein had the highest entropy value (1.06). After the informative features were directly generated from the 67 random forest models, the dimensions for class and probabilistic features were optimized as 4 and 3, respectively. The optimal class features had a maximum accuracy of 94.2% and a maximum Matthews correlation coefficient of 88.4%, while the optimal probabilistic features had a maximum accuracy of 94.1% and a maximum Matthews correlation coefficient of 88.2%. The optimized features outperformed the original informative features and amino acid features from individual descriptors. The sequential forward search strategy had better performance than the classical ensemble method. CONCLUSIONS: The optimized informative features had the best performance and were used to build a predictive model so as to identify the phenotype of influenza B virus with high pathogenicity and provide early risk warning for disease control.

Information on biodata, preoperative visual acuity, surgical methods, complications, and postoperative visual acuity were retrieved. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0. Results: Traumatic cataract accounted for 87 (14.7%) of 593 eyes operated for childhood cataract during the period. Of these, a total of 79 records were available for review. There were 56 (70.9%) males with a mean age of 10.11 (3.39) years. All injuries were unilateral; closed globe injuries accounted for 70 (88.8%) of the cataracts and the left eye was affected in 42 (53.2%) patients. Fifty-two (67.09%) eyes had other ocular injuries apart from cataracts. The morphology of the cataract was membranous in 44 (55.7%) eyes, and 76 (96.2%) eyes had cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation; 39 (51.3%) of these IOLs were implanted within the capsular bag.

AREAS COVERED: Two main strategies for developing metal-based drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 are herein illustrated. Firstly, a few clinically approved metallodrugs could be evaluated in patients according to a 'drug repurposing' approach. To this respect, the gold drug auranofin seems a promising candidate, but some other clinically established metal compounds are worthy of a careful evaluation as well. On the other hand, libraries of inorganic compounds, featuring a large chemical diversity, should be screened to identify the most effective molecules. This second strategy might be assisted by a pathway-driven discovery approach arising from a preliminary knowledge of the mode of action, exploitable to inhibit the functional activities of the key viral proteins. Also, attention must be paid to selectivity and toxicity issues. EXPERT OPINION: The medicinal inorganic chemistry community may offer a valuable contribution against COVID-19. The screening of metallodrugs' libraries can expand the explored 'chemical space' and increase the chance of finding effective anti-COVID agents.","output":"Metallo therapeutics for COVID-19.

Moreover, surgical safety is a critical topic that deserves to be addressed thoroughly during medical education, as part of the broader topic of patient safety. To maximize students engagement and to enhance their interest in patient safety and healthcare quality, it is imperative to explore and innovate stirring and interactive methods of learning. Through this paper, we present a unique narrative novel story-based, peer-led surgical safety teaching session organized by medical student representatives of Middle East's first student-led patient safety initiative and attended by medical students from various academic years. Methods A 1-hour case-based interactive learning session on surgical safety was developed, based on the World Health Organization (WHO) patient safety curriculum for medical schools. The session was peer-led at Alfaisal University College of Medicine, Riyadh and participation was voluntary. Learning objectives included surgical safety checklist, human factors, complexity of healthcare, students critical role in safety and open disclosure. The session included a verbal story-telling segment, followed by a didactic segment where learning objectives were covered. Attendees were continuously engaged throughout the session with the help of verbal inquiries. Pre-test and post-test questionnaires were distributed to assess participants' knowledge, awareness and perceptions regarding surgical safety and other objectives covered in the session. Results A total of 75 students participated in the session, consisting of 57.3% females and 42.7% males. Responses to the pre-test and post-test were analyzed and compared. Most students who attended the session reported that it was of value to them - with more than 90% of students considering the session either valuable or highly valuable. After the session, more students (10.67%, p = 0.10) were correctly able to identify that the initial reaction in healthcare is often individual blame (Q.1). Additionally, more students (30.63%, p < 0.001) were able to correctly identify the implementation of the WHO surgical safety checklist as the major factor that has contributed to the reduction of errors in healthcare (Q.2). Students responses also indicated that after attending the session a higher number (16%, p = 0.01) correctly identified that most errors linked to surgery were potentially preventable (Q.3). Conclusion Students are inherently willing to learn and engage in interactive learning. It was encouraging to see medical students show interest in this important patient safety topic, which also encourages similar future peer-learning initiatives. As reported, narrative story-based peer-assisted learning is an effective way to engage medical students in the cause of patient safety and should be utilized to further their knowledge and awareness regarding critical healthcare safety areas such as surgical safety, medication safety and infection control and instill a sense of responsibility in these future physicians.","output":"Peer-Led Surgical Safety Learning Among Medical Students Using a Novel Story-Based Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two important changes are happening in health care in the US. As hospitals close in high numbers, the geographies of health care services are changing. Also, the ageing of the population brings about new and complex care needs.

Developed out of research on the impacts of hospital restructuring on workers, patients, and communities, this paper aims to understand how health care financing, care needs for the ageing, and new geographies of health services are intertwined. To do so, I look back to 1980s policy changes to Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. In 1982, Congress made two important changes to Medicare. The program began covering hospice services, constituting an expansion of care, and the government drastically changed the way it reimburses providers, effectively a contraction of the program. I trace the impacts of these changes over the next decades through analysis of media coverage and secondary research on hospital budgets. Drawing on the concept of palliative space-time, I identify a contradictory logic of death at the center of this expansion and contraction of the health care system. This death logic works to destabilize an already uneven geography of health service.

There was an alarming level of public fear during the disease outbreak due toan information crisis, resulted by the government's holdback of vital information and the widespread MERS rumours on social media. By paying attention to news coverage patterns of rumours and comparing them across the outbreak period, the paper examines the following research questions: (a) Under what media frames were the MERS rumours reported by the online news? (b) Which media frame did the online news use most frequently? (c) How did the media frames change during and after the information vacuum?. Methods: Content analysis of news articles that covered MERS rumours during the outbreak has been conducted. Inductive open coding has been performed to investigate what reactions and media frames the news coverages have demonstrated to report the rumour propagation. Sample: The article samples were retrieved for big data analysis from the Big Kinds or the Korea Integrated News Database System (www.bigkinds.or.kr), by using the search terms, MERS and SNS (Social Network Services). A total of 142 articles have been sampled. Results: The paper found 7 reaction variables and categorized them into 2 risk-reporting media frames: risk-alarming frame(Anxiety, Criticisms and Damage) and risk-mitigating frame (Government, Correction, Remedies and Causes). The paper discovered that anxiety was the most frequently observed reaction variable across all phases. The paper also concluded that there has been a decrease in risk-alarming media frames and an increase in attempts to analyze causes for the rumour propagation (Causes), as the outbreak proceeds to the second phase, when the information vacuum finally ended.

However, the majority of TIL do not recognize tumour antigens(2), and little is known about transcriptional programs of MANA-specific TIL. Here, we identify MANA-specific T cell clones using the MANA functional expansion of specific T cells assay(3) in neoadjuvant anti-PD-1-treated non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). We use their T cell receptors as a barcode to track and analyse their transcriptional programs in the tumour microenvironment using coupled single-cell RNA sequencing and T cell receptor sequencing. We find both MANA- and virus-specific clones in TIL, regardless of response, and MANA-, influenza- and EpsteinCBarr virus-specific TIL each have unique transcriptional programs. Despite exposure to cognate antigen, MANA-specific TIL express an incompletely activated cytolytic program. MANA-specific CD8 T cells have hallmark transcriptional programs of tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells, but low levels of interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) and are functionally less responsive to interleukin-7 (IL-7) compared with influenza-specific TRM cells. Compared with those from responding tumours, MANA-specific clones from non-responding tumours express T cell receptors with markedly lower ligand-dependent signalling, are largely confined to HOBIT(high) TRM subsets, and coordinately upregulate checkpoints, killer inhibitory receptors and inhibitors of T cell activation.

This study aimed to estimate the monthly SFTS occurrence and the monthly number of SFTS cases in the geographical area in Korea using epidemiological data including demographic, geographic, and meteorological factors. Important features were chosen through univariate feature selection. Two models using machine learning methods were analyzed: the classification model in machine learning (CMML) and regression model in machine learning (RMML). We developed a novel model incorporating the CMML results into RMML, defined as modified-RMML. Feature importance was computed to assess the contribution of estimating the number of SFTS cases using modified-RMML. Aspect to the accuracy of the novel model, the performance of modified-RMML was improved by reducing the MSE for the test data as 12.6C52.2%, compared to the RMML using five machine learning methods. During the period of increasing the SFTS cases from May to October, the modified-RMML could give more accurate estimation. Computing the feature importance, it is clearly observed that climate factors such as average maximum temperature, precipitation as well as mountain visitors, and the estimation of SFTS occurrence obtained from CMML had high Gini importance. The novel model incorporating CMML and RMML models improves the accuracy of the estimation of SFTS cases. Using the model, climate factors, including temperature, relative humidity, and mountain visitors play important roles in transmitting SFTS in Korea. Our findings highlighted that the guidelines for mountain visitors to prevent SFTS transmissions should be addressed.

Many clinical trials over the last 20 years have used measurements of carotid artery stenosis as a means to risk stratify patients. However, with improvements in vascular imaging techniques such as CT angiography and MR angiography, ultrasonography, and PET/CT, it is now possible to risk stratify patients, not just on the degree of carotid artery stenosis but also on how vulnerable the plaque is to rupture, resulting in ischemic stroke. These imaging techniques are ushering in an emerging paradigm shift that allows for risk stratifications based on the presence of imaging features such as intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), plaque ulceration, plaque neovascularity, fibrous cap thickness, and presence of a lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC). It is important for the neurosurgeon to be aware of these new imaging techniques that allow for improved patient risk stratification and outcomes. For example, a patient with a low-grade stenosis but an ulcerated plaque may benefit more from a revascularization procedure than a patient with a stable 70% asymptomatic stenosis with a thick fibrous cap. This review summarizes the current state-of-the-art advances in carotid plaque imaging. Currently, MRI is the gold standard in carotid plaque imaging, with its high resolution and high sensitivity for identifying IPH, ulceration, LRNC, and inflammation. However, MRI is limited due to time constraints. CT also allows for high-resolution imaging and can accurately detect ulceration and calcification, but cannot reliably differentiate LRNC from IPH. PET/CT is an effective technique to identify active inflammation within the plaque, but it does not allow for assessment of anatomy, ulceration, IPH, or LRNC. Ultrasonography, with the aid of contrast enhancement, is a cost-effective technique to assess plaque morphology and characteristics, but it is limited in sensitivity and specificity for detecting LRNC, plaque hemorrhage, and ulceration compared with MRI. Also summarized is how these advanced imaging techniques are being used in clinical practice to risk stratify patients with low- and high-grade carotid artery stenosis. For example, identification of IPH on MRI in patients with low-grade carotid artery stenosis is a risk factor for failure of medical therapy, and studies have shown that such patients may fair better with carotid endarterectomy (CEA). MR plaque imaging has also been found to be useful in identifying revascularization candidates who would be better candidates for CEA than carotid artery stenting (CAS), as high intraplaque signal on time of flight imaging is associated with vulnerable plaque and increased rates of adverse events in patients undergoing CAS but not CEA.","output":"Contemporary carotid imaging: from degree of stenosis to plaque vulnerability."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vaccines against COVID-19 play a prominent role in the policies enacted to combat the pandemic. However, vaccination rates are lowest among adolescents and young adults. Therefore, research on younger individuals is needed to provide a deeper understanding of social disparities and the motives behind vaccination intentions. METHODS: This study draws on a sample (N = 4079) of German high school students and graduates. Based on cross-sectional data from March to July 2021 and linear regression models, which are conditioned on personality, risk preferences, and trust, the study analyses social disparities (i.e., gender, parental education and migration background) in vaccination intentions. RESULTS: We do not find heterogeneity by gender. Individuals with low-educated parents and a migration background indicate below-average levels of vaccination intention. Differences in solidarity beliefs entirely explain the heterogeneity between individuals with low-educated parents and those with high-educated parents. While differences in beliefs explain a substantial part of the heterogeneity in vaccination intentions, cultural and monetary resources also constitute an important source of difference in vaccination intentions between individuals with and without a migration background. These results are important because our data indicate higher infection risks among individuals with a migration and low education background. Additionally, individuals from lower social origins and with migration backgrounds report higher levels of perceived burdens associated with COVID-19-related policies. The migration results differ between first- and second-generation migrants and by region of origin. CONCLUSION: Polarization in solidarity explains social gradients in vaccination intention. A solidarity narrative may not motivate a significant share of young individuals to be vaccinated.","output":"The social gradient in COVID-19 vaccination intentions and the role of solidarity beliefs among adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2018, the University of Toronto (UT) Libraries opened its first family study space, which was very well received.1 In the years since the family study space opened, there has been a growth in research about student parents and how academic libraries can best serve them.2 In response to an increased awareness about the student parent population and their needs, the libraries piloted programming for student parents during the 2019-20 academic year, including free childminding sessions.

Since the inhibition of 9/10 nAChR by -conotoxin RgIA and its analogs is a possible way to drugs against neuropathic pain, here in a mice model we compared R8 with -conotoxin RgIA in the effects on the chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), namely on the long-term oxaliplatin induced neuropathy. Tests of cold allodynia, hot plate, Von Frey and grip strength analysis revealed for R8 and -conotoxin RgIA similar positive effects, expressed most prominently after two weeks of administration. Histological analysis of the dorsal root ganglia sections showed for R8 and RgIA a similar partial correction of changes in the nuclear morphology of neurons. Since 9/10 nAChR might be not the only drug target for R8, we analyzed the R8 action on rat TRPV1 and TRPA1, well-known nociceptive receptors. Against rTRPV1 at 25 M there was no inhibition, while for rTRPA1 IC50 was about 20 M. Thus, involvement of rTRPA1 cannot be excluded, but in view of the R8 much higher affinity for 9/10 nAChR the latter seems to be the main target and the easily synthesized R8 can be considered as a potential candidate for a drug design.","output":"-Conotoxin RgIA and oligoarginine R8 in the mice model alleviate long-term oxaliplatin induced neuropathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prolonged shedding of viral RNA occurs in some individuals following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Hospital non-compliance in managing hazardous waste can have a negative impact on the environment and public health, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the amount of hazardous waste produced by healthcare facilities is increasing. To protect the environment and public health from the negative impact of hazardous medical waste, this study was conducted to determine the level of compliance of hazardous waste management in hospitals in Indonesia before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, from 2019 to 2020. Study design: Cross-sectional. Methods: This study was conducted at 343 hospitals in Indonesia using secondary data obtained from Sikelim (Medical Waste Management Information System), which is owned and operated by the Ministry of Health. The data have been analyzed using chi-square tests and logistic regressions of the determinant model. Results: There was an increase in the level of compliance of hazardous waste management in hospitals from 82% to 86% during the pandemic. Furthermore, the availability of environmental documents and environmental health units were determinant factors of hazardous waste management compliance by hospitals before the pandemic in 2019. The only factor in 2020 was the availability of environmental health units. Conclusions: Despite the good level of compliance, additional efforts are needed to increase the activities of the treatment of hazardous medical waste by hospitals, as before the pandemic (i.e., in a normal situation) only 8% of hospitals was able to independently manage hazardous medical waste using authorized incinerators, a percentage that was reduced to 6% during the pandemic.","output":"A Comparative Analysis of Hazardous Medical Waste Management Compliance Before (2019) and During (2020) the COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: ADG20 is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody engineered to have high potency and broad neutralization against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other SARS-like CoVs with pandemic potential by binding to a highly conserved epitope in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. The Fc region of ADG20 has been modified to provide an extended half-life. ADG20 is in clinical development for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. METHODS: This is an ongoing Phase 1, randomized, placebo (PBO)-controlled, single ascending-dose study of ADG20 administered intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV) to healthy adults aged 18C50 years with no evidence of prior or current SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants were randomized 8:2 in 3 cohorts (N=10/cohort: n=8 ADG20, n=2 PBO): ADG20 300 mg IM, 500 mg IV, and 600 mg IM. Safety, tolerability, PK, and sVNA titers were assessed up to 3 months post dose. Serum ADG20 concentrations were measured with a validated hybrid ligand binding liquid chromatographyCmass spectrometry (MS)/MS assay. sVNA titers against authentic SARS-CoV-2 were determined by a plaque reduction neutralization assay. RESULTS: Overall, 30 participants received ADG20 (n=24) or PBO (n=6). Blinded safety data for all cohorts and PK/sVNA titer data for the 300 mg IM cohort are reported. Through a minimum of 10 weeks post dose, no study drug-related adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, injection site reactions, or hypersensitivity reactions were reported. The observed preliminary PK profile was dose proportional, consistent with an extended half-life monoclonal antibody, and well predicted by translational physiologically-based PK modeling. The measured 50% sVNA titer (MN50; geometric mean [coefficient of variation, %]) was 1382 (32.7%) 13 days after a single 300 mg IM dose. These values are within the range of peak serum neutralizing antibody titers reported for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. CONCLUSION: A single dose of ADG20, up to 600 mg IM, was well tolerated. Preliminary PK and sVNA titer profiles support the ongoing Phase 2/3 trials of ADG20 at a 300 mg IM dose for the prevention of COVID-19 (EVADE: NCT04859517) and treatment of ambulatory patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 (STAMP: NCT04805671).

Up to now, ENPT has usually been performed with open-pore polyurethane foam drains (OPD). A big disadvantage of the OPDs is their large diameter. We have developed a new, small-bore open-pore film drainage (OFD). Herein we report our first experience in a case series of 16 patients. Patients and methods OFD is constructed with a drainage tube and a very thin double-layered open-pore drainage film (Suprasorb CNP, Drainage Film, Lohmann & Rauscher International, Germany). The distal end of the tube is wrapped with only one layer of film. OFD is placed into the gastrointestinal leakage site with common endoscopic techniques. The tube is connected to an electronic vacuum device and continuous negative pressure of -125 mmHg applied. Results From 2013 to 2016, 16 patients were treated with the new OFD device. In 10 patients, transmural intestinal defects (4 esophageal, 4 rectum/colon, 1 duodenal, 1 pancreatic cyst) were closed with ENPT in median time of 12 days (range 3 - 34 days). Five of the 10 patients were treated solely with OFD devices. In five patients ENPT started with ODP and changed to OFD when the cavity was shrunken to a channel with a small opening. In four patients postoperative gastric reflux was eliminated for 5 to 16 days. Conclusions Small-bore OFD opens up promising new treatment options within ENPT. OFD can be used in endoscopic closure management of intestinal leakages in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Gastric reflux can be eliminated in an active manner. OFD can be inserted nasally. OFD may be an adequate substitute for OPD, especially when placement of the larger OPD is difficult.","output":"Open-pore film drainage (OFD): a new multipurpose tool for endoscopic negative pressure therapy (ENPT)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The author analyzes the aftermath of Edward Hooper's suggestion that the trial of an oral polio vaccine (OPV) in the Belgian colonies of Africa engendered the pandemic form of the AIDS virus, HIV-1. In response to Hooper's book, The River (1999), the Royal Society in London held a conference to debate the origins of HIV. Examination of the quick dismissal of the OPV theory opens a space for legitimately challenging the widely held belief that the vaccine contamination question was convincingly resolved. This article interrogates the relationship between historiography and the making of scientific facts and history, suggesting that historians have been too credulous of scientists' testimony. The further result of the lack of a thorough analysis of the evidence backing the OPV hypothesis has resulted in a missed opportunity to read The River as one of the few detailed accounts of the immense social, political, technological, and interspecies infrastructure constituted by Cold War vaccine production. This biomedical infrastructure dramatically changed the geographic and interspecies mobility of viruses in ways that may be impossible to reconstruct. Yet these potential transmission routes remain crucial to acknowledge.

Methods: Briefly, models were trained using a dataset of 816 COVID-19 positive and 920 negative cases collected at the emergency departments of IRCCS Hospital San Raffaele and IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi. 21 parameters, including the results of the CBC analysis, age [60.9 (0.9) years], gender (57% males) and the presence of COVID-19 related symptoms were used. The validation regarded the evaluation of the error rate (through different metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the area under the curve (AUC)) of the models considered. This external validation was conducted on two well balanced datasets coming from two different hospitals in Northern Italy: Desio hospital and Bergamo Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital. 163 positive and 174 true negative patients from Desio, and 104 positive and 145 true negative from Bergamo were included in the validation.

The disease has taken a form of pandemic and is now present in all countries across the globe with nearly 5.4 million infections and 344,000 fatalities till date. In late March, the Indian government initiated a lockdown, which confined nearly 1.3 billion people, around one-sixth of humanity to home, in an effort to decrease the community transmission of COVID-19 disease and flatten the curve so that Indian health care is able to deal with a manageable number of cases. This lockdown, which started on March 25, 2020, has now been extended to May 17, 2020, a duration of 54 days, with further planned extension to May 31. During this lockdown, the authors noted an increase in the number of mixer grinder injuries and a change in the demography of suicidal attempts due to frustration resulting in injuries to upper limb. The authors have studied this phenomenon and compared the data with cases from previous year. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The case records of all patients coming to the emergency department and department of plastic surgery in the period of March 25, 2020, to May 17, 2020 (54 days), with injuries of upper limb were analyzed and data compared with data from 2019. The demography and mode of injuries were studied. RESULTS: There was an unusual increase in hand injuries due to mixer grinder in kitchen, 32 cases in 54 days (17.78/month) compared to 28 cases in 12 months in 2019 (2.34/month) with P < 0.001. There was also an increase in number of intended self-inflicted injuries in upper limb, as a result of psychological effects of rage and frustration with spouse due to long periods of confinement at home (3.89/month during lockdown period compared to 0.58 during 2019, P < 0.005) with change in demography compared to previous year. There was a decrease in upper limb injuries due to road traffic accidents, industrial accidents, assaults, sports, school, and work-related injuries, during the lockdown period, and this was along the expected lines. CONCLUSION: The period of lockdown initiated in India, to slow the community transmission of COVID-19 caused long periods of confinement together at home for families and forced the young adults to carry out some unaccustomed work, which resulted in a spike in mixer grinder injuries of hand.

The number of lobes affected, number of lobes containing ground-glass opacities and consolidation, number of nodules, distribution of lesions (central, peripheral, or diffuse), lobes with centrilobular nodular pattern, and the presence of pleural effusion were recorded separately for both imaging methods. RESULTS: Seventeen of the patients were female (53%) and 15 were male (47%). The mean age of the patients was 60.5 (range, 20-85) years. A total of 31 patients (96%) had signs of pneumonia on CT. The most common finding in CT was ground-glass opacities in 29 patients (90.6%), followed by consolidation in 14 patients (43.75%). Both consolidation and ground-glass opacities were also observed in MRI in all of these patients. Nodules were detected in 12 patients (37.5%) on CT and 11 patients (34.4%) on MRI.

According to the results of the paper, the number of inmates who participate in the first and second-degree courses is fewer than the total population of illiterate prisoners and literate prisoners who have no primary school diploma. Moreover, the study reveals that it is an exemplary activity that the prisoners acquire a profession with vocational training while they are employed within the correctional settings. However, they have difficulty finding jobs after they are released. In addition, according to the findings of the study, prisoners are generally satisfied with the religious education activities going on inside the prisons. Nevertheless, there is a need to regulate the prison population in Turkey in order to make the inmates equally benefit from the educational, cultural, and recreational activities. Finally, it is significant to disseminate technology-enriched education programs to eliminate the challenges that arise in the implementation of educational activities particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Correctional Education in Turkey: A Historical Overview from Past to Present and Evaluation of Current Practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an emerging respiratory infection caused by introduction of a novel coronavirus into humans in late 2019 in China's Hubei province.

This study sought to understand the digital mental health experiences and priorities of Canadians affected by mental health conditions (i.e. seekers, patients, and care partners). METHODS: A national cross-sectional electronic survey of Canadians was administered through a market research firm's survey panel. Seekers, patients, and care partners were asked about their digital mental health experiences (e.g. uptake, barriers to access) and priorities. Survey responses were summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Overall, 1003 participants completed the survey. 70.2% of participants routinely use digital mental health supports to support themselves or those they care for; however, only 28.6% of participants are satisfied with the available digital mental health supports. Most participants (73.3%) have encountered some barriers when accessing digital mental health supports. Awareness of digital mental health supports was a top barrier identified by participants. The top digital mental health priorities consisted of digital mental health curation, navigation, and a digital mental health passport. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants use digital mental health supports for themselves or others, however, many are unaware of digital mental health supports available. Efforts to improve navigating access to digital and in-person mental health services are seen as a top priority, highlighting the need to enable seekers, patients, and care partners to find the appropriate support and make decisions on how to best improve their mental health.","output":"Canadian perspectives of digital mental health supports: Findings from a national survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The difference in morbidity and mortality between adult and pediatric COVID-19 infections is dramatic.

The Bayesian case model fits a location-specific curve to the velocity (first derivative) of the log transformed cumulative case count, borrowing strength across geographic locations and incorporating prior information to obtain a posterior distribution for case trajectories. The compartmental model uses this distribution and predicts deaths using a random forest algorithm trained on COVID-19 data and population-level characteristics, yielding daily projections and interval estimates for cases and deaths in U.S. states. We evaluated the model by training it on progressively longer periods of the pandemic and computing its predictive accuracy over 21-day forecasts.

Particularists try their best to tackle this global crisis. New challenges outlined from various medical perspectives may require a novel design solution. Asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers show different health conditions and no symptoms; hence, a differentiation process is required to avert the risk of chronic virus carriers. OBJECTIVES: Laboratory criteria and patient dataset are compulsory in constructing a new framework. Prioritisation is a popular topic and a complex issue for patients with COVID-19, especially for asymptomatic carriers due to multi-laboratory criteria, criterion importance and trade-off amongst these criteria. This study presents new integrated decision-making framework that handles the prioritisation of patients with COVID-19 and can detect the health conditions of asymptomatic carriers. METHODS: The methodology includes four phases. Firstly, eight important laboratory criteria are chosen using two feature selection approaches. Real and simulation datasets from various medical perspectives are integrated to produce a new dataset involving 56 patients with different health conditions and can be used to check asymptomatic cases that can be detected within the prioritisation configuration. The first phase aims to develop a new decision matrix depending on the intersection between multi-laboratory criteria and COVID-19 patient list. In the second phase, entropy is utilised to set the objective weight, and TOPSIS is adapted to prioritise patients in the third phase. Finally, objective validation is performed. RESULTS: The patients are prioritised based on the selected criteria in descending order of health situation starting from the worst to the best. The proposed framework can discriminate among mild, serious and critical conditions and put patients in a queue while considering asymptomatic carriers. Validation findings revealed that the patients are classified into four equal groups and showed significant differences in their scores, indicating the validity of ranking. CONCLUSIONS: This study implies and discusses the numerous benefits of the suggested framework in detecting/recognising the health condition of patients prior to discharge, supporting the hospitalisation characteristics, managing patient care and optimising clinical prediction rule.","output":"Detection-based Prioritisation: Framework of Multi-laboratory Characteristics for Asymptomatic COVID-19 Carriers Based on Integrated EntropyCTOPSIS Methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Simple SummaryMathematical modelling is used in disease studies to assess their economical impacts, as well as to better understand the epidemiological dynamics of the biological and environmental factors associated with disease spreading For an incurable disease such as Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis, this knowledge is extremely valuable However, the application of modelling techniques to study this disease has not been significantly explored in the literature The purpose of the present work was to review the published studies, highlighting their scope, strengths and limitations, as well to provide ideas for future modelling approaches for this disease The reviewed studies were divided into two major themes The first is epidemiological modelling, which use mathematical models which equations describe the disease dynamics over time Inside this group, the articles differ in considering or not considering the sexual transmission component The second major theme is statistical modelling, which correlates the disease with biological and environmental factors to quantify its risks and impacts Inside this group, the articles include models for dairy production, for risk factors of the disease and for Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis being a risk factor for other diseases Finally, the present work concludes with further suggestions for modelling studies on Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis AbstractMathematical modelling is used in disease studies to assess the economical impacts of diseases, as well as to better understand the epidemiological dynamics of the biological and environmental factors that are associated with disease spreading For an incurable disease such as Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis (CAE), this knowledge is extremely valuable However, the application of modelling techniques to CAE disease studies has not been significantly explored in the literature The purpose of the present work was to review the published studies, highlighting their scope, strengths and limitations, as well to provide ideas for future modelling approaches for studying CAE disease The reviewed studies were divided into the following two major themes: Mathematical epidemiological modelling and statistical modelling Regarding the epidemiological modelling studies, two groups of models have been addressed in the literature: With and without the sexual transmission component Regarding the statistical modelling studies, the reviewed articles varied on modelling assumptions and goals These studies modelled the dairy production, the CAE risk factors and the hypothesis of CAE being a risk factor for other diseases Finally, the present work concludes with further suggestions for modelling studies on CAE","output":"Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Virus Disease Modelling Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION New antihyperglycemic medications have proven cardiovascular and renal benefits in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, an evidence-based decision tree in specific clinical scenarios is lacking. MATERIALS AND METHODS Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with trial sequential analysis (TSA). RCT inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM from one of these subgroups: elderly, obese, previous atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), previous coronary-heart disease (CHD), previous heart failure (HF) or previous chronic kidney disease (CKD). RCTs describing those subgroups with at least 48 weeks were included. Outcomes: 3-point MACE; cardiovascular (CV) death; hospitalization due to HF; and renal outcomes. We performed direct meta-analysis with the number of events in the intervention and control groups in each subset, and the relative risk of events was calculated. RESULTS SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) were the only anti-hyperglycemic agents related to reduction in CV events in different populations. For obese and elderly populations, GLP-1 RA were associated with benefits in 3-point MACE; for patients with ASCVD, both SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA had benefits in 3-point MACE, while for patients with CHD, only SGLT2i were beneficial. CONCLUSIONS SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA reduced CV events in selected populations: SGLT2i led to a reduction in events in patients with previous CHD, ASCVD and HF. GLP-1 RA led to a reduction in CV events in patients with ASCVD, elderly and patients with obesity. TSA shows that these findings are conclusive.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: FMDV types O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012 were propagated in baby hamster kidney 21 (BHK21) and titrated then divided into five parts; the first part inactivated with heat, the second part inactivated with gamma radiation, the third part inactivated with UV light, the fourth part inactivated with binary ethylamine, and the last part inactivated with combination of binary ethylamine and formaldehyde (BEI+FA). Evaluate the method of inactivation via inoculation in BHK21, inoculation in suckling baby mice and complement fixation test then formulate vaccine using different methods of inactivation then applying the quality control tests to evaluate each formulated vaccine. RESULTS: The effect of heat, gamma radiation, and UV on the ability of replication of FMDV O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012 was determined through BHK cell line passage. Each of the 9 virus aliquots titer 10(8) TCID(50) (3 for each strain) were exposed to 37, 57, and 77C for 15, 30, and 45 min. Similarly, another 15 aliquots (5 for each strain) contain 1 mm depth of the exposed samples in petri-dish was exposed to UV light (252.7 nm wavelength: One foot distance) for 15, 30, 45, 60, and 65 min. Different doses of gamma radiation (10, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 KGy) were applied in a dose rate 0.551 Gy/s for each strain and repeated 6 times for each dose. FMDV (O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012) were inactivated when exposed to heat 57C for 15 min. The UV inactivation of FMDV (O/pan Asia and SAT-2) was obtained within 60 min and 65 min for type A/Iran05. The ideal dose for inactivation of FMDV (O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012) with gamma radiation were 55-60 and 45 kGy, respectively. Inactivation of FMDV with binary was 20, 24 and 16 hr for O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012, respectively while inactivation by (BEI+FA) was determined after 18, 19 and 11 hr for O/pan-Asia, A/Iran 05, and SAT-2/2012, respectively. The antigenicity of control virus before inactivation was 1/32, it was not changed after inactivation in case of gamma radiation and (BEI+FA) and slightly decrease to 1/16 in case of binary and declined to 1/2, 1/4 in case of heat and UV inactivation, respectively. The immune response induced by inactivated FMD vaccines by gamma radiation and (BEI+FA) lasted to 9 months post-vaccination, while the binary only still up to 8 months post-vaccination but heat and UV-inactivated vaccines were not effective.

The sharp rise in cases attributed to the Delta variant has made it especially disturbing and is a variant of concern. Fortunately, current vaccines offer protection against known variants of concern, including the Delta variant. However, the Delta variant has exhibited some ability to dodge the immune system as it is found that neutralizing antibodies from prior infections or vaccines are less receptive to binding with the Delta spike protein. Here, we investigated the structural changes caused by the mutations in the Delta variants receptor-binding interface and explored the effects on binding with the ACE2 receptor as well as with neutralizing antibodies. We find that the receptor-binding -loop- motif adopts an altered but stable conformation causing separation in some of the antibody binding epitopes.

We sought to determine the utility of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for characterizing lung involvement and, thereby, clinical risk determination in COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This multicenter, prospective, observational study included patients with COVID-19 who received 12-zone lung ultrasound and chest computed tomography (CT) scanning in the emergency department (ED). We defined lung disease severity using the lung ultrasound score (LUS) and chest CT severity score (CTSS). We assessed the association between the LUS and poor outcome (ICU admission or 30-day all-cause mortality). We also assessed the association between the LUS and hospital length of stay. We examined the ability of the LUS to differentiate between disease severity groups. Lastly, we estimated the correlation between the LUS and CTSS and the interrater agreement for the LUS. We handled missing data by multiple imputation with chained equations and predictive mean matching. Results: We included 114 patients treated between March 19, 2020, and May 4, 2020. An LUS &gt;=12 was associated with a poor outcome within 30 days (hazard ratio [HR], 5.59;95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-24.80;P = 0.02). Admission duration was shorter in patients with an LUS &lt;12 (adjusted HR, 2.24;95% CI, 1.47-3.40;P &lt; 0.001). Mean LUS differed between disease severity groups: no admission, 6.3 (standard deviation [SD], 4.4);hospital/ward, 13.1 (SD, 6.4);and ICU, 18.0 (SD, 5.0). The LUS was able to discriminate between ED discharge and hospital admission excellently, with an area under the curve of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.75-0.91).

Based on frontline practical experience and comprehensive literature review, here a panel of experts and physicians from China and Europe developed an evidence and opinion-based consensus on the prophylaxis and management of VTE associated with COVID-19. This statement aims for clinicians treating COVID-19 and provides practical recommendations in detailed situations, for example, how to choose thromboprophylactic measures for patients with diverse severity of disease and bleeding risk, or which kind of anticoagulant should be prescribed. With limited experience on COVID19-associated VTE, this expert consensus statement should be helpful for clinicians worldwide with specific suggestions.","output":"Prevention and Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection: A Consensus Statement before Guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is commonly used to triage and monitor the evolution of stroke victims.

METHODS: In this retrospective case series, patients must have had SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, fever, ferritin >1,000 ng/mL with one additional laboratory marker of hyperinflammation, and AHRF. AHRF was defined as requiring 15L of supplemental oxygen via non\\\\rebreather mask combined with 6L nasal cannula or use of 95% oxygen by high flow nasal cannula. We excluded patients with suspicion for bacterial infection or on immunosuppressants. Subcutaneous anakinra was initiated at 100 mg q6 hours and gradually tapered off completely. Primary outcome was prevention of MV. RESULTS: Eleven of 14 patients meeting criteria received anakinra for a maximum of 19 days. Seven of those who initiated anakinra 36 hours after onset of AHRF did not require MV, and all were discharged home. Four patients who started anakinra 4 days after onset of AHRF required MV. Of those, 3 patients were extubated (2 discharged home, 1 remains hospitalized) and 1 died. All 3 patients who met criteria but did not receive anakinra required MV. Two were extubated (1 discharged and 1 remains hospitalized) and 1 remains on MV. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that anakinra could be beneficial in COVID\\\\19 patients with evidence of CSS when initiated early after onset of AHRF.

The authors hypothesise that students adjusted their decisions by delaying graduation, dropping out or change the field of education because of increased uncertainty about future employment and monetary returns. Design/methodology/approach The empirical approach is based on a survey done during the first wave of COVID-19 in Slovenia. The probability of dropping out, prolonging or stop-out is designed by applying probit and probit with insturmental variables empirical model. Findings Primary orientation towards work increases the probability of dropping out and financial constraints increase the probability of prolonging studies. The same holds after accounting for endogeneity. However, the authors do not find that poor job expectations due to COVID-19 affect students' decisions to prolong, drop-out or stop-out. The authors also find that the primary orientation toward work or study explains the differences in the probability of each outcome that is not influenced by enrolment in a particular field of study. Research limitations/implications The results cannot be read as an objective prediction of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on college failures. However, the study provides insight into how students' expectations change their intentions to prolong, drop-out, or stop-out during periods of high uncertainty. The extent, to which measured intentions are realised, however, is uncertain. Practical implications Understanding the response diversity and motives behind students' study decisions represents extremely valuable insights for economic policy. Mapped apprehensions, augmented by heterogeneity in personal and financial characteristics, are relevant for policymakers. In terms of future research, it would be interesting to analyse what changes occurred over a five-year period, specifically which field of study was most affected by students' adjusted plans due to the pandemic. Social implications Students have always been a special group in the labour market. After the initial shock of closing activities, studying online and the drastic decrease in student work due to COVID-19, the decision was made in spring 2020 to continue on the chosen path or not. This paper provides insight into the changing decision students made about their educational plans. Originality/value This paper is one of the first to highlight the implications of COVID-19 for the adaptation of student plans in the transition from school-to work in Europe. It departs from the classical literature of college failures, as specific macroeconomic conditions influence students to reconsider their educational decisions. Moreover, the paper also contributes to the rapidly growing literature on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on household-level labour market outcomes, particularly with respect to job search and labour supply decisions in general.","output":"Drop-out, stop-out or prolong?

Given the pandemic urgency and lack of an effective cure for this disease, drug repurposing could open the way for finding a solution. Lots of investigations are ongoing to test the compounds already identified as antivirals. On the other hand, induction of type I interferons are found to play an important role in the generation of immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it was opined that the antivirals capable of triggering the interferons and their signaling pathway, could rationally be beneficial for treating COVID-19. On this basis, using a database of antivirals, called drugvirus, some antiviral agents were derived, followed by searches on their relevance to interferon induction. The examined list included drugs from different categories such as antibiotics, immunosuppressants, anti-cancers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), calcium channel blocker compounds, and some others. The results as briefed here, could help in finding potential drug candidates for COVID-19 treatment. However, their advantages and risks should be taken into account through precise studies, considering a systemic approach. Even though the adverse effects of some of these drugs may overweight their benefits, considering their mechanisms and structures may give a clue for designing novel drugs in the future. Furthermore, the antiviral effect and IFN-modifying mechanisms possessed by some of these drugs might lead to a synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2, which deserve to be evaluated in further investigations.","output":"Interferon-inducer antivirals: potential candidates to combat COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Perceived health is one of the strongest determinants of subjective well-being, but it has received little attention among survivors of ARDS. RESEARCH QUESTION: How well do self-reported measures of physical, emotional, and social functioning predict perceived overall health (measured using the EQ-5D visual analog scale [EQ-5D-VAS]) among adult survivors of ARDS? Are demographic features, comorbidity, or severity of illness correlated with perceived health after controlling for self-reported functioning? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the ARDSNet Long Term Outcomes Study (ALTOS) and Improving Care of Acute Lung Injury Patients (ICAP) Study, two longitudinal cohorts with a total of 823 survivors from 44 US hospitals, which prospectively assessed survivors at 6 and 12 months after ARDS. Perceived health, evaluated using the EQ-5D-VAS, was predicted using ridge regression and self-reported measures of physical, emotional, and social functioning. The difference between observed and predicted perceived health was termed perspective deviation (PD). Correlations between PD and demographics, comorbidities, and severity of illness were explored. RESULTS: The correlation between observed and predicted EQ-5D-VAS scores ranged from 0.68 to 0.73 across the two cohorts and time points. PD ranged from -80 to +34 and was more than the minimum clinically important difference for 52% to 55% of survivors. Neither demographic features, comorbidity, nor severity of illness were correlated strongly with PD, with |r| < 0.25 for all continuous variables in both cohorts and time points. The correlation between PD at 6- and 12-month assessments was weak (ALTOS: r = 0.22, P < .001; ICAP: r = 0.20, P = .02). INTERPRETATION: About half of survivors of ARDS showed clinically important differences in actual perceived health vs predicted perceived health based on self-reported measures of functioning. Survivors of ARDS demographic features, comorbidities, and severity of illness were correlated only weakly with perceived health after controlling for measures of perceived functioning, highlighting the challenge of predicting how individual patients will respond psychologically to new impairments after critical illness.","output":"Understanding Patients' Perceived Health After Critical Illness: Analysis of Two Prospective, Longitudinal Studies of ARDS Survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current reports concerning cardiac involvement in the novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) mostly document acute myocardial injury at presentation.

Nevertheless, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cannot be perceived as a disease limited only to pneumonia with diverse severity. More and more reports have demonstrated a wide range of possible systemic symptoms, including hepatic complications. Liver injury has been observed in a significant proportion of patients, especially in those with a severe or critical illness. COVID-19 might provoke a deterioration of liver function in patients with already diagnosed chronic liver diseases and without pre-existing liver disorders. The deterioration of liver function worsens the prognosis, increases the risk of a severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and prolongs the hospital stay. In general, patients who develop liver dysfunction in COVID-19 are mainly males, elderly people, and those with higher body mass index. The underlying mechanisms for hepatic failure in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are still unclear, nevertheless liver damage appears to be directly connected with virus-induced cytopathic effects. A liver injury observed during hospitalization might be simultaneously caused by the use of potentially hepatotoxic drugs, mainly antiviral agents.

METHODS: This cross-sectional, web-based study included Saudi adult patients with T1DM who attended at least one virtual phone visit with the diabetes clinic at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, between August 1 and December 31, 2020. Patients anonymously answered a Google form-created Arabic questionnaire. Information about patient characteristics, outcome, and perception of the virtual phone visit were obtained. Data were presented using descriptive statistics, chi-square, one-way ANOVA, independent t-, and Welch's t-tests. RESULTS: The questionnaire was sent to 281 patients, of whom 201 completed it. 59.2% patients were satisfied with their overall virtual phone clinic experience, and 75.6% preferred to continue attending the virtual phone clinics in the future. The average perception value of patients toward virtual phone clinics was 67.76  19.9, suggesting good perception among the majority. Negative or neutral views of current health, asking to be physically seen, and missing a virtual appointment were associated with significantly lower average patient perception value (p < 0.001).

Rates are elevated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Poor mental health affects expectant and new parents overall emotional and physical well-being, and has consequences for children, families, and society. Services currently available to those experiencing perinatal mental illness in Canada are largely inadequate and issues are magnified during COVID-19. This presentation offers findings from the Canadian Perinatal Mental Health Collaborative survey, which examines gaps in perinatal mental health service delivery. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of Canadian perinatal health care providers. Providers (N=405) were recruited via social media. Results: The majority of providers (87%) do not have mandated screening for perinatal mental illness at their workplace. When women are screened and have symptoms indicative of needing intervention, 61% of providers reported wait times of 1-12 months for services. Mental health services provided are disparate across health regions. Half (50%) reported that they have not received specialized training in perinatal mental illness. Providers identified significant barriers in service provision, with language and/or lack of culturally-appropriate counselling services being cited by 87%. Providers reported that COVID-19 has complicated access to care, including reduced in-person visits and overall services. Conclusions: The survey findings underscore a critical need for anational perinatal mental health strategy to address gaps in screening and treatment.

The aim of this double-blinded, randomized noninferiority trial was to evaluate the effect of neostigmine administration on neuromuscular function when given to patients after spontaneous recovery to a train-of-four ratio of 0.9 or greater. METHODS A total of 120 patients presenting for surgery requiring intubation were given a small dose of rocuronium. At the conclusion of surgery, 90 patients achieving a train-of-four ratio of 0.9 or greater were randomized to receive either neostigmine 40 g/kg or saline (control). Train-of-four ratios were measured from the time of reversal until postanesthesia care unit admission. Patients were monitored for postextubation adverse respiratory events and assessed for muscle strength. RESULTS Ninety patients achieved a train-of-four ratio of 0.9 or greater at the time of reversal. Mean train-of-four ratios in the control and neostigmine groups before reversal (1.02 vs. 1.03), 5 min postreversal (1.05 vs. 1.07), and at postanesthesia care unit admission (1.06 vs. 1.08) did not differ. The mean difference and corresponding 95% CI of the latter were -0.018 and -0.046 to 0.010. The incidences of postoperative hypoxemic events and episodes of airway obstruction were similar for the groups.

This study evaluated whether multidimensional sleep health calculated from actigraphy and self-report was longitudinally associated with adiposity in a sample of midlife women who have a high prevalence of sleep disturbances and adiposity. DESIGN: Longitudinal study with 11-14 years of follow-up time between the sleep health assessment and body mass index / waist-to-hip ratio measurements. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and twenty-one midlife women enrolled in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation Sleep Study. MEASUREMENTS: Multidimensional sleep health was quantified using actigraphy (M[SD] = 29.1[7.2] nights) measures of sleep efficiency, midpoint, duration, regularity, and self-report measures of alertness and satisfaction. Each component was dichotomized and summed; higher values indicated better sleep health. Height, body weight, and waist and hip circumference were measured at the sleep study and at follow-up. Linear regression models were used to assess associations between sleep health and adiposity, adjusting for demographic and menopausal covariates. RESULTS: There was no substantial within-person change in adiposity over time. Better sleep health was cross-sectionally and longitudinally associated with lower adiposity in unadjusted, but not in adjusted, models.

A composite reference standard comprising RT-PCR plus radiological and clinical features has been recommended for diagnostic accuracy studies. The FebriDx finger prick point-of-care test detects an antiviral host response protein (MxA) in 10 min. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of FebriDx and RT-PCR compared to a composite reference standard. METHODS: Adults presenting to hospital with suspected COVID-19 were tested by FebriDx and RT-PCR. A composite reference standard was used to classify patients as having COVID-19 based on RT-PCR positivity, or RT-PCR negativity with COVID-19 radiological findings or other clinical criteria. Measures of accuracy were calculated for MxA alone, RT-PCR alone, and both combined. This study is registered with the ISRCTN (ISRCTN14966673) and has completed. RESULTS: A total of 478 patients were tested, with valid results in 475. Of these 475 patients, 222 (46.7%) were classified as having COVID-19; 192 (40.4%) were RT-PCR positive, and 30 (6.3%) were RT-PCR negative and diagnosed on radiological/clinical criteria. Sensitivity of FebriDx MxA vs the composite reference standard was 186/222 (83.8%, 95% CI 78.3C88.4) and was similar to the sensitivity of RT-PCR (192/222 (86.5%, 95% CI 81.3C90.7), (difference of 2.7%, 95% CI ? 3.9 to 9.3, p = 0.42).

The way the media reports on the vaccine may influence or affect how the population perceive the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. MethodsThe aim of this study was to determine how newspapers in Nigeria report stories about the vaccine and the side effects of the vaccine amidst the growing fear on the safety of the vaccine. A total of 4 national daily newspapers were randomly selected for the study. These are Leadership, Guardian, Nation and Punch newspapers. The study was anchored on agenda setting theory. Quantitative content analysis research was used for the study. The duration of the study was the day the vaccine was introduced in Nigeria: March 1st, 2021 to July 31st, 2021. An Excel sheet served as the instrument for data collection and analysis done using SPSS version 25 with the level of significance predetermined at a p-value <0.05. ResultsKey findings from this research were: Government officials and technical experts were predominantly used by the newspapers as the source of their information. There was a mixed reporting of vaccine side effects with a significant difference between those newspaper publications that reported vaccine side effects and those that didnt. Amongst those that reported side effects, there was also a significant difference between those that communicated how and where to report the side effects as against those that didnt. ConclusionAs part of the effort to curtail vaccine hesitancy, a continuous improvement in communicating the vaccine efficacy and safety is needed.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccine: Newspaper Coverage of the side effects of the vaccine in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In February 2020, the Chinese government imposed a complete lockdown of Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province to contain a spike of COVID-19 cases. Although such measures are effective in preventing the spread of the virus, medical professionals strongly voiced a caveat concerning the pandemic emotional burnout at the individual level. Although the lockdown limited individuals interpersonal communication with people in their social networks, it is common that individuals turn to social media to seek and share health information, exchange social support, and express pandemic-generated feelings. OBJECTIVE: Based on a holistic and multilevel perspective, this study examines how pandemic-related emotional exhaustion enacts intrapersonal, interpersonal, and hyperpersonal emotional regulation strategies, and then evaluates the effectiveness of these strategies, with a particular interest in understanding the role of hyperpersonal-level regulation or social mediaCbased regulation. METHODS: Using an online panel, this study sampled 538 Chinese internet users from Hubei Province, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Survey data collection lasted for 12 days from February 7-18, 2020, two weeks after Hubei Province was placed under quarantine. The sample had an average age of 35 (SD 10.65, range 18-78) years, and a majority were married (n=369, 68.6%). RESULTS: Using structural equation modeling, this study found that intrapersonal-level (B=0.22; =.24; P<.001) and interpersonal-level (B=0.35; =.49; P<.001) emotional regulation strategies were positively associated with individuals outcome reappraisal. In contrast with intrapersonal and interpersonal regulations, hyperpersonal (social mediaCbased) regulation strategies, such as disclosing and retweeting negative emotions, were negatively related to the outcome reappraisal (B=C1.00; =C.80; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous literature, intrapersonal-level regulation (eg, cognitive reappraisal, mindfulness, and self-kindness) and interpersonal-level supportive interaction may generate a buffering effect on emotional exhaustion and promote individuals reappraisal toward the stressful situation. However, hyperpersonal-level regulation may exacerbate the experienced negative emotions and impede reappraisal of the pandemic situation. It is speculated that retweeting content that contains pandemic-related stress and anxiety may cause a digital emotion contagion. Individuals who share other peoples negative emotional expressions on social media are likely to be affected by the negative affect contagion. More importantly, the possible benefits of intrapersonal and interpersonal emotion regulations may be counteracted by social media or hyperpersonal regulation. This suggests the necessity to conduct social mediaCbased health communication interventions to mitigate the social mediaCwide negative affect contagion if lockdown policies related to highly infectious diseases are initiated.","output":"Social Media and Emotional Burnout Regulation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Multilevel Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a grave global public health emergency. Nowadays, social media has become the main channel through which the public can obtain information and express their opinions and feelings. This study explored public opinion in the early stages of COVID-19 in China by analyzing Sina-Weibo (a Twitter-like microblogging system in China) texts in terms of space, time, and content. Temporal changes within one-hour intervals and the spatial distribution of COVID-19-related Weibo texts were analyzed. Based on the latent Dirichlet allocation model and the random forest algorithm, a topic extraction and classification model was developed to hierarchically identify seven COVID-19-relevant topics and 13 sub-topics from Weibo texts. The results indicate that the number of Weibo texts varied over time for different topics and sub-topics corresponding with the different developmental stages of the event. The spatial distribution of COVID-19-relevant Weibo was mainly concentrated in Wuhan, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration. There is a synchronization between frequent daily discussions on Weibo and the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak in the real world. Public response is very sensitive to the epidemic and significant social events, especially in urban agglomerations with convenient transportation and a large population. The timely dissemination and updating of epidemic-related information and the popularization of such information by the government can contribute to stabilizing public sentiments. However, the surge of public demand and the hysteresis of social support demonstrated that the allocation of medical resources was under enormous pressure in the early stage of the epidemic. It is suggested that the government should strengthen the response in terms of public opinion and epidemic prevention and exert control in key epidemic areas, urban agglomerations, and transboundary areas at the province level. In controlling the crisis, accurate response countermeasures should be formulated following public help demands. The findings can help government and emergency agencies to better understand the public opinion and sentiments towards COVID-19, to accelerate emergency responses, and to support post-disaster management.","output":"Using Social Media to Mine and Analyze Public Opinion Related to COVID-19 in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spoken word poetry encourages youth to engage in identity construction, resist oppression and construct counternarratives.

The objective of this study was to identify the activities of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in response to the covid-19 pandemic in Iran and the challenges they confronted. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative analysis based on twenty-two individual, virtual, and semi-structured interviews. Interviewees were selected through purposeful and snowball sampling. All interviews were performed with active health-related NGO representatives willing to participate in the study and continued until data saturation. Data analysis was performed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The activities and challenges raised by NGO representatives were identified in 6 main categories, including the need for the participation of NGOs in the fight against pandemics, response to the COVID-19 crisis in the society, challenges in providing services to the target group in the COVID-19 crisis, NGOs challenges in interacting with governmental and non-governmental institutions, information sources used by NGOs in the COVID-19 crisis and strategies to support NGOs in their efforts. CONCLUSION: Considering the crucial challenges for their participation, such as the NGO access to the target groups, lack of communication network, and constructive interaction between government institutions and the NGOs, it is recommended to increase the capacity of these institutions and intervene to establish a constructive and long-term relationship with the government.","output":"Identifying the non-governmental organizations' activities and challenges in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Curcumin, an active component of the rhizome turmeric, has gained much attention as a plant-based compound with pleiotropic pharmacological properties. It possesses anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hypoglycemic, antimicrobial, neuroprotective, and immunomodulatory activities. However, the health-promoting utility of curcumin is constrained due to its hydrophobic nature, water insolubility, poor bioavailability, rapid metabolism, and systemic elimination. Therefore, an innovative stride was taken, and complexes of metals with curcumin have been synthesized. Curcumin usually reacts with metals through the -diketone moiety to generate metalCcurcumin complexes. It is well established that curcumin strongly chelates several metal ions, including boron, cobalt, copper, gallium, gadolinium, gold, lanthanum, manganese, nickel, iron, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, silver, vanadium, and zinc. In this review, the pharmacological, chemopreventive, and therapeutic activities of metalCcurcumin complexes are discussed. MetalCcurcumin complexes increase the solubility, cellular uptake, and bioavailability and improve the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antiviral effects of curcumin. MetalCcurcumin complexes have also demonstrated efficacy against various chronic diseases, including cancer, arthritis, osteoporosis, and neurological disorders such as Alzheimers disease. These biological activities of metalCcurcumin complexes were associated with the modulation of inflammatory mediators, transcription factors, protein kinases, antiapoptotic proteins, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzymes. In addition, metalCcurcumin complexes have shown usefulness in biological imaging and radioimaging. The future use of metalCcurcumin complexes may represent a new approach in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases.","output":"MetalCCurcumin Complexes in Therapeutics: An Approach to Enhance Pharmacological Effects of Curcumin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Mass indoor gatherings were banned in early 2020 to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spread. We aimed to assess, under controlled conditions, whether systematic antigen-screening within 3 days, medical mask-wearing and optimized ventilation could prevent SARS-CoV-2 spread during a large, indoor gathering without physical distancing.Methods: The non-inferiority, prospective, open-label, randomized (2:1)-controlled SPRING trial was conducted on May 29, 2021 in Paris, France. Participants, 18C45 years old, had no comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms and recent case contact, and a negative rapid antigen diagnostic test within 3 days before the concert. Participants were randomly allocated to the experimental arm (attendees) or to the control arm (non-attendees).

METHODS The Cochrane Library, PubMed, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to February 28, 2021, to identify randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome was reintubation within 24-72 hours after a planned extubation. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS Six articles presenting findings for 1746 patients were included. The effect of HFNC on the reintubation rate was noninferior to that of NIV (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.85-1.44). The rate of treatment failure was 20.40% with HFNC versus 20.92% with NIV; this difference was nonsignificant (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.72-1.32, P = 0.85). HFNC reduced the rates of skin lesion occurrence (10.28% versus 23.82%, OR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.26-0.53, P < 0.00001) and post-extubation respiratory failure (23.76% versus 25.56%, OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.46-0.88, P = 0.006), compared with NIV.

The relationship between the time spent on exercise during leisure time and physical activity, including work, with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in workers is unclear, with variations observed between occupational types. This cross-sectional study examined these associations among Japanese workers from various occupations during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An Internet-based national health surveyCollaborative Online Research on Novel-coronavirus and Work-study (CORoNaWork study)was conducted among 33,087 Japanese workers in December 2020. After excluding invalid responses, 27,036 participants were categorized into four and five groups according to exercise and physical activity time, respectively. Each group's scores were compared on each of the four questions on the Japanese version of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Health-Related Quality of Life (CDC HRQOL-4) using generalized linear models. Age-sex adjusted and multivariate models were used to compare each index of the CDC HRQOL-4. RESULTS: Compared to the reference category (almost never), any level of exercise (ORs 0.56C0.77) and physical activity (ORs 0.93C0.88) were associated with better self-rated health in the multivariate model. Any exercise was also associated with significantly reduced odds for physically or mentally unhealthy days; however, high levels of physical activity (120 min/day) were associated with significantly increased odds for these outcomes (ORs = 1.11 and 1.16, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that exercise habits are more critical to workers' HRQOL than physical activity.

However, the amount of literature on data quality challenges, specifically those for person-generated wearable device data, is sparse. OBJECTIVE This study aims to systematically review the literature on factors affecting the quality of person-generated wearable device data and their associated intrinsic data quality challenges for research. METHODS The literature was searched in the PubMed, Association for Computing Machinery, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and Google Scholar databases by using search terms related to wearable devices and data quality. By using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, studies were reviewed to identify factors affecting the quality of wearable device data. Studies were eligible if they included content on the data quality of wearable devices, such as fitness trackers and sleep monitors. Both research-grade and consumer-grade wearable devices were included in the review. Relevant content was annotated and iteratively categorized into semantically similar factors until a consensus was reached. If any data quality challenges were mentioned in the study, those contents were extracted and categorized as well. RESULTS A total of 19 papers were included in this review. We identified three high-level factors that affect data quality-device- and technical-related factors, user-related factors, and data governance-related factors. Device- and technical-related factors include problems with hardware, software, and the connectivity of the device; user-related factors include device nonwear and user error; and data governance-related factors include a lack of standardization. The identified factors can potentially lead to intrinsic data quality challenges, such as incomplete, incorrect, and heterogeneous data. Although missing and incorrect data are widely known data quality challenges for wearable devices, the heterogeneity of data is another aspect of data quality that should be considered for wearable devices. Heterogeneity in wearable device data exists at three levels: heterogeneity in data generated by a single person using a single device (within-person heterogeneity); heterogeneity in data generated by multiple people who use the same brand, model, and version of a device (between-person heterogeneity); and heterogeneity in data generated from multiple people using different devices (between-person heterogeneity), which would apply especially to data collected under a bring-your-own-device policy. CONCLUSIONS Our study identifies potential intrinsic data quality challenges that could occur when analyzing wearable device data for research and three major contributing factors for these challenges. As poor data quality can compromise the reliability and accuracy of research results, further investigation is needed on how to address the data quality challenges of wearable devices.","output":"Factors Affecting the Quality of Person-Generated Wearable Device Data and Associated Challenges: Rapid Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been relentless.

Memory B cells were detected primarily in the spleen and to a lesser extent in bone marrow but not in the genital tract or neural tissues suggesting that the HSV-specific antibody-secreting cells present at peripheral sites of HSV-2 infection represented persisting populations of plasma cells. The antibody produced by these cells isolated from neural tissues of infected animals was functionally relevant and included antibodies specific for HSV-2 glycoproteins and HSV-2 neutralizing antibodies. A vigorous IFN--secreting T cell response developed in the spleen as well as the sites of HSV-2 infection in the genital tract, lumbosacral ganglia and spinal cord following acute HSV-2 infection. Additionally, populations of HSV-specific tissue-resident memory T cells were maintained at these sites and were readily detected up to 150 days post HSV-2 infection.

These compounds may induce acute kidney injuries and are not recommended in patients with poor renal function, such as kidney transplant recipients (KTx). Methods We reviewed the records of 42 KTx with COVID-19, some of them receiving ARV (n = 10) or RDV (n = 8) as part of the COVID-19 management. Most patients were male (71%) with a median age of 52 years and median GFR 56 mL/min and had mild (36%), moderate (19%), severe (31%), and critical (12%) disease. Subgroups (patients receiving ARV, RDV, or no antivirals) were comparable regarding patient age, comorbidities or immunosuppression. Results: Seven patients (16,6%) died during hospitalization. Acute kidney injury was found in 24% KTx at admission. Upon discharge, eGFR increased in 32% and decreased in 39% of the KTx compared with the admission. The decrease was more prevalent in the RDV group (80%) compared with KTx without any antiviral treatment (29%) (p < 0.05).

While students traditionally spend time learning in the reading room, remote clinical learning requires material shared without direct teaching at the radiology workstation. Can remote clinical learning meet or exceed the educational value of the traditional in-person learning experience? Can student engagement be matched or exceeded in a remote learning environment? MATERIALS AND METHODS To replace the in-person reading room experience, a small-group learning session for medical students named Virtual Read-Out (VRO) was developed using teleconferencing software. After Institutional Review Board approval, two student groups were anonymously surveyed to assess differences in student engagement and perceived value between learning environments: \\"Conventional\\" students participating in the reading room (before the pandemic) and \\"Remote\\" students participating in VRO sessions. Students reported perceived frequency of a series of five-point Likert statements. Based on number of respondents, an independent t-test was performed to determine the significance of results between two groups. RESULTS Twenty-seven conventional and 41 remote students responded. Remote students reported modest but significantly higher frequency of active participation in reviewing radiology exams (p < 0.05). There was significantly lower frequency of reported boredom among Remote students (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in perceived educational value between the two groups. CONCLUSION Students report a high degree of teaching quality, clinical relevance, and educational value regardless of remote or in-person learning format. Remote clinical radiology education can be achieved with equal or greater student interaction and perceived value in fewer contact hours than conventional learning in the reading room.","output":"Medical Student Engagement and Educational Value of a Remote Clinical Radiology Learning Environment: Creation of Virtual Read-Out Sessions in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective prophylactic and therapeutic interventions are urgently needed to address the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic Various antiviral drugs have recently been tested Type I interferon (IFN) is a regulatory protein involved in the innate immune response, with broad-spectrum antiviral activities and the ability to directly block viral replication and support the immune response to eliminate virus infection Insufficient virus-induced type I IFN production is characteristic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, because SARS-CoV-2 suppresses the IFN response by interacting with essential IFN signaling pathways Exogenous type I IFN is recommended for treating COVID-19 Unexpectedly however, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, which acts as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor, was shown to be stimulated by IFN, raising doubts about the suitability of IFN use However, further studies have excluded concerns regarding IFN administration Type I IFNs, including IFN-1b, have been used clinically as antiviral drugs for many years and have shown strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro Preliminary clinical studies of type I IFNs, especially when delivered via aerosol inhalation, have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 Randomized controlled trials of IFN for COVID-19 treatment are ongoing","output":"Type I interferon: From innate response to treatment for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly infectious, with the current pandemic causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.

The present study reports on a novel electrode structure design together with its experimental assessment for RF thermo-fusion of porcine colonic segments. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two types of electrode were constructed and used in the present study: one with a conventional smooth surface (S) and the other with a novel reciprocating concave-convex (CC) configuration. Finite element modeling was used to study the thermal distribution profile of the CC electrode. Ex vivo porcine colonic segments were used to create end-to-end serosa-to-serosa colonic anastomoses by applying a pulse of 160 W RF power for 20 s. Different compression pressures (S1, S2, S3) and (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5), were applied, via specially designed ring carriers, to the S and CC electrodes, respectively. Assessment was based on anastomotic burst pressures and histological appearances using light microscopy of paraffin sections. RESULTS In total, 22 RF-induced circular anastomoses were performed. Similar burst pressures were observed for anastomoses created by the two types of electrodes (S, CC) performed under the same compression pressure. In contrast, significant differences were observed on histological examination of tissue anastomotic site. In particular, fusion areas between gaps of the CC electrode showed normal histological appearance, while the S electrode produced a completely flat featureless appearance. Furthermore, the CC electrode produced significantly different burst pressures depending on the applied compression pressure during thermo-fusion: compression pressures C1 vs. C4 produced circular anastomotic fusions with burst pressures of 21.9  9.3 vs. 44.6  8.9 mmHg, (p = 0.034); but the burst pressure beyond C4, declined significantly, with C4 vs. C5, burst pressures of 44.6  8.9 vs. 24.7  8.0 mmHg, (p = 0.034).

The Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form, Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, and Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale were used to assess problematic gaming, social media use, and smartphone use. The Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 was used to assess distress, and an item rated on a 0-10 scale was included to assess fear of being infected by COVID-19. Fear of being infected by COVID-19 was assessed because this could be a confounding variable in the association between psychological distress and screen time use. Increased time spent on gaming, social media, and smartphones was associated with greater problematic gaming, problematic social media use, problematic smartphone use, and psychological distress, but was not associated with fear of COVID-19 infection. Mediation analyses showed that problematic gaming, problematic social media use, and problematic smartphone use were significant mediators in the association between psychological distress and increased time spent on Internet-related activities during the COVID-19 outbreak period. Children who had psychological distress during COVID-19 outbreak might have spent longer time on Internet-related activities due to the school hiatus and problematic use of Internet-related activities.

With increased use of these medications, physicians need to become knowledgeable of these drugs' neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions with psychiatric medications. Objective: Clarify evidence base regarding the psychiatric side effects and psychiatric drug interactions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. METHODS: A literature review was performed in PubMed from 1950 to 2020 regarding psychiatric topics and targeted pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. RESULTS: First, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may mildly inhibit CYP2D6 metabolism of psychiatric medications, and psychiatric medications that interfere with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity could alter chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels. Second, they may prolong the QT interval, warranting caution with concomitant prescription of other QT prolonging agents. Finally, neuropsychiatric side effects are very uncommon but possible and include a potentially prolonged phenomenon of \\"psychosis after chloroquine.\\" Hydroxychloroquine has less information available about its neuropsychiatric side effects than chloroquine, with psychosis literature limited to several case reports. Weak evidence suggests a possible association of hydroxychloroquine exposure and increased suicidal ideation. It is not clear whether patients with psychiatric illness are more vulnerable to neuropsychiatric sequela of these medications;however, overdose of these medications by suicidal patients has high risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: The risk of neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for coronavirus disease-2019 treatment is not known. Best practice may include suicide risk assessment for patients treated with hydroxychloroquine. However, delirium is expected to be a more likely etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in critically ill patients treated for coronavirus disease-2019, and adjustment disorder is a much more likely etiology of anxiety and depression symptoms than the side effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.

To fight COVID-19 pandemic, over 100 countries instituted either a full or partial lockdown, affecting billions of people. In Tyrol, first lockdown measures were taken on 10 March 2020. On 16 March 2020, a curfew went into force which ended on 1 May 2020. On 19 March 2020, Tyrol as a whole was placed in quarantine which ended on 7 April 2020. The governmental actions helped reducing the spread of COVID-19 at the cost of significant effects on social life and behaviour. Accordingly, to provide a comprehensive picture of the population health status not only input from medical and biological sciences is required, but also from other sciences able to provide lifestyle information such as drug use. Herein, wastewater-based epidemiology was used for studying temporal trends of licit and illicit drug consumption during lockdown and quarantine in the area of the Tyrolean capital Innsbruck (174,000 inhabitants). On 35 days between 12 March 2020 and 15 April 2020, loads of 23 markers were monitored in wastewater. Loads determined on 292 days between March 2016 and January 2020 served as reference. During lockdown, changes in the consumption patterns of recreational drugs (i.e. cocaine, amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methamphetamine, and alcohol) and pharmaceuticals for short-term application (i.e. acetaminophen, codeine, and trimethoprim) were detected. For illicit drugs and alcohol, it is very likely that observed changes were linked to the shutdown of the hospitality industry and event cancelation which led to a reduced demand of these compounds particularly on weekends. For the pharmaceuticals, further work will be necessary to clarify if the observed declines are indicators of improved population health or of some kind of restraining effect that reduced the number of consultations of medical doctors and pharmacies.","output":"Monitoring drug consumption in Innsbruck during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown by wastewater analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to measure the percentage of reported olfactory or taste losses and their severity, recovery time, and association with other features in a large cohort of patients with COVID-19.

Barriers to HCV elimination include high cost of medications and the ability to engage specific at-risk populations as well as individuals who are out of medical care.

France has struggled to find the right balance between the rock of economic and social damage caused by containment measures and the hard alternative of a rapidly spreading pandemic. The response to the first wave, including a full lock-down, was an emergency response that revealed the low level of preparedness for pandemics and the overly hospital-centred provision of health care in France. During the second wave, this response evolved into a more level strategy trying to reconcile health needs in a broader perspective integrating socio-economic considerations, but without fully managing to put in place an effective health strategy.

Taking into account the genome similarity of COVID-19 with SARS-CoV, drugs with safety profiles could be fast solution. Clinical trials encouraged the use of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 inhibition. One of the possible inhibition pathways is the competitive binding with the angiotension-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), in particular with the cellular Sialic acid (Neu5Ac). Here, we investigate the possible binding mechanism of ClQ and ClQOH with sialic acid both in the gas phase and in water using density functional theory (DFT). We investigated the binding of the neutral, monoprotonated and diprotonated ClQs and ClQOHs to sialic acid to simulate the pH effect on the cellular receptor binding. DFT results reveals that monoprotonated ClQ+ and ClQOH+, which account for more than 66% in the solution, possess high reactivity and binding towards sialic acid. The Neu5Ac-ClQ and the analogues Neu5Ac-ClQOH adducts were stabilized in water than in the gas phase. The molecular complexes stabilize by strong hydrogen bonding and &#960; - &#960; stacking forces. In addition, proton-transfer in Neu5Ac-ClQOH+ provides more stabilizing power and cellular recognition binding forces.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of cases from the national trauma registry was carried out comparing the lockdown period (7th February 2020 to 1st June 2020) to the pre-lockdown period (7th February 2019 to 1st June 2019). Data extracted included the volume of Tier 1 (ISS >15) and Tier 2 (ISS 9-15) cases and epidemiology. Subgroup analysis was performed for Tier 1 patient outcomes. RESULTS: Trauma volume decreased by 19.5% with a 32% drop in Tier 1 cases. Road traffic and workplace accidents decreased by 50% (p<0.01) while interpersonal violence showed an increase of 37.5% (p=0.34). There was an 18.1% decrease in usage of trauma workflows (p=0.01), with an increase in time to intervention for Tier 1 patients from 88 to 124 minutes (p =0.22). Discharge to community facilities decreased from 31.4% to 17.1% (p < 0.05). There was no increase in inpatient mortality, length of stay in critical care, or length of stay overall. CONCLUSION: There was an overall decrease in major trauma cases during the lockdown period, particularly road traffic accidents and worksite injuries and a relative increase in interpersonal violence. Redeployment of manpower and hospital resources may have contributed to decreased usage of trauma workflows and community facilities. In the event of further lockdowns it is necessary to plan for trauma coverage and maintain use of workflows to facilitate early intervention.","output":"Impact of nationwide COVID-19 lockdown on the workload and injury patterns of major trauma cases in a regional trauma centre in Singapore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION DL-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpentanamide (HEPP) and DL-3-hydroxy-3-(4'chlorophenyl)-pentanamide (Cl-HEPP) are phenyl-alcohol-amides that are metabotropic GABAB receptor (MGBR) antagonists and protective against absence seizures. This study aims to further characterize the anticonvulsant profile of these drugs. METHODS HEPP and Cl-HEPP were evaluated in various standardized acute seizure and toxic tests in female Swiss-OF1 mice. RESULTS Toxicities of HEPP and Cl-HEPP were limited; doses up to 30 mg/kg did not result in hypothermia, reduced spontaneous locomotor activity, or failure of the rotarod test, with doses >15 mg/kg potentiating pentobarbital-induced sleep. In maximal electroshock-induced seizures, 20 mg/kg Cl-HEPP protected 100 % of mice; lower doses shortened post-ictal recovery. Seizure protection occurred against subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole and picrotoxin, being limited against N-methyl-d-aspartate. In bicuculline test, clonic or fatal tonic seizures were decreased, onset delayed, and recovery improved; ED50 values (dose protecting 50 % of the animals) were 37.5 and 25 mg/kg for HEPP and Cl-HEPP, respectively. In magnesium deficiency-dependent audiogenic seizures (MDDAS), ED50 values were 3 and 8 mg/kg for Cl-HEPP and HEPP, respectively. The components of MDDAS (latency, wild running, seizure, and recovery phases) in unprotected animals were only minimally affected by near ED50 doses of Cl-HEPP and HEPP. DISCUSSION HEPP and, to a greater extent, Cl-HEPP provide anti-seizure protections in several acute seizure tests in mice at nontoxic doses. These results are consistent with the action of these drugs on diverse molecular targets directly resulting from their MGBR antagonistic properties. However, other mechanisms might occur possibly for the protection given in the MES test. Finally, a similarity in the modulation of MDDAS components between the two phenyl alcohol amides and ethosuximide could also be based on the MGBR antagonistic properties of the former, given the recently re-evaluated therapeutic relevant targets of the latter.","output":"Anticonvulsive profile of two GABAB receptor antagonists on acute seizure mice models."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Wuhan, China The number of cases has been rapidly growing since then Molecular and antigen testing methods are very accurate for the diagnosis of COVID-19 However, with sudden increases of infected cases, laboratory-based molecular test and COVID-19 test kits are in short supply Because the virus affects an infected patient's lung, interpreting images obtained from Computed Tomography Scanners and Chest X-ray Radiography (CXR) machines can be an alternative for diagnosis However CXR interpretation requires experts and the number of experts is limited Therefore, automatic detection of COVID-19 from CXR images is required We describe a system for automatic detection of COVID-19 from CXR images It first segmented images to select only the lung The segmented part was then fed into a multiclass classification module, which worked well with samples obtained from various sources, which had different aspect ratios, contrast and viewpoints The system also handled the unbalanced dataset-only a small fraction of images showed COVID-19 Our system achieved 92% of F1-score and 88 1% Marco F1-score on the 3rd Deep Learning and AI Summer/Winter School Hackathon Phase 3-Multi-class COVID-19 Chest X-ray challenge public leaderboard ? 2020 ACM","output":"An Image Segment-based Classification for Chest X-Ray Image"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A common hallmark of dengue infections is the dysfunction of the vascular endothelium induced by different biological mechanisms.

We evaluated mRNA expression and the levels of endocan protein in vitro following the stimulation of HUVEC and HMEC-1 cell lines with recombinant NS1 proteins. NS1 proteins increase endocan mRNA expression 48 h post-activation in both endothelial cell lines. Endocan mRNA expression levels were higher in HUVEC and HMEC-1 cells stimulated with NS1 proteins than in non-stimulated cells (p < 0.05). A two-fold to three-fold increase in endocan protein release was observed after the stimulation of HUVECs or HMEC-1 cells with NS1 proteins compared with that in non-stimulated cells (p < 0.05). The blockade of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) signaling on HMEC-1 cells with an antagonistic antibody prevented NS1-dependent endocan production.

STUDY DESIGN Data were prospectively collected from 60 consecutive patients with uterine myomas at three institutions. Patients were managed by LESS-M with either traditional suture (the first 30 patients) or barbed suture (the next 30 patients). Operative time, blood loss, and technical difficulty were assessed for each patient. RESULTS Patient characteristics (age, body mass index, other demographic data, number of myomas, and location and size of the largest myoma) were similar between the two study groups. No significant differences in operative complications, failure rate of the intended surgeries, degree of postoperative pain, or hospital stay duration were observed between the two groups. The use of barbed suture significantly reduced the suturing time for treating the uterine wall defects (P=0.014), as well as the total operative time (P=0.027). The use of barbed suture was also associated with less operative blood loss (P=0.040) and less technical difficulty (P=0.001) compared with traditional suture.

However, lessons learnt while dealing with past viral epidemics mandates, simultaneous use of such drugs in combination amongst different populations. Mathematical modelling studies can be extremely helpful in understanding the efficacy of drugs both individually and in combination. The current within-host mathematical model studies the natural history of Covid-19 in terms of complex interplay of virus replication and behaviour of host immune response. Additionally it studies the role of various drugs at various stages of pathogenesis. The model was validated by generating two-parameter heat plots, representing the characteristics of Covid-19, the sensitivity analysis identified the crucial parameters.

Between November 2020 and May 2021, the Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe Network Group started collecting observational data on HIV and COVID-19 co-infections. In total, 16 countries from Central and Eastern European submitted data (eCRF) on 557 HIV-positive patients. The current analyses included patients who had a radiological examination performed. Logistic regression models were used to identify the factors associated with death, ICU admission, and partial recovery (poor COVID-19 outcomes). Factors that were significant in the univariate models (p < 0.1) were included in the multivariate model. Radiological data were available for 224 (40.2%) patients, 108 (48.2%) had computed tomography, and 116 (51.8%) had a chest X-ray. Of these, 211 (94.2%) were diagnosed using RT-PCR tests, 212 (94.6%) were symptomatic, 123 (55.6%) were hospitalized, 37 (16.6%) required oxygen therapy, and 28 (13.1%) either died, were admitted to ICU, or only partially recovered. From the radiologists description, 138 (61.6%) patients had typical radiological changes, 18 (8.0%) atypical changes, and 68 (30.4%) no changes.

Here, we report the infection control measures and early outcomes of patients who received radiotherapy (RT) at a tertiary cancer centre in Wuhan. Methods We reviewed all patients who were treated at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (ZHWU) from Jan 20 to Mar 6, 2020. This preceded the city lock-down date of Jan 23, 2020. Infection control measures were implemented, which included a clinical pathway for managing suspect COVID-19 cases, on-site screening, modifications to the RT facility, and protection of healthcare workers. Primary end-point was infection rate among patients and healthcare staff. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the 5th edition criteria. Findings 209 patients completed RT during the study period.

METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort of consecutive adults evaluated in the emergency department and/or admitted with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across 31 hospitals in four countries (1 February 2020C16 June 2020). The primary outcome was the incidence rate of cerebrovascular events, inclusive of acute ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhages (ICH), and cortical vein and/or sinus thrombosis (CVST). RESULTS: Of the 14,483 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, 172 were diagnosed with an acute cerebrovascular event (1.13% of cohort; 1130/100,000 patients, 95%CI 970C1320/100,000), 68/171 (40.5%) were female and 96/172 (55.8%) were between the ages 60 and 79 years. Of these, 156 had acute ischemic stroke (1.08%; 1080/100,000 95%CI 920C1260/100,000), 28 ICH (0.19%; 190/100,000 95%CI 130C280/100,000), and 3 with CVST (0.02%; 20/100,000, 95%CI 4C60/100,000). The in-hospital mortality rate for SARS-CoV-2-associated stroke was 38.1% and for ICH 58.3%. After adjusting for clustering by site and age, baseline stroke severity, and all predictors of in-hospital mortality found in univariate regression (p < 0.1: male sex, tobacco use, arrival by emergency medical services, lower platelet and lymphocyte counts, and intracranial occlusion), cryptogenic stroke mechanism (aOR 5.01, 95%CI 1.63C15.44, p < 0.01), older age (aOR 1.78, 95%CI 1.07C2.94, p = 0.03), and lower lymphocyte count on admission (aOR 0.58, 95%CI 0.34C0.98, p = 0.04) were the only independent predictors of mortality among patients with stroke and COVID-19.

Viral-laden aerosols generated from oral coughs have been well studied;however, aerosols generated from nasal sneezing has been overlooked. This scenario arises from patients who suffer allergenic rhinosinusitis, or the nasal cavity is irritated, particularly during naso-endoscopy. Nasal sneezing is characterised by an explosive blast of air exiting the nostrils, which can be considered as dual jets, resulting in the spread of viral-laden aerosols remaining suspended in the air. This study used computational fluid dynamics consisting of a hybrid RANS-LES turbulence method to model the airflow and the discrete phase model to track aerosol dispersion during nasal sneezing. The results demonstrated that the exhaled airflow jets during nasal sneezing resemble the flow characteristics of two parallel jets in co-flow. These two jets interfere with each other in the merging zone, and after they merge, the sneeze plume expands radially. The nasal sneeze forms a V-shaped plume with smaller particles in the core region. At the end of the sneeze, when the exhaled jets have lost their initial momentum, the large particle dispersion is dominated by gravity.

A vast variety of didactic concepts, methods and tools came into use, quite often as an ad-hoc solution that coped with a specific need. However, the extreme circumstances of the pandemic left little to no room to reflect in depth on how these different elements integrate into a big picture. As a consequence, all stakeholders involved in the educational process need to gain orientation within these new settings and possibilities, as a prerequisite for taking suitable decisions within their respective scope. To support this need for orientation, we introduce an architectural model that structures didactic concepts, methods and tools into a big picture, which is formulated using the notation of class diagram as known from software and requirements engineering. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Designing an Architecture for Structuring Didactic Concepts, Methods and Tools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple professional groups and societies worldwide have produced airway management guidelines. These are typically targeted at the process of tracheal intubation by a particular provider group in a restricted category of patients and reflect practice preferences in a particular geographical region. The existence of multiple distinct guidelines for some (but not other) closely related circumstances, increases complexity and may obscure the underlying principles that are common to all of them. This has the potential to increase cognitive load; promote the grouping of ideas in silos; impair teamwork; and ultimately compromise patient care. Development of a single set of airway management guidelines that can be applied across and beyond these domains may improve implementation; promote standardisation; and facilitate collaboration between airway practitioners from diverse backgrounds. A global multidisciplinary group of both airway operators and assistants was assembled. Over a 3\\\\year period, a review of the existing airway guidelines and multiple reviews of the primary literature were combined with a structured process for determining expert consensus. Any discrepancies between these were analysed and reconciled. Where evidence in the literature was lacking, recommendations were made by expert consensus. Using the above process, a set of evidence\\\\based airway management guidelines was developed in consultation with airway practitioners from a broad spectrum of disciplines and geographical locations. While consistent with the recommendations of the existing English language guidelines, these universal guidelines also incorporate the most recent concepts in airway management as well as statements on areas not widely addressed by the existing guidelines. The recommendations will be published in four parts that respectively address: airway evaluation; airway strategy; airway rescue and communication of airway outcomes. Together, these universal guidelines will provide a single, comprehensive approach to airway management that can be consistently applied by airway practitioners globally, independent of their clinical background or the circumstances in which airway management occurs.","output":"Project for Universal Management of Airways C part 1: concept and methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To measure the situation of the non-prescription sale of antibiotics and the service quality of community pharmacies in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: A simulated client method was conducted to estimate the non-prescription sale of antibiotics and service quality based on scenarios about adult acute upper respiratory tract infection in 2019. A total of 595 community pharmacies from 11 districts were investigated in Guangzhou, China. We used binary logistic regression to evaluate the factors associated with the non-prescription sale of antibiotics. RESULTS: The proportion of non-prescription dispensing of antibiotics was 63.1% in Guangzhou, China, with a higher incidence of antibiotic dispensing without prescription in outer districts (69.3%). Cephalosporin (44.1%) and Amoxicillin (39.0%) were sold more often than other antibiotics. Chain pharmacies had better performance on the prescription sale of antibiotics and service quality. Traditional Chinese medicine was commonly recommended by pharmacy staff. CONCLUSION: Since the non-prescription sale of antibiotics is prevalent in Guangzhou, effective solutions should be determined.

Cancer and its treatment affect many haematological and biochemical parameters, therefore we analysed these prior to and during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and correlated them with outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with cancer testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in centres throughout the United Kingdom were identified and entered into a database following local governance approval. Clinical and longitudinal laboratory data were extracted from patient records. Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, logistic regression, or linear regression for outcomes. Hierarchical clustering of heatmaps was performed using Ward's method. RESULTS: In total, 302 patients were included in three cohorts: Manchester (n = 67), Liverpool (n = 62), and UK (n = 173). In the entire cohort (N = 302), median age was 69 (range 19-93 years), including 163 males and 139 females; of these, 216 were diagnosed with a solid tumour and 86 with a haematological cancer. Preinfection lymphopaenia, neutropaenia and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were not associated with oxygen requirement (O2) or death. Lymphocyte count (P < 0.001), platelet count (P = 0.03), LDH (P < 0.0001) and albumin (P < 0.0001) significantly changed from preinfection to during infection. High rather than low neutrophils at day 0 (P = 0.007), higher maximal neutrophils during COVID-19 (P = 0.026) and higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; P = 0.01) were associated with death. In multivariable analysis, age (P = 0.002), haematological cancer (P = 0.034), C-reactive protein (P = 0.004), NLR (P = 0.036) and albumin (P = 0.02) at day 0 were significant predictors of death. In the Manchester/Liverpool cohort 30 patients have restarted therapy following COVID-19, with no additional complications requiring readmission. CONCLUSION: Preinfection biochemical/haematological parameters were not associated with worse outcome in cancer patients. Restarting treatment following COVID-19 was not associated with additional complications. Neutropaenia due to cancer/treatment is not associated with COVID-19 mortality. Cancer therapy, particularly in patients with solid tumours, need not be delayed or omitted due to concerns that treatment itself increases COVID-19 severity.","output":"Longitudinal characterisation of haematological and biochemical parameters in cancer patients prior to and during COVID-19 reveals features associated with outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A newly emerged strain of SARS-CoV-2 of B.1.1.7 lineage has caused a significant surge in the SARS-CoV-2 infections in the UK. In this study, changes in the epitopes of spike and orf8 proteins in SARS-CoV-2 of B.1.1.7 lineage were investigated. Genomic alignment of the SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7 with SARS-CoV-2/Wuhan showed the presence of several mutations in orf1a/b, spike, orf8, and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7. Molecular models of spike and orf8 proteins were constructed by homology modeling. Superimposition between the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2/Wuhan and SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7 showed noticeable variations in the spatial orientation in Val70-Asn74 and Thr250-Ser255 regions. This may have also resulted in the extension of the epitopic region at Ser244-Gly249 in the SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7 spike protein. Superimposition of the SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7 spike protein over Fab-spike protein complexes of SARS-CoV-2/Wuhan also showed subtle variations in the antibody binding affinity targeting the N-terminal domain of the spike protein. Epitopic variations were also observed between the corresponding orf8 regions of SARS-CoV-2/Wuhan and SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7. Moreover, the presence of a stop codon at position 27 in orf8 connotes the emergence of two frames (orf8a and orf8b) in SARS-CoV-2, which further hampers its extracellular secretion, and in turn, immunogenicity.

Therefore, the objectives of the study are; 1) to explore the changes in self-reported individual's mobility behaviortrip frequencies by mode and by purpose in three COVID-19 severity periods; 2) to quantify the effects of respondents' personal (i.e., age, gender, education, and living place), and perceived details (i.e., safety perceptions, the COVID-19 threat perceptions) on the change in mobility behavior in the COVID-19 severity change; 3) to analyze the willingness to use public transportation in the post-pandemic period. Methods: A web-based questionnaire survey was conducted from September 2020 to November 2020, resulting in 565 responses. Descriptive analysis, random parameter bivariate probit modeling, and structural equation modeling are adopted to achieve the objectives. Results: The results reflect the change in individuals' mobility behavior in three severity periods of COVID-19, including before outbreak, during the most serious period, and after the most serious period. A substantial reduction in individuals' mobility was observed during the most serious period, which is recovering back to normal.

We examined less-than-weekly contact by mode for those in residential care settings and community residents with and without limitations. We estimated multinomial logit models to examine predictors of change to less-than-weekly contact (vs. maintaining weekly-or-more contact) by mode, overall and stratified by setting. RESULTS: Weekly in-person contact fell substantially (from 61% to 39%) and more so in residential care (56% to 22%), where nearly four in ten transitioned to less-than-weekly in-person contact (doubling to 8 out of 10). Weekly-or-more contact was largely stable for electronic and telephone modes across settings. Weekly-or-more video contact increased mainly for community residents without limitations.

As our service has grown rapidly, we identified need for managing complex cases in a different way. To avoid admissions yet allow our team to consider each case in depth and carefully monitor patients remotely over time. We undertook a service redesign project to optimise management of our complex high risk patients through a weekly virtual ward round. This was chaired by the Rheumatology CNS with attendance from Clinical Fellows and Consultants. Consequently, we were able to avoid loss to follow up and potential undesirable events including admissions to local hospitals, loss of schooling or parental work absence. Here we describe the process and value of the virtual ward round.ObjectivesActive monitoring of high risk, high need complex patientsReduce admission ratesRemotely manage/avoid unnecessary appointmentsReduce unnecessary GP contactsMethodsRetrospective reviews of the weekly minutes with both qualitative and quantitative data collected. The CNS team generated a list of patients with clinical or social concerns, complex disease, frequent contact, upcoming transition, regular infusions and inpatients. Patients were divided into three categories;red, amber and green to highlight the concern level. Patients moved between groups as required and were taken off the list once concerns were dealt with.ResultsAn average of 58 patients were listed each week from a database of 791 and 16 decisions made on average. Discussions focussed on areas of concern therefore not all patients were discussed at each meeting. These decisions included new requests for day unit treatment/assessment, medication changes, changing appointments, referral to other specialties and whether patients can be removed from the list. There were no unexpected outpatients admitted. Patient conditions included Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Juvenile Dermatomyositis, Vasculitis, Scleroderma and Mixed Connective Tissue Disease with decisions leading to involvement from our colleagues in the dermatology and renal departments for many. A significant proportion of patients were added to the list due to social concerns or poor engagement.ConclusionsThis project identified the high level of productivity possible by continuing a weekly virtual ward round during a very difficult year. It is a reliable and resilient method for the team to keep track of a complex patient cohort. Data collection also highlighted the valuable learning for individuals and the team as a whole by sharing knowledge, discussing treatment plans and problem solving difficult cases. Limitations to this project include limited prospective data collection for contemporaneous analysis and the use of very basic computer systems to record outcomes. Going forward we plan to develop this meeting with the potential to upscale and use similar formats for other patient groups. It would also be important to assess technology options available to assist more detailed documentation and analysis of the outcomes.

We evaluated the health and economic impact of different age-based vaccine prioritisation strategies across this demographically and socio-economically diverse region. MethodsWe fitted country-specific age-stratified compartmental transmission models to reported COVID-19 mortality in the WHO European Region to inform the immunity level before vaccine roll-out. Building upon broad recommendations from the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE), we examined four strategies that prioritise: all adults (V+), younger (20-59 year-olds) followed by older adults (60+) (V20), older followed by younger adults (V60), and the oldest adults (75+) (V75) followed by incremental expansion to successively younger five-year age groups. We explored four roll-out scenarios based on projections or recent observations (R1-4) - the slowest scenario (R1) covers 30% of the total population by December 2022 and the fastest (R4) 80% by December 2021. Five decision-making metrics were summarised over 2021-22: mortality, morbidity, and losses in comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy (cLE), comorbidity- and quality-adjusted life years (cQALY), and the value of human capital (HC). Six sets of infection-blocking and disease-reducing vaccine efficacies were considered. FindingsThe optimal age-based vaccine prioritisation strategies were sensitive to country characteristics, decision-making metrics and roll-out speeds. Overall, V60 consistently performed better than or comparably to V75. There were greater benefits in prioritising older adults when roll-out is slow and when VE is low. Under faster roll-out, V+ was the most desirable option. InterpretationA prioritisation strategy involving more age-based stages (V75) does not necessarily lead to better health and economic outcomes than targeting broad age groups (V60). Countries expecting a slow vaccine roll-out may particularly benefit from prioritising older adults. FundingWorld Health Organization, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom), the National Institute of Health Research (United Kingdom), the European Commission, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (United Kingdom), Wellcome Trust Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed and medRxiv for articles published in English from inception to 9 Jun 2021, with the search terms: (\\"COVID-19\\" OR \\"SARS-CoV-2\\") AND (\\"priorit*) AND (\\"model*\\") AND (\\"vaccin*\\") and identified 66 studies on vaccine prioritization strategies. Of the 25 studies that compared two or more age-based prioritisation strategies, 12 found that targeting younger adults minimised infections while targeting older adults minimised mortality; an additional handful of studies found similar outcomes between different age-based prioritisation strategies where large outbreaks had already occurred. However, only two studies have explored age-based vaccine prioritisation using models calibrated to observed outbreaks in more than one country, and no study has explored the effectiveness of vaccine prioritisation strategies across settings with different population structures, contact patterns, and outbreak history. Added-value of this studyWe evaluated various age-based vaccine prioritisation strategies for 38 countries in the WHO European Region using various health and economic outcomes for decision-making, by parameterising models using observed outbreak history, known epidemiologic and vaccine characteristics, and a range of realistic vaccine roll-out scenarios. We showed that while targeting older adults was generally advantageous, broadly targeting everyone above 60 years might perform better than or comparably to a more detailed strategy that targeted the oldest age group above 75 years followed by those in the next younger five-year age band. Rapid vaccine roll-out has only been observed in a small number of countries. If vaccine coverage can reach 80% by the end of 2021, prioritising older adults may not be optimal in terms of health and economic impact. Lower vaccine efficacy was associated with greater relative benefits only under relatively slow roll-out scenarios considered. Implication of all the available evidenceCOVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies that require more precise targeting of individuals of a specific and narrow age range may not necessarily lead to better outcomes compared to strategies that prioritise populations across broader age ranges. In the WHO European Region, prioritising all adults equally or younger adults first will only optimise health and economic impact when roll-out is rapid, which may raise between-country equity issues given the global demand for COVID-19 vaccines.","output":"Optimising health and economic impacts of COVID-19 vaccine prioritisation strategies in the WHO European Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To systematically review and meta-analyze the validity of electrical bioimpedance-based noninvasive cardiac output monitoring in pediatrics compared with standard methods such as thermodilution and echocardiography. DATA SOURCES Systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE (2000-2019). STUDY SELECTION Method-comparison studies of transthoracic electrical velocimetry or whole body electrical bioimpedance versus standard cardiac output monitoring methods in children (0-18 yr old) were included. DATA EXTRACTION Two reviewers independently performed study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. Mean differences of cardiac output, stroke volume, or cardiac index measurements were pooled using a random-effects model (R Core Team, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, 2019). Bland-Altman statistics assessing agreement between devices and author conclusions about inferiority/noninferiority were extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS Twenty-nine of 649 identified studies were included in the qualitative analysis, and 25 studies in the meta-analyses. No significant difference was found between means of cardiac output, stroke volume, and cardiac index measurements, except in exclusively neonatal/infant studies reporting stroke volume (mean difference, 1.00 mL; 95% CI, 0.23-1.77). Median percentage error in child/adolescent studies approached acceptability (percentage error less than or equal to 30%) for cardiac output in L/min (31%; range, 13-158%) and stroke volume in mL (26%; range, 14-27%), but not in neonatal/infant studies (45%; range, 29-53% and 45%; range, 28-70%, respectively). Twenty of 29 studies concluded that transthoracic electrical velocimetry/whole body electrical bioimpedance was noninferior. Transthoracic electrical velocimetry was considered inferior in six of nine studies with heterogeneous congenital heart disease populations. CONCLUSIONS The meta-analyses demonstrated no significant difference between means of compared devices (except in neonatal stroke volume studies). The wide range of percentage error reported may be due to heterogeneity of study designs, devices, and populations included. Transthoracic electrical velocimetry/whole body electrical bioimpedance may be acceptable for use in child/adolescent populations, but validity in neonates and congenital heart disease patients remains uncertain.

Results: 15 interviews were completed with adults (ten with patients, five with non-patient parents/other family members). Emergent themes were: Establishing comfort, Allaying parent apprehension, Coaching and reassurance, Value added, Integration, Impact of Covid-19, and Areas for development. In three interviews with children, the emergent themes were: Building rapport, Developmentally appropriate approaches, Understanding and managing emotions, Improving communication, and Areas for development. The first focus group included the CLS and two clinical leads of the psychosocial support team. Emergent themes from this discussion were: Promotion of the program, Accessibility, Role of social work, Impact of Covid-19, and Adopting a virtual approach. The second focus group consisted of three inpatient social workers, and the emergent themes were: Expertise, Accessibility, Allaying parent apprehension, Value added, Impact of Covid-19, and Areas for development. Synthesis of data identified five overall key themes: Awareness, Integration, Value added, Family-centered care, and Impact of Covid-19. Conclusions: This study conducted qualitative analysis of 360-degree feedback on the CLS pilot program. The analysis demonstrated that program was felt to add value, integrate well with current systems, and represent high-quality, family-centered care. This pilot occurred during the Covid-19 pandemic, the impacts of which were represented in this study.","output":"Feasibility of a child life specialist program for oncology patients with minor children at home: Qualitative analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study were to derive Maine Coon haematological and biochemical reference intervals (RIs) from adult healthy blood donors, to validate (or reject) the use of published RIs for the general feline population in this breed, and to evaluate the effects of age, sex and weight on the haematological and biochemical results. METHODS Haematological and biochemical data were retrieved retrospectively from a database of 81 healthy adult Maine Coon cat blood donors and were analysed to generate normal RIs. RIs were determined and compared with established non-breed-specific feline RIs according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines and the American Society of Veterinary Clinical Pathology guidelines using Reference Value-Advisor (version 2.1) software. RESULTS The age of the cats ranged from 1-8 years (mean 4.4 years), 42 were female and 39 were male, and weights ranged from 4.9-8.5 kg (mean 6.7 kg). New Maine Coon RIs were proposed for red blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, reticulocyte count and percentage. Haematocrit was higher in male cats (mean HCT 42.9% vs 41% in females; P = 0.001) and in heavier cats (P = 0.003; slope 1.0, regression equation HCT = 35.1 + 1.0  weight). New biochemical RIs were proposed for urea, aspartate aminotransferase, -glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, total protein and albumin in Maine Coons. Females had higher GGT (median GGT value in females 4.0 vs 3.0 in males; P = 0.011) and albumin values (mean albumin value 3.3 in females vs 3.1 in males; P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Currently published RIs for some haematological and biochemical parameters are not appropriate for use in adult Maine Coon cats. A breed-specific variation could be a plausible explanation for the new haematological and serum biochemical analytes proposed in this study. Breed-specific RIs for Maine Coon cats will help prevent misinterpretation of laboratory results in diagnosis and in the selection of ideal blood donors.","output":"Haematological and biochemical reference intervals in adult Maine Coon cat blood donors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There have been several reports on why the clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pediatric patients is milder than in adults.

METHODS: Participants were consented to answer a physician-administered questionnaire following Ramadan 2020. Impact of COVID-19 on the decision of fasting, intentions to fast and duration of Ramadan and Shawal fasting, hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia events were assessed. Specific analysis comparing age categories of <65 years and &#8805;65 years were performed. RESULTS: Among the 5865 participants, 22.5% were &#8805;65 years old. Concern for COVID-19 affected fasting decision for 7.6% (&#8805;65 years) vs 5.4% (<65 years). More participants &#8805;65 years old did not fast (28.8% vs 12.7%, <65 years). Of the 83.6%, participants fulfilling Ramadan-fasting, 94.8% fasted &#8805;15 days and 12.6% had to break fast due to diabetes-related illness. The average number of days fasting within and post-Ramadan were 27 and 6 days respectively, regardless of age. Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia occurred in 15.7% and 16.3% of participants respectively, with 6.5% and 7.4% requiring hospital care respectively. SMBG was performed in 73.8% of participants and 43.5% received Ramadan-focused education. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, universally high rates of Ramadan-fasting were observed regardless of fasting risk level.

We aimed to identify the association between multiple respiratory viral infections and PICU admission among infants with bronchiolitis. METHODS: We performed a 1:1 case-control study enrolling previously healthy full-term infants (12 months) with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU as cases and those to the general pediatric ward as controls from 2015 to 2017. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for detection of the respiratory viruses. We summarized the characteristics of infants admitted to the PICU and the general pediatric unit. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to fit the association between multiple respiratory viral infections (2 strains) and PICU admission. RESULTS: A total of 135 infants admitted to the PICU were compared with 135 randomly selected control infants admitted to the general pediatric unit. The PICU patients were younger (median: 2.2 months, interquartile range: 1.3C4.2) than the general ward patients (median: 3.2 months, interquartile range: 1.6C6.4). Respiratory syncytial virus (74.1%), rhinovirus (28.9%), and coronavirus (5.9%) were the most common viruses for bronchiolitis requiring PICU admission. Patients with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU tended to have multiple viral infections compared with patients on the general ward (23.0% vs. 10.4%, P < 0.001). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, bronchiolitis with multiple viral infections was associated with higher odds of PICU admission (adjusted odds ratio: 2.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.17C5.57, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Infants with multiviral bronchiolitis have higher odds of PICU admission compared with those with a single or nondetectable viral infection.","output":"Association between multiple respiratory viral infections and pediatric intensive care unit admission among infants with bronchiolitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ίԱ͹״ףCOVID-19Ⱥ֯רƶ6ƷƼͺΣͻʹҩעĻҽҩۣٴҩĽǶȷ˵淽Ƽҩעص㣬ΪCOVID-19ͺΣͲѪΪ߶ʢ±֤֤ͬʱ֣߶շ֤ʹϲƽעҺӪ֤ʹ̵עҺȶעҺΣڱ֤ʹòθעҺעҺעҺѣպ衢ţԾעҺϺãʹòθעҺʹעҺʹԾעҺѪ֤ͺΣ͵ĹвӦѡѪؾעҺȸ΢ѭ֤֯ٳֹΪ忹ǱܣضŤתƵ춨.","output":"[Thinking on Clinical rational use of TCM injection in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19)]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on patients with Covid-19 has been unclear.

Here, we report the design of a recombinant multi-epitope vaccine against the four proteins spike or crown (S), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and envelope (E) of SARS-CoV-2 using immunoinformatics tools. We evaluated the most antigenic epitopes that bind to HLA class 1 subtypes, along with HLA class 2, as well as B cell epitopes. Beta-defensin 3 and PADRE sequence were used as adjuvants in the structure of the vaccine. KK, GPGPG, and AAY linkers were used to fuse the selected epitopes. The nucleotide sequence was cloned into pET26b(+) vector using restriction enzymes XhoI and NdeI, and HisTag sequence was considered in the C-terminal of the construct. The results showed that the proposed candidate vaccine is a 70.87 kDa protein with high antigenicity and immunogenicity as well as non-allergenic and non-toxic.

The case is similar in Ethiopia in which severe acute malnutrition is the major contributor to mortality being an underlying cause for nearly 45% of under-five deaths. However, there is no recent evidence that shows the time to death and public health importance of oxygen saturation and chest in drawing in the study area. Therefore, estimated time to death and its predictors can provide an input for program planners and decision-makers. METHODS A facility -based retrospective cohort study was conducted among 488 severe acute malnourished under-five children admitted from the 1st of January 2016 to the 30th of December 2019. The study participants were selected by using simple random sampling technique. Data were entered in to Epi-Data version 3.1 and exported to STATA version15 statistical software for further analysis. The Kaplan Meier was used to estimate cumulative survival probability and a log-rank test was used to compare the survival time between different categories of explanatory variables. The Cox-proportional hazard regression model was fitted to identify predictors of mortality. P-value< 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. RESULTS Out of the total 488 randomly selected charts of children with severe acute malnutrition, 476 records were included in the final analysis. A total of 54(11.34%) children died with an incidence rate of 9.1death /1000 person- days. Failed appetite test (AHR: 2.4; 95%CI: 1.26, 4.67), altered consciousness level at admission (AHR: 2.4; 95%CI: 1.08, 4.67), oxygen saturation below 90% (AHR: 3.3; 95%CI: 1.40, 7.87), edema (AHR 2.9; 95%CI: 1.45, 5.66) and HIV infection (AHR: 2.8; 95%CI: 1.24, 6.36) were predictors of mortality for children diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition. CONCLUSION The overall survival status of severe acute malnourished children was low as compared to national sphere standards and previous reports in the literature. The major predictors of mortality were oxygen saturation below 90%, altered consciousness, HIV infection, edema and failed appetite test. Therefore, early screening of complications, close follow up and regular monitoring of sever acute malnourished children might improve child survival rate.","output":"Survival and predictors of mortality among severe acute malnourished under-five children admitted at Felege-Hiwot comprehensive specialized hospital, northwest, Ethiopia: a retrospective cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fluorinated compounds are widely used in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials.

METHODS: Databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, Chinese Knowledge Resource Integrated Database and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry were searched on 20 March 2020. RESULTS: In total, 135 studies were included, involving severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, coronavirus disease 2019 and other coronaviruses. Most were case reports, case series and cohort studies of poor to fair quality. In post-mortem examinations of subjects who died from infection, around half had virus identified in heart tissues in severe acute respiratory syndrome, but none in Middle East respiratory syndrome and coronavirus disease 2019. Cardiac manifestations reported include tachycardia, bradycardia, arrhythmias, and myocardial injury, secondary to both systemic infection and treatment. Cardiac injury and arrhythmias are more prevalent in coronavirus disease 2019, and elevated cardiac markers are associated with intensive care unit admission and death. In severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and coronavirus disease 2019, comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease are associated with intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality. There were cases of misdiagnosis due to overlapping presentations of cardiovascular diseases and coronavirus infections, leading to hospital spread and delayed management of life-threatening conditions.

The aims of this study were to: (i) determine the independent contributions of body mass, force production capabilities and tendon dimensions to tendon stiffness during childhood; and (ii) descriptively document age-related changes in tendon mechanical properties and dimensions. Achilles tendon mechanical and material properties were determined in 52 children (5-12 years) and 19 adults. Tendon stiffness and Young's modulus (YM) were calculated as the slopes of the force-elongation and stress-strain curves, respectively. Relationships between stiffness vs. age, mass and force, and between YM vs. age, mass and stress were determined by means of polynomial fits and multiple regression analyses. Mass was found to be the best predictor of stiffness, whilst stress was best related to YM (< 75 and 51% explained variance, respectively). Combined, mass and force accounted for up to 78% of stiffness variation. Up to 61% of YM variability could be explained using a combination of mass, stress and age. These results demonstrate that age-related increases in tendon stiffness are largely attributable to increased tendon loading from weight-bearing tasks and increased plantarflexor force production, as well as tendon growth. Moreover, our results suggest that chronic increases in tendon loading during childhood result in microstructural changes which increase the tendon's YM. Regarding the second aim, peak stress increased from childhood to adulthood due to greater increases in strength than tendon cross-sectional area. Peak strain remained constant as a result of parallel increases in tendon length and peak elongation. The differences in Achilles tendon properties found between adults and children are likely to influence force production, and ultimately movement characteristics, which should be explicitly examined in future research.","output":"Age-related changes in mechanical properties of the Achilles tendon."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a rare case of a laparoscopic splenectomy performed for a carcinoid metastasis.

Results The surgical energy devices used were LigaSure? in the first 4 cases, Acrosurg?. Scissors S17 in the next 13 cases, and Acrosurg?. Revo S15 in the latest 7 cases. The operation time (range: 72-250 min; mean: 147 min), intraoperative blood loss (range: 5-370 mL; mean: 33 mL), indwelling time of wound drain (range: 2-6 days; mean: 3.5 days), and hospitalization period (range: 3-8 days; mean: 5.5 days) were within acceptable ranges. In this study, it is suggested that Acrosurg?. Revo S15 can shorten the indwelling time and the hospitalization period. There were no serious complications, but 1 patient developed transient vocal cord paralysis, which improved 3 months after surgery. It was suggested that the microwave energy devices, Acrosurg?. Scissors S17 and Acrosurg?. Revo S15, may be more effective with respect to sealing/hemostasis/coagulation capacity and controllability than the high-frequency electrosurgical device, LigaSure?. Conclusion Based on this initial experience, VAT using surgical energy devices appeared to be a safe, effective, and minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of thyroid/parathyroid tumors. Further studies confirming these early findings are needed.","output":"Video-Assisted Thyroidectomy Using a Surgical Energy Device: Initial Experience in a Japanese Single-Center Cohort."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"California's diverse population provides a natural laboratory for understanding how diseases and conditions interact within different racial/ethnic groups.

We developed two different fabrication/conditioning procedures and produced fibrin-based constructs embedding cells from the ovine umbilical cord artery according to the two different approaches. Tissue formation was confirmed by histology and immunohistology. The design of the tube-in-tube foresees the possibility of using a textile coscaffold (here demonstrated with a warp-knitted mesh) to achieve enhanced mechanical properties in vision of implantation in the aortic position.

Migrants are overrepresented in COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed cases, hospital admissions, intensive care treatment and death statistics in all countries with available data. A syndemic approach has been suggested to understand the excess burden in vulnerable populations. However, this has not stopped the unequal burden of disease in Norway. Initially, the disease was mainly imported by Norwegians returning from skiing holidays in the Alps, and the prevalence of infection among migrants in Norway, defined as people born abroad to foreign parents, was low. Later, confirmed cases in migrants increased and have remained stable at 35-50% - more than twice the proportion of the migrant population (15%). To change this pattern, we need to understand the complex mechanisms underlying inequities in health and their relative and multiplying impacts on disease inequalities and to test the effect of counterfactual policies in order to reduce inequalities in disease burden. Yet, the current paradigm in the field of migration and health research, that is, the theories, research methods and explanatory models commonly applied, fail to fully understand the differences in health outcomes between international migrants and the host population.

RECENT FINDINGS: Most thoracic surgery is performed under general endotracheal anesthesia with either a double lumen endotracheal tube or a bronchial blocker. In an attempt to lessen the incidence and severity of postoperative complications, the nonintubated video-assisted thoracoscopic technique was developed, where the surgical procedure is performed under regional anesthesia with sedation. Currently, this technique is recommended for the elderly and in patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease who are at increased risk of complications after general anesthesia. It is the role of the anesthesia team to assist in the decisions whether the patient is a candidate and which block should be performed and to carefully monitor these patients in the operating room. SUMMARY: Nonintubated video-assisted thoracic surgery is an emerging technique with the goal of reducing postoperative complications. The anesthetic technique is highly variable and ranges from general anesthesia with a laryngeal mask airway with a truncal block to thoracic epidural anesthesia with minimal to no block. It is important to have excellent communication with the surgical team and the patient to ensure a safe, successful procedure.","output":"The Anesthetic Management of Patients Undergoing Nonintubated Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systemic lupus erythematosus is a complex multi-system disease affecting various systems of the body.

We included COVID-19 patients who underwent surgery in nine centres of the Province of Qubec, the Canadian province most afflicted by the pandemic. We also included suspected COVID-19 (subsequently confirmed not to have COVID-19) patients and patients who had recovered from it. We collected data on baseline characteristics, postoperative complications and overall surgical activities performed in participating centres. Our primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Results: We included 44 COVID-19 patients, 18 suspected patients, and 18 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 at time of surgery. Among the 44 COVID-19 patients, 31 surgeries (71%) were urgent and 16 (36%) were major. In these patients, pulmonary complications were frequent (25%) and 30-day mortality was 15.9%. This mortality was higher in patients with symptoms (23.1%) compared to those without symptoms (5.6%), although not statistically significant (p = 0.118).

COVID-19 displays certain radiological patterns easily detectable by X-rays of the chest. Therefore, radiologists can investigate these patterns for detecting coronavirus disease. However, this task is time-consuming and needs lots of trial and error. One of the main solutions to resolve this issue is to apply intelligent techniques such as deep learning (DL) models to automatically analyze the chest X-rays. Nevertheless, fine-tuning of architecture and hyperparameters of DL models is a complex and time-consuming procedure. In this paper, we propose an effective method to detect COVID-19 disease by applying convolutional neural network (CNN) to the chest X-ray images. To improve the accuracy of the proposed method, the last Softmax CNN layer is replaced with a [Formula: see text]-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier which takes into account the agreement of the neighborhood labeling. Moreover, we develop a novel evolutionary algorithm by improving the basic version of competitive swarm optimizer. To this end, three powerful evolutionary operators: Cauchy Mutation (CM), Evolutionary Boundary Constraint Handling (EBCH), and tent chaotic map are incorporated into the search process of the proposed evolutionary algorithm to speed up its convergence and make an excellent balance between exploration and exploitation phases. Then, the proposed evolutionary algorithm is used to automatically achieve the optimal values of CNNs hyperparameters leading to a significant improvement in the classification accuracy of the proposed method.

Patients admitted in ICU with an acute COVID event present with respiratory dysfunction and are more likely to have critical illness myopathy and neuropathy (CIMN). Physiotherapy services being integral part of non-pharmacological management of any ICU was implemented for patients with COVID 19; a novel viral disease. Objective This retrospective study was undertaken to explore the physiotherapy practices that could be implemented in patients admitted with COVID 19 in the ICU and its effect on mobility and oxygen requirement as an outcome. Methodology Following ethical permission of institute, the data was extracted from electronic data record sheet in which daily parameters for physiotherapy intervention were recorded. Data from a single ICU and step down unit (SDU) from 5th June to 5th July 2020 was analysed. Records of patients diagnosed with COVID 19 and admitted in ICU or SDU were studied. Those in the age group of 18 to 90 years, of either gender were included. Demographic characteristics, disease severity, oxygen requirement, mobility status, physiotherapy intervention were studied. Results 278 record sheets (110 ICU and 168 SDU) were retrospectively analysed for demographics. 44.55% of patients improved with side lying position, 37.27% with prone position and 10.91% with quarter prone position. 4.55% of patient maintained oxygenation in propped up sitting. 2.73% could not be positioned. Chest physiotherapy techniques applied were deep breathing, ACBT, paced breathing and diaphragmatic breathing. Deep intercostal pressure on NIV along with vibrations was given to 12.72% of patients in the ICU. Group therapy sessions were conducted in SDU where 50.59% patients participated.

Little is known about its clinicopathological features, prognosis and potential therapeutic strategies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) on patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the breast. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients diagnosed with PSCCB in our center. All pathological slides were reviewed by an experienced pathologist to confirm the diagnosis. Furthermore, we searched the public database for patients with SCC of the breast. Then, we analyzed the clinicopathological features, treatment methods and patient outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 14 patients with primary SCC of the breast in our center. Additionally, 739 patients with SCC of the breast from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database were diagnosed between 1975 and 2016. Only 453 patients who underwent surgery were included in this study. Patients from the SEER database had a more advanced tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage than patients from our center. The median overall survival (OS) of all patients was 104 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 87.2-120.8 months), and the 5-year OS was 60.8% (95% CI, 56.1%-65.5%). Most of the patients (58%) tested negative for hormonal receptor expression. Multivariate analysis showed that PORT was an independent prognostic factor for OS. CONCLUSION: The results of our study demonstrate that SCC of the breast presents aggressive behavior with unique clinical characteristics. PORT improved OS significantly in patients with SCC of the breast. Longer-term studies are needed to confirm our findings.","output":"Postoperative radiotherapy improves overall survival in patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals and in those who had a prior infection have been observed globally, but the transmission potential of these infections is unknown. The RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) value is inversely correlated with viral load and culturable virus. Here, we investigated differences in RT-qPCR Ct values across Qatars national cohorts of primary infections, reinfections, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) breakthrough infections, and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) breakthrough infections. Through matched-cohort analyses of the randomly diagnosed infections, the mean Ct value was higher in all cohorts of breakthrough infections compared to the cohort of primary infections in unvaccinated individuals. The Ct value was 1.3 (95% CI: 0.9-1.8) cycles higher for BNT162b2 breakthrough infections, 3.2 (95% CI: 1.8-4.5) cycles higher for mRNA-1273 breakthrough infections, and 4.0 (95% CI: 3.4-4.6) cycles higher for reinfections in unvaccinated individuals. Assuming a linear relationship between viral load and infectiousness, these differences imply that breakthrough infections are at least 50% less infectious than primary infections in unvaccinated individuals.

Ventilator-associated event (VAE), a more objective definition, has replaced traditional VAP surveillance and is now widely used in the USA. However, the adoption outside the USA is limited. This study aims to describe the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of VAEs in China, based on a prospectively maintained registry. METHODS: An observational study was conducted using an ICU-HAI registry in west China. Patients that were admitted to ICUs and underwent mechanical ventilation (MV) between April 1, 2015, and December 31, 2018, were included. The characteristics and outcomes were compared between patients with and without VAEs. The rates of all VAEs dependent on different ICUs were calculated, and the pathogen distribution of patients with possible VAP (PVAP) was described. RESULTS: A total of 20,769 ICU patients received MV, accounting for 21,723 episodes of mechanical ventilators and 112,697 ventilator-days. In all, we identified 1882 episodes of ventilator-associated condition (VAC) events (16.7 per 1000 ventilator-days), 721 episodes of infection-related ventilator-associated complications (IVAC) events (6.4 per 1000 ventilator-days), and 185 episodes of PVAP events (1.64 per 1000 ventilator-days). The rates of VAC varied across ICUs with the highest incidence in surgical ICUs (23.72 per 1000 ventilator-days). The median time from the start of ventilation to the onset of the first VAC, IVAC, and PVAP was 5 (3C8), 5 (3C9), and 6 (4C13) days, respectively. The median length of hospital stays was 28.00 (17.00C43.00), 30.00 (19.00C44.00), and 30.00 (21.00C46.00) days for the three VAE tiers, which were all longer than that of patients without VAEs (16.00 [12.00C23.00]). The hospital mortality among patients with VAEs was more than three times of those with non-VAEs. CONCLUSIONS: VAE was common in ICU patients with  4 ventilator days. All tiers of VAEs were highly correlated with poor clinical outcomes, including longer ICU and hospital stays and increased risk of mortality. These findings highlight the importance of VAE surveillance and the development of new strategies to prevent VAEs.","output":"The epidemiology and clinical outcomes of ventilator-associated events among 20,769 mechanically ventilated patients at intensive care units: an observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency (PHE), most wound/ulcer management professionals, providers, and patients had never participated in evaluation and management services via telehealth and/or telephone In fact, Medicare regulations restricted the geographic locations of the originating sites of telehealth, as well as the distant site practitioners who could provide telehealth services Most important, telehealth services were not covered for most patients in their homes Communication Technology-Based Services (CTBS) can be incorporated into the practices of physicians, qualified healthcare professionals (QHPs), and qualified nonphysician healthcare professionals CTBS can help the patients transition away from telehealth and can provide the physicians, QHPs, and qualified nonphysician healthcare professionals with paid digital communication opportunities now and after the COVID-19 PHE","output":"Now Is the Time to Teach Patients to Use Communication Technology-Based Services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of review: Poor outcomes in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have been attributed to superadded bacterial coinfections.The World Health Organization has reported overzealous usage of broad-spectrum antibiotics during this current pandemic raising concerns of increasing antimicrobial resistance?

Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocyte population in human hosts and reach markedly high numbers during severe COVID-19. However, a detailed examination of their responses has been largely overlooked in the COVID-19 literature to date. Here, we report for the first time a dedicated study of neutrophil responses using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) of fresh leukocytes from 11 hospitalized adult patients with mild and severe COVID-19 disease and 5 healthy controls. We observed that neutrophils display a pronounced inflammatory profile, with dramatic disruption of predicted cell-cell interactions as the severity of the disease increases. We also identified unique mature and immature neutrophil subpopulations based on transcriptomic profiling, including an antiviral phenotype, and changes in the proportion of each population linked to the severity of the disease. Finally, pathway analysis revealed increased markers of oxidative phosphorylation and ribosomal genes, along with downregulation of many antiviral and host defense pathway genes during severe disease compared to mild infections. Collectively, our findings indicate that neutrophils are capable of mounting effective antiviral defenses but adopt a form of immune dysregulation characterized by excess cellular stress, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19.","output":"ScRNA-Seq study of neutrophils reveals vast heterogeneity and breadth of inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Detection of elliptical features is a challenging and important task in computer vision.

Some non-ideal ellipses cause also difficulties for detection such as occlusion, appearance of multiple ellipses at same time and non-parallel ellipse. In this paper, we are interested in detecting elliptical traffic signs. We present a method for detecting different cases of ellipses: simple, partially occluded, non-parallel, multiple ellipses in images.

Herein, we aimed to investigate the reflections of our otherwise crowded emergency services quietness in the period of normalisation. METHODOLOGY: Our study retrospectively investigated three groups of patients: the patients who were admitted to the emergency service in the Period of Restrictions when the restrictions were imposed to limit the spread of the COVID\\\\19 infection; the patients who were admitted to the emergency service in the Period of Normalisation when normalisation attempts were made and the restrictions were lifted; and the patients who were admitted to the emergency service in the Period of Pre\\\\pandemic Normal exactly 1 year before the normalisation period, which would reflect the normal functioning of the emergency service at that time. The three groups were compared with respect to the demographic characteristics and patient outcomes (death/hospitalisation/discharge). RESULTS: A total of 69 474 patients were admitted to the emergency service in the Period of Pre\\\\pandemic Normal whereas 21 278 patients were admitted in the Period of Restrictions. The number of emergency service admissions in the Period of Restrictions was significantly lower (P < .01). A total of 72 843 patients were admitted to the emergency service in the Period of Normalisation. There was no statistically significant difference between the Period of Pre\\\\pandemic Normal and the Period of Normalisation in terms of the number of emergency service admissions (P = .127). A total of 9421 (13.5%) patients were hospitalised in the Period of Pre\\\\pandemic Normal and the corresponding figure for the Period of Normalisation was 19 876 (27.2%).

The monitoring of emergence events is subject to ascertainment bias, whether at the level of species discovery, emerging disease events, or disease outbreaks in human populations. Disease surveillance is generally performed post hoc, driven by a response to recent events and by the availability of detection and identification technologies. Additionally, the inventory of pathogens that exist in mammalian and other reservoirs is incomplete, and identifying those with the potential to cause disease in humans is rarely possible in advance. A major step in understanding the burden and diversity of zoonotic infections, the local behavioral and demographic risks of infection, and the risk of emergence of these pathogens in human populations is to establish surveillance networks in populations that maintain regular contact with diverse animal populations, and to simultaneously characterize pathogen diversity in human and animal populations. Vietnam has been an epicenter of disease emergence over the last decade, and practices at the human/animal interface may facilitate the likelihood of spillover of zoonotic pathogens into humans. To tackle the scientific issues surrounding the origins and emergence of zoonotic infections in Vietnam, we have established The Vietnam Initiative on Zoonotic Infections (VIZIONS). This countrywide project, in which several international institutions collaborate with Vietnamese organizations, is combining clinical data, epidemiology, high-throughput sequencing, and social sciences to address relevant one-health questions.

Our principal objective is to develop an integrated approach to the surveillance of pathogens circulating in both human and animal populations and assess how frequently they are exchanged.

First, where regular vortices induced oscillating wall shear and simultaneously enhanced mass transport, which produced the thickest most extensive biofilms. Second, where unsteady uniform flow imposed an oscillating wall shear, with no enhanced transport, and where the biomass and coverage were only 20% smaller. Finally, for uniform steady flows with constant wall shear where the extent, thickness, and density of the biofilms were on average 60% smaller.

METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, observational, cohort study using data from Korean Hypothermia Network prospective registry included adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treated with targeted temperature management (TTM) and underwent standard EEG within 7 days after cardiac arrest from 14 university-affiliated teaching hospitals in South Korea between October 2015 and December 2018. Early EEG was defined as EEG performed within 72 h after cardiac arrest. The primary outcome was poor neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category score 3C5) at 1 month. RESULTS: Among 489 comatose OHCA survivors with a median EEG time of 46.6 h, the highly malignant pattern (40.7%) was most prevalent, followed by the benign (33.9%) and malignant (25.4%) patterns. All patients with the highly malignant EEG pattern had poor neurologic outcomes, with 100% specificity in both groups but 59.3% and 56.1% sensitivity in the early and late EEG groups, respectively. However, for patients with malignant patterns, 84.8% sensitivity, 77.0% specificity, and 89.5% positive predictive value for poor neurologic outcome were observed. Only 3.5% (9/256) of patients with background EEG frequency of predominant delta waves or undetermined had good neurologic survival. The combination of highly malignant or malignant EEG pattern with background frequency of delta waves or undetermined increased specificity and positive predictive value, respectively, to up to 98.0% and 98.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The highly malignant patterns predicted poor neurologic outcome with a high specificity regardless of EEG measurement time. The assessment of predominant background frequency in addition to EEG patterns can increase the prognostic value of OHCA survivors. Trial registration KORHN-PRO, NCT02827422.

Secondary aim was to compare the results with those obtained in a matched population treated with drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization alone. METHODS 40 consecutive cirrhotic patients with single HCC were prospectively enrolled and treated. Twenty-three patients had tumours between 3 and 5cm (Group A), and 17 larger than 5cm (Group B). Twenty cirrhotic patients with single HCC treated only with chemoembolization formed the control group. RESULTS Complete response at 1 month was achieved in 32/40 tumours (80%). During follow-up, complete response was maintained in 25 patients (25/40, 62.5%), and this rate was higher in Group A (69.6% vs 53%, p=0.008).

Administering SD PFG carries the potential risk for exacerbation of neutropenia based on analyses in lymphoma and breast cancer regimens;however, little data exists on infusional fluorouracil and SD PFG administration. The availability of biosimilar PFG and increased utilization of growth factors during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in practice for SD PFG administration. This study explored the incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN) and myelosuppression with FOLFOX and FOLFIRI regimens in Gastrointestinal malignancies (GI) to address the safety of SD utilization of PFG. Methods: Patient data was extracted through electronic health records search of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for GI malignancies and treated with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI-based regimens from November 2013 to May 2021. SD administration was defined as administration of PFG within 15 minutes after fluorouracil pump disconnect. The primary endpoint of our study was to evaluate the incidence of FN across all CTX cycles for up to four cycles, in SD PFG administration. Secondary outcomes included chemotherapy induced neutropenia (CIN), hospitalizations, and CTX dose reduction or delay. Results: Three hundred and thirty-nine patient charts were reviewed with 55 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. In our study cohort, 72.7% received FOLFOX and 27.2% received FOLFIRI-based regimens. Out of all 194 CTX cycles, 136 (70.1%) cycles received pegfilgrastim and 58 cycles received pegfilgrastim-cbqv (29.9%). Two patients had grade 3/4 CIN (1%), with both cases resulting in FN (1%). Both FN cases resulted in hospitalizations, and dose delays or reductions. Investigation of FN incidences revealed that both patients received CTX with active infections, one case with a urinary tract infection and the other with a chronic gangrene infection. Conclusions: Our study results suggest that SD administration of PFG can be as a safe and effective alternative to 24-hour postchemotherapy administration in patients receiving FOLFOX or FOLFIRI-based regimens. The incidence of FN was noted to be minimal in our study. Furthermore, no noted increase in myelosuppression was seen in our analysis, as compared to previous studies in breast cancer and lymphoma-based regimens. SD administration not only minimizes travel burdens on long-distance patients but also has allowed for reduction in infusion appointments and therefore possible exposure to the SARSCOV2 virus during the 2020-2021 pandemic. Future prospective studies are warranted in order to elucidate the risk of FN and myelosuppression in patients undergoing chemotherapy for GI malignancies with SD PFG administration.","output":"Evaluation of febrile neutropenia and myelosuppression in patients receiving FOLFOX/FOLFIRI in gastrointestinal cancer treated with same-day (SD) pegfilgrastim/pegfilgrastim-CBQV (PFG)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diverticulosis, Diverticular Disease, and Diverticulitis, comprising different entities, pose increasing burdens for health care systems.

Currently, there is no satisfactory treatment of anosmia. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effect of nasal betamethasone drops in the recovery of olfaction in COVID-19-associated anosmia. METHODS: The study was designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. In total, 276 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who were presented to the outpatient clinic with anosmia were enrolled in the study. In the betamethasone group, 138 participants received nasal drops of betamethasone 3 times daily until recovery for a maximum of one month. Similar dose of 9% NaCl drops was administered to 138 participants in the placebo group. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 29 years (IQR 23-37). Among them, 198 (71.7%) were females. Ageusia was co-presented with anosmia in 234 (84.8%) of participants. In this study, 83% of participants had recovered from anosmia within 30 days, with a median recovery time of 13 days (IQR 8-18). Compared to placebo, nasal application of betamethasone drops has no significant effect on the recovery time of anosmia (hazard ratio 0.88; 95% CI 0.68-1.14; P = 0.31). CONCLUSION: The use of nasal betamethasone to facilitate the recovery time of acute anosmia is not advised. In addition, age, smoking status, the duration of anosmia at presentation, and the co-presentation of ageusia with anosmia are important determinant covariates for the recovery time of anosmia.

Although the symptoms remain mild in most patients, the elderly and patients with previous comorbidities have higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Patients with liver cirrhosis, especially after decompensation, may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to systemic immune dysfunction. CASE REPORT The patient was a 51-year-old man who was hypertensive, an ex-alcoholic abstinent for 6 months, and a smoker. He was diagnosed with alcoholic liver cirrhosis in July 2019, and was using norfloxacin at home for secondary prophylaxis of bacterial peritonitis. He was also using furosemide and spironolactone to control ascites and propranolol for primary prophylaxis of esophageal varices. The patient entered our hospital in July 2020 with cough, dyspnea, runny nose, diarrhea, and fever. During hospitalization, we confirmed infection by COVID-19 and secondary nosocomial pulmonary infection. Chest tomography compatible with ground-glass standard was performed. The patient developed the need for auxiliary oxygen but without invasive mechanical ventilation. The patient received dexamethasone 6 mg/day and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (he was started on cefepime but switched to meropenem). At the end of the 14-day isolation period, he was discharged with improved respiratory status. CONCLUSIONS Despite high mortality rates in patients with advanced cirrhosis who become infected with COVID-19, we report a case with a favorable outcome.

Despite increasing interest in sex-specific brain function in laboratory animals, the significance of sex-specific immune activation in the brain of wild animals along with the variables that could affect it is widely lacking. Here, we use the Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) to study sex differences in expression of immune genes in the brain of adult males and females, in two wild populations breeding in contrasting habitats: a coastal sea-level population and a high-altitude inland population in China. Our analysis yielded 379 genes associated with immune function. We show a significant male-biased immune gene upregulation.

Secondary outcomes were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (UMA), 1-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), urine transferring (TRU) alone and in combination in diagnosis of COVID-19 with early renal injury. Results While all patients had no significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), the abnormal rates of eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of multi-index combined to diagnose early renal injury in COVID-19 was 0.875, which was higher than UMA (0,813), A1M (0.813), IGU (0.750) and TRU (0.750) alone. Spearman analysis showed that the degree of early renal injury was significantly related to C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil ratio (NER), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal injury. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia were common in patients with COVID-19, and there was a correlation with the degree of renal injury. Conclusions Early renal injury was common in patients with COVID-19. Combined detection of UMA, A1M, IGU, and TRU was helpful for the diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19.","output":"Analysis of early renal injury in COVID-19 and diagnostic value of multi-index combined detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spatial price equilibrium modeling framework, which emphasizes the importance of transportation costs between markets, has been utilized in agricultural, energy, mineral as well as financial applications. In this paper, we construct static and dynamic spatial price equilibrium networks with flow-dependent arc multipliers, which expand the reach of applications. The static model is formulated and analyzed as a variational inequality problem, whereas the dynamic one is formulated as a projected dynamical system, whose set of stationary points coincides with the set of solutions of the variational inequality. Qualitative results are presented, along with an algorithm, the Euler method, which yields a time-discretization of the continuous-time adjustment processes associated with the product shipments from supply markets to demand markets. The algorithm is implemented and applied to compute solutions to numerical examples with flow-dependent arc multipliers addressing losses and/or gains, inspired by perishable agricultural products, and by financial investments.

Butyrate has also shown promise in the treatment of intestinal disorders and diseases such as short bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and colon cancer. To modify sensory properties, intestinal release, and butyrate production capabilities, tributyrin (TB) was microencapsulated in whey protein isolate (WPI)-based and gamma-cyclodextrin (GC)-based materials. Using an in vitro digestion and fermentation model, microcapsules containing TB were monitored for their release and production of butyrate in vitro. All samples containing TB showed limited butyrate release (<5%) during oral and gastric stages. In the small intestinal phase, all microcapsules containing TB released approximately 75% of their total butyrate with no significant differences (P > 0.05) across formulations. During the fermentation phase, GC-based microcapsules produced significantly more butyrate (P < 0.001) on a molar basis than all WPI-based microcapsules. Butyrate production increased significantly (P < 0.001) over each time interval with GC-based microcapsules having the highest during the 12 h of fermentation. The GC-based TB encapsulation systems were able to effectively deliver butyrate to the small intestine and generate butyrate in the large intestine. These microcapsules may, therefore, be beneficial for the maintenance of intestinal health and improvement of disease states across all areas of the gastrointestinal tract.","output":"In Vitro Digestion and Fermentation of Microencapsulated Tributyrin for the Delivery of Butyrate."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid and sensitive identification of viral pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 is a critical step to control the pandemic disease. Viral antigen detection can compete with gold-standard PCR-based nucleic acid diagnostics in terms of better reflection of viral infectivity and reduced risk of contamination from enzymatic amplification. Here, we report the development of a one-step thermophoretic assay using an aptamer and polyethylene glycol (PEG) for direct quantitative detection of viral particles. The assay relies on aptamer binding to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and simultaneous accumulation of aptamer-bound viral particles in laser-induced gradients of temperature and PEG concentration. Using a pseudotyped lentivirus model, a limit of detection of 170 particles L-1 (26 fM of the spike protein) is achieved in 15 min without the need of any pretreatment. As a proof of concept, the one-step thermophoretic assay is used to detect synthetic samples by spiking viral particles into oropharyngeal swabs with an accuracy of 100%.

A total of 82 adults, 50 women and 32 men, participated. Data analysis showed that 67.1% (55) of the respondents had difficulty in understanding medical information and 57.3% (47) did not know where to seek medical help for a specific health problem. Four main areas of health problems were identified and further action is required: (A) mental health concerns, (B) vaccinations, (C) obesity, and (D) dental hygiene. Direct linkage with the Roadmap and Toolbox section of the projects website gave the respondents access to many sources and tools, while through the use of the interactive map, specific referral points of healthcare delivery in their area were identified. IT-based intervention in migrant and refugee populations in Greece are effective in increasing health literacy levels and identifying areas for health promotion interventions in these groups.

Some of these variants have resulted in transmissibility changes of the virus and may also have impact on diagnosis, therapeutics and even vaccines, thereby raising particular concerns in the scientific community. The variants which have mutations in Spike glycoprotein are the primary focus as it is the main target for neutralising antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect human through Spike glycoprotein and uses receptor-binding domain (RBD) to bind to the ACE2 receptor in human. Thus, it is of utmost importance to study these variants and their corresponding mutations. Such 12 different important variants identified so far are B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.525 (Eta), B.1.427/B.1.429 (Epsilon), B.1.526 (Iota), B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta), C.37 (Lambda), P.1 (Gamma), P.2 (Zeta), P.3 (Theta) and the recently discovered B.1.1.529 (Omicron). These variants have 84 unique mutations in Spike glycoprotein. To analyse such mutations, multiple sequence alignment of 77681 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 98 countries over the period from January 2020 to July 2021 is performed followed by phylogenetic analysis. Also, characteristics of new emerging variants are elaborately discussed. The individual evolution of these mutation points and the respective variants are visualised and their characteristics are also reported. Moreover, to judge the characteristics of the non-synonymous mutation points (substitutions), their biological functions are evaluated by PolyPhen-2 while protein structural stability is evaluated using I-Mutant 2.0.","output":"A review on evolution of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants based on spike glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, and Exposure (ABCDE) approach is widely recommended and taught in many resuscitation courses. This study assessed the adherence to the ABCDE algorithm and whether this was affected by the instruction method used to teach this approach. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial in which simulation was used as investigational method. Between June 2017 and January 2018, neonatal healthcare providers routinely participated in simulated neonatal advanced life support (NALS) scenarios, using a high-fidelity manikin. They were randomly assigned to a video-based instruction (intervention group) or a conventional lecture (control group) as the method of instruction. One blinded researcher evaluated the adherence to the ABCDE approach on video with an assessment tool specifically designed and tested for this study. The primary outcomes were: 1) the overall adherence and 2) the between-group difference in individual adherence to the ABCDE approach, both expressed as a percentage score. Secondary outcomes were: 1) the scores of each profession category (nurses, neonatal ward clinicians, fellows/neonatologists) and 2) the scores for the separate domains (A, B, C, D, and E) of the algorithm. RESULTS: Seventy-two participants were assessed. Overall mean (SD) percentage score (i.e. overall adherence) was 31.5% (19.0). The video-based instruction group (28 participants) adhered better to the ABCDE approach than the lecture group (44 participants), with mean (SD) scores of 38.8% (18.7) and 27.8% (18.2), respectively (p = 0.026). The difference in adherence between both groups could mainly be attributed to differences in the adherence to domain B (p = 0.023) and C (p = 0.007). Neonatal ward clinicians (39.9% (18.2)) showed better adherence than nurses (25.0% (15.2)), independent of the study group (p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Overall adherence to the ABCDE algorithm was rather low. Video-based instruction resulted in better adherence to the ABCDE approach during NALS training than lecturing.

Records since the reopening of ambulatory centers in New York were searched for patients with positive coronavirus disease 2019 nasal swab results who underwent ambulatory procedures. Chart reviews were conducted to determine coronavirus disease history and hospitalizations, demographic information, procedure details, and 30-day admissions. RESULTS: A total of 3,762 patients underwent ambulatory procedures. Of those, 53 were previously diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 but recovered and tested negative at preprocedural testing. Of the 3,709 asymptomatic patients, 37 (1.00%) tested positive during preprocedural testing; 21 patients had their procedures delayed on average 28.6 days until testing negative, while 16 had their procedures performed before testing negative owing to the time sensitivity of the procedure. There were no major complications or 30-day admissions in any of these asymptomatic patients. Three patients tested positive for coronavirus disease after having an ambulatory procedure. CONCLUSION: Positive tests in asymptomatic patients led to procedure delays of 28.6 days. No patients who underwent ambulatory procedures after a positive coronavirus disease 2019 test had any coronavirus disease-related complications, regardless of whether or not the procedure was delayed until testing negative.

However, because most previous studies have assessed satisfaction with ones life as a whole, we know little about whether specific domains of life satisfaction (e.g., satisfaction with family life, income) might be responsible for longitudinally driving better health and well-being. METHODS: Data were from 13,752 participants in the Health and Retirement Studya prospective and nationally representative cohort of US adults aged > 50. We evaluated if positive changes in seven individual domains of life satisfaction (between t(0); 2008/2010 and t(1); 2012/2014) were associated with 35 indicators of physical, behavioral, and psychosocial health and well-being (at t(2); 2016/2018). RESULTS: Most domains of life satisfaction were associated with psychological outcomes: satisfaction with family and non-work activities showed the largest associations (sometimes double in magnitude) with subsequent psychological factors, followed by satisfaction with financial situation and income. Further, some domains showed associations with specific physical health outcomes (e.g., mortality, number of chronic conditions, physical functioning limitations), health behaviors (e.g., sleep problems), and social factors (e.g., loneliness). CONCLUSIONS: As countries seek innovative and cost-effective methods of enhancing the health and well-being of our rapidly aging populations, findings from our study suggest that some domains of life satisfaction have a substantially larger influence on health and well-being outcomes than others. Individual domains of life satisfaction might be novel targets for interventions and policies seeking to enhance specific facets of health and well-being.

A retrospective cohort study of gynecologic oncology patients with an index unplanned encounter between January and December 2018 was performed. Super-utilizers were defined as patients with 3 or more unplanned hospital encounters during a 12-month period starting at the time of the index unplanned encounter. We identified 553 patients with gynecologic cancer. Of those, 37(7%) met inclusion criteria for super-utilizers accounting for 193/310(62%) of unplanned visits. The median number of unplanned visits was 4 (range 3C24). The most common cancers were uterine (N = 15 (41%)) and ovarian (N = 11 (30%)). Nineteen (51%) super-utilizers had advanced stage disease. Phases of oncologic care at index unplanned encounter included primary diagnosis (N = 24 (65%)), recurrence (N = 10 (27%)), and surveillance (N = 2 (5%)). Twelve super-utilizers (32%) had new diagnoses of cancer without prior therapy, 19(51%) had prior chemotherapy, 17(46%) had prior surgery, and 10(27%) had prior radiation therapy at the time of initial encounter. Fifteen super-utilizers (41%) were in the last year of life. The most common reasons for unplanned encounters were pain (66%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (61%). Multivariable analysis adjusting for key variables demonstrated that Medicaid insurance, ASA classification, and disease status are risk factors for health care super-utilization.

We studied the effects of dsRNA, a nucleotide synthesized during viral replication, on airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in murine models of asthma. Intratracheal instillation of poly I:C, a synthetic dsRNA, increased the airway eosinophilia and enhanced bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine in OVA-sensitized, exposed rats. These changes were associated with induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and COX-2-dependent PGD2 synthesis in the lungs, particularly in alveolar macrophages. The direct intratracheal instillation of PGD2 enhanced the eosinophilic inflammation in OVA-exposed animals, whereas pretreatment with a dual antagonist against the PGD2 receptor-(CRTH2) and the thromboxane A2 receptor, but not with a thromboxane A2 receptor-specific antagonist, nearly completely eliminated the dsRNA-induced worsening of airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. CRTH2-deficient mice had the same degree of allergen-induced airway eosinophilia as wild-type mice, but they did not exhibit a dsRNA-induced increase in eosinophil accumulation. Our data demonstrate that COX-2-dependent production of PGD2 followed by eosinophil recruitment into the airways via a CRTH2 receptor are the major pathogenetic factors responsible for the dsRNA-induced enhancement of airway inflammation and responsiveness.","output":"Cyclooxygenase-2/prostaglandin D2/CRTH2 pathway mediates double-stranded RNA-induced enhancement of allergic airway inflammation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present an unusual case of a woman in her 30s who was admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the setting of newly diagnosed but late COVID-19 infection with associated Klebsiella pneumoniae infection.

Finally, tourist food experiences in totality mediated the relationship between the overall Sustainable Local Food Supply Chain and destination branding. This study contributes to the existing literature by developing and validating a scale to measure the sustainability practices of local food supply chains in restaurants to fill this gap in the literature. Additionally, the findings have intimate important theoretical and practical implications.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic Is a Wake-Up Call for Sustainable Local Food Supply Chains: Evidence from Green Restaurants in the USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite all the advances in hip arthroscopy, microfracture is still the workhorse for treating focal and full-thickness cartilage lesions.

In the literature, much attention is paid to the influence of coffee on human health, especially daily intake of caffeine, and also purchasing consumer behavior. There is a lack of research devoted to consumer choices and habits in relation to coffee consumption and brewing method. Therefore, the aim of this study is to describe the characteristics of coffee consumers and present their segmentation based on consumer choices and habits towards coffee consumption. The study was performed using the computer-assisted web interviewing (CAWI) method on a group of 1500 adults respondents in Poland reporting the consumption of coffee. We collected information about consumer choices and habits related to coffee consumption, including brewing method, place of consuming coffee, and factors determining coffee choices. Using cluster analysis, we identified three main groups of coffee consumers. There are Neutral coffee drinkers, Ad hoc coffee drinkers, and Non-specific coffee drinkers. The respondents in the study are not coffee gourmets; they like and consume coffee, but these are often changing choices. To conclude, it can be stated that the Polish coffee consumer prefers conventional methods of brewing coffee (like a traditionalist) but is open to novelties and new sensory experiences. Based on study results it is possible to know the coffee drinking habits in Poland.","output":"Consumer Choices and Habits Related to Coffee Consumption by Poles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe Australian ED workload over the period 2017-2020 using data from twice annual Access Block Point Prevalence Studies, and to identify any impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of demand and occupancy data provided by the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine accredited EDs in voluntary surveys at the start of June and September 2017-2020. Hospitals answering all surveys were grouped and compared by jurisdiction and role delineation. RESULTS: A total of 121 EDs were eligible, 63% supplied complete occupancy data and 53% complete demand data. Between the June 2017 and 2019 surveys, mean daily ED presentations increased by 11.4% (P = 0.0003). The number being treated at 10.00 hours rose by 27.7% (P < 0.0001) and those experiencing access block (waiting for an inpatient bed, been in ED more than 8 h) rose by 46.1% (P = 0.001). Between the June 2019 and 2020 surveys, ED presentations fell by an average of 12.6% (P < 0.0001), ward admissions were almost unchanged (-6.0%, P = NS), and patients who did not wait to be seen fell by 57.8% (P < 0.0001). Major Paediatric Referral hospitals reported a 28% decrease in presentations. By September 2020, only the state of Victoria (ongoing state of emergency) and Major Paediatric Referral hospitals reported demand lower than 2019 or occupancy lower than 2018. CONCLUSIONS: Occupancy increased by more than demand 2017-2019, with some decrease in 2020: in June presentations were 12.7% lower than 2019, in September back to the normal range outside Victorian and Major Paediatric Referral hospitals.

The dimeric enzyme dissociated at guanidinium chloride concentration of <0.4 M, at which the enzymatic activity loss showed close correlation with the subunit dissociation. Further increase in guanidinium chloride induced a reversible biphasic unfolding of the enzyme. The unfolding of the C-terminal domain-truncated enzyme, on the other hand, followed a monophasic unfolding curve. Different mutants of the full-length protease (W31 and W207/W218), with tryptophanyl residue(s) mutated to phenylalanine at the C-terminal or N-terminal domain, respectively, were constructed. Unfolding curves of these mutants were monophasic but corresponded to the first and second phases of the protease, respectively. The unfolding intermediate of the protease thus represented a folded C-terminal domain but an unfolded N-terminal domain, which is enzymatically inactive due to loss of regulatory properties. The various enzyme forms were characterized in terms of hydrophobicity and size-and-shape distributions. We provide direct evidence for the functional role of C-terminal domain in stabilization of the catalytic N-terminal domain of SARS coronavirus main protease.","output":"Reversible Unfolding of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Main Protease in Guanidinium Chloride"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the deficiencies that characterize the functioning of the Italian national health system Prisons have always mirrored the most radical expressions of these weaknesses During the early stages of the pandemic, prison facilities across Italy underwent a series of changes dictated by the need to ensure the safety of the prisoners and staff The adoption of these rules contributed to a total or partial redefinition of many central facets of life in prison, such as intake procedures for new arrivals and the ways prisoners were allowed to communicate with their families Objectives: The aim of this qualitative study was to analyze the testimony of penitentiary healthcare workers in prisons throughout Italy to determine the impact of COVID-19 on their professional and personal lives Participants: Thirty-eight participants were contacted and 20 decided to participate in the interview The sample was made up of 10 women and 10 men All the participants were members of the healthcare staff of a penitentiary facility (psychologists, psychiatrists, physicians, and nurses) All were recruited through an Italian association whose mission is the development, promotion, and implementation of social solidarity projects including prisoners' social and health care This study was facilitated through representatives serving in nine different regions of Italy The participants were divided according to their professional roles in prisons Method: In-depth interviews were conducted by telephone or online using telecommunication platforms (e g , Zoom, WhatsApp, and Skype) The transcribed texts underwent thematic analysis using the Atlas ti software to identify patterns of meaning across the dataset Results: Four main themes emerged from the analysis: Interpersonal difficulties, management and operational difficulties, the personal distress and bereavement of healthcare workers, and the distress of inmates The importance of relationship management skills when interacting with prisoners emerged as a key topic in many interviews, and the participants highlighted the need for adequate training The increase in prisoners' anxiety made communication more difficult Conclusions: The findings suggest that healthcare workers in jails need emergency-oriented training Participants described their feeling of loneliness and quasi-abandonment when carrying out their duties during the pandemic In particular, they underscored the need for psychological guidance to better manage altered reactions with prisoners and colleagues as a result of heightened death anxiety and isolation","output":"Hardships in Italian Prisons During the COVID-19 Emergency: The Experience of Healthcare Personnel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The COVID lockdown has affected food purchases and eating habits.

In this review, recent trends in the synthesis and application of heterogeneous Fenton catalysts for the abatement of organic pollutants and disinfection of microorganisms are discussed. It is noted that as the complexity of cell wall increases, the resistance level towards various disinfectants increases and it requires either harsh conditions or longer exposure time for the complete disinfection. In case of viruses, enveloped viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV-2) are found to be more susceptible to disinfectants than the non-enveloped viruses. The introduction of plasmonic materials with the Fenton catalysts broadens the visible light absorption efficiency of the hybrid material, and incorporation of semiconductor material improves the rate of regeneration of Fe(II) from Fe(III). A special emphasis is given to the use of Fenton catalysts for antibacterial applications. Composite materials of magnetite and ferrites remain a champion in this area because of their easy separation and reuse, owing to their magnetic properties. Iron minerals supported on clay materials, perovskites, carbon materials, zeolites and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) dramatically increase the catalytic degradation rate of contaminants by providing high surface area, good mechanical stability, and improved electron transfer. Moreover, insights to the zero-valent iron and its capacity to remove a wide range of organic pollutants, heavy metals and bacterial contamination are also discussed. Real world applications and the role of natural organic matter are summarised.

The choice of support mode depends largely on the indication. Patients with respiratory failure are predominantly treated with a venovenous (VV) approach. We hypothesized that mortality in Germany in ECLS therapy did not differ from previously reported literature METHODS: Inpatient data from Germany from 2007 to 2018 provided by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany were analysed. The international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems codes (ICD) and process keys (OPS) for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) types, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hospital mortality were used. RESULTS: In total, 45,647 hospitalized patients treated with ECLS were analysed. In Germany, 231 hospitals provided ECLS therapy, with a median of 4 VV-ECMO and 9 VA-ECMO in 2018. Overall hospital mortality remained higher than predicted in comparison to the values reported in the literature. The number of VV-ECMO cases increased by 236% from 825 in 2007 to 2768 in 2018. ARDS was the main indication for VV-ECMO in only 33% of the patients in the past, but that proportion increased to 60% in 2018. VA-ECMO support is of minor importance in the treatment of ARDS in Germany. The age distribution of patients undergoing ECLS has shifted towards an older population. In 2018, the hospital mortality decreased in VV-ECMO patients and VV-ECMO patients with ARDS to 53.9% (n = 1493) and 54.4% (n = 926), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ARDS is a severe disease with a high mortality rate despite ECLS therapy. Although endpoints and timing of the evaluations differed from those of the CESAR and EOLIA studies and the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry, the reported mortality in these studies was lower than in the present analysis.

The cost implications of dabigatran for this population are unknown but are important given the significant clinical implications. METHODS Hospitalized events, procedures, and study and non-study medications were documented. We applied Canadian unit costs to healthcare resources consumed for all patients in the trial, and calculated the average cost per patient in Canadian dollars for the duration of the study (median follow-up of 16 months). A sensitivity analysis was performed using only Canadian patients, and subgroup analyses were also conducted. RESULTS The total study cost for the dabigatran group was $9985 per patient, compared with $10,082 for placebo, a difference of - $97 (95% confidence interval [CI] - $2128 to $3672). Savings arising from fewer clinical events and procedures in the dabigatran 110 mg twice-daily group were enough to offset the cost of the study drug. In Canadian patients, the difference was $250 (95% CI -$2848 to $4840). Both differences were considered cost neutral. Dabigatran 110 mg twice daily was cost saving or cost neutral in many subgroups that were considered. CONCLUSION Dabigatran 110 mg twice daily was cost neutral for patients in the MANAGE trial.

This results in overall poorer population health for minoritized people. In 2020, Black and Hispanic/Latinx communities throughout the United States, including the state of Illinois, experienced disproportionately high rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Public health officials in Illinois implemented targeted programs at state and local levels to increase intervention access and reduce disparities. METHODSTo quantify how disparities in COVID outcomes evolved through the epidemic, data on SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests, COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19 deaths were obtained from the Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System for the period from March 1 to December 31, 2020. Relative risks of COVID-19 cases and deaths were calculated for Black and Hispanic/Latinx vs. White residents, stratified by age group and epidemic interval. Deaths attributable to racial/ethnic disparities in incidence and case fatality were estimated with counterfactual simulations. RESULTSDisparities in case and death rates became less drastic after May 2020, but did not disappear, and were more pronounced at younger ages. From March to May of 2020, the risk of a COVID-19 case for Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations was more than twice that of Whites across all age groups. The relative risk of COVID-19 death reached above 10 for Black and Hispanic/Latinx individuals under 50 years of age compared to age-matched Whites in the early epidemic. In all Illinois counties, relative risk of a COVID-19 case was the same or significantly increased for minoritized populations compared to the White population. 79.3% and 86.7% of disparities in deaths among Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations, respectively, were attributable to differences in age-adjusted incidence compared to White populations rather than differences in case fatality ratios. CONCLUSIONSRacial and ethnic disparities in the COVID-19 pandemic are products of society, not biology. Considering age and geography in addition to race/ethnicity can help to identify the structural factors driving poorer outcomes for certain groups. Studies and policies aimed at reducing inequalities in disease exposure will reduce disparities in mortality more than those focused on drivers of case fatality.","output":"Structural racism and COVID-19 response: Higher risk of exposure drives disparate COVID-19 deaths among Black and Hispanic/Latinx residents of Illinois, USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

As most care activities occur at home, there is often a disconnect and lack of communication between families, home care nurses, and healthcare providers. Digital health technologies may help bridge this gap. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a pre-post study with a voice-enabled medical note taking (diary) app (SpeakHealth) in a real world setting with caregivers (parents, family members) of children with special healthcare needs (CSHCN) to understand feasibility of voice interaction and automatic speech recognition (ASR) for medical note taking at home. METHODS: In total, 41 parents of CSHCN were recruited. Participants completed a pre-study survey collecting demographic details, technology and care management preferences. Out of 41, 24 participants completed the study, using the app for 2 weeks and completing an exit survey. The app facilitated caregiver note-taking using voice interaction and ASR. An exit survey was conducted to collect feedback on technology adoption and changes in technology preferences in care management. We assessed the feasibility of the app by descriptively analyzing survey responses and user data following the key focus areas of acceptability, demand, implementation and integration, adaptation and expansion. In addition, perceived effectiveness of the app was assessed by comparing perceived changes in mobile app preferences among participants. In addition, the voice data, notes, and transcriptions were descriptively analyzed for understanding the feasibility of the app. RESULTS: The majority of the recruited parents were 35C44 years old (22, 53.7%), part of a two-parent household (30, 73.2%), white (37, 90.2%), had more than one child (31, 75.6%), lived in Ohio (37, 90.2%), used mobile health apps, mobile note taking apps or calendar apps (28, 68.3%) and patient portal apps (22, 53.7%) to track symptoms and health events at home. Caregivers had experience with voice technology as well (32, 78%). Among those completed the post-study survey (in Likert Scale 1C5), ~80% of the caregivers agreed or strongly agreed that using the app would enhance their performance in completing tasks (perceived usefulness; mean = 3.4, SD = 0.8), the app is free of effort (perceived ease of use; mean = 3.2, SD = 0.9), and they would use the app in the future (behavioral intention; mean = 3.1, SD = 0.9). In total, 88 voice interactive patient notes were generated with the majority of the voice recordings being less than 20 s in length (66%). Most noted symptoms and conditions, medications, treatment and therapies, and patient behaviors. More than half of the caregivers reported that voice interaction with the app and using transcribed notes positively changed their preference of technology to use and methods for tracking symptoms and health events at home. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that voice interaction and ASR use in mobile apps are feasible and effective in keeping track of symptoms and health events at home.

Nearly one-third of patients had comorbidities (29%; n = 53), of which hypertension was the most common (18.9%; n = 49). Participation in mass gatherings (Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.37; P = 0.03) and dysgusia (OR = 2.09, P = 0.02) were predictive of diagnosis of COVID-19. Age groups 60 to 69 (OR = 7.41; P = 0.0001), 50 to 59 (OR = 4.09; P = 0.03), 40 to 49 (OR = 4.54; P = 0.01), male gender (OR = 2.53; P = 0.04), diabetes (OR = 4.05; P = 0.01), HIV infection (OR = 5.57; P = 0.03), lung disease (OR = 6.29; P = 0.01), dyspnoea (OR = 3.70; P = 0.008) and fatigue (OR = 3.35; P = 0.02) significantly predicted COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: Most COVID-19 cases in this study were benign with low fatality. Age (40-70), male gender, HIV infection, lung disease, dyspnoea and fatigue are associated with severe COVID-19.

These restrictions directly impacted College Park Academy (CPA), a public charter middle and high school in Prince Georges County, MD that typically follows a hybrid approach to in-person and online instruction. The purpose of this qualitative study was to review CPAs transition to full online distance learning during emergency remote teaching. The research worked to establish a snapshot of the schools underlying structure and disaster preparedness strategies before evaluating the perceived viability of the online model and its effects on students, teachers, parents, and educational administrators. The researchers conducted interviews, as well as document analysis and online classroom observations. The findings reveal that despite strong infrastructure and communications during the transition, there remained issues with school readiness, including the maintenance of academic rigor and social emotional wellbeing. Overall, recommendations are made as to how the school would benefit from a shift in its approach to technology-enhanced learning, including the need for digital tools that better facilitate wellness checks, provide human touchpoints, and target collaborative, student-centered pedagogy.

In this study, we investigated the effects of a natural sesquiterpene lactone, 6-O-angeloylplenolin (6-OAP), isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine Centipeda minima (L.) A.Br., on neuroinflammation and the underlying mechanisms. We showed that treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) caused activation of BV2 and primary microglial cells and development of neuroinflammation in vitro, evidenced by increased production of inflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-1, the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-B, and the transcriptional upregulation of COX-2 and iNOS, leading to increased production of proinflammatory factors NO and PGE(2). Moreover, LPS treatment induced oxidative stress through increasing the expression levels of NOX2 and NOX4. Pretreatment with 6-OAP (0.5?4 M) dose-dependently attenuated LPS-induced NF-B activation and oxidative stress, thus suppressed neuroinflammation in the cells. In a mouse model of LPS-induced neuroinflammation, 6-OAP (5?20 mgkg(?1)d(?1), ip, for 7 days before LPS injection) dose-dependently inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines, the activation of the NF-B signaling pathway, and the expression of inflammatory enzymes in brain tissues. 6-OAP pretreatment significantly ameliorated the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the brains. 6-OAP at a high dose caused a much stronger antineuroinflammatory effect than dexamethansone (DEX). Furthermore, we demonstrated that 6-OAP pretreatment could inhibit LPS-induced neurite and synaptic loss in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that 6-OAP exerts antineuroinflammatory effects and can be considered a novel drug candidate for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases.","output":"6-O-angeloylplenolin exerts neuroprotection against lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation in vitro and in vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A vaccine based on liposome-formulated uracil-modified mRNA shows promise in mouse models of multiple sclerosis.","output":"mRNA vaccine shows promise in autoimmunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since 1992, the Eilat Conferences have provided a forum for all stakeholders in the epilepsy community to appraise the latest data on new antiepileptic drugs and emergency seizure treatments, including, in recent years, updates on progress with the development of novel monitoring and therapeutic devices.

A model-based analysis using a retrospective cohort of all hospitalized children with CSF EV PCR testing done between November 2013 and 2017. The primary outcome measured was the potential date of discharge if the EV PCR result had been available on the same day. Patients with positive EV PCR were considered for potential earlier discharge once clinically stable with no reason for hospitalization other than intravenous antibiotics. Descriptive statistics and cost-sensitivity analyses were performed. CSF EV PCR testing was done on 153 patients, of which 44 (29%) had a positive result. Median test TAT was 5.3 days (IQR 3.9C7.6). Median hospital LOS was 5 days (IQR 3C12). Most (86%) patients received intravenous antibiotics with mean duration of 5.72  6.51 days. No patients with positive EV PCR had a serious bacterial infection. We found that same-day test TAT would reduce LOS and duration of intravenous antibiotics by 0.50 days (95%CI 0.33C0.68) and 0.67 days (95%CI 0.42C0.91), respectively.

Objective: Our study aimed to quantify the effect of COVID-19 pandemic measures on general practitioner (GP) visits, specialist care, hospitalization, and cost-related prescription nonredemption (CRPNR) among adults, and to identify the social strata susceptible to the pandemic effect. Methods: This cross-sectional study was based on nationally representative data of 6611 (N(prepandemic) = 5603 and N(pandemic) = 1008) adults. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied to determine the sociodemographic and clinical factors influencing health care use by odds ratios (ORs) along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). To identify the social strata susceptible to the pandemic effect, the interaction of the time of data collection with the level of education, marital status, and Roma ethnicity, was tested and described by iORs. Results: While the CRPNR did not change, the frequency of GP visits, specialist care, and hospitalization rates was remarkably reduced by 22.2%, 26.4%, and 6.7%, respectively, during the pandemic. Roma proved to be not specifically affected by the pandemic in any studied aspect, and the pandemic restructuring of health care impacted the social subgroups evenly with respect to hospital care. However, the pandemic effect was weaker among primary educated adults (iOR(GP visits, high-school vs. primary-education) = 0.434; 95% CI 0.243C0.776, OR(specialist visit, high-school vs. primary-education) = 0.598; 95% CI 0.364C0.985), and stronger among married adults (iOR(GP visit, widowed vs. married) = 2.284; 95% CI 1.043C4.998, iOR(specialist visit, widowed vs. married) = 1.915; 95% CI 1.157C3.168), on the frequency of GP visits and specialist visits. The prepandemic CRPNR inequality by the level of education was increased (iOR(high-school vs. primary-education) = 0.236; 95% CI 0.075C0.743). Conclusion: Primary educated and widowed adults did not follow the general trend, and their prepandemic health care use was not reduced during the pandemic. This shows that although the management of pandemic health care use restrictions was implemented by not increasing social inequity, the drug availability for primary educated individuals could require more support.","output":"The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Social Inequalities of Health Care Use in Hungary: A Nationally Representative Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to investigate volatile compounds and quality traits of shrimp heads stored at 20 C, 4 C, -3 C, and -18 C.

Our results indicate a strong positive relationship between livestock-processing plants and local community transmission of COVID-19, suggesting that these plants may act as transmission vectors into the surrounding population and accelerate the spread of the virus beyond what would be predicted solely by population risk characteristics. We estimate the total excess COVID-19 cases and deaths associated with proximity to livestock plants to be 236,000 to 310,000 (6 to 8% of all US cases) and 4,300 to 5,200 (3 to 4% of all US deaths), respectively, as of July 21, 2020, with the vast majority likely related to community spread outside these plants. The association is found primarily among large processing facilities and large meatpacking companies. In addition, we find evidence that plant closures attenuated county-wide cases and that plants that received permission from the US Department of Agriculture to increase their production-line speeds saw more county-wide cases.

Methods: From April 17, 2020 to June 30, 2020, fifteen COVID-19 patients who had been liberated from mechanical ventilation at the acute care hospital were transferred to the LTACHs. These patients were matched with 14 COVID-19 patients transferred to the same LTACHs for weaning from prolonged invasive ventilation. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was December 20, 2020. Results: The median (interquartile range) age of non-mechanically ventilated (non-MV) patients at LTACH admission was 63.0 years (55.0-74.0);7 (46.7%) patients were women and 8 (53.3%) resided in low-income areas. The corresponding values in patients mechanically ventilated (MV) at LTACH admission were 64.0 years (58.0-73.3), 6 (42.9%) women and 8 (57.1%) resided in low-income areas. Race distribution, premorbid functional status (Zubrod score), premorbid clinical characteristics (Charlson Comorbidity Index), and severity of disease at LTACH admission (APACHE II) were equivalent in the two groups of patients. The most common indications for LTACH transfer in the non-MV group were tracheostomy decannulation (60.0%), weaning from high-flow oxygen (40%) and delirium/encephalopathy (33.3%). The corresponding indications in the MV group were weaning from invasive ventilation (100%), prolonged antibiotic therapy (42.9%) and delirium/encephalopathy (14.3%). No patient in the non-MV group required mechanical ventilation during LTACH stay, 7 of 9 (77.8%) with a tracheostomy were decannulated and 1 (6.7%) died.

Correlation of binding antibody assessment in clinical assays with neutralizing antibodies is needed to better understand the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and establish of correlates of protection. Methods A cohort of 752 samples was used to assess specificity, sensitivity, and comparison to 6 other Conformit Europ?enne serologic assays for the BioRad SARS-CoV-2 IgG multiplex assay which measures receptor binding domain IgG (RBD), spike-S1 IgG (S1), spike-S2 IgG (S2), and nucleocapsid IgG (N). A subset of serial specimens from 14 patients was also tested for neutralizing antibodies (n=61). Results Specificity for RBD and S1 IgG was 99.4% (n=170) and 100% for S2 and N IgG (n=170) in a cohort selected for probable interference. Overall assay concordance with other assays was >93% for IgG and total antibody assays and reached 100% sensitivity for clinical concordance at >14 days as a multiplex assay.

METHODS Children with cancer and FN at 3 hospitals in Chile were prospectively evaluated by clinical examination, blood cultures and detection of 17 RVs using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (nasopharyngeal samples). Clinical characterization and outcome variables were determined and compared by the type of RV detected. RESULTS A total of 1044 episodes of FN in 525 children were included. At least 1 RV was detected in 46%. In 350 of 1044 (34%) episodes, we detected only RVs, of which 284 (81%) were classified as a single-RV infection and 66 (19%) as a viral coinfection. Respiratory symptoms were present at admission in 65% of the episodes with any detected RV. Median age was 6 years (interquartile range, 3-10), and 51% were women. The most common RVs detected were rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, influenza, adenovirus and human metapneumovirus.

Globally, 18% of celiac patients showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig vs 25% of the non-celiac control (p=0.18). The values of anti-RBD IgG/IgA and anti-N IgG did not differ from the non-celiac controls. Celiac patients had a significant lower level of anti-N IgA. The ACE2 receptor was detected in the non-atrophic duodenal mucosa of celiac patients; atrophy was associated with a lower expression of the ACE2 receptor. Conclusion. CD patients have an anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig positiveness and profile similar to non-celiac controls, except for anti-N IgA. The main celiac parameters and adherence to the GFD do not influence the development of a different Ig profile.","output":"IMPACT OF A SARS-COV-2 INFECTION IN PATIENTS WITH CELIAC DISEASE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA is central to the COVID-19 pandemicit shapes how the SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) behaves, and how researchers investigate and fight it.

Data of 287 pregnant women with COVID-19 of 6 countries were assessed from 28 articles between December 8, 2019 and April 6, 2020. Most pregnant women reported in their third trimester, 102 (35.5%) cases were symptomatic at the time of admission. Common onset symptoms, abnormal laboratory findings, and chest computed tomography pattern were fever (51.5%), lymphocytopenia (67.9%), and multiple ground-glass opacities (78.5%) respectively. 93% of all deliveries were done through cesarean section. No maternal mortality and 3 % ICU admission were reported. Vertical transmission was not reported but its possibility was suggested in three neonates. One neonatal death, one stillbirth, and one abortion were reported. All newborns were not breastfed. This review showed fewer adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 in comparison with previous coronavirus outbreak infection in pregnancy.

However, none of these studies have examined the levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with confirmed diagnosis of neuropathy. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the levels of MCP-1 along with IL-6, IL-8 and TGF- in patients with T2DM and confirmed neuropathy and identify correlations, if any, between MCP-1 and other parameters. METHODS: A single center cross-sectional clinical study was conducted at University Hospital Sharjah (UHS) and University of Sharjah. One hundred and two patients with T2DM were recruited from diabetes clinics at UHS and were stratified into different groups based on diagnosis of DNP and other parameters. Several analyses were conducted to evaluate and compare the levels of MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TGF- across these groups of patients and identify correlations, if any, between MCP-1 and other variables. RESULTS: A significant increase was found in the levels of MCP-1 in T2DM patients with DNP compared to the patients without DNP (p=0.002, p-adj=0.007). Further analysis has shown that levels of IL-8 (p=0.008) and TGF- (p=0.06) were increased and decreased, respectively, in patients with DNP compared to patients without DNP. Moreover, strong correlations were found between MCP-1, IL-8 and TGF- levels. CONCLUSION: The key finding of the present study is the significant elevation in levels of MCP-1 in T2DM patients with DNP compared to the patients without DNP and IL-8 and TGF- were strong predictors of MCP-1 increased levels.","output":"Inflammatory Biomarkers Levels in T2DM Emirati Patients with Diabetic Neuropathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As COVID-19 spreads worldwide, an infodemic C i.e., an over-abundance of information, reliable or not C spreads across the physical and the digital worlds, triggering behavioral responses which cause public health concern.

FINDINGS: The COVID-19 global communication network is characterized by knowledge groups, hierarchically organized in sub-groups with well-defined geo-political and ideological characteristics. Communication is mostly segregated within groups and driven by a small number of subjects: 0.1% of users account for up to 45% and 10% of activities and news shared, respectively, centralizing the information flow. INTERPRETATION: Contradicting the idea that digital social media favor active participation and co-creation of online content, our results imply that public health policy strategies to counter the effects of the infodemic must not only focus on information content, but also on the social articulation of its diffusion mechanisms, as a given community tends to be relatively impermeable to news generated by non-aligned sources.","output":"Emergence of knowledge communities and information centralization during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ethical principle consists of ethics.

Cerebral vasospasm (CVS; narrowing of cerebral arteries) occurs following SAH and represents a major cause of associated mortality and morbidity. To improve postsurgery care of SAH patients and their prognosis, the ability to predict CVS onset is critical. We report a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signature to distinguish SAH patients with CVS from SAH patients without CVS. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained from SAH patients without CVS (n = 10) and SAH patients with CVS (n = 10). lncRNAs ZFAS1 and MALAT1 were significantly upregulated (p < 0.05), whereas lncRNAs LINC00261 and LINC01619 were significantly downregulated in SAH patients with CVS (p < 0.05) compared to SAH patients without CVS. We applied this lncRNA signature to retrospectively predict CVS in SAH patients (n = 38 for SAH patients without CVS, and n = 27 for SAH patients with CVS). The 4-lncRNA signature was found to be predictive in >40% of samples and the 2-lncRNA comprising MALAT1 and LINC01619 accurately predicted CVS in a90% cases.

Setting: The Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralyzed (CRP) and the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedic Rehabilitation (NITOR), two tertiary level hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: From July to September 2020, a prospective, cross-sectional survey of SCI subjects, 13-78 years of age, carried out in two SCI rehab centers in Bangladesh. Data has been collected by face to face interview through a pretested, and language validated questionnaire on KAP and Depression, Anxiety, Stress (DASS). Ethical approval and trial registration obtained prospectively. As all the patients were previously living with Spinal cord injury (SCI), therefore, all the patients admitted/ attend SCI rehab centers were considered as SCI positive samples. Results: A total of 207 people with SCI responded, 87%were male, and 13% were female with mean age34.18 (SD 12.9) years. 33.8% was tetraplegic and 66.2% was paraplegic and 63.8% of them were diagnosed ASIA-A, with a motor score mean 45.38, the sensory score of 97.2, SpO2 95.07, and Vo2max 35.7 mL/kg/min. 178 people had at least one health issue.

However, the mechanisms governing their efficacy remain unclear, highlighting the need for hypothesis-generating analyses to guide future research. METHODS: We used Bayesian network analysis in three cross-sectional samples (N = 1135) of undergraduates and participants from the community to identify links between individual symptoms of depression and specific facets of mindfulness. In two exploratory studies, we assessed depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (n = 384) or the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (n = 350) and mindfulness using the Five-Facet Mindfulness Scale. RESULTS: Across these samples and measures, exploratory analyses indicated that non-judging was a central bridge between facets of mindfulness and symptoms of depression. We confirmed this finding in a pre-registered replication (n = 401) using a recently developed confirmatory testing framework for network analysis. Non-judging was consistently a central bridge in the networks and specifically linked to the symptoms of depression related to feelings of failure and worthlessness. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide strong evidence that non-judging is an essential feature of mindfulness in the context of depression and provides direction for future research testing mindfulness-oriented treatment prescriptions for depression.

Opioids are thought to contribute to the mechanism of bowel dysfunction. We tested if methylnaltrexone, a pure peripheral mu-opioid receptor antagonist, could reverse opioid-induced constipation. METHODS: The MOTION trial is a multi-centre, double blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial to investigate whether methylnaltrexone alleviates opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in critical care patients. Eligibility criteria included adult ICU patients who were mechanically ventilated, receiving opioids and were constipated (had not opened bowels for a minimum 48 h) despite prior administration of regular laxatives as per local bowel management protocol. The primary outcome was time to significant rescue-free laxation. Secondary outcomes included gastric residual volume, tolerance of enteral feeds, requirement for rescue laxatives, requirement for prokinetics, average number of bowel movements per day, escalation of opioid dose due to antagonism/reversal of analgesia, incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, incidence of diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile infection and finally 28 day, ICU and hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients were enrolled and randomized (41 to methylnaltrexone and 43 to placebo). The baseline demographic characteristics of the two groups were generally well balanced. There was no significant difference in time to rescue-free laxation between the groups (Hazard ratio 1.42, 95% CI 0.82C2.46, p = 0.22). There were no significant differences in the majority of secondary outcomes, particularly days 1C3. However, during days 4C28, there were fewer median number of bowel movements per day in the methylnaltrexone group, (p = 0.01) and a greater incidence of diarrhoea in the placebo group (p = 0.02). There was a marked difference in mortality between the groups, with ten deaths in the methylnaltrexone group and two in the placebo group during days 4C28 (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: We found no evidence to support the addition of methylnaltrexone to regular laxatives for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in critically ill patients; however, the confidence interval was wide and a clinically important difference cannot be excluded.

Design: We used an agent-based model Covasim and the demographics, policies, and interventions implemented in the state. Using the calibrated model, we simulated possible epidemic trajectories that could eventuate due to leakage of infected cases with high-transmission variants, during a period of zero community transmission. Setting: Model calibration covered the first-wave period from early March 2020 to May 2020. Predicted epidemic trajectories were simulated from early February 2021 to late March 2021. Participants: None (simulation study). Main outcomes: A calibrated model of COVID-19 epidemiology in Queensland; the conditions that could lead to an outbreak; and how likely that situation is to occur. Results: Simulations showed that one infected agent with the ancestral (A.2.2) variant has a 14% chance of crossing a threshold of sustained community transmission (i.e., > 5 infections per day, more than 3 days in a row), assuming no change in the prevailing preventative and counteracting policies. However, one agent carrying a more infectious variant (e.g., B.1.1.7) has a 43% chance of crossing the same threshold; a threefold increase. Doubling the average number of daily tests results in a decrease of this probability from 43% to 23%.

To date, the various transmission modes of SARS-CoV-2 have not been completely determined. Food products might be carriers for SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 pandemic not only can spread through the respiratory tract like SARS and MERS but also the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces of several patients, shows the possibility of their fecal-oral route spread. Besides, people with gastric problems, including gastric intestinal metaplasia and atrophic gastritis, may be susceptible to this kind of COVID-19 infection. Accordingly, food may act as a potential vehicle of SARS-CoV-2 due to whether carry-through or carry-over contaminations. Considering carry-over, SARS-CoV-2 spread from personnel to food products or food surfaces is feasible. Beyond that, some shreds of evidence showed that pigs and rabbits can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, viral transmission through meat products may be conceivable, indicating carry-through contamination.

METHODS: a cross-sectional program assessment with descriptive analysis of TB services, health staff capacities, diagnostic capacities, data management and reporting, and treatment outcomes. Data were extracted from health facility TB registers and semi-structured key informant interviews conducted in selected 26 cross-border sites within the 7 member states of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) region. RESULTS: the overall cross-border TB cure rate in the year preceding the study (37%) was way beneath the global target with considerable variations amongst the study countries. The restricted support to the cross-border health facilities was mediated and even exacerbated by expansive distances from the respective capital cities. Restricted geographical access to the facilities by cross-border populations was a longstanding challenge. Substantial staffing gaps, TB service delivery capacity needs and inadequate diagnostics were noticeable. The TB control guidelines were not harmonized between the countries and the inter-country referral systems were either absent or inappreciable, contributing to ineffective cross-border referrals and transfers. The frail linkages between stakeholders were contemptible, but increasing governments commitments in tackling infectious diseases were encouraging. CONCLUSION: cross-border TB interventions should drive regional TB policies, strategies and programs that sustain countries coordination, harmonization of management guidelines, advocacy for increased human resources support, enhanced capacity building of cross-border TB staff, adequate diagnostics equipping of the cross-border health facilities and seamless transfer and referral of patients traversing boundaries.","output":"Elucidation of potential challenges and prospects for regional tuberculosis interventions in East and Horn of Africa: a cross-sectional program assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 from Wuhan, China.

We aimed to identify CXR features that correlate with severe COVID-19. METHODS: All confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted within the study period were screened. Those with suboptimal baseline CXR were excluded. CXRs were reviewed by three independent radiologists and opacities recorded according to zones and laterality. The primary endpoint was defined as hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen, and CXR features were assessed for association with this endpoint to identify high-risk features. These features were then used to define criteria for a high-risk CXR, and clinical features and outcomes of patients with and without baseline high-risk CXR were compared using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 109 patients were included. In the initial analysis of 40 patients (36.7%) with abnormal baseline CXR, presence of bilateral opacities, multifocal opacities, or any upper or middle zone opacity were associated with supplemental oxygen requirement. Of the entire cohort, 29 patients (26.6%) had a baseline CXR with at least one of these features. Having a high-risk baseline CXR was significantly associated with requiring supplemental oxygen in univariate (odds ratio 14.0, 95% confidence interval 3.90-55.60) and multivariate (adjusted odds ratio 8.38, 95% CI 2.43-28.97, P = 0.001) analyses.

Although the symptoms of the disease are predominantly respiratory, the involvement of the cardiovascular system is common. Patients with heart failure (HF) are particularly vulnerable when suffering from COVID-19. AIM OF THE REVIEW: To examine the challenges faced by healthcare organizations, and mechanical circulatory support management strategies available to patients with heart failure, during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be lifesaving in patients with severe forms of ARDS, or refractory cardio-circulatory compromise. The Impella RP can provide right ventricular circulatory support for patients who develop right side ventricular failure or decompensation caused by COVID-19 complications, including pulmonary embolus. HT are reserved for only those patients with a high short-term mortality. LVAD as a bridge to transplant may be a viable strategy to get at-risk patients home quickly. Elective LVAD implantations have been reduced and only patients classified as INTERMACS profile 1 and 2 are being considered for LVAD implantation. Delayed recognition of LVAD-related complications, misdiagnosis of COVID-19, and impaired social and psychological well-being for patients and families may ensue. Remote patient care with virtual or telephone contacts is becoming the norm. CONCLUSIONS: HF incidence, prevalence, and undertreatment will grow as a result of new COVID-19-related heart disease. ECMO should be reserved for highly selected cases of COVID-19 with a reasonable probability of recovery. Special considerations are needed for patients with advanced HF, including those supported by durable LVADs.","output":"Mechanical circulatory support-Challenges, strategies, and preparations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding how immunological memory lasts a lifetime requires quantifying changes in the number of memory cells as well as how their division and death rates change over time. We address these questions by using a statistically powerful mixed-effects differential equations framework to analyze data from two human studies that follow CD8 T cell responses to the yellow fever vaccine (YFV-17D). Models were first fit to the frequency and division rates of YFV-specific memory CD8 T cells 42 days to 1 year post-vaccination. A different dataset, on the loss of YFV-specific CD8 T cells over three decades, was used to assess out of sample predictions of our models. The commonly used exponential and bi-exponential decline models performed relatively poorly. Models with the cell loss following a power law (exactly or approximately) were most predictive. Notably, using only the first year of data, these models accurately predicted T cell frequencies up to 30 years post-vaccination. Our analyses suggest that division rates of these cells drop and plateau at a low level (0.001 per day, ~double estimates for naive T cells) within one year following vaccination, whereas death rates continue to decline for much longer. Our results show that power laws can be predictive for T cell memory, a finding that may be useful for vaccine evaluation and epidemiological modeling. Moreover, since power laws asymptotically decline more slowly than any exponential decline, our results help explain the longevity of immune memory phenomenologically. Author summary Immunological memory, generated in response to infection or vaccination, may provide complete or partial protection from antigenically similar infections for the lifetime. Memory CD8 T cells are important players in protection from secondary viral infections but quantitative understanding of their dynamics in humans is limited. We analyze data from two studies where immunization with the yellow fever virus vaccine (YFV-17D) generates a mild acute infection and long-term memory. We find that: (i) the division rate of YFV-17D-specific CD8 T cells drops and stabilizes at ~ 0.1% per day during the first year following vaccination whereas the death rate declines more gradually, and (ii) the number of these cells declines approximately in accordance with a power law (time?0.82) for at least several decades following vaccination.","output":"Dynamics and turnover of memory CD8 T cell responses following yellow fever vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The role of favipiravir as a treatment for COVID-19 is unclear, with discrepant activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, concerns about teratogenicity and pill burden, and an unknown optimal dose. In Vero-E6 cells, high concentrations are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. The purpose of this analysis was to use available data to simulate intracellular pharmacokinetics of favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate (FAVI-RTP) to better understand the putative applicability as a COVID-19 intervention. Methods: Previously published in vitro data for the intracellular production and elimination of FAVI-RTP in MDCK cells incubated with parent favipiravir was fitted with a mathematical model to describe the time course of intracellular FAVI-RTP concentrations as a function of incubation concentration of parent favipiravir. Parameter estimates from this model fitting were then combined with a previously published population PK model for the plasma exposure of parent favipiravir in Chinese patients with severe influenza (the modelled free plasma concentration of favipiravir substituting for in vitro incubation concentration) to predict the human intracellular FAVI-RTP pharmacokinetics. Results: In vitro FAVI-RTP data was adequately described as a function of in vitro incubation media concentrations of parent favipiravir with an empirical model, noting that the model simplifies and consolidates various processes and is used under various assumptions and within certain limits. Parameter estimates from the fittings to in vitro data predict a flatter dynamic range of peak to trough for intracellular FAVI-RTP when driven by a predicted free plasma concentration profile. Conclusion: This modelling approach has several important limitations that are discussed in the main text of the manuscript. However, the simulations indicate that despite rapid clearance of the parent drug from plasma, sufficient intracellular FAVI-RTP may be maintained across the dosing interval because of its long intracellular half-life. Population average intracellular FAVI-RTP concentrations are estimated to maintain the Km for the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase for 3 days following 800 mg BID dosing and 9 days following 1200 mg BID dosing after a 1600 mg BID loading dose on day 1.

METHODS: With repeated surveys conducted with relatively uniformed standards, the UNICEF Data warehouse compiles and publishes a wide spectrum of health indicators, of which data analysis and visualization would reveal the underlying statuses and trends on global, regional and national levels. RESULTS: Apparent geographic disparity is present in that sub-Saharan African countries lag far behind their counterparts in other regions with regard to most health indicators on adolescents. Education attendance rates sequentially drop from primary to secondary school levels, and display correlation with youth literacy. Harmful practices of early marriage, early childbearing and female genital mutilation have decreased but the presences of peer violence and sexual violence are worthy of attentions. Although incidence and mortality rates of HIV/AIDS have dropped (most notably in sub-Saharan Africa), adolescents HIV/AIDS awareness remains suboptimal in selected countries.

The existence of the virus in the gastrointestinal tract makes digestive endoscopy a high-risk operation, which associated with an increased risk of infection rate in healthcare workers. This study aimed at exploring current knowledge, practice and attitudes of healthcare workers in endoscopy units in China regarding the status of occupational protection during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study of a national online survey involving 717 healthcare workers in endoscopy units from 94 medical structures in 24 provinces and municipalities around China was conducted online via a questionnaire platform called Wenjuanxing (wjx.cn). The data were analyzed using correlation approaches, Kruskal-Wallis test for independent samples, and linear regression models. Results: Most Chinese healthcare workers in endoscopy units had a good knowledge of COVID-19 (median: 10; range: 7-12), showed a strikingly positive attitude (median: 65; range: 39-65), and carried out good practice (median: 47; range: 14-50) in strengthening the protection, disinfection and management of COVID-19. In terms of attitudes, female staff was more concerned about protection against COVID-19 than male staff (KW = 8.146, P = 0.004). Nurses performed better in both attitude (KW = 2.600, P = 0.009) and practice (KW = 6.358, P < 0.001) than endoscopic physicians when carrying out personal protection, patient care and environmental disinfection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. More positive attitudes in protection were related to better protective behavior in endoscopic daily medical work (r = 0.312; P < 0.001). Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that Chinese endoscopy healthcare workers have an excellent mastery of knowledge about COVID-19, which is transformed into positive beliefs and attitudes, contributing to good practice during daily endoscopic procedures. Medical staff may benefit from further education. With the gradual normalization amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, protection and management in endoscopy units may be changed accordingly.","output":"The Status of Occupational Protection During COVID-19 Pandemic: Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practice of Healthcare Workers in Endoscopy Units, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of face masks for the general public has been suggested in literature as a means to decrease virus transmission during the global COVID-19 pandemic.

The fluid dynamics of face masks are investigated via analytical and numerical computations. The results demonstrate that the flow can be satisfactorily predicted by simplified analytical 1D-flow models, by efficient 2D-flow simulations and by 3D-flow simulations. The present results show that already gap heights larger than 0.1mm can result in the mask not fulfilling FFP2 or FFP3 standards, and for gap heights of ca. 1mm most of the airflow and droplets may pass through the gap.

Cost cuts, although sometimes deemed tolerable, no longer help because expenditures have thresholds that hardly can be crossed. Increasing the revenue by raising rates, on the other side, adversely affects the level of demand. In low seasons, travelers are more sensitive to prices, and therefore, higher rates turn customers away to other rivals. To address the compromise between demand, supply, and prices, this work contributes to the existing literature by proposing a model that tests the balance of seasonal demands and prices to maximize hoteliers profit. Specifically, we present an approach that finds the seasonal elasticity of demand at the optimum profit. The model is capable of assessing the balance of prices with the market demand, which helps in the assessment of hotels. To validate the model, data sets from Dubai international and domestic hotels were collected and used for benchmarking. It was found that international hotels confront higher seasonality as compared to local hotels. Only couple of hotels (Local and International) demonstrated successful efforts in seasonal balancing of prices with the demand. The demand was also found to be more elastic in the low seasons owing to high room offerings, while less elasticity is observed in the high seasons.

In recent months, our lives have been fundamentally changed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the health, economic, and social impacts of which are almost invaluable for the time being. In addition to the acute consequences of viral infection, more and more data are proving its effects on the entire population: an increase in the incidence of psychological distress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and addictive behaviours. It is also a very important question, how the global crisis is affecting suicide rates. In my paper, I summarize the acute and chronic effects of viral infection and the general and specific psychological-psychopathological consequences of the epidemic based on the most significant psychiatric literature of the recent period, paying special attention to suicidal risk and the most vulnerable groups. Studies suggest that mental troubles and suicidal behaviour resulting from a pandemic are becoming an increasingly important public health problem. Although the treatment of viral infections and slowing the spread of the infection are still the most important goals today, we all need to be prepared for the long-term consequences of the epidemic. In order to prevent and mitigate the expected negative mental health effects of a pandemic, it is necessary to develop and apply general and specific methods. In addition to health care, mental health and community care systems, political and economic decision-makers, civil society organizations and the media must also play a role. Their effective cooperation is key to the implementation of prevention strategies that can be applied at the individual, community and social levels, as this is the only way to prevent the epidemic spread of more serious mental health problems, the \\"psychodemia\\".

To induce protective responses against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)a highly prevalent childhood pathogen without a licensed vaccinewe previously engineered a pre-fusion-stabilized trimeric RSV F (pre-F) DS-Cav1 immunogen, which induced high titer RSV-neutralizing antibodies, in mice and non-human primates, when formulated with adjuvants Poly (I:C) and Poly (IC:LC), respectively. To assess the impact of different adjuvants, here we formulated RSV F DS-Cav1 with multiple adjuvants and assessed immune responses. Very high RSV-neutralizing antibody responses (19,006 EC(50)) were observed in na?ve mice immunized with 2 doses of DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with Sigma adjuvant system (SAS), an oil-in-water adjuvant, plus Carbopol; high responses (3658C7108) were observed with DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with Alum, SAS alone, Adjuplex, Poly (I:C) and Poly (IC:LC); and moderate responses (1251C2129) were observed with DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with the TLR4 agonist MPLA, Alum plus MPLA or AddaVax. In contrast, DS-Cav1 without adjuvant induced low-level responses (6). A balanced IgG1 and IgG2a (Th2/Th1) immune response was elicited in most of the high to very high response groups (all but Alum and Adjuplex). We also tested the immune response induced by DS-Cav1 in elderly mice with pre-existing DS-Cav1 immunity; we observed that DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with SAS plus Carbopol boosted the response 2-3-fold, whereas DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with alum boosted the response 5-fold. Finally, we tested whether a mixture of ISA 71 VG and Carbopol would enhanced the antibody response in DS-Cav1 immunized calves. While pre-F-stabilized bovine RSV F induced very high titers in mice when adjuvanted with SAS plus Carbopol, the addition of Carbopol to ISA 71 VG did not enhance immune responses in calves. The vaccine response to pre-F-stabilized RSV F is augmented by adjuvant, but the degree of adjuvant-induced enhancement appears to be both context-dependent and species-specific.","output":"Adjuvants and the vaccine response to the DS-Cav1-stabilized fusion glycoprotein of respiratory syncytial virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus has placed national health systems of different countries in difficulty, and has demonstrated the need for many types of personal protective equipment (PPE) Thanks to the advent of new three-dimensional printing technologies, it was possible to share print files (using stereolithography (stl)) quickly and easily, improve them cooperatively, and allow anyone who possessed the materials, a suitable 3D printer and these files, to print The possibility of being able to print three-dimensional supports, or complete personal protective equipment has been of incredible help in the management of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) The times and the relatively low costs have allowed a wide diffusion of these devices, especially for the structures that needed them, mainly healthcare facilities 3D printing, now includes different fields of application, and represents, thanks to the evolution of methods and printers, an important step towards the &ldquo;digital world&rdquo;","output":"Worldwide 3D Printers against the New Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This comparative study deals with the question of whether travelers can terminate an already booked package tour free of charge after the outbreak of COVID-19 (\\"coronavirus\\") in EU law and Turkish law It first provides preliminary information about the regulations related to package tour contracts It explains afterwards, which package travelers have the right of termination and compares the conditions and legal consequences of termination of the contract, under the perspective of EU and Turkish laws In this context, the terms such as unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances, force majeure, the situation that cannot be foreseen and prevented and the reason that not caused by consumer are examined in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic Different results of the cancellation of the package tour or termination of contract are analyzed Also a recent amendment in the directive about the package tour contracts in the Turkish law is criticized","output":"Package Tour Contracts in Times of COVID-19"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(O,[["render",V]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/33.md","filePath":"doctor/33.md"}'),R={name:"doctor/33.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
